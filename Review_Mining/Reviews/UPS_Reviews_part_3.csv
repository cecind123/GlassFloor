good,The job itself is fairly challenging. Overall and great experience  You meet people of all kinds and even though hours are crazy at times the job itself is solid
good,"Working for UPS is a fast paced friendly place. Always doing something different daily.  Work loads vary from day to day which makes for an exciting job. Always great customer service, when a customer has a problem you are able to handle it with the tools of your job. Depending on work load, depends on how many stops you would have during the day, so daily you are usually changing your routine.  If you enjoy being outdoors, being fast paced and having great customer service skills UPS is a place you would appreciate."
good,making sure packages made it to there destination on time was very important especially at peak season and using as much space inside of trailers was useful.

good,I would like to work for UPS because of the Part Time hours and company benefits. I would like to be @ UPS to work and learn something different every day.

good,UPS cares about their employees and the truck routes and daily routines are always the same so it is all about memorization and repeating the same thing every day. fairly easy

good,Holiday hours are great with a lot of overtime. Change to grow in the company moving from loader or Unloader to someday the foreman ..the great part about it I'd the benefits its a plus
good,Loaded and unloaded boxes and bags from 25-75 pounds correctly and safely in order from top to bottom of trailers. Very physical work and fast paced environment
good,There was also someone coming in to ship their package. You have to learn the different things that are in the store and how much each box and tape is.
good,I was a package handler a typical work day and the warehouse will be stocking lifting pulling pushing sometimes heavy objects or materials.  we will use scanners to scan items that comes in or out of the warehouse.
good,Come and do your job and go home happy - if you need help ask supervisors - time goes by fast when you are busy loading or unloading packages - it's tough in the beginning but then you get use to it.
good,"Starts up by setting up for the morning unload. Than scanning and labeling the packages, than loading them on a conveyor belt (packages than can weigh from 1 pound to 150 pound plus) than loading them into a truck for delivery."
good,"UPS is a good company to work for. There are different work stations that you can do there. Unload , load wall , small sort & working in the mezzanine."
good,Ups is a very competitive company with excellent pay and benefits. I would definitely advice people to work for them. I love working for ups and think there is options to have a career.

good,"productive work environment"
good,"I enjoyed working at UPS as a seasonal driver helper. It was a very fast paced company with lots of physical demands. I worked very hard and hoped to continue as a permanent worker, however, unfortunately I did not receive that option."
good,"They offer a great advancement incentive that starts to pay really well. other than that, it's a factory job that most will know of already. Doesn't require a lot in terms of trying to get hired so easy for those looking to get into a job asap."
good,My experience at UPS wasn’t long but I enjoyed the time being there. I recommend to apply if you like working out or lifting weights. It was a fast pace working job but you’ll enjoy it one you get the hang of it
good,The communication is kinda off but overall the supervisors at UPS are wonderful to work with and have a relationship outside of work and have a better understanding about the company
good,It was a pleasure working at Bancroft Uniforms. I  worked with UPS not UPS directly. We would fill in customer orders and at the end of the day fill out a UPS label to have it shipped out.
good,"It was a good experience  great way to expand my career options and great culture and environment. The managers , coworkers and HR facilities was okay. The management cares about their employees"
good,good place to work. very flexible big company so you can transfer to other locations they have Union so great job security lots of room for growth thru the company

good,"it was very productive and a good work enviroment , overtime was always available and the pay was good and this company could be a long time career for their employees"
good,The cultural is well but could never be made full time employee. They give you good benefits but staff is unprofessional at times. They have constant turnover.
good,Very friendly and helpful job benefits are really good management and co workers help you whenever they can. Safety is a priority I have never felt like I’ve been over worked.
good,Was a good job Supervising the loading of planes at the airport. Had to supervise like 15 employees. Worked from 2:30 am till like 9:30 am. Had Sundays and Mondays off.
good,"Good pay and benefits, usually short hours with good opportunities for overtime. Upper management is a tad disorganized, however, which can lead to some confusion."
good,"The job was a good position to work."
good,I worked there for a year at one point in time o was the youngest one there but I had the most experience. I did receive a lot of hours but due to a shortage of people working there i worked 10 hours 3 days in a row during school it was little challenging managing working there and getting school work done
good,It’s really tiring and the people there are unprofessional. They judge u before u even start . But as long as your there just to make your money than you will be okay
good,i liked working here it was easy with minimum amount of work  i lift a lot of heavy packages but overall I really liked it I would recommend people to work here
good,I really loved working with UPS the Training was easy I was really able to work hands-on and they really know how to make a person feel welcome I feel like I was part of a family the best thing about working at UPS is everybody is so nice and willing to help you when the  workload is overwhelming.
good,"I liked working as a delivery driver for UPS. I have learned some new skills. Being on time was mandatory, so i had to be organized before I leave the building. I also learned some driving skills, safety, hazmat, and how to interact with costumers. The hardest part was in holidays seasons because it was very busy but I got through it since we also worked in teams."
good,"My time with UPS was seasonal and brief, but I enjoyed my job. punctuality was important, and the position was highly labor oriented, but I drove around all day with a driver and I was never alone for my shift."
good,I loved working with them. It was a fast paced but friendly environment. Managers were motivational and made us feel important and we loved what we did. It was exceptional . But it was only a part time and only paying $10.00 at the time..
good,"It was a challenge at first after a while you get used to it and lifting the heavy packages, it was a good experience working there I wish it wasn’t a seasonal job for me they have good benefits for full timers"
good,"Good place to work. Fair wages for the work. Seasonal work is part time."
good,"The like to hire from within company which gives opportunities from growth even from a low level entry position."
good,It’s Good Company to work for been 6 years I’m just looking for other opportunities the work is not to difficult just a strict policy on attendance other than it’s great company
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was It kept me fit as well as on my toes up on an early schedule, usual day began at 4:15 which helped enjoy most the day"
good,Mainly seasonal but end of year is the busiest so you can work a lot of hours. Plenty of locations so you have the opportunity to work near home. Overall great company to work with
good,"Workplace with variation of tasks including helping with retail, copies, faxing, boxing packages, as well as providing a Notary Service to a variety of customers."
good,"The pay is great, you work independently, driving your own vehicle; the time you get off depends on how fast you move; it's a great way to make extra money"
good,There's two shifts early morning and twilight. And if are the type for physical work and standing for long hours. Then I would recommend this job for you.
good,"Good work experience, good hours good pay, nice people. The supervisors we’re professional. My jobs was seasonal so it wasn’t a permanent position. Good first job to have."
good,what I love most about this job is that it has great benefits. Health insurance is free. The work can get heavy times and must be able to lift up to 70 lbs.
good,"here is what I was actually doing there"
good,.I have worked here for 33 years so that should tell you something.  Fair pay for hard work.  promotion opportunities and ability to expand your experience
good,I loved working at UPS. My co-works friendly and wor well as a team. I learned a lot of useful skills every day from someone different every day. I look forward to going to work each day and performing my best ability.
good,"Working here was difficult in regards of studying at the same time. I would do my part time hours (4 hours every day, 4am - 8am) then go into college from 9am - 5pm. "
good,pretty relaxed environment flexible schedule decent work surroundings little conflicts reasonable wages clear and understood responsibilities clam pace
good,I think it’s a pretty great place to work with good benefits everyone there was super nice! It’s hard to get hours but management is amazing. I definitely recommend working at UPS.
good,The job creates a lot of opportunities. You gain a lot of new skills with people because communication is a key role. Hours are flexible and given extra hours during the holidays.
good,"Seasonal Job - Not much to it. Listen to what you're told, do what you're told. Nobody gets hurt, everyone goes home happy. Was outside about 80-90% of the time. Dress accordingly!"
good,"UPS is a great company for students (still living at home) or with 2 jobs. Takes a while to become a full-time employee but, most would say that it's worth the wait eventually."
good,It’s a fast past and a lot of lifting its hard work but if someone trying to stay fit ups is a great job you pretty much get payed to work out and the staff are amazing
good,"Cool job, cool managers. Nice hours. Decent pay for a part-time job."
good,"I was on the preload it was pretty cool, only got to be there for less than a month and then the cut most of the new hires, though they did leave me on the rehire list. if you can stay in long enough to get in the union its a pretty solid job/career with great benefits. I know ill be back in during their next hiring wave because i do want to eventually become a driver."
good,"It had a very friendly atmosphere and was interesting.  Very fast paced and had to have attention to detail.. I learned a lot about the workings of UPS shipments,"
good,You have to work hard at any job. But working here you have to be well rested and ready to work. You lift packages from the conveyer and make a wall but you have to be sure to read the Slic so that your putting the right packages in the right trailer.
good,"I worked for the month of December as a driver helper and I absolutely loved it. I started right as I finished exams and worked up until the week of Christmas at really good pay in comparison to my retail job. I was given at most, 8 hours a day depending on who needed help Monday- Saturday. All you had to do was call in the morning and tell them your availability for the day of for the week and they will tell you if anyone needs help at those hours. It is a physical job but nothing compared to the work I did as a truck loader at this company. This job was a cakewalk and I will 100% be back next Christmas to do this seasonal position again!"
good,In UPS I've learned that it takes a group of dedicated people to make the company succeed and grow with every effort planned for the future. I would definitely recommend this employment.
good,Outstanding pay and hours of work and the ability to have the final say in deciding who are worthy candidates who may be an asset to the UPS Warehouse Team
good,"UPS WAS a great place to work. I was treated fairly, and felt like they appreciated me as an individual. The pay was also very good, and I learned a lot while I was working there."
good,"great job with lots of room for advancement, will defiantly miss working here, great staff and work environment. made it easier to achieve customer success"
good,"very clean work area, very clean vehicles, great customer services. All the drivers I’ve had have been professional and great people. It’s getting me in shape for the army and it’s fun to meet different people."
good,"Working in management at UPS Freight is not for the faint of heart. The job is stressful and often you are faced with difficult goals in safety and performance that seem almost impossible. However, you are given a multitude of tools and resources to succeed, and you are compensated very fairly. The culture at UPS can be militaristic at times, but most of the management team is very helpful and supportive. To me, my fellow managers were almost like a second family. Managing union workers was difficult, but again, there were resources provided for that - like a special Labor Manager who knows the ins and outs of the teamster contracts. Overall, my only complaint about UPS was the work/life balance. As a manager, even when you are not at work, you are checking emails and constantly checking in with the supervisors at your location to ensure everything is running smoothly as you are ultimately responsible for your location's success and failure. I feel like that would be the same for any manager at any company, though, and is not exclusive to UPS Freight."
good,I love working for UPS. I would really like to be able to move forward but there isn't really an avenue to do that. It is a great company with great benefits. Just don't go through a temporary agency.
good,Halve to have the proper mindset and be willing to do hard work great scheduling for a part time position the benefits and pretty good and reasonable just have to put in the work to achieve them
good,Always able to work with you get a raise like twice a year. Opportunity to make the best work day possible if anything happens off the job they usually work with you so you can remain comfortable and able to continue future employment
good,This job is a great adventures job when it come to delivering. I was able to see areas in my own city with UPS that I never seen on my own. This job teaches how to work collectively and speedily.
good,"Great company to work with."
good,Great company with excellent employees. Employees made you feel less like attending work- more like family. I really enjoyed my time worked within the organization.
good,"Working here is definitely hard work. You have to come to work prepared and ready to have a long day with more than a few surprises, every day in the operation is different."
good,"Enjoyed the job, very fast paced but when things get slow, hours get cut, only wanted to give 20 hours a week. Computer knowledge is a must, customer communication daily"
good,Trabalha na ups foi uma oportunidade é uma experiência maravilhosa aprendi muito tanto como pessoa quanto no profissional.. Mas como toda empresa tem autos e baixos porem tiramos aquilo de bom independente de qualquer coisa...
good,Properly executed UPS packaging handling methods: Load and unload  packages into trailers in a fast paced  warehouse environment.  Handled packages up to 70lbs.
good,Very frustrating work have to go as fast as we did but we had a good reputation for being the best in the area for UPS. Tough work but very rewarding.
good,"It leaves room for advancement if you wanted to travel to other states etc, but working for them is high demand and the energy is awesome. The lifting, and customer service is very important it’s our community we’re serving and it’s a great experience"
good,"Deliver the best of the season in this exciting role at UPS. As a Personal Vehicle Driver, you’ll enjoy a fast-paced, physical position that gets you outdoors and connecting with customers. From the driver’s seat of your own car, find out what you’ll become at UPS."
good,"enjoy the job hard work but fair for the money "
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is that I can be nights where its easy loads of packages in the sort and being able to finish quick on the job for early clock out. What I learned at the United Postal Service is that I am able to move fast at loading on my job.
good,"I work a weekly schedule in road dispatch, making sure that the drivers get out in a timely manner.  I also run reports daily and stay in contact with upper management."
good,When don’t work it makes it a typical long day we gotta walk from the back of the trailer to the front constantly wit packages as long as yuh keep keep a steady pace it will work out
good,"Good money and benefits and standard hours with some overtime. Fast paced job and will be a workout, always moving driving and delivering packages and back to the center."
good,"You are challenged everyday to execute and innovate as we explore customer objective to increase sale, manage costs and enhance brands.  UPS has various solutions to solve the same concerns."
good,Long term employment.  Fast paced work and physically demanding but can be rewarding.  Good team building from management.  provided uniform suited for the changing weather conditions.
good,"Great place to work. Learned a lot about customer relationships and handling day to day operations. Learned inbound and outbound packages. Costumer service is the key to a great business environment, that's what I learned here."
good,The pay is great for package handlers. Have to be time efficient and able to lift up to 75 pounds. Have the ability to stand for long hours and stoop and bend.
good,"I loaded trucks during peak season, it was fast paces so the time went by quick. advancement opportunities available.  Flexible schedule and friendly managers."

Responsible for reviewing helper hours for accurate recording of time and assignments. I worked closely with the operation, communicating helper performance and administration of uniforms and tracking helper performance."
good,a typical day at ups consisted of unloading and loading boxes into a feeder.I also sometimes had too work i the sort which consisted of distributing boxes by zip code down a chute.
good,"As soon as you step foot into the store you are welcomed by your co-workers and if you know a couple of regular customer them too will welcome you, it's a great feeling really. Once you're done saying hi to everyone (a bit of high fives and fist bumps to your comrades), you then clock in, put on your work gloves and get to it! Customers enter the store with a box and/or boxes either by hand or with a dolly. You as the package handler have to greet the customer and kindly receive the package from the customer and put it in the appreciate spot. Packages and boxes are divided by the label they have. The packages and boxes vary by Next Day, 2nd Day, 3rd Day, etc. Customers that transport boxes into the store with a dolly should be advised where to leave their packages. They could either place them in a specific place where it divides the unscanned packages with the scanned ones. The scanned packages are then transported by the worker (yourself or your co-worker) to the back of the store where it is then stocked into the UPS truck which is then sent out by the Driver."
good,Worked via agency and enjoyed my time working at UPS. Good staff and management alike. Daily routine loading and unloading of goods to ensure deliveries are shipped on time
good,For this being my first job it was great working here great people to work with i wasn't judge or disrespected we work as a good team. A skill i learned there was safty first.
good,Es una empresa internacional y de prestigio con personal capacitado en sus labores y con un buen ambiente de trabajo.
good,I felt the management as well as my coworkers were all approachable and helpful. It felt like a team. I left on good terms and wish the best for everyone at the warehouse.
good,Business as a whole was a great place to work until the layoffs. Good people were let go but until then the work culture was friendly and professional
good,The company is very great always showing appreciation to their employees. Very high volume work place lots of hours during peak season.You have to love dealing with people all the way around.
good,On a typical day there is so much to do that standing all day doesn't seem so bad. Timed breaks are never missed. Staff is always looking for someone to train.
good,"I love to work with UPS and wish them success in future."
good,"While at UPS, I grew exponentially as a hard working individual, and also as a motivator and trainer for other employees. Mental toughness and endurance was key in this work place, and problem solving was most important."
good,Hours for a temporary part time position were OK. Pay could have been better from one of the largest shipper in the world. Got good exercise. Great for someone needing part time work.
good,The stores are different than the drivers and the transfer hubs (or whatever they call them). They aren't rated or treated the same so I feel these reviews won't be of much help unless it differentiates.
good,UPS Supply Chain Solutions provided a strong work ethic and required employees to lean on diversity. Provided a great program for employees benefit and promotion.
good,Be prepared for a fast-paced work environment. Always bring hydration because it is not provided and be in shape because it gets hectic at times plus be flexible when it comes to job positions.
good,Work in warehouse unload or load truck sort item for delivery and package delivery holiday overtime and  room for growth and advancement with starting part time then fulltime
good,"It’s about opportunity, teamwork, a supportive culture and benefits that help you become everything you’re envisioning right now.  "
good,I worked in the morning and the shift was 5-8am. Monday-Friday and sometimes Sunday which was at 4 o'clock in the morning instead of 5am. I was in small carts that will have boxes and we unload them on a belt to go into the UPS trucks.
good,"This is a new facility that is very busy. Its is very automated self driving carts, conveyor belts that move in and out of trucks. Very high tech. They just need more coffee machines and to extend the hours of the cafe for peek season. They open from 8-11pm. What about after that?"
good,It always has a sense of hurry up while working and management would move people around in the middle of your work shift setting you behind and expecting you to finish with everyone else once you finished whatever other task they had to complete
good,"Worked at a franchise location, owners were nice enough. Christmas season was crazy, but that's to be expected. I liked boxing things up. This is the character limit."
good,"I enjoyed working there, it is a good company. I am customer too and I found out how the company works inside out. Really good colleagues and management was supportive."
good,"Ups was a quick paced job, if you slack even just one time it could slow the whole process down and then you have to work extra hard to catch back up."
good,"Hi i was so proud working at ups scs dept"
good,Its a hard working fast place company. It runs on people who are willing to devote their all and provides many benefits. I would consider working there again.
good,Working at ups was like an adventure never a dull day rather your in the field or doing packages at the base if you wanting to loose weight this is the place to be fast pace up and down twisting and turning and just making sure clients were pleased at the end of the day
good,"I have worked for UPS for 21 years. It is a good place to work. The benefits are great. December is the hardest time of year, but you can make a lot of money working extra hours."
good,I just don’t think we were fairly compensated for the actual amount of physical work we did as package handlers. And warehouse condition so weren’t the best for someone like me with asthma. Just dusty and dirty compared to my current warehouse job
good,"A typical day at UPS consists of organizing the packages that customers order to the proper locations. It is a fast-paced job, but the benefits are worth any potential stress that you may feel during your time with this company. I had a positive experience in the time that I worked here, and I would recommend it to anyone."
good,"Your job will be pretty much the same thing every day. Loading semi-truck trailers or unloading the package pick-up cars. It can get pretty tiring after a few hours, but its great physical activity that keeps you moving."
good,Fast-paced environment and very tiring. I enjoyed working there because I was able to work with a friend as his helper. Would always have to deliver a lot of packages.
good,Good exercise in a fast paced environment so time flies when you're working. Many opportunitues to move up in the company if you want. I'm mainly there for the benefits and tuition. Supervisors in my area are good. The part I hate is seeing lazy grass people who don't do their share of the work. Lazy bums like that irritate me!
good,the company was ok as a part time job and I would work on the truck at Christmas time for extra pay and help get packages to the customer's home and deliver to businesses
good,If you like a fast paced job this is the job for you. Everyone who works there are great and will help you when we need it. They are really good at letting you have the night off if a family emergency comes up.
good,"Enjoyed the one day i worked, very fast paste job. In and out of truck all day long, working in hot and cold weather. Driver i worked with was very friendly and didn't mind educating me on type of work that was expected of me to do."
good,"I was so used to my routine at Ups that I knew it like the back of my hand."
good,"Tough and hard work. Early mornings with not a lot of downtime. Good tuition reimbursment, Friendly staff and good people to be around. Always looking for people to grow within the company."
good,"Fast paced and fun learning environment.  Plenty of supervisors and that are willing to answer questions and assist during the training timeframe.  After training timeframe supervisors check on any other needs that will improve an employee's overall job performance, regardless of what department they work in.  Their safety department does a good job of checking on the facility and on the safety of their employees."
good,Fast and Friendly environment. Great benefits for a part- time job. Overall great workout not too many hours maybe less than 20 a week. Great company to grow with.
good,"UPS is a great place to work and have flexible hours for school. The management is good, the work environment is great ( new people to meet ). Some days there are challenges other days its pretty light in the workplace."
good,Great place to be. Innovative and leading the way in supply chain solutions. Management is superb. They know and understand work life balance. Will continue to work here unless recruiters find me.
good,"Teach You How To Be Productive As A Team, How To Manage Your Time Per Package and How To Respect Your Fellow Co-Worker. The Company Provides You With Skills You Need To Be Promoted To A Hire Position."
good,its very productive work but they provide great break rooms they also feed us at times and provided medicine for headaches if need its fast pace and they also pay well they give you the weekends off so the schedule is not to much
good,"Early morning hours, make it hard for some fast paced work is continuous and very fast paced benefits are excellent plus room to advance and pay scale is very good"
good,In my opinion the work was overwhelming while I was In school. but if your out of school this is a great career. I was working the twilight schedule..
good,My day to day experiences and duties were fine and easy to do. Some days we started a little later if the trucks didn't arrive on time. It was a constant flow of work
good,"Great company if a person is focused and skilled; however, management changes often and this sometimes affects non-management personnel's continuity; company no longer values long term employees and does not like to promote from within."
good,I helped deliver packages to house as a driver helper. there was no set hours. would get called in if they needed help. I would help organize the packages and set them up for what would get delivered next.
good,UPS Operations prepared me for any operation in the world. The Management team was supportive and gave constructive criticism on my day to day operation to get the best results everyday.
good,"Ups is one of the good company to work for and I will recommend everyone to work for that company"
good,"working place. I was just a seasonal driver, but I would have loved being a full time worker there, with their competitive salaries and benefits. unfortunately you have to start really low and work your way up with them."
good,"Fun place to work. Meet with lots of challenges. Nice co workers, and supervisors. You must know your Route. Follow instructions. Be careful and respect all customers."
good,A labor job with excellent rewards. The benefits are really good as well. It’s refreshing to go to work each day and know that it’s a safe and stable job
good,"People there can be friendly, sometimes rude, but always try to work as a team. If you need help just ask and you will get it especially with heavy items. It's a very fast paced environment, as well time crunch to get everything shipped out and delivered. But all In all great place to work at."
good,"Flexible hours, different departments/opportunities, benefits and they have incentives. Looking forward to all the overtime, becoming part of a union."
good,Be ready to work.. fast paced at first but you catch on quickly. Some days are longer than others but you get adjusted and you learn to deal with it..
good,"Great job but no hours, only worked 3hrs a day unless it was peek season u can work more hours but that lasted for about 2 months only , then went back to 3 hours a day !"
good,"I helped the driver with pick ups and deliveries during holiday season. My driver was nice and easy to work with. The Job is repetitive and fast paced and that's what i found easy to me, some days were different than others but overall easy work. If given a chance i'd work with them again."
good,Good working informant that helps all around so that people can enjoy there time working at the ups grounds people are nice and the pay is good and others treat you well
good,fun for someone who likes fast pace. i dont know much else to say but this has to be 150 characters long so ill ramble on with this second sentence of mine.
good,Great example of American culture and economy. Once in they will provide you with tons of resources that make you feel like you belong or are cared about.

good,"Was a good part-time job for me when I needed the extra money in the busy season. I would recommend it to"
good,"it is a very good job with free insurance after working 1 year with ups, pays $14 an hour and up for part time employees. But you are constantly moving for hours and for some people it could be hard for them"
good,"Working at UPS is not for everyone. It is a lot of constant hard work. You have to go in focused and must stay focused throughout your shift. I personally loved the schedule. I would go in at 3 a.m. est. usually and get off around 9 a.m. est. I liked having the rest of the day to myself. Overall it’s a pretty good job. I did a number of things ranging from sorting, to loading, to unloading."
good,"hardest but most enjoyable job"
good,"UPS was a great place to work"
good,This is a hard but fair job they will give you a chance to move up and better yourself if that is what you want. They will assist you with your education and you there are other training that  will  help you grow as a person and partner
good,"ups wasn’t bad. they’re pretty laid back honestly. no drug test, no uniform policy, it’s a union job. good benefits. can’t get full time though unless you’re a driver or possibly some other high positions. i just worked as a package handler. pretty easy and simple for the most part. we all work together to load and unload trailers full of customer packages in order to get them to their destination. anything after 5 hours in a day is time and a half and if you work 6 days which is rare you’ll get paid double time the whole shift. i’m just leaving because i don’t really wanna be a driver anymore and i’m tired of working two part time jobs"
good,Thorough training and high expectations for safety. Managers are strict on productivity. A positive atmosphere in the work site. Overall a good place to work.
good,"If you are not ready to work here do not do it, it takes a lot of physical, mental, and emotional strength, this place basically becomes your second home. You have to be a dedicated hard worker. Make sure you get rest, and do not let your co-workers get you upset. Only need a drivers licence to be a driver"
good,I loved to work there but there wasn't gonna be any drivers retiring anytime soon when I moved on to a new job that was full time.  The benefits are great along with the people that I worked with.
good,Ups is a great job to work at if you want to start an career and you know you want to be there for 20 years plus. Then you can retire from there and be set to buy the house you want.
good,This job was a regular mellowed out job not to crazy . I learned that there is more remembering things that had to b done computer wise but not hard .
good,Amazon was a very fast paced environment  that taught me a lot about careers as an adult considering it was my first real job after high school. I learned many skills there.
good,Enjoy packing and shipping  learn new  skills daily. Meet new people. Learn how to efficiently and effectively prevent load packages for shipping and delivery.
good,It was a great job with the people I worked with. Hours can sometimes be over kill working 10-14 hours plus a day. Some areas can be made more stressful than it needs to be.
good,"UPS has a good work life balance since we can work from home twice a week and it’s not too stressful of a job, but they do have an old school mentality of keeping you in your cube even when work is completed. I am a salary employee and I find it to be pointless to force employees to wait around till 5 every day."
good,"Work at UPS may seem like the same daily task. But everyday brings exciting new challenges that must be met with a high pace energy to overcome all problems that arise during the shift, in order to maintain service."
good,Typical work day very fast pace but great environment. I have learned so much there working in different things and from management. Management has been great. The jobs really are not hard just need to work. Great working enviorment
good,"great place to work, great benefits, fast pace, provide opportunities to move up, if you like to play tetris then loading a package car is for you, managers are good"
good,The people there are what make the job what it is. When i was there there was never a dull moment. The “work” you have to do is easy enough for anyone to be able to do it no problem. I wish there was more full time positions open but you have to be there for almost 10 years to even have a chance at getting one.
good,"This management position involves directly supervising seven to ten part-time Package Handlers. Part-Time Supervisors train, develop, and hold their workgroups responsible for safety, production and attendance. The Part-Time Operations Supervisor impacts the organization by contributing to the continued growth and profitability of UPS by maintaining the highest standards for account productivity, accuracy, customer service, organization, communication, cooperation, and safety. The Part-Time Operations Supervisor provides innovative and effective leadership and cultivates a functional working relationship with all levels of personnel throughout the organization."
good,"Good company when I could learn a lot and aplly and improve my skills, as work in group (good relationships), attention at small details (and very important), customer focus, follow up with managers, time management, and others"
good,Friendly and enthusiastic Retail Sales Associate/ Operations Supervisor. Highly successful at upselling and promoting new products. Effective at multi-tasking and maintaining a friendly attitude under pressure. Responsible and mature who thrives in fast-paced environments. Enjoys working as part of a team to achieve sale goals and direct employees while also completing a variety of paperwork and meeting safety requirements.
good,I liked working for the company. Wish I could have been able to work another shift.. Its great for  management advances.Its difficult to change positions and shifts.
good,Hi fast paced work and culture working environment management team gratefully understanding gratefully helpful always listening and understanding very collaborative and cooperative
good,"I enjoyed working at The UPS Store. I have learned a lot about about shipping, packaging, print and design. I would do it all again if given the choice."
good,"I worked in a CO franchise and not only was the owner really cool, our store manager was as well. I had a lot of freedom to do my job and met and interacted with a lot of interesting people and stuff."
good,"UPS typical day is to come in start stretching, management tells you the safety activity and topic for the day. They tell you the amount of packages you have to process that day, and then you get to work processing those packages."
good,"This company is very great to work for because the attitudes from the employees are great,  everyone is very helpful if you don't understand something they are very morivsted to help you."
good,This was a tough job rewards were good . Ups was good to me and helped me grow . I was sent to the USA for training over the years and i had great opportunities
good,The work is not complicated but very physical. Safety is top priority with management testing everyday. Most people are friendly. Hardest part is peak season because of the volume of packages. Most enjoyable part is not having any misloads and seeing happy drivers.
good,"Working for UPS is a really good career choice. There is quite a bit of opportunity depending up on where you live. If you live in a major city there will be more opportunity for you to get a full time position. If you live in a smaller city then there is less opportunity, but it can still be worth it."
good,At the start of the shift you were assigned to truck you had to load or offload.You had to offload packages onto a conveyor belt where the offline people directed them to the truck to be loaded. The guys loading the trucks had to scan and stack the packages onto this 53 foot trailer. The packages had to be stacked very tight and in to like a wall.I was very hot in the summer and very cold in the winter.The best part is you only worked four hours a day.
good,Either in school or want a part time job it’s there and can find it easy to work there and good scheduling for part time work nothing but good people work there very helpful
good,"For those with a keen eye for detail, and enjoy more physical work, this is a great place to be. Everyone works as a team, and helps each other accomplish our goals."
good,"good people fun people really dont know what to say if u needs job they give you a job u work there they pay u and then u go home and then you come back again ......"
good,Try to never show up late or miss a day of work because that would really  mess up your pay check since they give you a bonus if you don't miss a day of work
good,"Typical work included packing and mailing packages, managing mail, making phone calls, and fulfilling online print orders. Dependable work with a good work-life balance and good customers."
good,"Great company to work with. Help me to work under pressure, also it thought me how to get my work done at a set time and to multitask. It always helped in providing excellent customer service."
good,"Working at UPS you will constantly stay busy it is a fast pace job that wants everything job at a certain time, but once I got familiar with things it started to become easy"
good,I basically just unloaded packaged out of a tractor trailer. You come into work at around 3 am and you unload packages until around 10 am. you get a 10 minute break during your shift and its pretty much non stop from the minute you get there until tr=he minute you leave.
good,"Clock in ready to work at a steady pace keeping flow for 4 hrs getting the job done unloading about 4, 53’ foot trailers a night safety first and priority"
good,It was a hot and stressful eniviroment. I was day there be no air on the truck days where there be little air. S ome days you didnt gwt a break and some days u did.
good,"Not an easy job but I feel accomplished after my shift. Management can be a little annoying but overall good people. Good opportunity for growth, and truck drivers will help you as long as you do your best. Good company, but they can be a little stingy on hours."
good,"I found out UPS was hiring through a website page. I then put in my application, within hours they contacted me for a phone interview. I had my interview which was through phone and the following Monday was my orientation and training day that lasted about a week. I then started working and it was great, fast and easy to get use to. I would be in charge of a cage and I would have to get the boxes in the cages and read the labels to know exactly where in the truck it is loaded for drivers to know exactly where the package is and having no problem delivering it."
good,"""Seasonal helper"" is not a difficult position. It is what it is, and will be what you make it. The drivers are respectful and mostly appreciative of the help. Although it is seasonal, and the ""bottom of the barrel"", the pay could be a bit more seeing as in how it is ""UPS"" a fortune 500 co; the position is physically demanding and I think necessary to help meet customer needs."
good,"A day working at UPS consists of hard work and really physically challenging. Management is really intense and they push you to do your best. I would say that the work could be difficult if you are not used to being active,but i enjoyed it."
good,"A typical day at work included processing multi-state payrolls, meeting payroll deadlines, handling customer concerns, while maintaining a positive work environment."
good,It was actually a good workplace just not a good environment. The environment was too gloomy and negative but the work was pretty good and informative.
good,It was fast paced. But easy. The other employees was super nice and helped with learning the job. The supervision were understandable to getting the job done.
good,Good company good benefits. Besides they brush up union contract every 5 years. Decent retirement plan. Every center has it own policies but overall a excellent culture
good,i was getting injured everyday my experience was good but the pay wasn't worth if as a female you work strange hours and the work environment was outside
good,I was seasonal but would love to go back over the holidays! They pay well and kept me busy with consistent hours. The problem was I wasnt paid for all the hours I worked
good,no set end time so they work you like slaves until all the volume is done could be 3 a.m they dont care if you have to be back at 2 p.m. or if you need to take the bus
good,"Working for UPS is very Challenging both mentally and Physically. Their is no set start time, find out start time the day before. The Management team seems to enjoy"
good,It was a stepping stone great if you have your license. If u can keep up on a fast pace and can organize without mental issues and frustrations and like working overnight this is a good job
good,"I’d say being on preload and loading package cars is one of the easiest things about ups. My supervisor doesn’t bother me as long as I’m working hard and not slacking off. Compared to loading semi trailers on twilight, preload is a breeze and a lot less stressful. I would recommend this job to anybody looking for a good career with a strong company. You are apart of the Union and you do gain seniority over time. My ultimate goal is to become a driver."
good,I Love it..Fast paced intense working..Everyone constantly moving and the time flies by before You know it..Nice Supervisors and The driver were also nice...
good,my teacher told me about the job an i went on the website an applied an i got it an it was a amazing experience an i am no longer working there but would go back but i am curently looking for a different job now.
good,"my job was easy to me and i loved it, i benefited from the work experience and would love to come back. i wish the company the best without me and i hope to accomplish more from my experience"
good,Didn't see the lay offs coming after the holidays were over but that's what they do .I was so serious about wanting to work for them .jumping through hoops to get hired. Live scan fingerprints for background checks and putting hazmat on my driver's license only to get layed off when they don't need me anymore after the holidays
good,"I need the work ,"
good,"A typical day at work consists of working as a team to ensure we produce the best service possible. From this job, I have learned the importance of organisation and time-management as they have been skills very useful to my job."
good,The only reason I left ups was because my mom was diagnosed with cancer and needed more care and I need a better paying job. I would recommend anyone looking for a first job ups is a great fit.
good,"Happy to be part of this company, wanting to explore more and see hoe far it can take me. It's not easy but worth it. With UPS you have to look at the big picture."
good,"It was long start process, 3 days of videos and training. Then shuttle rides to correct loading docks. Hardly the same location daily. Unnumberable packets then none with no warning."
good,"UPS is a very fast paced business. With so many people expecting packages and sending packages, it is important to understand all that goes into that package arriving at your door."
good,Do to the fact I found a new job I left the ups warehouse.It was a good job for a person my age and if I was to give a comment about the job it’s with be a good one.
good,Ups likes to higher drivers from with in their company. I started out loading trucks and it took 4 months before I started driving.  The work is fast paced as you may know but the faster you work the more work you are given. If you lag behind supervisors will let you know. Being a driver is a great job if you don't mind working hard for 50 to 60 hrs and you can handle the occasional criticism from supervisors.
good,"You earn your paycheck each day. The work conditions can be stressful if you let it."
good,Good first job and place where you can grow! It’s hard work but once you get used to it it’s not that bad. Good environment and people that work there! 👍🏽
good,I was always treated fairly. It was a good place to work. Of course some days were more hectic than others.  My hours were somewhat flexible.  I worked part time and there were times the job dictated more hours.
good,I worked at night as a mechanic. It was fairly demanding and requires a good amount of dedication. Some times it was difficult to get a package car ready for route due to the area I worked it.
good,"You just have to be ready to work soon as you get in because they are going to put you too work soon as you step in the doors . But follow all the rules , you can get hurt at this job if your not doing it right ."
good,Ups is a good place to work and maybe even retire but the hours is way I want the most there if u could get more hours there it would make u wanna stay for ever
good,Ups is nice company to work and the benefits help as well it a very fast pace job very good learning experience for me you have to be physically fit strong in body and in mind
good,A very results driven team oriented Company.  The teamwork aspects of the defined areas of responsibility helps drive customer oriented results.  There is a complete work life balance where employees are able to balance each respectively.
good,Good overall company to start your career  has a friendly feel if you want to continue school it has plenty of opportunities and great health benefits
good,"My daily routine at UPS is loading trucks and making sure all the packages fit in trucks properly. Always scan the packages, the owners would know that the package is on the way."
good,typical day at ups you come in clock in hop on the truck and get to loading or unloading. really not much to the job just have to move at a fast pace. they want you to load like 300 pack per hour
good,"It’s a great part time job to have. Easy work, just a few hours out your day and you’re done. Nice pay as well. Bonus you can wear what you want just have to have work boots."
good,UPS warehouse with good facilities. Excellent supervision work and good training. Stressfull but with team work to compesate. Good benefits after one year in the company.
good,I enjoyed working here. Great way to keep in shape. No need for a gym. Personal reasons is why I left. Would still work there if it were possible. Great people to work with.
good,Great company to work for! Although I was a contracted employee i was treated with respect and felt like a part of my core team. I would suggest this company if you're looking for a long term career with management that cares!
good,It’s a good place to work the people are great the union is good however it takes to long to get full time hours and if you want to be a driver you have to memorize word for word a lot of things
good,"UPS is a good starter job but long term, not a very good option. If you work in office hours are flexible but in the warehouse long hours and low pay."
good,I really like my job with UPS. I just wish they offered more hours but overall love my job. I have recommended UPS to friends and family. I love the benefits and annual raise.
good,Once I go into the warehouse in the morning I stretch and see which 3 trucks or less I have today than I start looking for the correct labels than place the right packages in truck
good,"This was a good job, but I was offered a higher paying job, where I could learn more skills in compliance. Otherwise, I learned a lot of patience and to be able to help people solve their problems"
good,"management was friendly"
good,Work hard and you will be compensated. There is room for advancement because of the high turn over.  UPS is a union environment where it is mandatory to pay dues.
good,"Laid back easy going work place. fast passed, always on the go. I enjoyed work for this company. Would work there again if given the chance. lots oc chances to move up."
good,UPS was a great place to work for the years I did. I was able to grow with the company. They offer fair compensation and days off as well. I would recommend it to my friends.
good,The job was okay. work schedule began to interfere with other job.They were a decent place to work for. I also had another noob at the time that ultimately forced me to decide between the two.
good,"I really loved working at UPS. This job was a faced paced job. This was a high demanding job, because you had to make a certain quota each and every dsy. This job was fun and very exciting. The team I worked with was very welcoming and I had fun while working. I enjoyed the benefits and essential that came along with the job. I would recommedn this job to anyone."
good,the company is great overall but the hours were short and the distance wasn't worth it . If it was closer I would still be working there but beside that everything was great
good,It’s good pay. $13 an hour. 17 year olds can work and go to school. Everyone is chill. No dress code except boots. About 5 hours a day. Only 5 days a week. Pays for college tuition. Free health care after a certain time. 401k. Pick your shift.
good,Enjoyed my team as well as my supervisors. Definitely work you but the benefits paid great! They show appreciation to their employees as well as respect
good,Like the sort I'm in. We use our resources respectfully. Have volume will move. Belts and chutes at our facilities move packages to you. High volume makes a good day.
good,"Daily work was fairly normal.  During holidays, it's a bit chaotic.  Great people to work with.  Most difficult part of my job was dealing with hostile customers.  Whether package was lost or misplaced, maybe delivered to incorrect place,"
good,You get to meet new people . It is a fast paced environment and it is challenging.   The company thrives on safety and the safety of there employees. I was only there for 3 months during there peak season but it was fun.
good,"Empresa americana con unos conceptos de trabajo optimizados para cumplir objetivos,"
good,Ups Was the best thing that happen to me showed me how to pay attention more listen to others and Do what you suppose to do and Work fast never Slow  stay consistent
good,"UPS is a great company to work for if you like physical labor. They provide you with school tuition payment from day 1. They promote from within, and provide employees with a great benefits package."
good,Overall it was a learning experience with great benefits. It was hard work at first that became habbit after awhile. The inside of warehouse is as hot or cold as the side temperature.
good,"Work normally lasts 4 to 5 hours (almost double that during peak season)"
good,"UPS is a good paced job, you can definitely build some muscle working there full time. The people are very social, there’s always something to do. Keeps your mind busy to get through with tasks you need to get done. You aren’t ever really doing anything alone. It’s a team job!"
good,"This place is a fast place to work, if you want a work out you can get it done there, it's the right place to keep you in shape,"
good,the typical morning at work is a fast paced and enthusiastic enviroment with everyone trying their best to acheive the tasks set to a high standard. the hardest part of the job would be keeping up with the fast pace
good,"They gave amazingly good benefits after a year. Good company "
good,"Very hot and fast paced work place , many people scrambled everywhere putting in maximum effort to get what ever is needed done . Small work area and 3 personal trucks to load for yourself ."
good,Great benefits but very hard and faster passed work. Would recommend as a great part time job for anyone needing great benefits but you will definitely earn every bit of them
good,Must be able to keep up with long hours and face paced jobs. It is very fast paced job to get the job done correctly and on time you need to be able to do quick think and quick decisions.
good,Work environment was good . Very fast paced . As a driver helper you have early starts and finish around 6/7 pm. If your working your way to becoming a driver this position gets your foot in the door getting familiar with the day to day life of a driver
good,can be critical of people they hire and how they speak if not speaking proper english and women who work there tend to be catty for certain things then run to supervisor to complain about you and how you have spoken to them
good,"I learned alot working at ups. How to work hard but safe and in groups. at times I was afraid but ups taught me to overcome my fear and work with people and I met some great people and made awsome friends along the way. the typical job day would almost always be heavy all day or light. the rare times that its a mix of the two can be either good or bad depending on how many people you have. The culture is very diverse which I did Like, you'll meet many different people. The hardest part of the job I think was when there was not a whole lot of people a certain day or week and you had to work in multiple areas. the most enjoyable part of it for me was sorting. That was my favorite thing to do there and I Was good at it."
good,not very safe at all times wasn't really for me although i do appreciate them hiring me in my time of need. If i needed to i suppose to would work at Ups again.
good,Worked part time was okay. Fast paced good coworkers. Worked with customers and packed packages in trailer. Good benefits and easygoing work environment.
good,"Very fun work environment. The drivers over at UPS are very people persons. Other than the grueling work moving packages, especially during the holiday season, its a very fulfilling place to work."
good,It was a good job and different hours was good . They pay good and I liked it . I work from 4-11 pm I would leave school to go to work but now I graduate from high school i’m looking for a better job.
good,"Learned team skills, Accounting skills gained, multicultural work environment. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning new everyday and has positive energy."
good,"Fun place to work very challenging at times but fun. Enjoy the people I work with, excellent benefits, good work/life balance. Good pay and a good place for advancement if you work towards it."
good,"I love working here the benefits are great and works well for any schedule. No weekend work, paid holidays and paid vacation plus the benefits all while part time. Great place to work and build a career"
good,Ups needs to hire full-time instead of part=time causing us to pay for my own medical expenses until they see fit for us to join their team full-time.
good,"UPS is a great company,  union driven hence opportunities for growth; they care about their employees and their families. Excellent Management team and coworkers."
good,I enjoy working with the guy I was working with we enjoy each other routes was nice in easy we both help each other . If I had any questions he was there to answer them
good,The jobs is like getting paid for working out.is like a gym is not that bad. If you like working out apply to ups. The people there are really nice. They will help you if you need help
good,"Clear your environment to ensure a safe workplace, organized your work area as well to prepare the loading process of all delivery trucks that go out in the morning."
good,"Great place to work, great enviroment. Management needs improvement and also they need to trained all this kids that they make supervisors cuz they dont know what they are doing."
good,Great management and position advancement. I learned a lot with this company. They  recognize hard work and encourage growth. If I ever get the opportunity to go back I would. A very professional place of employment.
good,The job itself is not a bad job to have. They offer benefits and the overtime pay is good if offered. Many different shifts and position's to chose from.
good,"If you want to see what you're made out of, give UPS a try. You're expected to unload 1200 or more packages, most of which are 35 to 75 pounds. I thought I knew what work was, until I tried working there. In my opinion the pay isn't worth what you put in to the place. If you're lucky you're getting 25 hours a week, and that is plenty given the work you do. Offer teamsters union benefits, which are mostly irrelevant, you won't even earn enough to be ineligible for Medicaid."
good,"I enjoyed the operation aspect of the job. I enjoyed meeting deadlines, running reports, and overall problem-solving. I performed a variety of tasks daily that kept me motivated."
good,This was the position that gave me my Human Resources chance and career foundation. I loved working in my Human Resources position with UPS and they make it a point to recognize a job well done.
good,For the time I worked for UPS I thoroughly enjoyed it. The pace wasn’t too fast but I had to make sure I kept up. It was good place to learn good pacing and routes if I ever showed interest in becoming a driver.
good,To do this job you need to be very physical it is a nonstop conveyor that has heavy light big small and awkward boxes that will pile up if your not fast enough and 8 hrs of this daily took a toll on my body I recommend this to younger people with a lot of energy
good,"While UPS offers great benefits and plenty of opportunities, it is a very intense, fast paced job that requires discipline and strong people skills in order to be successful"
good,I enjoyed the work through peak season but as soon as it was over my job changed and the pay decreased and I was no longer a fan of working there. Great for the Holiday season
good,Work is very easy once you know what your doing. Alot of the workers are friendly and likes to help others. They provide Caribbean food. Environment is good.
good,This was a good job experience right out of high school.  It helped me develop a strong work ethic.  UPS sets a high stsndard for accuracy and safety and I will carry that knowledge with me to my future employment.
good,"we had a team of 13 and we cleared many shipmenrts per day. we also had the task of opening and closing files, billing, filing ISF, calling customers, dealing with different government agencies, ets."
good,"Decent job with good pay. The hours are very early and take some adjustment. Only downfall is there is pretty much no tolerance for missing work or being late. If you are sick, your kid is sick, or you have car trouble and have to miss work, you are likely to be out of a job."
good,It’s was like the typical warehouse job I enjoyed my time there learning was great it’s much closer like an workout on the daily.. can sometimes y heavy but it was worth it.
good,"UPS isn't necessarily a ""fun"" place to work. UPS is a money maker, and feel as though it should be treated like such. It's stressful, but don't overthink it. If you apply, you'll make good money as a part-time package handler for roughly $12.50-$13.00/hr or as a full time driver for roughly $25.00-$45.00/hr plus guaranteed overtime at that."
good,"Work was fast-paced, punctual, and required moderate physical activity. Employees were professional and friendly. It was good work experience that taught excellent work ethics."
good,A normal day was unloading and loading ups packages on the ups trucks. I learned how to organize boxes and place them onto trucks at a fast pace. It also kept me in great shape.
good,Fast pace management leaves you to work on your own. Overtime is common on request. Holidays are hectic but pay will make up for it. Diversity in the work place. Everyone is friendly.
good,"great managers along with great co workers who worked as a team to get our job done. only con about the job was the lack of hours i was receiving, i am looking for a full time position."
good,"Working at UPS was a cool experience the pay wasnt bad,lunch period was nice cause they even had they own food tuck that stop by,overtime given if requested management kept you infrom,coworkers showed appreciation,room to grow. Preload pay could of being a little more."
good,"Need more full time positions. I like it here, but I can't live, and pays bills off these hours that they are offering. I don't want to lesve, but I need more hours."
good,The hardest part of the job was when they would tell you to hurry up and unload a truck which is filled from back to front. When I first got there it took me a while to learn how to do that.
good,"I enjoy and understand that they're a corporation,  therefore I play my role. I am thankful to be able to make this type of money without a degree. The job is hard but the pay and benefits make it worth it."
good,"Good part time jobs with benefits.  There is opportunity to move up in the company if you want to be a driver or in management, fulltime inside jobs are scarce unless you have 20 plus years."
good,"You meet your assigned driver at a safe location, like Walgreens. They pick you up, and not every day is going to be the same with when you start, or when you get off. You help the driver deliver packages within the city assigned to your driver. You need to keep a brisk pace when you deliver packages, and at the same time keep an eye for your surroundings, like ice, and decorations. You learn how to read the labels on packages, how to use the scanner to scan packages, and some other skills for the job. The hardest part about the job in my opinion is keeping the track organized when you, and your driver are flooded with packages at times. The most enjoyable thing about being a driver helper is that your outside getting exercise, almost 100% of the time. But I would not consider this job if you can not stand winter weather."
good,"I did enjoy working here. I felt that the management was a little off, but they did treat their workers fairly. When overtime was needed, they did ask if we wanted to participate."
good,Hard to advance in the company unless it’s right timing. Very fast paced company with high demands but the pay is good. Your hours are never the same and it all depends on having a good manager and dispatcher for your center
good,This position was fast paced and challenging. Some days we made 200-400 stops delivering packages to homes and businesses. I loved every minute of this job.
good,"A typical day inside a UPS hub is usually high intensity with a huge focus on processing loads and working safe and smart. During my time and current development within the company i have grown vastly in confrontation with others, team communication, and leadership along with timely decision making. The most difficult aspect of dealing with any part pf my job is simply employees or managers making the job more difficult by being inconsiderate or just not wanting to cooperate or perform their job task. As stated above the work environment is mostly fun and family oriented like a sports team, i love the people i work with from different walks of life. The most enjoyable part of my job is connecting with my employees and putting a smile across their face and getting them to understand how much i and the company appreciate their efforts."
good,I worked as a supervisor for UPS part-time while still taking 12 credits per semester in school. The job was fast-paced and required attention to detail and being on top of the drivers.
good,Working at a steady pace on a assembly line labeling packaging and shipping items... Setting up the line for the truck to be loaded and shipment handled...
good,Everyone that I worked with was very friendly. Management was very involved with the daily goings-on throughout the warehouse. The employees were valued very much as well.
good,UPS was a fast paced working environment with great leadership and coworkers. The pay and benefits were good and I enjoyed my time there. I would recommend to anyone not afraid of work.
good,"fast paced place to work..must keep on schedule to get the trucks out in timely manor."
good,"I really enjoyed working at ups , The employees were very welcoming they took the time to teach me how to package and use inventory sheets and computers. "
good,"I received boxes from different places in the world, I had to find the truck where the packages belongs in the state sometimes the truck states are given to you for you to load the packages clean and neatly evenly so they won’t fall."
good,"If you sign on to be a Flex PCS, you are not going to make enough if your bills surpass $1000 a month. You will not get more than 20 hours a week. While pay us good, it only goes so far, if you are not getting enough hours."
good,"Needs AC. I'm tired of cooking like a stuffed Turkey at work. And the warehouse is filthy. When you blow your nose after getting off, black stuff comes out."
good,On a typical day at work we would line up to stretch before the day for about 20 minutes. We would then start loading and unloading freight from trailers and off of the conveyor belts.
good,"I like the job but it's part time, it's a good working environment with healthcare and college  benefits. The only drawback is the hours aren't consistant."
good,"UPS was a great first job to have it taught me to work fast, safe and constructive. I had to learn how to work with other people no matter the situation"
good,"If you want to relocate, this is a perfect company to work for. Also they hire lots of people with different backgrounds. The problem with UPS is the continuous changes in upper management positions, that create an inconsistency on expectations, tasks, performance and pay structure."
good,"Be prepared to be lifting, moving, and transporting weird shapes and varying pounds. The coworkers and management are very accommodating. Great work space."
good,if you cant multi task this isn't the job for. you'll need to be able to pay attention to detail at all times and make sure you're proficient as will as efficient.
good,"UPS is an outstanding company to work for. UPS has taught me how to become a better manager, keep track of things far as in packages and my employers, and lastly what goes in & out of the building."
good,Daily maintenance checks on equipment that is used daily. Setup work area before your employees arrive. The belts start up at a certain time and boxes are moved toward their destination.
good,"UPS gives a good start up opportunity, they offer fair pay for the amount of time worked, unfortunately its hard to make a career there. they offer great retirement and insurance"
good,"I worked for UPS during the holiday season. My hours was from 9:00 a.m. to 6:00p.m., I learned fast paced organizing. I got to meet new people and it was never boring."
good,"It’s a fast paced job with an interesting work atmosphere. Many different types of personalities work there, some negative, but mostly positive. Management needs work, they make questionable decisions in an untimely manner. The hardest part of the job is getting used to the overnight schedule. You are required to be able to lift heavy packages safely, and with/without help."
good,Ups is a good job to have when you're in need of extra pocket money or need money around holiday times as far as working there full time I wouldn't recommend it.
good,I'd arrive around midnight and wait for my group to meet up in the main rec room. We would then wait to hear where we were stationed that night and would proceed to either load or unload a plane.
good,I like it a good pace to work if your just started out but not for long term work. Can not start a family with company so if you plan on starting a family anytime soon do not go to ups long term.
good,M'a fait découvrir le métier du transport qui me donne envie de continuer dans cette voie mais suite à mon déménagement je recherche un autre poste
good,"working at ups is full of friendly and hardworking people and when you first start you get 2 weeks training, everything is well explained if you do not understand anything,"
good,A great place for a young worker to build character and responsibility. Great benefits but the pay starts off low. The heat is the hardest part of the job.
good,back breaking work and bad pay. staff usually keep to themselves and they usually dont really care t if you get hurt. they will gossip and such but that is like any other work place
good,"the environment is multicultural, and looking forward to the new advancements in the west division. I have learned lots of lots of things and looking forward to moving on."
good,A typical day at the office is going out getting bills off dock enter data into computer make sure if hazmat and the correct palcers are asigned. File them where needed. Answer the phones and asist truck drivers as well.
good,Just show up and work don't worry about others do the job and everything else falls into place. Doing that there wouldn't be any problems with no one at all.
good,I was only a package handler or pre-loader. I worked less than part time in the mornings loading delivery trucks for the drivers. Pay was great but the hours are NOT. At least as a pre-loader. I was working on average 15 hours a week and just wasn't cutting it. Career advancement is poor. Unless you get lucky expect to wait 10 years to move up. Yes 10 years. Drivers get paid very well for the work they do so it may be worth it if you want to wait. Pretty good pay for the work and great medical. My dad is a teacher and working ultra part time I had better insurance than him.
good,"Load trucks"
good,work 2 to 3 and a half hours usually on a daily basis in a work week. There are different areas in the building you can do. Inbound- getting packages into the building. small sort- smaller packages get sorted out and put into bags and outbound- scanning packages into containers and feeder trucks to be shipped out. These are  some of the main areas. Some supervisors are great and others dont know what they are doing. It is a fast paced environment and everything has to be done at a certain time. Hardest part is dealing with belts that shut down or jammed. Most enjoyable is working with people you get along with.
good,"The job moves at a fast pace. You have to adjust or fall behind. The co - workers are good, they teach and help you alot on the job. I was hired seasonal option and I loved it."
good,I learn to delivery packages efficiently and was able to meet deadlines. Its a very fast paste. As a driver helper i would say the most enjoyable things is the experience overall and having a relationship with the driver.  The hardest part is trying not to get bit by dogs.
good,"The environment is great but the people who are in charge of the show are not so great. Upper management seems to not care so much about over working employees let alone part time supervisors. In fact sometimes , we as part time supervisors feel like hourly employees."
good,at ups the hours were terrible and the nights dragged on forever. the pay wasn’t the best working 15 hour weeks at 15/hr pay making roughly 1000 a month but with taxes making less
good,The job is easy. You are in your feet all day but it’s easy work. Can get crazy busy at times. There is always something to do. The coworkers are what made the job for me.
good,Its a very fast pace work place have to load truck so that drivers can be out the building by 9am every morning. Its only one shift and that is 3am to 9am
good,"UPS had a friendly environment for everyone with different backgrounds. the management were very helpful and respected everyone as equals, no matter the age. the culture was very diverse but overall well-mannered. I believe the hardest part about the job was its early shifts that would sometimes start at two in the morning."
good,"Required an almost impossible standard to qualify for permanent job. Otherwise, the work was enjoyable.  Co-workers were very helpful sometimes, even if they didn't know you well."
good,"It was a great work experience with ups."
good,"Great benefits, can advance fairly quick, solid workout. As with all things both management and the union can be super good, but always keep an eye on them. Just starting as an hourly won't make you very much, a side from the free, full benefits. The early years working UPS should be supplemented with a second job while you build up enough seniority within the union to get a better position."
good,"Typical day would be load up as many packages as you can, preferably in an organized way, and then deliver them as fast as possible. That is how most of my days went, it was stressful at first when learning all of the addresses, but after I got into the swing of things it almost became a game of trying to figure out the fastest most efficient route for the addresses I have to get to."
good,"Heavy lifting continues"
good,Great job if you  don't want to work full time but still make some money.  Anything over 20 hours is overtime.  Good way to make some money for the holidays
good,"its a good job if you don't mind surprise overtime. customers are flexible so depending on the day, people mood changes. the pay is good and the job offer good benefits."
good,UPS great for the services.  Corporate UPS needs to assist more with direct marketing and advertising.  And helping centers grow.  Too much expectation for growth without direct support.
good,for a first time job it was great! tons of opportunity to move up in the company. during Christmas it can get crazy but its only for a few months.  starting as a box handler and becoming a UPS driver would make for a solid career.
good,I would recommend anyone to work for ups and if I’ve given a chance to work for ups again as long as it’s local I would work for ups again.i have enjoy having conversation and interact with my co employees .
good,"I was a loader for the preload shift and begun seeing how the company can grow and who should be held accountable for certain problems. I applied for the PT Sup positions and begun my career as a preload sup.  I wanted to learn about the entire building and sort before moving on the next stage as a FT sup. I had to transfer to a closer building by my residence for personal reasons and In this particular building, we were very understaffed which isn't completely unusual with the company in general.  I understand there is a certain amount of money is put into our healthcare however, I firmly believe more people would stay if health insurance is provided after book is made. Not having enough people to work that make the supervisors help has a negative effect  on experienced employees but especially the trainees."
good,"I worked there over 15 years ago and do not know how things are now, but at the time the pay was good, the benefits were great and the management was good."
good,"You will get tired and it goes fast, but the benefits and pay are worth it.  They will also supply some food and drinks to their workers.  I worked midnight shift so It was hard to adapt but any other shifts work too."
good,"loading unloading trucks forklift driver. Sorting boxes, aircraft working frieght work on the airport. Taking of the customers servies any orders that come in."
good,"Opportunity to grow, daily reward programs that include prizes at the end of each week.  The culture at UPS is well established and are goal oriented to meeting numbers."
good,"I enjoyed working there but I don’t agree with the upper management on how to resolve issues, or the way they treated the hourly employees. Pay was ok."
good,Great job just cute hour because others have more time with company lost time because others had more time in then me but over all best place to work good pay no benififts becaues only partime
good,Every work day is just like the last. Its for the most part a very organized environment. Everyone works together to achieve the goals for the day and to keep things productive.
good,great company and great to advise your career skills. focus on management and safety first with great production goals. its a great student and family job helps provide great benefits after joining the company union
good,UPS is a top company. The pay level is good and it requires an attitude of diligence and professionalism. UPS will be a good experience for the right worker.
good,"Working as a seasonal package handler at the United Parcel Services was a interesting experience. I learned an abundance of life skills while on the job. Although there as't direct communication between workers and supervisors, it was still a good opportunity because it paid $14 per hour with a $150 bonus."
good,becoming a supervisor at UPS is a great learning experience. whether you want to advance in the company or find a new career. It gives you a full hands on learning management skills and understanding the importance of running an operation for a company.
good,Scan the items that had to be put it the correct slot to get to the correct town was a rask that is stressful but its a task that i completed and at a steady pace.
good,I would recommend this job to anyone looking to apply only took me a couple days to get the hang of it and managed to get loads of work done in the few months I was here. Hourly pay rate really good. Me and the driver I was paired with got on well made the job seem a lot easier. Working Hours don’t get in the way of doing other things during the day. Overall good experience.
good,"UPS was a fun place to work which offered a face pace environment. You come in work the sort then leave, on occasion bad weather would cause t to stay over."
good,very fast paced work.the company expected a very hi standard from their employees.you would get in your truck and it usually had a 10 hour day load in it.you go out make your deliveries and.you didnt  go back to the building until you made an attempt on every package.employees are union workers and management are not.best part of the job is that your customers was happy to see you every day.
good,It’s a great company but if you work hard it can come back and bit you. If you do the work your supposed to but finish early because you have something to do or just because your not a slacker. They are going to end up having you pick up the slack of other employees.
good,"Although I was only employed with UPS on a seasonal basis, I enjoyed that I always had something to do and before I knew it, it was time to clock out and head home."
good,The ups job is actually ver fun and challenging which makes you want to work there more its a good place to gain weekly exercise and get paid for it 100% fun
good,"I'd work for ups again if I could work for them again I would.                "
good,On a typical day I would meet up the driver and jump in the passenger seat then head out to deliver the packages. We would work about 10 plus hrs a day and we would eat on the drive.
good,I started off as a loader. Learned how to load trucks and make sure packages are loading in the right trucks. Lift heavy boxes and also to boxes back to resort. Sorted boxes for their truck doors as well.
good,It was hot but the environment was decent. The job itself was enjoyable. As long as you did you job to specs. Benefits are decent and but if your good at your job you work alot.
good,"Fast paced environment with a lot of friendly competition. "
good,"I liked working here because it was early in the morning and it was a fast paced and hard working environment and I worked well together with other co-workers. I would load up the trucks with all packages to be delivered for the holiday which gave me a sense of accomplishment,knowing people would receive there packages for the holiday."
good,"You never have to worry about not getting enough hours, there's always options to get OT. I worked at UPS seasonally but it was very enjoyable. Flexible schedules as a student and plenty of benefits."
good,UPS had a structured and productive work environment. A typical workday involved but not restricted to meeting with reps from other departments who had requirements for building efficient databases or improving existing ones. This job was fulfilling because there is a sense of accomplishment at the end of each project
good,great temp job but low pay for the Christmas package delivery that I did. I liked the job but it wasn't worth it.I don't want to talk about this part time job any more but the stupid program keeps prompting me to.
good,"I am the opener for the store each day during the week. Saturdays, are rotated. Sundays we are closed."
good,I really enjoyed working with my co workers and we became friend! so cool having a adult friend. also the higher ups really nice people too. Their show results not talk about results
good,UPS is all about safety first. They provide long working hours. The employees and managers are friendly and willing to work with you. This place is fast paced as well.
good,"Kom till jobbet satt och åt lunch innan uppstart sedan började vi packa in alla paket som kom via ett band -in till lastbilarna."
good,"I enjoyed working for UPS."
good,Ups definitely takes care of their employees. Great benefits provided to all workers. Great Co-workers and management.  Supervisors treated you like a human being.  Usually long days though. Not a lot of home time.  Always the chance of overtime usually
good,"I learned DB2 at UPS in a training program back in 1992-93."
good,"Wonderful to their employees.  Great work enviroment.  Flexible in scheduling.  Management is awesome, they really care about their employees regardless of their position in the company"
good,i had to put the right boxes in the design order truck at a fast pace an made sure all boxes made it in their right truck .when end of day i had to make sure working area was cleaned
good,"Fast paced work in a warehouse lifting boxes into trucks for 4-6 hours  a day, 5x a week. Options to work an extra shift if help is needed with a 1.5x hourly rate after 5 hours of work up to 2x after 10 hours worked in a single day. Meeting new and different people and have to work with other people in the building is enjoyable and the management can be very serious at times but also very relaxed and funny at the same time. "
good,"It is a very hard and long process to become a UPS Packages driver. With it being a Union, you get great benefits but it takes time. If you are lucky enough to get a good delivery route and make it to the 3year mark (which is a lot of work and time). The pay is great for driving a little brown truck."
good,It is a Good place to work  with a Good Pay. The company provides Good Training. It's new learning experience for my role as I was looking part time position.
good,"UPS Package Handlers work for the UPS delivery company and are responsible for packing items so they can be delivered safely to the destination. Successful resume samples for this position showcase duties such as using hand tools, assembling cartons, sealing products, and completing other tasks as assigned."
good,UPS was a good experience for me because that is where I cut my teeth in transportation.  I learned a lot about the inner working of a sort center and the time study measurements.
good,"Liked company a lot, It has a very large IT department and provide a lot of opportunities to all employees. especially have chance to work on large scale projects."
good,With technology ups has been able to track every single package. this shifts responsibility to workers in the precise sorting of packages in timely delivery.
good,"UPS would work you 12 plus hours a shift that was mandatory most days, I learned how to load and unload trucks at a very fast paste, the hardest part of the job was trying to complete a project in a timely manner before your shift was over."
good,This was a great place to work. I really enjoyed learning how to function as part of the team and learning how to work with my coworkers. The pay is decent.
good,The owner was very helpful he went beyond for his customers reaction and he treated the mailbox customers as family which was a good and bed thing but he was an awesome boss
good,Transport vehicles through a car wash to be ready for transit for the following work day and transport vehicles to gas fueling system to so the vehicle would be ready for transit the following work day. Very straightforward management that’s helpful for further employment opportunity that make the job enjoyable.
good,It was  consistant work nonstop physical work. Great work out. Scheduled work day was 4 hours very seldom worked full schedule. At the end of the week we may get 17.5 hours. We only got a10 minute break each night.
good,"Freedom to be on your own, not a lot of micromanagement, safety is a priority, frequent interaction with customers, outdoors a lot in all kinds of weather."
good,An outstanding company to work for. I spent 33 years there. There are no easy jobs but you are well compensated. The company is growing and there are many opportunities.
good,"Okay place to work, need to be physically fit as the job is very demanding and you have to be able to work at quick speeds to keep up with everyone else."
good,"UPS has a great work environment, people are very kind and considerate. They have a great training program for those that are excepted into UPS family.  They have a great union  with great benefits."
good,Ups was a great job with an even greater staff and management. Everyone was extremely nice and helpful. On special occasions management would buy us lunch and do special things like buy snacks and pastries once a week.
good,This a job that requires you to work on your feet and sometimes requires working in poor weather conditions. It is a tough job but occasionally you receive tips.
good,You have to be very consistant and work very quickly at a fast pace. It all depends on the season or the month your in for example the most heaviest month is december..
good,"I love my job there's plenty of different jobs to do and after proving your loyalty you get paid vacations and insurance. Yearly raises, a union protection, and off on weekends."
good,I helped sort and deliver packing during the holiday season.  This involved delivering all packages and it didn't matter what time you finished.  We often worked to 10:00 pm.
good,Ups is a great company to work for. There is definately room for advancement. There is a lot of unsupervised work time which always gave me a sense of control.
good,"Structured focused management team, striving to be the best in the business. At times we loose focus on the individuals growth and achievements. Short term planning is excellent. Long range planning and communication of strategies needs work."
good,My experience at UPS was overall a very good one. It’s and exciting place to work and in order to be successful you must be physically and mentally tough in order to fill a semi truck up in the allotted amount of time.
good,"Just need more training and help but I loved it. Good hours, good manger, positive people, good benefits just wants there that long to get them, lots of help"
good,"I like it here, though the work and hours can sometimes be a little tedious depending on flow and the time of year (peak season is a bit of a hassle, but it pays well)."
good,Enjoyed working only left cause had to relocate back to California to take care of family member. Wasn’t able to relocate to it being afamily emergency really wish I could.
good,"The people here are very friendly and the management is helpful. They're always looking for people. I was surprised to get healthcare and paid days off for the part time job I was doing. Its a very quick-paced work environment, so you have to be on top of things, otherwise you'll get overwhelmed. Career advancement is a bit difficult. Its a good temp part-time job."
good,Great place. The only downside to part time management is the lack of hours. You are constantly being cut back to the minimum. All the hours and pay goes to the drivers.
good,"As soon as we start loading,unloading the whole shift. Non stop work. When you start with an empty 18 wheeler, it has to be packed tight to the door by the time your finished."
good,the mangers was all the same age as you and they all wanted to stand around and goof off and talk about what the next party was they was going to and who they dated and worried about sending people all over the place and didn't even know when there employee got hurt or anything
good,its a hard job like they say lots of fast pace work always need to be aware of the surroundings while staying safe and productive the have a great staff time with lots of helpful tips
good,"Tightest shipper in the shipping business very good co.pany monetary, developmental. Coaching daily many meeting to keep you informed on any given day."
good,"It's seniority based. They sell you on the benefits packages and the high pay of driver positions. BUT, you have to be able to stick out the daily grind making pennies for several years before anything happens as far as advancement. You're not paid by performance yet they always push you to work harder and more efficient."
good,It’s a good   Steady  Paying job they are friendly people and it’s a work out. It most  definitely  Made me lose a lot of weight it’s a great job to work for.
good,"UPS is a good place for those who are good in stressful situations as well as wok at a quick pace. Your job is simple, but it is not as easy as it sounds. The goal is to get all your packages in the correctly labeled car as quickly and organized as you can. If you are too slow, packages will build up and you risk being boxed out of one of your cars. If you can work at a fast enough pace you will be okay, but you must be certain that you can or you may not be there for long."
good,Work is fast paced and very physical in some departments.  Peak season hours increase but shifts are 4-5hrs a day regularly. Training is mostly hands on with co-workers or part-time supervisor.
good,"I believe due to the growth of new business and people moving into Texas, UPS as a company has had to grow very rapidly and is moving away from its past employee relationship practices, and has become a  large freight company. Im in the opinion that due to that growth, its safety and training  program has suffered. As well the employee relations have changed."
good,"Workplace culture is OK, but it needs a lot of improvement when it comes to Technology advancement as they ahem old legacy systems in place. Management is OK."
good,I was only here for a holiday season was a good job loved being there would have loved to be a full time employee if that was ever a chance I would do it
good,Driver I worked with was great. We would go from block to block quick and worked a lot of hours and did a lot of walking. Delivering packages was a different experience.
good,Great! Love the job very well will work there again people was great company is good the pay was okay the hours was ok they have great benefits and the job is fun
good,Worked in various functions throughout my UPS career. Enjoyed the opportunity to work directly with customer decision makers. Culture at UPS was to service the customer and bring value to whatever work function you were assigned. Annual Peak Season duties were at time stressful with the long work hours and responsibilities. Enjoyed to ability to work remotely at customer sites as well my home office.
good,Typical day. Get a call from dispatch and given a time and place to meet with driver. Clock in and log in on phone provided by the driver plan delivery route. Deliver packages to correct addresses.
good,If you're into carrying loads of boxes this is the job for you dear !! Its easy money and you learn how to be quicker on your feet and lose a few pounds while you're at it !
good,"competitive with other pickers, to get our daily quota. safety is prioity, a lot of team work, supervisors are always willing to help with our personal lives outside of the workplace."
good,Will be a lot of heavy lifting and will get hot/cold inside the trailer. Everyone is friend and easy to get along. But will be some late night shift working till your trailer is done.
good,Pays for school and decent pay. The hours could be better but for a part time gig and school being paid for it isn’t that bad i guess. Freight facility management is awesome.
good,"You build a lot of character working with UPS, from the management to the employees to your daily collaboration of work ..you leave ups with a sense of pride and belonging."
good,Arrive to work at 8:20. leave the UPS center at approximately 9:00-9:30 with assigned driver. Deliver packages house to house for Peak Season. Roughly 8-11 hours per day.
good,Overall a good place to work especially if you like to stay active and want a part time job. Pay is better than many other part time jobs out there. Good place.
good,"Fast paced but also very rewarding with manageable hours, great training and decent coworkers. Overtime is compensated fairly and there is tuition reimbursement"
good,"Great benefits, good management structure. Thye love to promote from within, and hard work and effort really pay off.  It is a very demanding job, but they'll pay for your education"
good,"Great benefits occasionally stressful(holidays), somewhat unfair pay for what is expected. Annual raises, paid time off, paid holidays, great union. Part time supervisor position is offered to everyone but is an undesirable job."
good,UPS is a good hard working job. If you want to get a good work out on top of getting paid then ups is a good job to start at .Especially because they can help out with your schooling. They will pay your tuition for you as long as your employed with them.
good,Working here I've learned multiple traits such as patients stamina and problem solving. It's a quick pace job and can be stressful at times but I personally believe it's easy work to do due to repetitive task.
good,"Great job just have to dedicate yourself . Also wonderful supervisors. Easy Job , great pay and great job training but it was pretty cold due to the time I was working."
good,"Overall it's not a bad place to work, you meet many different people and work with different supervisors.....but since I've been back from my military training it's changed a lot so I can't really give you a review. But they do have tuition reimbursement and the benefits are great and it's good for making money on the side unless you're into management and want to move up the chain then yea maybe it's something you can do."
good,"I like working at UPS, It is a great opportunity and a unique experience. I have learned a lot through there training and on line training options. They keep me informed with any vital information."
good,At this job I am able to use sorting skills. I take multiple packages and place the packages in the correct location. The physical demands to the job allow opportunity to obtain more muscle on my body. Co-workers encourage packages are sorted correct.
good,I did the seasonal work because I was told that They hire from the Seasonal workers for full time employment. Near the end of December I inquired with HR as to the process for getting hired full time and was told that they don't hire off the street.
good,UPS is a good job to build charcter but is not a good first job if your in school. The pay rate is okay due to the union rasing it. The UPs communite is very good.
good,The company is a fast pace and has lots of package coming and going to where you have to be on ur toes at all times. And have to know where things are going and have to very visualize to see if there are not jams or broken packages
good,"The day is short but the work is hard. Everyone is in a good mood. Work goes by quickly. Management is great. Packages can sometimes be heavy, but it's a good work out."
good,"A workday usually starts off with me clocking in and greeting co-workers in a small conversation usually about sports etc, then I would go check out my scanner. I learned how to work at a fast pace with minimum help loading packages onto the carrier trucks. Management was fair and the workplace culture was extremely nice. I would have to say that the hardest part of the job was to keep up with the workplace speed of doing things. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to the rearward cookouts that the company provided for good work behavior."
good,The work environment was relaxed and fun. There was times for working in a group and independent work as well. You could also move up in the company. The oportunity qas great.
good,Hard working place get alone with ppl also see alot of thing's being shipped but overall its a place just for business that needs to get where they need to be which is called work
good,"My typical day at work starts with stand-up meetings. I work for a group called Internet Membership Services and there are multiple teams with in this group. I support applications in couple of teams. I support a variety of applications, Front end, backed and database layers. Hardest part of Job is to support applications in two different teams as timelines collide some times. Enjoyable part is that i like challenge of supporting multiple applications."
good,A decent place to work given you use their other benefits. The pay is lacking and unsustainable but the benefits make it work it to put a few hours in on the clock for simple peace of mind.
good,"I enjoyed my time at UPS and was really thankful to get an opportunity. I gained great experience during my time there and I was able to learn a lot regarding logistics, staffing and coordination. "
good,Great company to work for UPS offers a great pay and benefits package. Very much enjoy working for the company over the last 19 years but I am worried that they are going to be down sizing.
good,"i love the way how we all communicate, it a lot of fun working and meet new people every day, it also make me feel happy to know that am doing good for people."
good,Working overnight and learning to package delivery trucks is a great entry level job to learn about what UPS is about as a company. Working hard and proving yourself can open opportunities for promotion as a supervisor or chance to go to driving school and become a delivery truck driver.
good,The job always kept your busy. It may have been cold for the time I worked there but everything was still fast pace. It was an excellent job to be at for the time being.

good,I learned an abundance of Human Resource skills as well as how to interact with current and potential employees. My coworkers were friendly and extremely helpful.
good,"Seasonal Helper was a fast paced job. Typical day was unloading a u-haul truck full of packages, organizing and delivering of said packages. Management was very reasonable while I was working for UPS since I was a full time student and my schedule was a little conflicting with the jobs. Hardest part of the job was the dropping off of the packages, the holiday season is the busiest they have and the times would shift depending on how big the load was that was being dropped off. Some drivers that delivered were better than others in the unloading process. All were very professional and worked to help in anyway they could."
good,It’s backbreaking work that is acceptable because of the culture the people there create. They’re loose and energetic most of the time and it helps greatly.

good,Most days I report to the sort and we begin unloading trailers to the secondary. We will typically unload about 3-4 trailers per day. The work culture for the most part is good. I have a great working relationship with the employees that work in my area as well as other employees throughout the building. The company does have great medical benefits as well as tuition reimbursement for school which I took full advantage of.
good,"I love labor work so this was the field i was looking for. Even tho i am a woman the men let me do my job the way it need to be done "
good,Fine place to work. Fastpaced always something to do. Managers were very fair and understanding. Got along with everyone. If needed I would go back and work for them again.

good,the days were average.learned to hone my social skills.management was very poor.the culture was very diverse.hardest part of the job was angry customers
good,"Job can be stressful at times depending on which day it is, but overall pay is good along with paid time off with opportunity for overtime during peak seasons. Advancement for full-time is limited and have to be there for 5+ years usually before they even consider it."
good,"Good workplace. Plenty of hours, especially during the holidays. Overall a safe place to work. They also care about employees and make sure to take care of them."

good,"My responsability as a driver "
good,"I busted my butt being a helper and it was a pretty fun gig for just two weeks.

It was hard and long hours, but my driver was a really cool guy and I have heard nothing but good things about the company."

UPS is big on training their employees on safety in effort of saving lives and expenses on both the employer and employee. The hardest part about working for UPS is the long hours on certain days. However, the work schedule is well balanced so that employees are not overexerted day to day. The most enjoyable part about for UPS is the continuous education to keep you abreast on information that is design to keep you safe."
good,"To be very honest, I did feel as though I was being worked like a horse pushing bins larger than myself and overfilled with packages all day. Despite that, I still enjoyed the job. It was relatively easy work, just somewhat grueling on your body. I would have continued to work there if my car accident had not been as severe."
good,"It was hard work, but helped while unemployed."
good,UPS was very fast pace and demanding.  The hardest part of the job was getting all packages out without delay. A belt jam or belt close down for even a min. can cause major delays.
good,"Lifting and handling packages from 1lb - 100+ lbs "
good,"The job is good but the hours and pay are not enough, if you're looking for a full time job look elsewhere unless you're looking into becoming a driver. Inside the warehouse is a nightmare the work is exhausting for the pay and the stress it puts on your body if you want to have severe back problems then this job is ""perfect"" i only recommend this job for drivers if that's not your taste then look away you'll thank me later."

good,a typical day at work was busy fast paced productive interesting friendly people nice place to work huge warehouse nice break room the mangers where great
good,I worked there for 7 years and was fired without representation. I worked at the hub in Des Moines Iowa on Dixon St. Upper management cares little about middle management.
good,"UPS is great company to work for because they provides great pay, benefits and their is union so you really don’t have to worry about your job. You can work at UPS for a long time and get something out of it."
good,"A typical day was helping set up and train driver assistants to ride with driver during heavy delivery times during the holiday.  The drivers in my opinion have the best deal with pay an benefits but I admit it is not an easy job from what I saw on site in Gainesville, GA."
good,"UPS is a great company to work for.  The pay and benefits is great and employees are coached to advance within the organization.  They promote from within, which is attractive."

good,Loading trucks can be very fast pace doing the holidays. Never knowing how many packages coming down the conveyor belts can be challenging so you have to be up beat.
good,Great hours. Weekly pay. No benefits. Not enough hours. Fast pace. Heavy lifting part time so only 4 hours a day no breaks. No advancement there at all
good,"UPS employees are able to build themselves from the ground up. Everyone begins at the bottom of the ladder and it is up to them whether to advance further or not. Because of this UPS is an excellent choice for someone looking for a job with no credentials. It is a physically demanding and fast paced job, and new employees need to acclimate to the work environment.  UPS provides employees all the tools they need to work safely and succeed, but it is up to the employee to actually use those tools."

good,It was a fast paced 6 week temporary Holiday job. Physically demanding for sure but as I was a driver helper I didn't feel on my own.  If you are in good shape it's steady work for the holiday season. There maybe some 12 hour or more days but  I was compensated well.
good,"The job culture was fun, and mostly everyone got along. There were obviously tough days where I would have to load 3000 packages or whatever, and sometimes tempers would flare, but other than that it was fun. They offered basketball tournament, they would let you mix up your job or job location. They were accommodating."
good,"It was one of a roller coaster rides working with UPS, Canada as a delivery assistant to the driver during the peak season of Winters. We delivered atleast 100 addresses in 4 hours."

good,"-I run an entire area and manage 8-15 people"
good,I worked there 12 years+ Different Management with their own rules. Having favorites and not ashame to show it. Some didn't have any education. It wasn't required No High Diploma. I was Very Surprised

good,"A typical day started with a pre-sort check, followed by a daily meeting.  I was required to do position audits and paperwork. I was responsible to instruct tractor trailer drivers when to hook up and when to depart from the loading dock.  I observed and ensured all safety procedures and rules accordingly. I was also responsible for ensuring that no packages were left behind at the  end of the shift."
good,I enjoyed the fast paced environment at UPS. I enjoyed the pay as well. It is a union job. So those union workers can be very lazy due to the job security the union provided them. I would recommend job because the pay and benefits are good.

I learned better interaction skills and I learned proper cleaning techniques. Management was great, they weren't rude or hostile, they pointed out ways to make certain tasks easier and what should be changed, etc. The hardest part of the job was driving from Searcy to Batesville then back everyday, but that's work. I love every other aspect of the job, and the perks that followed behind it as well."

good,Working part-time doesn't provide much ability to move forward but if you have a good manager it can pay well and be flexible with your schedule. The position depends more on location and ownership than anything else. Working here will require an employee to learn new skills which can be later used on future resumes or to work up the latter.

good,"A typical day at this job includes a lot of lifting, bending, pulling, standing, sweating, and walking.  I learned that working at this company that teamwork is a must and you have to work together to get the job done. The management sucks and could be better but they don't have the right combination of people running the company.  The hardest part of the job is being able to adjust to the changing temperature inside the hub because it gets really hot in the summer time and really cold in the winter time.  The enjoyable part is that you only work a few hours a day and you still have time to do other things before or after work.  They offer insurance and tuition reimbursement and also life insurance policy for you and your family."

good,Great position for recent college graduates. Not a career job unless you can deal with not making decent money until your senior years. Good culture unless you get a bad supervisor. Very supervisor based culture. Someone sitting next to you doing the same position could have a different rule book based on their supervisor.
good,Wish I could go back  love the pay hated  the inside work I was took off my route really want to stay but I needed better pay the reason I left but other then that really was a great job
good,"Solid  company, work hard compensated. Interact with multiple customers. Offer technology solutions to build strong business partnership. Offer customers positive guidance."
good,"I loved the people i worked with every day, tough being in management and being harrassed by union reps is a bit of a drag. Good that those times were few n far between."
good,Overall i really loved UPS management was great and the coworkers were friendly and welcoming. They so potential in me and the moved me from place to place every so often to help around the warehouse. Most enjoyable part of the job was how friendly everyone was there although some hard parts happened when coworkers got sick and could not show up to work increasing the pace of the entire work flow.
good,I love the fast working Pace with UPS it's a good company to work for when you start off but when you first start off you only get 17 to 20 hours a week and you can't live off that that's a good part time job if you have a full-time job I would love to have a career with UPS but it takes being there a year before you have any opportunities but sometimes you just don't got time for that but besides that UPS is a great place I would recommend it to anybody who's hard-working

good,"good company to work for, getting ready to retire from there, but i learned a lot, and i was able to get my degree, with tuition reimbursement from the company.  i think the hardest part of the job was getting promoted, and having to wait so long to get into management.  the most enjoyable part of the job was traveling to different cities, and meeting different people with the company"

good,"While a more physically demanding job, I enjoyed working for UPS.  The typical day started very early and I learned how to pace myself to last to the end of the day.  Management was very good about being there for support and making sure that team goals were met.  This coincided with the team culture that was there as everything that was done was team oriented.  The hardest part of the job was the physical labor, but ironically it also became one of the best things about the job.  There was a supreme sense of accomplishment when you performed your tasks at a high level."
good,It's a company the allows you to grow based of years of service and seniority.. your response for unloading trailers and getting to hot freight to there destination in order for the freight to make it's cut times to satisfy the customers... Fright arrived on time means more business
good,"Ups would be an ideal employment if only they paid more at the hours you worked or extended the hours. Good management mostly, always opportunities to move jobs or into management. The best benefits around and discounts to many popular store and restaurants. UPS needs to change one or two things as far as salary and hours."
good,"Lots of room for advancement if that is the industry you want to stay in, start unloading packages, moved to sorting packages and memorizing lots of zip codes, moved to loading the UPS cars and trailers.   It takes up to 5 to 8 years to get to be a driver, so if your in for the long haul keep at it."
good,Working here was definitely fast paced and required attention to detail in regard to your safety! Working with other team members was nice and supervisors would often step in to help.
good,"From the start of a shift to the end , everyone is professional and hardworking while keeping a relaxed mindset throughout the day . The teamwork displayed day in and day out pushes you to become a better you so you can put yourself in a leadership position someday."
good,Was an face paced job caught on very face because of my football experience in high school. Other then that you’ll have a lot of fun working there it was an very good experience.
good,The atmosphere at this job was unlike any other I had been a part of. Great benefits. Great people to work with. The work though was grueling. A lot of responsibilities and deadlines to ensure that things got out on time.
good,I'm not sure as to the company. I was hired on as a driver helper during the Christmas season. It was fun but there was really no training and it is a good way to get your foot in the door
good,working for ups is a great opportunity.. Great company to work for. I like the fact that you are not micro managed.. They give you your assignment for the day or you already know what work needs to be done when you arrive at work
good,Position was fun and challenging every day. Great benefits and paid time off. Room to advance within the company. Great reputation in the community and in the US.
good,Quick paced work environment really challenged your attention span. Great if you like working out and getting up early. Everyday is the same and its easy to get good at your work
good,I learned a lot about the United postal service business and it was fun and productive I learned to print fax scan pack packages and help customers find their lost packages.
good,"You have very short days. Your co workers are nice. The work can be hard, and fast. The benefits are unbeatable. quite a few job opportunities. The managers are fairly easy to work with."
good,Nice faced pace place. The supervisors really support you and the overall work environment is pleasant. If you want a job where you will stay busy this is the place for you. I highly recommend UPS to anyone whos interested.
good,Hard work.... Lifting heavy packages.... Bagging packages and label the packages...... It got tough at times but it was a great experience to remember
good,"A great place to work, learn and apply supply chain innovation.  Individuals ability to accel in learning agility, engagement and aspiration to succeed, is well compensated based on achievement."
good,"You learn thing about other areas that deliver to us, I also learned the abbreviated terms they use to make easier to know what you are looking at. I have learned that being a leader means that there is a place for employees to do what they like but that place is not at the work place"
good,In the end run you do make 14 dollars an hour but you can only work 18-25 hours a week so it’s about the same as a job that pays 10 an hour with 40$/hr
good,The training process was well organized. Developed good relations with regular customers. The training process prepared me well to handle customers and situations wherein the store needs me.
good,"As a supervisor in UPS, you have many responsibilities. You must make sure every one is doing the right thing such as, using safety equipment, doing the proper techniques while lifting and lowering packages, and making sure everyone is working safely. You also have to make sure your work area is constantly clean and not filled with packages on the floors or blocking any exits. The hardest part of the job is making sure the area does not have a ""belt stop"". This is when the flow of packages becomes so heavy, that the conveyor belt would need to stop in order for the employees to catch up with the heavy flow. Time management can also be a challenge as you sometimes have to start your shift with employees coming in late and important equipment such as scanners are not ready and available because the shift before you, are still wrapping up their sort."
good,"UPS is a great place to work if you like being on your feet and you like labor work. It's mostly an individual job, but you can here and there work with a partner."
good,"while working for UPS you will learn how to work at fast paced learn different techniques on how to load or unload trucks , and also you lean how to communicate a lot more with others."
good,A typical day at ups was showing up clocking in after going through the security booth. Making sure the work area is clean and make sure all they trucks were being loaded at a fair rate of speed leaving no truck by itself to get backed all the way up the shutes.
good,"A fast paced work environment that requires an individual to adjust constantly. This company requires its employees to work hard, but reward those coworkers for their loyalty and commitment."
good,"I had an MBA internship there this summer and I really enjoyed it. Being an intern for 12 weeks, there were many things that were not offered to me that UPS is known for (such as great benefits). The pay was good for a summer's work and the culture was very good and relaxed. The hours are flexible as well. As long as you work your hours, they don't really care how you do it. I didn't have to participate on many conference calls or sit in on many meetings because I was an intern. But the management team is in meetings and on conference calls all day long. That doesn't seem like a job I would want so I don't see myself working there full-time once I graduate from my MBA program."
good,Ottima azienda con grande prospettiva di crescita.
good,They have a fair company but need hirer wages. It’s a very easy job if you like fast pace environments I come from that so I can adapt quickly. The no dress code is also good.
good,"Show up early and be ready to work . Depending where you are located you have different responsibilities , you have to memorize lots of numbers signs and rules."
good,"learned logistics for the first time very fast paced and detailed, great benefits the best. hardest part was the lack of hours at the beginning. very enjoyable atmosphere with employees and managers"
good,I like the environment the people there was very helpful I’ll do it all over again most importantly the managers was always by your side if you needed help lefting things.

good,"fast pace of work but nice place of work, loved working there even thou I didn't made probation. Manager was great. they care about the safety of the employees."
good,"Work was fast-paced to get a lot of packages delivered on time. There are some break in-between which is nice. Being in shape helps a lot, especially if the area of delivery has a lot of changes in elevation."
good,"Being a part of the ups team has been a Great working experience,  it also a positive working environment . Team members must work together everyday in order to Complete each task on time."
good,"My department, the Locator Group's main purpose is to assist in locating a customers freight that has gone missing while in transit. We get the best physical description of what it looked like when  shipped, then distribute that to the service centers to help them know exactly what they are looking for. The hardest part of the job is when the customer wants an explanation of how this could happen and how long it will take to find it.  The best part is when it is found quickly (in the same day) and you can call the customer back and let them know it is found and they are pleased."
good,"Its a great union if you put your years into it. Unfortunately they were changing thr contract,  the hours were getting dramatically cut and i was low on the seniority totem pole."
good,okay job. just the same old loading/unloading boxes. also learned time management. overall this job was okay. would recommend to others if needed or asked to
good,"fast paced environment, heavy lifting, a lot of trucks to load, early hours, warehouse environment. Inventory. Great people to work with overall. Great atmosphere."
good,The seasons are UPS' most busiest days in the year. As a Seasonal Driver Helper it was my job to lighten the burden placed upon the Drivers. During the time I had learned how to perform my job at a quick and steady pace as well as build a sense of direction in order to locate houses and deliver all the packages quickly and efficiently.
good,"Very stressful job, but beneficial and humbling. A day at work contains a lot amounts of walking, lifting, yelling, climbing. You definitely break a sweat at this job."
good,"I was a seasonal driver. You get there at 5 am and the manager from each branch would gather the drivers for a quick morning briefing. After you would get to your truck and prep it for the day. Go out drive your route help anyone if you finish early, go home. Do it all again the next day."
good,"It was my first hob a lot of different experiences, but overall I’m happy that UPS was my first job beside it can’t get much harder. It taught me a lot!"
good,"It was a good experience and I learned from it."
good,It is a collaborative working environment. It can be very busy but it is still good. I drive for a long time and deliver packages. I have nice management. but hours are sometimes hard
good,"Always in good company no matter how tedious the work gets. Good pay rates, easy to move up. Good fun work environment, Management does what they can to ensure employees have information they need"
good,"Some days were more hectic than others, more often than not there would be an influx of boxes then none at all, every day was different, co-workers were friendly and helped each other to lift stress off their load, lots of moving around some days, fast paced yet relaxed."
good,UPS take much pride in providing service in a timely manner. UPS is a safe but yet fun place to work. Relationships are build that last a life time.:)
good,"•Capable independently using appropriate judgment. Well-equipped at identifying package markings and zip codes. •	Experience in package handling, Strong ability to receive directions and establish routine."
good,"My experience at ups is that everyone is willing to help you. I had some great people i work with back home. the hours are long but its is a great place to work. the hardest part of the job is just trying to learn new routes. i knew i could ask one of my co works and they can help me with figuring it out. the most enjoyable part of the job is delivering. i meet a lot of cool people and its cool how you for a good relationship with you're customers, that's my favorite part of the job. i have  learn a lot at UPS. i have leaned how to be a much better driver inside the package car and outside in my personal vehicle. i have learn lots of new ways to do my job as safe as possible. UPS takes safety very seriously and they keeps us up to date on new ways to be healthy and efficient not only on the job but off too. i would work for UPS again."
good,Being at UPS has teach me to become a very hard and dedicated employee. I would consider myself one of the most hardest workers there. If something needs to be done no challenge is to difficult.
good,This is a great company to work for. I have learned a great deal while being at UPS in the last 5 years. This company believes in constantly training people for more opportunities to grow company so you’re definitely set up for success.
good,It gets very hot in there during the summer and the only thing to cool us down would be fans that just blew around hot air. Inside the trucks could reach 125 degrees.
good,Customer Service is great and the hours are convenient and flexible. Gain responsibility with closing and opening the store. Key holder and mails sorter
good,althogh not at hard job it does require a lot of standing for long periods of time. this just job is also an incentive position so you definitly want to handle the product as fats as possible.
good,But it’s a job that’s not for everyone. Pays well for a part time job. Supervisors that I’ve worked under have all been down to earth. Gets really hot.
good,"Started at early around 4 am. Learned much about delivery and what it took to do so. Management was usually fare considering what their duties and responsibilities were to the company. The work place culture was one that ""Bled brown"". The hardest part of the job was being consistent with my work loads and delivery loads. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to join committees, i.e. employee relation committee and safety committee, to make sure my finances and living were stable"
good,"I worked here for a few months during the busy holiday season.  It was a good way to earn extra cash, but I did not get any benefits for this position."
good,I liked the quick pace. I liked that they had us doing little exercises before work. They are big on safety. They care for their employees. The Pay was great!
good,"UPS is a very good company to work for, except their promotion opportunities are rare compared to the number of employees."
good,"A Typical Day Was Showing Up and Meeting With Your Driver at a specific Location, After That Your Driver Will Give You Packages and You Deliver them to commercial and residential buildings Using An Scanner and Hand truck. This Job Taught Me How To Work In A Fast Paced Environment. Management Was Very Straight forward and Very Respectful. The Hardest Part of the job was the various weather changes but that is the part you have to adjust too especially with the equipment given. The Most Enjoyable Part Of The Job was really Meeting Different People and putting smiles on people faces along with getting the job done as well."
good,Quick paced so days usually fly by.  Relaxed dress code. 2 weeks paid vacation after a year 3 after 2. full benefits dental/medical even for part-time after the first year.
good,"Overall ups has it benefits, I wish that they allow part time worker the option to apply for more hours as they do for the union workers as well. The benefits are excellent and they have the Reimbursement program that they allow you to go back to school overall UPS is a great place to work and sometimes you don’t like their tactics but in the long run it’s a great opportunity."
good,This by no means is an easy job. It's tough hot and physically demanding. It is a  great way to get paid and get in shape at the same time.  I lost 30 pounds in 2 months
good,UPS is a great place to work.  There is a lot of opportunity for growth and development.  Management encourages working with others and giving feedback.
good,Still a new hire so I do not know the company well enough to write a proper review. From my experience so far is is a good company to work for but is extremely fast paced.
good,"It was a good job with great benefits, but working part time isnt enough money. Great co workers and supervisors, i would recomend it to anybody to work at UPS"
good,"New supervisor every 2-3 months. New training coach every 2 months. Not really ideal to work up a repor with upper management,but everyone is pretty good about treating employees."
good,"I worked as a package handler during the holiday season, which required loading and unloading tractor trailers all thru the night.  Along with heavy lifting, there are hand held computer operations and logistics involved."
good,Full benefits for part timers and a great atmosphere to work while in school or tending to other projects. m-f work schedule for part time and quarterly raises.
good,"I recommend a career at UPS , expect to work long hours ."
good,"I worked in a small hub in waldorf Md. One of the best jobs I had as far as my coworkers and boss. So when I speak about UPS I'm talking about this particular one. I'm sure all UPS's have their perks, but I really liked it there. If I didn't have to move, I will still be there."
good,had a fun expereince management was very nice and enjoyed the overall work as well as the knowledge i gained from this job. I also learned how to use a walkie and a gun to locate items and boxes throughout a big warehouse.
good,Decent part time job who also provided transportation for many employees. The only downside is sometimes you may get sent home early and the breaks are very short
good,Good job and Benifits management was cause of concern . Younger people with degrees believed they knew everything. Go in do the job and you’re fine. Great company for a whole.
good,"Fast pace, great people who come to work everyday. The hardest part of the job is when holiday season comes around, we get twice more the work load. But overall I like the job"
good,"normal warehouse experience. The work is physically demanding, management is good, one or two bad supervisors, and free snacks during the 15 min break time on wednesdays."
good,"Great job - working environment was excellent. Advanced throughout the entire tenure at this job. Traveled often, but no so much as to interfere with family"
good,"Very fast paced job. Good on the job training. I enjoyed the work, it kept me busy and allowed me to shed some of my winter weight. Union workers and management clashed a lot."
good,"Its your basic warehouse environment, nothing to fancy. There are different accounts to work in which is nice. The management is by far some of the best I have ever worked for and were very understanding when I decided to part ways with the door open if I were to ever return. If I lived closer this job would be ideal on an early shift."
good,Liked it a lot. Had an epileptic seizure and it prevented me from becoming a driver so I had to find a new job. If I could become a driver I'd return in a heartbeat
good,Its a great job It all depends on your interests.  It takes a of commitment and dedication. Hard work pays off and you get holidays.  Overall the people are very nice.
good,great job ver competitive graet work out job great employees great management great atmosphere never had a day I didn't like great pay just need to make sure u drink and eat right
good,The hardest part of my job is dealing with torn boxes which will slow up my production and load quality. Management at times are not working with common sense and continue to hire part-time supervisors that are not capable of given a helping hand. Most part-time supervisors leave the role as pre-loader mainly because they do not like loading the trucks and are lazy. Working with part-time supervisors that doesn't understand load quality and weren't good loaders make the job difficult at times.
good,"I love what I do at UPS. sometimes things can get stressful and Hot at time especially and the summer, I like and don't mind working hard for something I like or want."
good,"This was a great place to work, given it had higher wages and more hours I would still be happily employed there. The owner Tannweer Alam runs a very good establishment and should be commended for his efforts."
good,"Working with UPS has been an honour, all of my co workers, and supervisors are amazing. Very healthy and professional environment to work within. The Company is very efficient."
good,It was a very good job recommend it to those who  like to work out and also for those who like moving up in family ordinated company that has great benefits.
good,This was my first job and it was a great one! It was a bit difficult to balance school and work but I managed. Other employees were very friendly and helpful and we worked as a team. I had a bit of seniority as I was trusted to run the store alone on several occasions.
good,This place is a great place to a positive work environment. Management teams are more than willing to work with you to fit your individual needs within reason.
good,"enjoyed the fast pace and the co-worker. they often rewarded us with gifts for had word and no accidents. the management was great to work with, they also worked with us."
good,loaded and unloaded packages in a safe but fast paced manor. how to work under stress effective management was on top of things it busy seasons were the hardest part of the job but got done efficiently and the past paced environment
good,Working at UPS you came in on your bus put your things into the locker swiped your employee card and walked through the medical detectors. Once we get pass security we go to our work stations and began our day unloading trucks and maintaining a safe work environment as we worked to prevent injury.
good,"Enjoyed working for UPS, just had personal issues that prevented me from staying. This job is good for teens and grads, and seniors. I would recommend this to others"
good,"People are easy to get along with, management was understanding, good workout while you are working if you don't have much time for exercise. Overall great place to work and good people too."
good,"You don't get benefits as a part-timer until a year after your hire date. The job is very physical, as a primary member there are times where we even get flooded with packages. But in the end they pay for my college, offer pay, give us days off, so I believe for a part-time if you can handle it go for it. Other than that avoid it, I've seen people cycle out every week because they can't handle it. Oh, and we only have a 10 minute break."
good,"Work the hours you can work, get trained"
good,Ups is a great opp for advancement in company to make a career. I like hard work in warehouse settings it's great the shift is very convenient and you are constantly encouraged to move ahead in the company there two options so you get to decide what path you want to take.
good,"Fun and productive place to work. Job Work/Life Balance, team oriented, supervisor opportunities, workplace culture, adaptive, strong culture, historic."
good,good job part time work. the hours were good evenings. Hard work but I kept up with pace and I was the best performer on my team and shift. Rewarded
good,"It was a good part time job."
good,I loved this job and really wished I could have stayed on I just couldnt afford to I needed more money and more hours. This store is locted in upland an I would recommmend the is job to anyone
good,Enjoyed time here.  Managers and employees were very friendly and helpful.  Fast paced high energy position.  Alot was expected of you but proper training was supplied
good,"A typical day seems to last forever but it comes to an end pretty quick, you do not get any breaks unless you work doubles but if you are a hourly you get overtime after 5 hours. I learned many companies ship through UPS and it is a huge part of the postal service franchise. The hardest is getting used to hard labor, especially in either the winter or summer. I enjoy my coworkers company though. If you work hard they support you and you get opportunities others wouldn't. It is nice getting off at the end of the week."
good,This job got me through college. I really enjoyed working here even though the work was tough. The management could have been better and less unorganized.
good,The work day would always be fast-paced and exhausting. I would learn different ways that the UPS managed packages everyday. The most enjoyable part of the job would be being able to have a conversation with your coworkers while loading. Hardest part of the job would having to sort and throw steel up at the end of the day after loading all the normal packages in the trailers.
good,"ok place to work. Slow sometimes though. Good hrs. Good benefits "
good,"I'm a student so this job was a way for me to live off campus and still maintain decent time to work on school. The pay is decent, but it is the most physically demanding job I have ever worked. When I first started I was 180 and 15% body fat, and within 3 months I was 150 pounds and 10% body fat. It's a pro to me because I don't have to go to the gym on top of work and school. Management is questionable at times, and you have to be a hard worker. Lazy people leave really quickly. Workplace culture is competitive, you have to try to be better than other belts in the facility. The hardest part of the job is peak season, which is in between black friday and christmas, where we work 35+ hours a week, but get paid overtime for anything above 25 so that is a pro. The enjoyable part of the job is when your trucks are relatively light so you can just listen to music and have a chill day for once."
good,This was a great job. great people. management was great. fast pace. work outside in the hot and the cold weather. Learned different jobs out on the ramp.
good,"Solid overall company to work for. Union company. Work.life balance can be hard to manage, depends on position and immediate manager. Hires and promotes from within."
good,A good company to work for part time work if you are a college student looking to get edge with real experience. The job itself does have their flaws with not enough hours in the week.
good,There are no room for tears within this profession. Period. Hard work is expected daily. The work climate is extremely hectic and you must be prepared.
good,"Great pay, and benefits. Work is extremely tough but it does pay off in the end.  Don’t expect 40 hour work weeks. More like 50 to 60 hours a week.  Have weekends off."
good,"everything is great the staff is awesome and very understanding , they also makes sure everything goes smooth an correctly, they do their best to provide great service to others and also gets the job done. i love UPS ."
good,"Load packages as they come down sorting chutes, keep floor and area clear. Must move around quickly. The supervisors are very good at ups, they try to help new employees adjust to the work."
good,"Quick paced environment."
good,I work at ups they bring packages to people they load trucks and unload trucks they are in Greensboro nc it is a fun place to work it is part time as a loader and drivers helper
good,"I worked at UPS SCS (Supply Chain Solutions) not to be confused with UPS delivery (the Brown truck). UPS-SCS is a logistics based job where we would provide warehouse space and complete orders on behalf of the client. The job would include load and unload trucks, inventory, shipping/ receiving, cycle counts, and misc. things for the client. UPS SCS is a great place to work. They provide training and great benefits. The pay is in line with warehouse jobs in the DFW area. Great people to work with. Also includes tuition assistance."
good,"They teach you everything you need to know, very informative.  Learn something new everyday, it is not super high stress.  They work around your schedule.  District Manager is very friendly."
good,Ups works with its employees. They offer a lot of programs and benifits after a certain time period. Good workplace. The only bad thing about the sorter job is that you only get a 10 minute break.
good,"I worked at UPS for a couple months part time during the Christmas season and it taught me to pay attention in a fast paced environment.  When loading multiple trucks up with hundreds of boxes with only a short time to do so, you had to make sure you were loading the right box into the right truck while constantly running back and forth from the line to the trucks."
good,i enjoyed riding in a riding around in the truck picking up delivering packages to people front doors and it was a pretty great experience to enjoy i guess
good,"I worked as a driver's helper during the winter holiday season unloading a storage unit parked on the street NE. Minneapolis , distributing boxes to houses with a hand held Dias. The boss always checked on us and brought coffee along with donuts which was comforting and provided motivation."
good,"you have to be ready to wake up and lift things! Some packages are very very heavy, but if you are not lazy and willing to lift and walk around then this the job for you."
good,"UPS is a pretty big and busy place, the workers there were serous about their jobs but had fun while doing it. The work load was varying depending on the cargo the plains got but doable with the teamwork of our peers"
good,"Overall Great place to work with great people to work with. Flexible hours, but busy during holidays. Great part time job."
good,Basically just coming in and going to your station to either unload or sort packages.  Some days are really hard because we don't have enough employees to handle the volume.
good,"I had an overall experience here.  The only negative is there is not enough hours so I would not recommend this job to anyone that has bills to pay, it is for students or for a 2nd part time job."
good,"Hard working days, tiring, fast paced but keeps you on your toes and its  alot of excercise. The managers were great and very helpful. The hardest part was keeping up with all boxes while loading truck."
good,"A typical work day with UPS, was a fun and fast paced one. I worked as a drivers helper. I was able to get plenty of exercise due to all the constant walk that the job required."
good,it was a really fast paced place but was really fun and everyone there was really friendly at the place. Also the boss was really understand able with everyone there
good,I worked for UPS over summer as a preloader. Woke up early in the morning to load the trucks for the drivers. I only worked their for a few months but my time there was worth it.
good,"off loaded company vehicles at end of day onto belt to scan items traveling down belt for unloading onto outbound trailer."
good,"Track and monitor volume flow into trailers, dispatch yard drivers moving trailers and spotting new ones, doing lot inspections, monitoring driver hours"
good,UPS was not the ideal job for me but I can see why someone could like it. I did like the fast pace work environment and being able to travel. I was also always active.
good,I just want to upload my resume and find a job and not rate the places I worked before. It might be good for them but at the moment it does absolutely nothing to me
good,"do a turnover with morning dispatcher, learn E2K, microsoft, excel , the best part was that i would get along with everyone. the hardest part was i had to do more than what i had to"
good,"You Really work hard daily "
good,"There is always something to do there at UPS. It is a great company to work for and go to school. The company will even help pay a portion of your education, and the benefits are better than others."
good,"job is pretty easy and provides a great work out, but is extremely fast paced and runs on seniority; not hard to move up in the company and pay increases come with training for other departments."
good,good company and good benefits. Pay for management is low. I was offer area manager position but pay was way low than I expected. UPS offered good training and possibility for promotion if you had educational background. I did safety training and had safety meeting on a daily basis.
good,"The workplace I have pushes us to be the best and competitive person I can be. Because of this job, I have learned to be as productive as I can  be. Happy to be a part of productive minded peeps"
good,"My experience at ups was a great one . The human resource management was great ."
good,"Fast paced and stressful work enviroment. It felt like getting paid to work out which was cool. They didn't offer very many hours for my shift, so it was hard to afford the cost of daily life."
good,The job was quick paced and you worked as a team. I was a helper and greeted customers along with making sure they got their packages. Sometimes lunch was bought by supervisor
good,"Dealing with packages , weighing all types of mail coming and going , learning to deal with speed and consistency at a steady pace , being able to stand for long hours of the day ."
good,Great pay and always something to do. Keeps you busy and motivated. Suggest working here if you want to work out and get paid. Great benefits and perks through seniority.
good,"The Job is hard. Esp entry level (loaders and unloaders). If you can get past the first year, you have a lot of opportunity for growth. Even part time employees get full time level benefits for the cost of union dues. Pay raises every 6 months."
good,"UPS is a very good company that one must work very hard to move forward, but you will have the opportunity to do almost anything you want to do at UPS."
good,One thing about working at the UPS Teleservices contact center is that it was never predictable.  Their technology is constantly advancing with the times and they keep their employees well trained and prepared for any and all situations that come up.  My only reason for leaving company was because I became disenchanted with working in a call center environment.
good,"At UPS, you start from the bottom and work up. It's based on Seniority, not how good you are. It's a very, very, physically demanding job. No benefits till after one year, but they are currently amazing, though may be getting a cut in the near future."
good,Great working environment. Very friendly staff. Positive attitudes. There is always something to do when arriving at the workplace. Work will be non stop but there will be breaks when timing is available.

good,"Working at ups was actually very fun. For the most part. I enjoyed being there and learning the many different things ups has to offer. Unfortunately the management was really bad, us co-workers found it easier to work together and get the job done , rather than what management sometimes had us do. They always over think and make mistakes.  I enjoyed working there, management made me dislike showing up. Job was very easy and it was very easy to learn the several positions ups has to offer."

good,"It's a fast pace work place."
good,Even discounting the benefits package (which is good) the biggest perk I got out of working at UPS was the weight I lost. Almost 20 pounds my first month there. The work is physically demanding and the early morning schedule takes a bit of getting used to but it was a good place to work and the supervisors were tough but fair.
good,A quick pace working environment.lots of opportunity to move up and exceed and better yourself. Give you a chance to work with a good team and receive awards for your efforts.

good,Harsh climate at times but as long as you dress according to the weather you will be fine. Lots of hours and labor when you are a loader during the morning shift. Driver helper during holiday season is a lot of long nights due to heavy amounts of shipment. overall a great company to work for. Drivers are paid well and the benefits are pretty good.
good,"The job was great, although I was a temp for two years with no official hire in sight. They were on a hiring freeze the whole time I was there. Good people to work with though"

good,An rewarding seasonal job. Better if made a permanent job. Great work benefits and a welcoming atmosphere. Highly recommended. Rare for current workers to leave.
good,"The only thing that I learned from UPS is that hub I worked at was crazy most of the time. At different parts of the day, the door I would be working on would get cleared, and then I had to help out another person because they got backed up. It was intense, but I lost 30 lbs."
good,It was a great environment to work at. Great staff that helped with all questions i had and great way to learn fast pace. The one thing that was a little hard to get use to was the weather when it was cold out you still had to continue the same pace!

good,"A typical day at work included helping customers pack and ship items and stocking supplies. I learned a lot about retail work while at The UPS Store. Management here was very helpful and always made me enjoy going into work. However there wasn't much chance of advancement or pay raise. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was my colleagues they always helped out and also made work enjoyable. The hardest part would probably be the rude customers but you have those anywhere you go to work..just part of the job, Overall I would say I enjoyed my time working at The UPS Store."
good,"get some real heavy packages "
good,Very fast pace environment.  Great people/benefits. Would highly recommend working for this company. They are global so if you are willing to relocate the opportunities are endless.

good,"Had a good time working there, I was seasonal but was treated well. The pay was good and there were many opportunities to double shift for more hours."
good,this is not an easy job but it pays well. The hours i worked as a preloader were always early mornings so you have to be willing to work at 4 am or earlier.
good,UPS was a great opportunity. I learn what goes into making a high productive factory work. I would recommend anybody going to work at ups to be in excellent Shape.
good,"UPS is a fast paced company to work for, requiring you to stay fit and in shape at all times. The shifts are rigorous and not for the faint hearted. The ability to adapt and flex to stress, commands, organization, speed and integrity must be evident to work here. However, you meet a workforce who are all going through the same things that you are and the benefits are great if the worker is willing to stay dedicated and push through hard things."
good,Everyone was really nice. Sad that it was only seasonal. They did wonderful job on training me. And making feel like one of the team even if I was a seasonal help.

good,Great company to grow with . I enjoyed putting on my browns everyday. Great benifts. Opportunity to grow with the company is very high. Managers are better organized and care about employees
good,I enjoyed working here. My position was temporary but I would consider it again. I worked at the airport which I think is just  fun place to be. My manager had high standards but was totally fair. The work was fast-paced which kept it interesting.
good,Learned how to scan packages and load onto trailers. Very fast paced environment. 1 10 min break and they allow snacks and drinks as to keep your hydration and energy levels up. Hardest part was building the mental and physical stamina. Most enjoyable part was the short shifts (typically 5 hours) and getting paid to work out.
good,"This is a tough fast paced job but it feeds my family and makes me proud. If you plan to work here you must prepare yourself before work daily, drink water, eat good foods, and have plenty of sleep."
good,"I've only worked seasonally at UPS, after cyber Monday through the month of December and January. You make over 300 deliveries and most of the packages are over 35 pounds. There includes bonuses and a foot I the door once the position is over."
good,"For the most part my position was pretty easy. But during the peak season the co-workers are what made it bearable. Great people."
good,The job is hard and you have to keep yourself moving all the time but there always people ready to help once you become a permanent employee you have great benefits
good,"I wanted to stay, but I was mandated to quit and acquire my current employment. Advancement is available in management or other places, pay in creases quickly and tops out high enough. Overtime is usually available, and at the time, it was only a few hard hours a day and can be ideal if one is going to school or needing an extra pay check."
good,it was agood place to work but it was very fast and they didnt pay as well as they should have. other then that it is a really good place tyo work with good management.
good,"UPS was a pretty chill place to work. they were only bad about hours. then having to drive an hour to work was pretty bad, there near the end. but it was fun."
good,"My time at UPS was only seasonal, therefore I didn't get any health benefits and although the job paid minimum wage (less than what I made at my old job) they have a great bonus system for seasonal workers, when you start working with them in November you get a $500 bonus at the ender of your work period with them, after December, and a $200 weekly bonus, as long as you can work when called upon."
good,Por el tipo de empresa se disfruta mucho del trabajo entre monos de peluche y regalos.
good,"only worked part time, four hours a day after college, worked with class schedule, good experience, good training, culture was good, nice employees, management was good"
good,I would get a call to meet a driver and a pick up place in the city and I help the driver with the daily packages while performing safety practices of package delivery

good,"While working at ups I seen that everyone was dedicated, hardworking and mature. I seen the actions of my employees and I was determined to do great similar to them."
good,"As a driver helper, once you start working, the only person you will deal with is your driver. Drivers keep it simple and that was something i liked.."
good,I was just a Driver helper working for multiple drivers. It was decent job for the holiday season to get references. Especially fun when the job gets done and when you have a driver you like.
good,"I worked for UPS only as a seasonal Driver Helper years back. The work was good and I learned alot of the delivery process. If I could be a Driver for UPS, I would go back full-time"
good,"Worked in the load, then unload or small-sort as needed. I learned how to load 350 packages per hour with extreme accuracy, how to lift irregular items that were over a 100 lbs, and how to sort smalls with accuracy.  Workplace culture was fun, and met a lot of good people.  The hardest part of the job was the toll it took on your body.  Most enjoyable part of the job was the camaraderie and fun atmosphere, plus all the benefits they provided."
good,"I learned to do nearly everything a part-time loader can learn at UPS.  I started doing the unload in the most busy PD in the building.  From there, I would help with the unload, then the small sort as well.  Really, I went wherever needed.  The hardest part of the job was mainly that it was incredibly physical and you had to be really careful there not to get hurt.  The most enjoyable part was all the benefits."
good,"The job did have me running for hours, but i did get paid very well. I made about $500 in just one week of working their. It was a lot of work and a fast pace, but overall I enjoyed it."
good,This job was pretty cool.  my team was always in good spirits and helping one another.  You have to fast and accurate with the packages you scan to ensure all customers receive things in a timely fashion.  Fridays was the most difficult on the evening shift because we had mandatory overtime because night crew does not come in.
good,"A great place to work."
good,"Boxing and packing, shipping and recieving.  Very complex duties and completing multiple duties at one time, and meeting deadlines.  Culture is very diverse.  Hardest part of job was working alone and recieving and shipping heavy boxes and freight shipments."
good,"The hardest part about UPS was working 3rd shift. Its a great place to work if UPS pays for your college its a great benefit to have the people are very nice UPS is a fast past job and learning quickly will help you in the long run and the management is very good. On a typical work day you come in have a meeting with your crew, stretch and talk about the plan for the day once done you wait for a plane to come in then your crew will  unload and load back up the plane and wait for the plane to leave. You do the same routine all night and operate very big and dangerous equipment until all planes are done for the night."
good,"Being able to ride with a driver and hear about the company and how it is ran was very rewarding.  Learned a good deal about logistics and the whole business behind that.  Great pay, great hours.  Very enjoyable"

Outside in all elements of weather but job must still be done efficiently. Physically demanding but fun if you like being outside and constantly moving.

good,I was a Package Handler so i had to be active and handle the packages carefully. You learn to be more organized. The hardest part of the job was the shift which was from 2 am to 9 am.

good,a typical day for me working as a seasonal loader was pretty boring  the first week it was mainly school time and learning things but at the end of that week they had me loading trucks by myself and if there needed help the managers and counselers were always there to either help or assign a helper that isnt doing anything.  also helped recycle some packages and also unloaded sometimes.
good,"Work was mostly heavy lifting and transport, general labor sort of thing. Hardest part was getting to job sites for me which was only due to the lack of a car at the time."
good,UPS is a competitive employer that takes care of their employees. There is a lot of room for growth within this company and many different areas of advancement. UPS is also unionized and offers better benefits and pay to employees than similar positions in other companies.

good,Great environment to work. Good for part time employment and if you want to start off in a place that will give you an opportunity to go to school to advance your career options.
good,I really enjoy working as a UPS package handler it's very fast pace you get a great work out everyday you meet a lot amazing employees there its not just a regular job its like everybody family there id recommend this job to anyone.
good,"The day starts in a hurry, progresses to busy, and ends in a rush."
good,"the driver i worked wit hwas out at the Parks Mall in Arlington, it was a great place to work at with a company and driver that was fantastic, I wish that I had been able to stay on and go full time, it was hectic but it was the holidays, so it made sense to be, but even with ti being that way, there was a sense of ease in the work itself."
good,"- Excelente empresa em quase todos aspectos"
good,"This company is a fast-paced environment. There is a lot of movement, depending where one wants to take their career. Tons of benefits and great managers."
good,Enjoyed my time working at UPS Distribution Center.  All the Team Members work very supportive and helpful.  Targets were clearly communicated and measured.
good,"loaded and unloaded packages onto trucks while making sure they were placed in the right places. it was very hectic, if you are not strong, I wouldn't recommend this for sure"
good,"was very fast paced, working in cold and warm weather, the management could've been a little better. The most enjoyable part about ups was meeting new people throughout the day."
good,Noonday shift began with a pre sort meeting amongst fellow supervisors which then moved to a brief pre sort meeting with employees at your work station. Fast paced and team oriented work environment. High volume workload over a 4 hour shift. During my time there full time supervisors were a revolving door. Hardest part of the job was meeting production numbers while maintaining low misload frequency.
good,"Management was good at keeping track on the inventory or on work. Everything else was good like the workers and its a team oriented job so it worked out pretty well, i personally left the job because they had me working for 2 weeks worth of pay and it took long to get my check so i went to search for a better opportunity"
good,we all ate together///worked with each other....laughed and just had a good time and it made the jib more easy for everyone because everyone got alone great.
good,United parcel service would be a great place to work if that moved into the modern era with beliefs and practices for employees.  Lighten up on the shaving  rule and modify hiring policy.
good,Hard work for most people but it's really a easy job just have to be ready to work but I liked it take control to work with ups but good job to me I have a great time working for them
good,Everyday is slightly different as there is plenty to do. The staff and owner is great and always works with you on whatever you need. I enjoyed working here in high school and through college.
good,I enjoyed working their. But i work 10x harder than wat i get paid. People that work at ups are amazing but employees should be paid better.breaking our backs evryday is not worh 11$ hr
good,Load and unload trucks on a daily basis. Lifting over 50lbs repetitively. Takes focus to perform this job. Management is there to help you in any way needed.
good,"Would get a meeting place at a 10:30 would deliever close to 250 packages a day, one day we had 300 packages the week before Christmas. They didn't give me that much hours after Christmas but would still like to work their full time."
good,It was very fast paced although my time was short it was a cool job. I liked the community between everyone on the conveyor belt and I made some friends that were great guys. All good people.
good,"Its a good place to work. A little stressful at times, but thats what a lead does is deal with stress. As long as you got a good crew everything will go smooth."
good,My position was driver helper so I wasn't in the depot much but it was very fast paced and stressful during the holidays. The people were always nice and got free coffee in the mornings :)
good,"Quick pace, especially during holiday season. Did not get lunch breaks, were only given one 15 minute snack/smoke break per 8-9 hour shift. Co-workers were usually great, although some would sleep in trucks instead of doing duties once the line slowed down. Lots of heavy lifting, and are reprimanded for misloads."
good,"I loved the job, just wish the job was part time rather seasonal. i would work there again. i enjoyed working with my driver, we didn't clash. They should've kept me permanent."
good,Learned how to work hard and get a week's worth of work done in one day!  Great work culture that demanded 100% every day.  Taught me that a 10-hour day talking to doctors was not a bad way to earn a living.
good,UPS was a fast paced culture. Everything you worked on was timed due to the time the drivers start to come in. The early work hours took some time to get used to.
good,"Great work environment, the pay was decent and the hours were good for people that stay up late and need something to do with that free time, other then tat my only complaint was equipment going out and thatw as really nothing."
good,"A typical day at  work would be delivering and picking up packages to and from families home, businesses, and Ups stores. Hardest part of the job to me was getting to know people that I basically delivered to daily. Since I was new, a lot of people was skeptical of me because I was new and wasn't the regular guy delivering to them.  I learned all types of customer service skills on how to deal with people more because I dealt with many different people daily."
good,Took a  temporary job as a package handler during the holidays.  Very much enjoyed working at ups and would recommend the company to anyone looking for an interact level job in this field
good,Overall the job was great to bad it was only temporary I really wished I would have stayed the hourly wage is great it's a seasonal job so you won't get as much hours.
good,UPS is a nice place to work but the work is very hard. you have lift the boxes fast and make sure you do things right every time. the benefits are great but that and the pay do not make the work worth it until its years down the line.
good,"The situation I worked in this year was with a younger driver in a more densely settled route.  This year, I worked harder than I did last year, but it was a bit more rewarding due to increased pay and more hours.  Tougher weather required more preparation for safety such as more layers for warmth and cleats due to the ice and snow on the route.  While it's very fast-paced, it's accurately described as a marathon and NOT a race.  You must pace yourself or you will tire out more easily or cause yourself injury.  The best part of the job is getting the smiles from customers when they see you've delivered their packages.  You also gain a close professional relationship with the driver to create a cohesive working team which is required to be successful in the job.  The worst part of the job is when the weather is both very cold and wet.  However, it's at these times when the customers are most grateful for your service as these are the times when you most earn your pay.  $100 incentive pay for working all five weekdays Monday through Friday."
good,If you can handle moving packages that weigh at least 50 or more pounds at a time then you can pretty much handle most of the work. There is opportunity to advance pretty easily if you stay long enough for the long haul and the pay is descent for a fixed part time job as a loader or unloader.
good,"I loved working here..it was tough at first but after I got the hang it,  was great.  a learning experience to say the least .. my boss was funny as well, quite a joker. Christmas was crazy time to work"
good,It a great company to work for just a bit disorganized and lazy indidvual  who wants a paycheck but want to do they least amount of work.  individual with no college education are management and know nothing lol  its all who you know
good,Great pay. Great benefits and regular pay raises due to the Teamsters Union. You can earn 2 retirements. One by investing in a UPS retirement and the second retirement by investing in the UPS stock options.
good,It was a good experience. A typical day was going to the warehouse and meeting up with the driver you are assigned to work with then the two of you load up the truck before heading out to make the deliveries.
good,"United Parcel Service continues to overcome numerous obstacles in order to stay ahead of the competition by training and developing their employees. The corporation in many ways is comparable to the Arm Services in reference to structured, policies and procedures. Throughout my 18 years of service at United Parcel Service, I personally enjoyed the training and development I received while working within various departments throughout the corporation. The hours can be over whelming due the nature of the business which allows minimal work life balance. However, the corporation overall in regards to compensation, job experience and development would be ranked extremely high based off my personal opinion."
good,I was so young my typical day at ups so started at school days were long but ups was a great position with great people I did some packing and also loading
good,"Very fast placed, but to where you could keep up. I loved work place environment  . will do it again for a real job.I learned a lot of new stuff during the internship."
good,I loved the fast paced work environment. The staff was cooperative as well as the managers. The hours were great. The pay was great as well with great perks.
good,"I worked as a driver-helper during the holiday season."
good,"A typical day would be unloading 5 trailers by yourself while maintaining a steady paste of 1,200 boxes per hour, heavy or not. The supervisor was pretty helpful but regardless the work was still hard. I can't complain because i signed up for it."
good,be prepared to give it all in a full day for Ups... drivers helpers in my opinion are not compensated nearly enough for work.. battle with the elements and constantly climbing on and off truck will wreak havoc on your knees.
good,"offers great advancement if taking advantage of internal programs, a wide variety of career options and chains to follow to become successful personally and professionally"
good,Collaborative team effort toward progression. Good benefits and opportunities of advancement. Friendly environment with team members focused on success.
good,"One of the best packaging companies on the market.with an on time delivery guarantee. most employees love the job and what it entails  after being there for an while, you take pride in the job."
good,"The workplace was loud, but that is to be expected in a warehouse. The managers where fair. I took on a bunch of extra responsibilities. I was looked for for the answers."
good,"It kept me busy and being that I'm very hands on, I love working with UPS. It satisfied me to satisfy the customers. Working with UPS teaches an individual integrity and helps them build character."
good,"Great environment to work in, people are helpful and happy to assist, there is a strong emphasis on community outreach and support, the wages are fair and the opportunity for advancement is high."
good,"I only worked here during christmas seasonal while in highschool so i don't have much on this subject, but the the time i worked with UPS was average. hard work and tiring, but rewarding in the end."
good,"haven't worked here in 10 plus years"
good,"Ups is a nice place to work and advance in that industry, also for college kids looking to make some money while going to school for an education that they also help you pay for"
good,loading packages can be hard when doing three trucks daily. sort the packages to correct belts isnt as hard but can be intense. ive learned alot from one position to another.
good,"daily schedule of flights to load and unload. "
good,"UPS is a friendly workplace. They are flexible with the time range that they have for you to work. The work is strenuous and you have to make sure you are in great shape. Management was great and they are understandable, they would love to see everyone prosper in their career."
good,"A regular work day at ups could be a little stressful but what's you get into a rhythm it isn't that hard "
good,A normal day was taking packages to different locations. I learned many things from the customers of UPS when i would come in contact with them. hardest part was the late hours on holidays
good,"Unorganized , Tiring, Bad Management , Short Pay & Its Seasonal that's all I have to say & Im looking Forward To Finding Something Else But it's Been A Helpful Experince"
good,"Fast paced and productive I fairly enjoyed this job but it is not a job where you can just goof and do whatever, it is a job of deication and being on time."
good,it was a fast pace working environment. you had to be quick in ur feet and mentally stay focused on what you’re loading into the trucks. sometimes it can be really stressful and overwhelming
good,"Efficient company with long hours, lots of deliveries, professional networking opportunities, driving long hours, great job security & develop skills on efficiency."
good,"it was a fast pasting job, great pay. You meet a lot of people and make there days when you give them the packages they been waiting for. Don't be slow at all."
good,"Very quick pace during holidays, the pay is average and could offer more. some team members are very easy going   some are not as friendly. As with any job you have a lot of compainers"
good,Overall ups has been good for me but I can see it not being the kind of job for others. It’s fast paced and physically demanding but once you get used to it it’s like getting paid to go to there gym.
good,"Great Company, always challenging & fast-paced, Global presence with diverse workforce. Large company offering different areas of expertise with ability to apply globally."
good,"just needed more hours to provide for my family, the hours wre very limited and with those type of hours that I was receiving they just was not cutting it for me."
good,The work load is tedious but it is a good workout. The environment is fast paced and it is sometimes overwhelming depending on which department you work in.
good,"UPS warehouse associate is not what I would call a desirable job. Benefits are good but the hours are not, typical start time is 3 am. I would recommend UPS to a morning person who would like to become a UPS driver."
good,good trucks lastest models very busy there freindly staff company is very organize there just for the season butt would like to continue working there
good,"Seasonal truck loader. Took awhile to get into the hang of things. Sometimes you have soooooo much to get put on a truck, you almost give up trying but it all fits."
good,Fast paced work keeps you physically and mentally fit. Must follow stick guidelines for delivery and be aware of traffic and changing weather conditions.
good,It was a very intense and fast paced job. When one is barely starting off there quitting will seem like such a great option but just get through the first week and it will all be worth it.
good,I would recommend this job to others.There is opportunity to grow. They have a great tuition reinbursement program. The work is strenuous and fast paced.
good,Great work environment. as a prior Operations Support Supervisor my role was a temp position for 12 months. I would consider a similar role within this company....

good,"I enjoy working for UPS Brokerage, it has become more relaxed over the years.  Management works with you to provide work/life balance as well as making sure you know the ins and outs of your job.  It's a fun environment and I would recommend UPS to anyone."
good,was  a temporary position   part time       fast  paced      lots  of advancement ..    but  position was  part time work for extra pay   and  while  attending  school
good,Great workplace organized steady work flow. Great company. Greatest art of the job is the flexible schedules. Supervisor were very helpful and always was available for any questions may need answering.
good,UPS was an easy job but also fast pasted job. The employees was friendly and also helpful. I think if anyone that looking for a warehouse job should go get employed at UPS.
good,"Our weeks were usually managed by the store manager and I due to the old owner having MS and not being able to make it every day, unless it was on a necessary occasion. Other than that, we would ship packages for multiple customers on a daily basis, package items, sell office supplies, do USPS services, etc. We would have mailboxes for customers with Personal or business purposes and I mainly managed that part, distributed the mail and logged in packages that could not fit in their boxes. Building and maintaining relationships with customers was always a pleasure to experience. The hardest part would be when something outside of the manager's control happens and would take a few days for the owner to come solve the issue. Thus, customers with issues would turn to us, since we're at front and get all the anger they released. We still kept calm and our posture, the problem was not being able to do anything to help the customer."
good,A typical work day at ups was mostly light hearted jokes and smiles. It is not an easy job but with the help of your teammates the job was sure to go by fast.
good,i would work here again. i just started to young and it would of taken to long to make advancements. the pay was to low for how long i would have to earn it
good,A typical day is loading and unloading packages. There is wonderful team support in most tasks. The holiday season is the most difficult become a already fact pace is increased even more

good,Good company to work for the long haul. Would recommend to those that like a fast paced work environment. Had to leave after many years of employment with company.
good,"great company to work for. pays great, the job is simple but fast pace. Not for everyone. Need to keep a positive outlook while working there. The heat in the warehouse is the worst part."
good,"Hectic pace around the holidays. Typical warehouse job, heavy box lifting and stacking."
good,"Had a very good time working at UPS. Very fast paced work, almost a 4-7 hour power lifting session every morning, like a free gym membership. I enjoyed myself"
good,The job was seasonal and because of my location the hours were not what I expected. For the month I worked there I was only called to work 4 days. This was a disappointment.
good,Very fast pace woke environment. Great place to get promoted and different places. Easy to learn great exercises unless you a driver wich is one of the hire paid positions
good,"It is a good job for me although I would appreciate a better pay, because of personal life dealing with school, travel etc, it has become inconvenient for me. My manager was really cool as well as my co-workers. The work was pretty fast-paced, but fun for me because I enjoy pushing myself, and a good workout."

good,"Productive and Fun place to work with and grow within, got a real idea about how finance work and insurance sector grows. The best thing was the ability to adapt and learn."
good,The Night life as I called it. I've Learn alot about ground operations as a Lead Guider. Managers were very Nice and they help you deliver on your job. The hardest part of the job was working in the Rain and wind. I enjoyed my coworkers.
good,"The shift I had was early am and it was really enjoyable. It gave me the whole day to get things done at home or even run errands and even pursue my hobbies. The shifts I took would be ideal for students who are looking for a part time jobs that offers enough time for both study and play. And UPS pays for college! With included health benefits after a year. Really great if you manage to stick it out.UPS also rewards you for being willing to advance through the ranks really quickly, which is a plus. The overall experience depends on your mental attitude and crew."
good,Lack of workers but the pay rate was very good. The supervisors were very disrespectful to there most hard workers. The jobs are some what easy but when no one shows up to work but you it’s very difficult to work.
good,"faatpaced job,gave great benfits,has v arious postions that you can move up to.a standout work place and having experince there stands out on a resume."
good,Meet with the team members for a exercise and begin the work. Work is normally 3 and a half hours. Workers come inside the trailer to help out if the task becomes stressful. Hardest part of the job is understanding how each trailer can be different.

good,"I make it fun for myself, and I do the same job everyday but there is something new that happens everyday regardless of what goes on in the day. I talk to my employees they would like to be spoken to at any given time."
good,Great Company to work with- more opportunities need to be provided for full time positions. The system needs to embrace over achieving employees and promote more so on the premise of merit and performance rather than seniority.
good,"This is the place for you. I love working at UPS. If you have young kids that are dependent on you, it may not be the best place. You want hours? You’ve got em!"

I have learned a lot about retention/converting customers and the importance of utilizing KPI's to meet my business objectives.  Management is very supportive towards employees.

Most enjoyable part of this job is building comprehensive proposals/presentation to show how our company can increase sales revenue for many different businesses and negotiating complex sales to convert customers from our competitors.

If you don't mind long hours with the same person, or walking up many driveways, this is a fun job where you can make good connections."
good,"UPS is a very challenging work environment with a lot of opportunities. I was in charge of making sure that document for international shipment packages were done accordingly based on regulations, and I was also in charge of hazmat auditing. By managing this department, I learn that nothing can not be accomplished without team work."
good,It was a good job.  I would still be there if I did'nt get a machining opportunity.  I learned to operate all material handling equipment there also.  I would recommend this job.
good,"On a typical workday I would meet up with my driver near our route. We would spend roughly 6 or 7 hours delivering packages together. Then at the end of the day I'd be dropped back at my car and we'd fill out my paperwork for the day. I'd usually end up spending the day having great conversations with the driver, which is easily the best part of the job.

good,"Very competitive and quick pace. The pay and benefits was great to be a part time job, and the supervisor's was very helpful and always accessible to be reached if needed."
good,Well basacally i had a partime job worked from 12 am to 6 or 7 in the morning its a fast paced work place to work you have different thungs you can do from sorting boxes or putting labels job its so busy that you dont even feel when hours pass by i would really recomend ups to a friend because it can give you better oportunity for the future
good,"The package handler is a steady but very demanding job in a fast pace warehouse environment, you will be lifting and pushing heavy packages for 5 hours. It can seem overwhelming at times but the supervisors and managers are pretty good at helping you if needed , mostly because they cannot afford to be late loading the trucks for delivery."
good,"Good job if your a student, good beinifets, not many hours, takes about 4 years now to hit top rate, management can be unreasonable, safety is a priority untill things are running late"
good,"Exceptional pay for job qualifications, Long days that may interfere with life outside of work, expect to make adjustments based around your job.  Benefits are exceptional based on sub contracts"
good,I enjoyed working in this company with great leaders and collegues. Still I am in professional and personal contact with many of people who are good friends of mine.
good,I worked in the distribution warehouse for UPS and loved every second of it. It was over hot in the summer and clod in the winter but it kept me constanyly busy. Made the days go by fast. Heavy work. Stay on your toes.
good,"Loved working at UPS. It almost felt like a brotherhood. I enjoyed my time there and if you are looking for work but have not completed your High School diploma, but carry a driver's license then their are seasonal driving positions that are temp to perm depending on ur performance during the peak season."
good,"In a nutshell, if you're looking for a place to stay for a few years and attend school, or go for something bigger in a management role (whether it be with UPS management or another company), it's a solid job. Even though it's labeled as ""Part Time"" you're eligible for full benefits, 401k and quite decent pay. However, If you plan on working for UPS for the long run and wish to make it a career, do not take the position."
good,"People are friendly and accomodating, low ranking and high ranking individuals. Pays well and a lot of room for advancement. Stable and top 10 compnies."
good,"Viaggio roma rieti  rieti roma"
good,This job is a pretty easy going and well paid part time job. Although if you prove yourself and show your hard working attitude you can move through the ranks and get a Full Time job. What you put in is definitely what you get out with this company.
good,"the company is great. i was unable to fit a regular warehouse sechdule into my own but hey, everyone has their nich. some people run at their own pace, some people would rather fly but hey, im just thinking wishfully."
good,Great place to learn new skills. Great hours so its perfect for flexability. Its a good company to grow in if you want see yourself progress at your job.
good,Kelly Services was a productive and fun workplace. At UPS it was times that you work fast and work slow. Depending on how fast the trunks come in. The moving of the boxes was maybe the hardest part.
good,"Good place to work good benefits good people good pay "
good,The best place I ever worked .They are 100 percent meritocracy. This makes for a vey completive but fun place to work. The management team is the best of the best
good,Overall it was a good experience. I would recommend it to anyone that. likes working outside. Very laid back environment. Loved being out and about and constantly on the move.
good,Fast paced and very cut throat. have to know your stuff and stick to it no matter what happens or comes your way. problem solving skills is a must. Great benefits.
good,Really good place to work. Good people and a fast paced place to work. Ups looked after they're staff well. I enjoyed my time there and wish i never left there to work somewhere else.
good,"Ups offers tuition reimbursement as soon as you're hired, one week of vacation and health insurance is given after being with the company for one year. But if you do not use the benefits then don't work at ups because of the hard work."
good,"Maximum production in the shortest tie possible as safe as possible. This job is extremely fast paced with varying start and end times each day. I have learned while at this job that it is not for everyone. A typical day would be loading 2 or 3 trucks and maintaining 350 boxes scanned an hour. "
good,Its a fast paced job. very phsyical and demanding job. Great benefits and will get you in shape. Good part time job and work out. Learn about hazardous and non hazardous packages.
good,I liked the job it was a learning experience but I was kind of hard but it was a team work place and I liked that a lot the people there was very nice. I made new friends and everything.
good,"I was promised advancement after I graduated. I have waited almost a year, and no further opportunities to advance within the company have risen. I have chosen to look for alternatives."
good,Ups was a great company to work with. Great benefits. The only thing i didnt like about ups is the lack of hours. 3 to 4 hours a night wasnt enough for me. But the management when i was there was amazing. Very kind and helpful.
good,"It was a great job that dealt with something new everyday, I have learnt so much from this job. To be able to smile and be confident infant of your customers, greeting and helping the customer with what they came in for. "
good,"This is a good place to work. Be prepared to work vert hard and diligently. This is not an easy place to work. If you are loading and unloading, it will be hard."
good,I enjoyed working there because it kept me busy. The work was pretty simple and i got along well with others there. I never had any problems working at ups
good,"I liked that you could choose different shifts to work around your school or other work schedule."
good,If you are a member of the union this is one of the best companies to work for. However if you are in management it is dog eat dog and very stressful. Do not plan on having any family time
good,I enjoyed working for this company. Fun work place and the staff is great to work with. The hours was good. The pay was okay. It was a temp position but I would work for the company again if I had the chance
good,Always on the go.  I worked there during the holidays and everyone had to be on point.  A lot of heavy lifting but this was expected.  Collaboration was important.
good,"working for UPS was fun to me, delivering mail and presents to our customers made you feel satisfied."
good,"cool people but very fast pace, just deliver the package to the door and get going. simple as that, people were nice to interact with, most of the time"
good,"Company provides benefits which is a plus however if driving history is not stellar , the company limits growth. The hardest part of the job is the strenuous activities especially in  holiday season."
good,Loading and uploading cargo and package goods on and off trucks as well as airliners  Make sure that all documents for each package and cargo is correct.
good,"It was for the most part a good place to work. At times it was hard when people called in, and you had to work double shifts. Keeping the people  up dated with the rates that changed all the time. The most enjoyable part of the job was at Xmas time when the kids got their package from grandma on time."
good,"It was a neat place to work. Very fast pace .(For larger businesses such as MN Transit and other motor companies) Please do not come with more than 2 people per hour, as there are two other finger printing services that have scheduled appointments and take priority"
good,"Easy to get into the flow and almost too easy to get too comfortable when wanting to find a more professional and serious career-driven job. However, it is easy to move up (based solely on seniority)"
good,Unions should never die! It is the saving grace of this company. Be prepared to work hard but you can't deny the benefits. If your driving or loading it's hard work and long hours but worth it to be taken care of.
good,It's a very good company to work for the bosses are very understanding  the work is not that bad it just gets hot or cold the supervisors are very cautious about your health and being able to work
good,Working in this fast paced corporate environment was a welcomed challenge. I enjoyed the physical nature of the work and interacting with a range of different employees.
good,I am a very hard working energetic an reliable worker open minded an good with working with others trustworthy an always on time an ready to work with no problems.
good,Good company with possiblities for advancement. It is a physical job which can be demanding at times. But the benefits are great and there is opportunity for advancement
good,"Ups had good benefits, a good work schedule, and good people. I love the people and how they acted on certain days . I definitely  loved  the woman who was the hiring manager. Ups was a good job ."
good,"UPS offers great benefits and if you stay long enough a decent hourly rate.  There are not a lot of available hours for most hourly positions so in the end your take home is not much.  Most positions involve heavy labor and depending on your location, you will most likely be working in the hot and/or cold."
good,The short time I have been here it is the freight business. I think as in all jobs this place could use improvements. Management needs to improve local freight coming in on time to meet the outbound commitments
good,Work is hard but fair. pay is low in management and should be looked at to be competitive with hourly employees. all in all it is a good place to work.
good,I gain so much experience from that short term before getting laid off. It was as a personal gym to the worker who picked up and arrange a box with in a Truck or outside.
good,"My work day consisted of  keeping a fast work pace, paying attention to detail from beginning to end. The job requires discipline as far as keeping yourself motivated. I did enjoy that everyday was different , no time to get bored. The hardest part was working in AZ heat."
good,I would come into work and load/unload packages off and on semi trucks. The hardest part of the job was the constant heavy lifting. I enjoyed working there because I worked with a lot of friends i grew up with
good,Only get 3 hours a day. Work 5 days a week. Sometimes get sent home early depending on the amount of work. Working on the back of a truck inside of a warehouse when its 90's outside is not comftorable. Especially with no fans.
good,"Es una empresa en la cual me senti muy contento, pero era necesario un crecimiento laboral."
good,"UPS overall pays well and has been around for quite a while. The culture is very Union vs Management. There really wouldn't be a typical day at UPS as many different things can change how the days goes, but that is also part of what makes it energizing."
good,"pretty simple"
good,Easy and short days. I only worked part time. Some down time when waiting for paperwork is being uploaded. Very rare heavy lifting but everyone is willing to help when you need it.
good,"Always need to be on your toes.  Quick paced and physically demanding. The ability to rationalize and think quickly is a priority, Safe work methods are key."
good,I learned how to keep a good pace and not tire myself out too quickly. The job required me to stay on my toes and always pay attention. The one downside was the problems I was having with my feet while running packages. I would have preferred to continue working for UPS if my physical 'injuries' didn't keep me from working with my driver.
good,United Parcel Service has a very fast paced work environment. The work is hard but the company takes care of its people very well with pay and benefits.
good,"UPS is good job/ career to start if you enjoy warehousing. My only problem is that, when it comes down to summer heat, the management believes their employees can stand working in the heat with one less worker on the shift, over working the others (to near heat strokes). But other than that, the diversity in race and background is positive towards each other. The benefits are worth working for."
good,Awesome place to work keeps busy all the time. Very friendly people to work with. Awesome customers and employees to be around. Great environment all the way around.
good,"Job requires physical labor, standing, lifting, moving. Work environment was pretty relaxed considering how physically demanding the job was. Overnight shifts can be difficult."
good,A great way to work out and get paid at the same time. Really wished there was more help because it could really be overwhelming at times. Met some good people there.
good,"I enjoyed management, and it made me happy to know that I would be welcomed back anytime. Great energy from co-workers and upper management. It gave me the strong work ethic I have now."
good,"UPS is a good company to work for, most of the work is part-time. There is extra work if requested. Supervisors and Managers worked well together. Management was supportive of supervisors."
good,"I was employed at The UPS Store, which is not UPS.  I enjoyed working there part time while attending the local university.  My boss was the owner, and he was great to work with!"
good,"Continuous lifting and lowering of packages"
good,Worked through the holidays while looking for a full-time position. While working here the workplace culture was great because all employees showed a willingness to coach and teach you things about the job.
good,"Stressful, exciting, fast working, time structured. I enjoyed a lot of days with friends at UPS and day are not enjoyable love the work and payroll. Some of the managers are not the greatest and some are easy to work and get a long with."
good,"Management is great, made advances in my first month with the company. Having to work with the union can sometimes be a pain but it goes with the job."
good,Wonderful environment and they treat there employees fair. I like the on the truck part of the position of a package handler because it gives you a better sense of feeling what it feels like to be a UPS driver.
good,This place  requires you to work hard and also put it in the time to make sure their standards are met. The hours a UPS can fluctuate and the people can be lazy.
good,UPS is a great place to work however the pay and location do not match up to the distance I had to drive.  The management was great and the benefits were great however did not have any benefits for my future goals.
good,"Typical day at work is scanning packages,loading and unloading truck and sorting out packages to go to there designated locations!!!great team-work environment..lots of laughs and pretty much everyone was there to do their jobs productivly!!"
good,Good company to begin a career and start you professional work experience.  The work life balance is fine and it is very hard work but it is rewarding.  The days can be high stressful but the work builds character.
good,"Long hours but good income, job requires skillful driving, a strong back and steady legs. UPS and FED-EX National were grate opportunities to grow and hone skills both in driving and customer relationships."
good,The working conditions weren't the best but the people  I worked with were nice and caring. The management team was also helpful and worked to fix any problems we had.
good,"I worked part time as a pre-loader at UPS. It was a very physically demanding position, but the compensation was fair, and the hours were not so bad. UPS has a lot of union benefits and perks once you have worked there for a while, so it is a great place to start a career. I thought sometimes that the management was a little disorganized. They do promote from within and advance people quickly, so it made sense to me that sometimes management was just as new to a position as the people they were supervising. Overall good experience."
good,Sales associate at UPS store was a very relaxed job. Packed and shipped boxes on a daily basis and also did printing services. Also did photo editing and typing. The job was very easy.
good,"If you are willing to sweat and build muscle this is the job for you."
good,Great company to work for if u can deal with hard work .great place to work if your trying to build your career and a better future for yourself and your family
good,A typical day at work is energetic and empowering by helping others. Required heavy lifting not over 50 pounds unless advised. Directions needed too..
good,great company you just have to work hard. One of the more rewarding jobs out there in terms of benefits. As a package handler you will work hard but honestly the first week is the hardest after that its literally like riding a bike. One of the best jobs around
good,"First few months were hard work, but when you get to know the system it gets easier."
good,"This is a good job overall, fun and friendly people in a fast pace environment. With some adjustments in the pay and benefits this would be an awesome place to work."
good,"it was a good place to work, it was easy to learn the daily operations. the only thing that sucks was we were on call for about 3 months so had to find another job."
good,My shift is routine with the exclusion of the different people and  personalities that i encounter each day. The management team is very typical. There are managers who are great and there are mangers who suck. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the members of the management team that make unnecessary decisions. The most enjoyable is working with my co-workers.
good,"Very loud and busy environment with a very fast paced approach to working. Getting a 15 minute break on a part time job seemed generous, and all the management was nice."
good,"Sorting items by hand into compartments on a sorting frame"
good,"UPS is very process and procedure based to ensure the safety of the people, the equipment and the customer. Audits and quality assurance are continual throughout every aspect within the company."
good,This is a good company to work for with good compensation. I worked as a driver part-time and maintenance tech on fleet. Your movement in the company is based seniority. Management can be unfair at times but the union rep is there to work on your behalf. The environment is fast paced but people pull together to help one another.
good,"Very fast paced and energetic, organized and detail oriented, you learn so much about maps and packages work at a fast yet steady pace to ensure satisfaction."
good,unfortunately the facility manager that was there during the time I was employed there was rude and hateful to all employees and made days at work miserable.
good,Awesome company to work for. The people and benefits are awesome. Awesome relocating options. Great company to retire from. Growth potential is great.
good,This is a good position for someone looking to join a team and work hard while learning good skills.  I have enjoyed my time working here and it has been one of the best positions.
good,Time Study Supervisor - ensuring that the time allocated for each delivery stop is calculated fairly and accurately. Manually riding with drivers to review anomilies
good,"I really enjoyed my time there. It's fast paced, and can be great depending on your coworkers. It's also very easy to pick up on if you can handle basic computer software."
good,UPS is a good place to work. People are nice and great place to find friends. I like that UPS is a community helper. I would recommend it to anyone who like customer service jobs.
good,I worked a ups for 2 and a half years. my job title was a truck loader. it was fun because I never worked a job in a wharehouse before. I learned a lot.
good,A typical day involves about 3 to 4 hours of physical excursion. It's not too difficult once you've adjusted. The hardest part would be keeping your frustration low when there is an overflow of packages. The most enjoyable would be how active the job keeps you.
good,Loading and unloading trucks your entire shift. Working more hours during the holiday seasons but you get weekends off. Job pays every week which is a big plus.
good,Franchise Owned and it felt more like a family than just a job. We all worked hard for each other. The owners treated us more than fair and everyone was a pleasure to work with.The people! My coworkers made this job worthwhile Consistent hours Paid every week
good,They treat you well. A lot of great benefits. Work area is enjoyable. Employees are great partners. Management is very caring about you. I will recommend a lot of my own family to this job but I will tell you it's not easy.
good,Great Company. Lots of Interesting people. Enjoyed working there. They always have appreciate days for their Drivers and Helpers. They cater food or they cook the food and show appreciation for all the hard work.
good,"easy going job for during the winter time, the hours are flexible in that I worked in the afternoons after class. You essentially are just taking packages from the driver of the UPS car into businesses which is self explanatory."
good,"A good job, if you're looking for extra money or career.  I work part-time with full benefits. Great way to stay fit lol. Will recommend a job here."
good,"Flexible hours, good benefits, ok work environment. Not for older people.  Good part time job for kids right of high school that don't know what they want to do."
good,UPS is a great company with ample opportunities for advancement. A growing list of benefits along with a guaranteed job as long as you follow simple guidelines. Management is a weak point in my opinion due to promotions being so rapid which yields under trained and unprepared supervisors.
good,"part time package handlers work in a fast paced environment. package volume varies day to day. organization a must. very physical work, lifting constantly."
good,Many people take this job for the benefits and it is worth it for them. The overnight hours may suck but the shift isn't too long. You are constantly moving the whole shift and often may be tired but your whole day is still ahead of you.
good,The job requires a lot of physical work. It can be rewarding if you are willing to put in the years necessary to move up in the company. There are great opportunities to develop great work relationships.
good,It was really interesting to see things from an employee's perspective and I appreciate the hard work that they do each day. I worked with several drivers during the holiday season and  I learned something from each of them.
good,"This was a job you would want to keep, although management was not that great. Seems the closer you got to your yer of working there to get benefits, they less hours they worked you and so fourth. There would be times i would make my 25 min drive and they wouldn't even need me or work me. I do believe this gave me the basic of the job field I wanted to be in and for that I loved it."
good,The day to day work was pretty much the same everyday and it was a fast pace and physical job most of the managers were not to kind and co-operative  but  other than that it wasn't bad at all
good,"no complaints, seasonal position. all the management was kind, and ver professional. learning my position was easy and self explanatory. There were also refreshments on holidays."
good,"Good pay for a part time position, difficult to become full time, hours are early in the morning with start times as early as 3am. Would be a good job for someone attempting to become a full time driver for ups."
good,"Fun job to work at if you like working with other people who also likes to work. Have to stay focus on the job, so packages wont end up in the wrong truck,"
good,I loved my job ever simple and nice people just not enough hours all you had to do was basically unload trucks not mch thinking required anyone could do it
good,"What I learn about becoming a driver helper for ups is coming in to work with a positive attitude, have your uniform clean and neat, & always work in a fast pace."
good,Uma grande empresa que da oportunidades de crescimento interno.
good,Very fast paced and fun.  I learned just how to follow safety rules on the road from being on the truck.  The 3 points of contact.  Management wasn't all to bad because during driver helper I didn't always have a manager watching me and the driver's back.  The culture was fine.  The hardest part of the job was when the volume of packages increased and when some of the boxes were very heavy to lift.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the season this position took place in.  The holidays season.
good,Working at UPS Freight was definitely demanding labor. lifting wrapping and packaging various sized materials while documenting all materials handled.
good,"The company as a whole is a great place to work for with a bright future, however you will be a slave to your work and not be able to have anything else besides UPS Monday - Friday."
good,I really enjoyed the challenge of my position and the co-workers I had the great fortune to work with with and for. The negative was there is very little training for new hires or transitioning employees. You have to learn on the job and management is very secretive and closed off about company changes that affect employee work /home life. Overall a very good place to work.
good,"They provide a very extensive training program for all sale associates, covering all product and technology solutions. I provide tech support to my customers and make sure that I understand their business needs as well as proper align business solutions. I cover a region that consist of N.Y. and N.J. with a customer base of over 8,000 clients.  Continued support is always available and continued education on product training. It can be a relaxed worked environment. It offers great opportunity and professional goal resources."
good,UPS package handler I work for delivery and was responsible for packing items so they can be delivered safely.I learned safe work skills that has help me on and off the job.
good,"Great job! Gets busy so you are always occupied, time fly's by and co workers always help you out. The hardest part of the job is when you over full with boxes."
good,there was always work to be done and very little slow down periods. I worked preload so maybe its different on other shifts. For the most part there was always something to do.
good,This job is okay if you are looking for part time employment to fill the gap if needing additional income.  Takes too long to get promoted as a part time employee.
good,You just send out peoples packages and pack if they didnt have it in a box. learned about customer service and how to deal with customers face to face. management was good.
good,Great company for benefits and pay - Need to focus more on employee culture and making sure happiness exists amongst employees - Focus on taletnt and cultural improvement.
good,UPS offers great benefits. Depending on what time you work you will have to deal with different types of stress. Great job if you are going to school.
good,"I was only working seasonal, but the time I spent there was worth the short window. Enjoyable employees and managers were understanding of my artist lifestyle. Good for a part-time supplemental job."
good,"UPS is a great company, but can be unorganized down through each HUB. Communication about career paths/expectations not managed well. Pay is extremely low for supervisors managing a team of people ($14-15/hr). UPS doesn't seem to want to pay for good people, and the turnover at the warehouse level reflects this. With 10 years warehouse experience that wasn't calculated at all in my compensation, you start at ground zero as a new person at UPS regardless of your resume."
good,"Great place to work.  Management supports the employees and give them to opportunity to grow and move up in the organization. During my internship with UPS, I have learned on how to manage projects from the early stage until it is executed and controlled."
good,"You sweat a lot, get a great workout, but do not bring home a big paycheck. Benefits are fantastic, and the metro college program pays full tuition at University of Louisville and Jefferson County Technical College."
good,While working at UPS I would build a lot of relationships due to the amount of conversation with customers. Also Ups improved my typing speed as well as my productivity.
good,Ups is a great job to work at for the benefits and u have grest employee there and good supervisor and the drivers nice to u when u load they truck right
good,Overall good company to work for. Must be comfortable to stay in positions and be long-term oriented. Good work life balance and accrued holiday time increases are great.
good,It was like any typical work place. You had your people you got along with and work was steady. Worked Monday through Friday.  Management was alright. Favoritism was definitely visible here.
good,"A 3 to 5 hour job a day"
good,It can get pretty overwhelming with hundreds of boxes coming at you non stop. At the same time it's a pretty short shift so by the time you get really tired it's time to go. There's a lot of good people to work with there and we are all a team
good,"Positives: Great pay, great benefits, and a very active environment."
good,UPS is a good place to work. great benefits (once you make book) and great pay. The work is very fast pace and strenuous so i suggest a good night sleep as well as a good meal
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to play music at the belt i was assigned. The hardest part of the job was loading and unloading packages that were at the top of the trailer.
good,"After you get used to listening to the trucks come in and out, it's okay. I worked this job at the same time I substitute taught at NPS during the day. The job was generally from 5 to 9, except during heavy shipping times (like Christmas, etc.) where we could work until midnight. I was given my responsibilities, I did my work and enjoyed it. I really needed the money, so it was much appreciated."
good,"Its ups what can be said, you know what to expect because they tell you right in the door, expect to work hard, but there is space for growth and opportunity to make good money in this field."
good,I think ups is a great place to gain knowledge and experience and it's a productive and hard working environment to work in and I think every experience is a great experience
good,When i started working here a ups employee trained me to stack packages into the trucks. I coped how to work in a really noisy environment and hot environment.
good,UPS is a good company with good pay and benefits.  I was able to make a good living and raise my family.  My co-workers were hard working and trustworthy.  Management was fair and there was room for advancement.
good,i enjoyed working with my driver although it was seasonal. i learned a  lot in such a small amount of time. such as using the handheld device..organization of packages
good,cool overnight job for a college student. got paid weekly.very fast paced environment. task may seem pretty repetitive at times but it is a factory job.
good,"I loved my work crew!! we had alot of fun, despite the circumstances.  some days were long, some were short.  i learned alot of different things.  the hardest part of the job was dealing with trying to get the job done on time when you are exhausted."
good,"Working here was a great experience, the staff was always willing to help and the workload was always busy making the day go by fast. you are always in for a surprise when entering work because of the call volume and flow you never knows what each callers issue is"
good,"Really hard from that aspect, that you need to take a tremendous amount of calls and you dont have time to log them as you dont have after call time. So you really need to develop an ability to multy task because everithing needs to be put into the system during troubleshooting or discussion with the customer."
good,"Fast-paced, challenging environment. Recognizes the importance of education; motivates and encourages advancement and recognizes management potential."
good,I enjoyed the hard work I did here they pushed you hard. It is a good character  building  job. I really enjoyed  it. I have thought about going back.
good,this was a great part time job while I was finishing school. Good hourly rate plus benefits. Able to pick up extra shifts if needed as well and flexible with hours.
good,"As a part-time employee my shifts were short but hard work, and very fast paced. UPS is a great place for students to work. Offering decent salaries, and fairly good benefits."
good,"I enjoyed working there, my only regret was that I did not go back to working after the strike. Have to be willing to work very hard and at a fast pace."
good,"There's nothing bad I have to say "
good,Nice company to work for and keep you in shape. Its not a job if your lazy . You have to be in physical shape and learn to do to things at work . The pay is fair and good every week
good,"Good company to work for. Great benefits, but pay could be higher. Very hard work, not for the weak. Must have a desire to be successful and be willing to sweat."
good,the job was ok but i didnt get the position i wanted. they had me packing boxes into trucks which were either too hot or too cold.boxes were too heavy
good,"Depending what you applied for, you will be loading or unloading packages if you get a package handler position. It is fast paced and after a year you will receive full benefits. Depending on what you want to do, you can go for a management position or go long term by being a driver here which pays well but high on hours. Management is really demanding but it can mold you to grow and you can move up and it will buff your resume tremendously. Overall This job offers way more than what I have mentioned here."
good,It was great having an early morning job because when I got off work I pretty much had the rest of the day to do whatever I needed to. I worked the 5 am to 10 am shift.
good,"Overall it was a good experience. The hub was fast pace which I like and the driving was super fast pace, you have to be very focused and careful but the pay was worth it."
good,UPS is a very well organize business and have great benefits. I fell like I would like to make a career out of this company. Also can advance in life by working for UPS.
good,A nice atmosphere. I love going to my job everyday. Everyone gets along and does their job. At UPS we are committed to doing our job to the best of our ability. I'm proud to say that this is my very first job and I'm still there after all of these years.
good,"It was fun working there with a lot of interesting people learned the proper technique to lift boxes the management was nice, respectful and also aware of things going on."
good,You start your shift by going to your designated area of work and clocking in. You and maybe another will be filling trailer with boxes that are being sent and scan them to make sure they are going to the correct zip code. I learned a little about how the boxes should be stacked and how neat they should be. management is laid back as long as work is being done to best of ability. hardest part of the job for me was transportation to the area but the flexible schedule makes everything easier. I enjoyed how laid back everyone was considering I like more laid back environments.
good,Shift working hour with strict management. Learning processes in courier company. The hardest part of the job is short time for praying. The management is strict to have a discipline environment

good,"It was a fun seasonal job to have. I would meet the driver I was riding with or they would pick me up at my house and then ride around all day with them. it was a lot of walking and getting up and down from the truck, but I enjoy physical work so it didn't bother me."

After that somewhere between 8:30 am and 9:00 am a UPS driver will call me and give me the information, directions and location of where we will meet and what time we will me. Me and the Driver will meet up and start our daily route. And once the truck is unloaded and packages are delivered the driver drops me off and i go home. The hardest part of the job was multiple stops and in and out of the trucks. The most enjoyable part was seeing customers happy when delivering there packages.Management at UPS were very great its a wonderful stress free place to work"
good,"Simply form an hourly perspective, you come in you work safe and it basic, you move packages to where they need to go. If your going into management, you will learn how to manage your people,balance time management, team building, payroll, safety and work ethics, . This is if you chose to become management. They will push to make sure you gain an education and obtain a degree of some kind. Hardest part of the job is managing the stress. Enjoyable part of the job is the pay."
good,"Although my experience at ups was really great, I was very upset that they did not pay me for the full hours I worked but instead, they paid me half of what I worked for, only because I was working more hours than I should have and that meant the drivers could lose their jobs."
good,This is not an easy job but as time goes on you get use to it. I like the fact you get great benifits and the they show there appreciation. Ups is a great company to work for.

good,"Typical weekly work hours is 20-25 hours. Workload could be stressful and physically demanding, but advancement within the job is attainable; as well encourage."
good,"Learned extreme organizational skills and the agility it takes to get things done quickly in an accurate manner.  Discipline and properly managing on an individual level  was essential. I learned Effectiveness and accuracy, this was mandatory to ensure a easier workflow for the drivers.  This transition into a better experience for the customers and the company.  The training you get at UPS make you a better individual and a positive influence to your community.  Jobs are made available to the residence of the community. They also give back to the community in assistant with school scholarships and a number of other things.This company provide as much and more benefits to a high school graduate upwards to any of the highest earned degrees with competitive pay.  Honesty is the best policy and with hard work you can accomplish anything. Some challenges was those holiday fluctuating hours, I had to learn to make it work.  We had a each one teach one relationship and assisted in picking up the pieces.  It was a peace of mind to have such unity. You never really know what to expect on a day to day basis, you may have double the work you had the day before. you have to go with an open mind.  The trucks were sometimes challenging with the content of material being packed.  The hardest part one time was dealing with insect being shipped and the container broke apart.  UPS is non-discriminative, the work opportunity is there for anyone who is interested.  One of the best companies to work for based on the benefits and salary potential.  It's a union organization which is a great addition"
good,The work was very stressing but at the end of the day you feel good about yourself because you do a lot of work. I learned how to be a better team player and to manage my time better. The work environment was alright because it's a little dangerous and people are screaming left and right. Hardest part of the job was carrying and loading heavy packages. Most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and helping them with what they're doing because you guys get to know each other and grow a bond.
good,"This is a smaller family run business, were always good to me, and I"
good,"Benefits and security are what highlight this job. UPS generally promotes from within so the opportunity for advancement is there. I worked in the operations aspect where my shift ranged from 3am to 10am outside of the busy season, then 11pm-11am during peak. Simply put I planned the destination for every UPS package that came to Niagara County. Decided which truck and where in the truck the package will go. Also consisted of office and managerial duties."

good,the people their are not the people you would think. Very nice group of individuals. as a whole they are not the company to be with unless you like to be controlled for no reason.
good,"It was fun, worthwhile, got a lot of bonuses, dedication, I learned to work in difficult weather, work with customers effectively, and have fun in the process"
good,"very hard, dark unsanitary, unfriendly co workers, who only care about themselves. The hours were ridiculous, should start no later than 5:30 everyday not earlier than 4"
good,UPS was a job that tested both mental and physical strength. A great place to meet new people and accomplish levels you probably would have never thought that you could. Raises were guaranteed with hard work and came with great benefits that got even better with time.
good,"The management is well educated and speaks clearly. Most goals are communicated very well but they change often. Some week or months the business goals changed 3-4 times making it difficult to adjust operations. I rated the work life balance as low because management doesn't care about you working 12-14 hours a day, every day. They don't see a cut off time for work. They expect you to be there even if something small needs to get done. It does not need to be related to your shift or job duties/responsibilities. Otherwise, I enjoyed the work. It wasn't difficult and it was very rewarding."
good,"Its quite hard to balance my school and work life while maintaining my workout schedule aswell as continuing to advance my skill with guitar and other hobbies."
good,"Everyday was a new challenge.  Everyday, I would create new designs for all of my clients.  My skills as designer were constantly utilized while keeping with the proper code of conduct held by The UPS Store."
good,Good place to work but it was far from where I live for such a short amount of hours someways. I wish there was full-time from day to night but they only had night to day full time.
good,"Schedule appointments and route shipments. I learned the WMS and SAP system. Management was difficult to communicate with. I enjoyed the diverse workplace. It was hard to move up with this company, I'm always looking into growing within a company. I enjoyed what I did for UPS and well as my co-workers."
good,Decent place to work. I drove a forklift and loved it. Regretted leaving the place. Will likely go back in the future when it is a better fit for me. Most of the people I worked with were very nice.
good,"Great job if you enjoy minimum supervision, team members were very cool and I enjoyed working with management as well. Great benefits and overtime available."
good,This is a job that challenges you in a way to help you compete in other related fields of work.  The co workers were very helpful at this job which made my transition into the company very comfortable.
good,I only worked there for the holiday season riding in the ups delivery truck with the driver delivering packages to residents and businesses. I really wish I could work there again part or full time.
good,I was just seasonal and could not wait it out so had to stop. But boy would I love to work for UPS.  I should have jumped on it when I was in college. I didn't.
good,"I loved working at UPS it is a physical fast paced job, thats my type of work. I would like to return there i worked the twiliggt shift 3:30 In the morning."
good,"Load packages all day. Good place to meet different people, gain friendships, learn about different places in the world. Very consistent and very dependable work."
good,typical day at work i used to work nights  you don't stop till the end of your shift no breaks  you need  to make sure all the packages go out as quick as they can but make sure its 100% in-tacked and make sure its going to the right location
good,"The student reimbursement program seems brilliant until you get started. Third shift is exhausting, they allow you minimal hours which means minimal pay, and it takes away from the college experience when you're sleeping all day. There are good benefits for people who stick through it and don't mind being in college a little longer. It's nearly impossible to graduate on time with a good GPA when you have that type of work schedule."
good,"Ups definitely takes care of their employees. I worked as a part time supervisor during college and was paid very fairly for my time. I did not like the ""us vs them"" mentality of union workers vs management, but it is understandable."
good,"This company is focused on safety of its workers, and efficiency of its process, so everything ran very well. Being a part of a union gives quite a bit of security in the job, but I also didnt really enjoy all of the people that worked there. It seemed to be a very closed-minded environment. I got a good workout in while loading the trucks, though."
good,"Es una muy buena opción para laborar , ya que te brinda el apoyo en lo que sea desde el primer momento."
good,A physically demanding job with great benefits and a 401 k plan. A fast paced environment and good for the body. Keeps you in shape. Alot of growth opportunity.
good,Sometimes a positive environment. What I learned is to keep life and work separate. Management can be helpful at times but they're not always available when needed. You must stay focus or things can get messy because it can be fast paced. Because it's so face paced though time flies.
good,"-Long days and long shifts with no set hours make position less than ideal for family life"
good,"Fast paced, high demand job. There is a lot of expectations, with minimal help. Great benefits. Good pay for job worked. Hard to get full time job opportunity."

good,"It's a hard job for some people............"
good,"The owner is a very nice man and, as long as you get your work done,  a good person to work for. The pay was fine and the hours were nice, but advancement was an impossibility. All in all, not a bad place to work."

The management team made sure that we were safe and complient the day. Workplace culture was excellent we made sure that we work as a unit and made sure thrucks were loaded and job was well done. Hardest part of job was loaded the trucks.
good,"UPS is a good company to work for.  It's really good to learn how important production, safety and culture.  It's very fast pace, with long hours.  You always have contact with division managers, who will help with production."
good,"Usually work started at 11pm, I would clock in then after my supervisor would assign me to my trucks. Most of the time you would have 3-4 trucks to lead packages into and each truck would have around 100-400 packages all different sizes. It was kind of hard but you have to move fast pace with that job. It's a friendly job and you will have to communicate with your other employees to help everyone jobs go smoothly. The hardest part of the job was managing 4 trucks with so many packages but it helped me learn how to move in a fast pace for the future. The most enjoyable part was when your done packing all your trucks without the hassle."

good,Door to door experience with customer service. Shipping and handling merchandise. Organizing and delivering packages to commercial and residential areas.
good,"It's a pretty typical package handling job, we check the packages as they come down the belt and load them into the containers. The warehouse is safe if you follow correct safety rules. The management is nice and helpful and the people are friendly."
good,A typical work day of a ups supervisor: to work at 6am. sometimes have 6 am meetings on the squack box. Check trucks for drivers make sure loads are correct (not too heavy not too light). dispatch drivers on their routes (I am in charge of 75 drivers).

good,A typical day at Ups is to come in before the beginning of shift to make sure every tool and equipment and properly set up safe and secured. I also has to make sure that I have enough to start and finish the task on a daily basis. The hardest part of the job is when your not fully staffed.
good,"It's a good job if you're young you won't get paid the most about 350 if u work the most u can but if u get a second job for 5 to 7 years your checks will start to pay off. It's a job that gets good when you have time in."
good,Lack of leadership and management skills in the guys in charge of us. My experience could be more improved if management actually showed effort and appreciation towards us the dogs of UPS.
good,i liked this job alot. the hours were very reasonable and the job required you to constantly move around a keep busy during the entire work shift. loved it

good,I have done various shifts at UPS Ltd. It was quite stable company with good environment and decent wage with opportunities to advance. As long as you are not lazy looking for a career within logistics industry I believe that UPS could be a good place for it.

good,Excellent company.  Great customer service.  Excellent logistics services.  Well maintained vehicles and facilities.  Well paid and excellent benefits.

good,"- constant movement"
good,Each day brought you to a new area of the city. Giving you a chance to meet various individuals. Very pleasant environment to work in each day. Thoroughly enjoyable.
good,"The only reason I left honestly is the fact that I got a job offer with more money and it was full-time. Teamwork is a big thing with this company, if you can't work together with other people you should not work here."
good,"Great physical job , fast pace , does great out of work activities. Does activities that recognizes the workings that does their job at a safe manner and correctly."

good,"Ups is a great place to work, good pay, just dont get enough hours. Load and unload the trucks everyday. In a warehouse setting"
good,"The company is good to work for, but finding positions to move up in the company are hard to find.  The management could be a bit more forward thinking and not so regimented in the way they have always done things."
good,15 minute break. if you work well and follow the instructions you are taught on the week of being hired in it is a decent job to work with good benefits.
good,"It's not the best job. I like working there but they don't pay enough for the hard work. But that's only and only my review of the job, others would have it differently."
good,"At UPS you're one of 400,000 employees world-wide, so to say you're just a number is not a stretch.  While it's a great place to earn a paycheck, the environment can really be a downer at times."
good,The hours here are extremely long. But the overtime was well worth it. The place was somewhat enjoyable. I knew most of the people and we made the time go by.
good,Good job to have loads of benefits to it and there great to work with only bad side is I only get 20 hours a week but  I'd still recommend anyone to go for this job if looking for work
good,"It was great, & I had a friendly driver. We made the job easy by helping each other. Busy days wasn't so bad besides the breaks was short other than that I wouldn't mind going back to work there."

good,"Fast paced and rewarding environment with unlimited potential for growth"
good,"It was a fulfilling experience with a lot of benefits and established character for myself. Each day was set before each new week so it was consistent, friendly co-workers and staff."
good,USP provides good training that allows you to become proficient in your job.  They provide you with the opportunity to learn new jobs and provide you with benefits also.
good,Help drivers or anyone in need . Work as a team member is a must as well as communication skills.The job is a handyman hands on job .
good,It was a okay job during peak season but after they drop your hours completely and if you are seasonal they will get rid of you if you are not good.
good,The job was ok at the begin until they start asking you to move fast. I really didn't know what I was doing the first and nobody told me how to the job until a co-worker told me how. The 11 an hour sounds like a good deal if you get more than 20 hours a week but you might get that or less depending on the work load that is set for that day.

good,I like that I had great benefits. Flexible hours and they worked with me with time off when my father was in the hospital all the way up to his passing.
good,"UPS was a great place to work at, you get chances to move up and they have great benefits, it's a little hard if you are not careful cause you move a different veriety of boxes, and different weight. Overall is a good first job and also a great place for a career specially if you go into being a driver."
good,"Good place to work for. Awesome area and management. Glendale, az. I learned a lot about ups and customer services while working here."
good,"it a good job. and it a nice place 2 work at "
good,"The driver made the job great for me because he was patient and gave great instruction. When delivering packages, we came across a lot of friendly faces which boosted my moral throughout the day."
good,"You will be greeted warmly and enthusiastically by people in your company. I can say that we have a very good camaraderie at work but work itself was taxing enough that people didn't have time to explore other things and do other activities. "
good,Ups haves a 1hr breaks and still pay you your 8hr rate it's sucks that it was seasonal $15 an hr was the best job for me.  I had great co workers and tons of fun

good,"Good Dental and Health benefits "
good,"a little hard labor but worth it, the pay was amazing, the team was great I would definitely go back if i could. the setting was overall amazing."
good,"A typical day at work entails calling the dispatch center in the mornings (usually between 7am & 10am), asking for work, then getting the work, receiving a call from a delivery NLT. 10:30am, meeting the driver at a disclosed pickup location close to the driver's route, traveling as passenger in a UPS truck, delivering packages to businesses and residences, completing said delivery quota for the day, then heading back to where my car was parked - essentially, done for the day between 5pm and 6pm. I learned the ins and outs of the UPS delivery process. The management was efficient, professional, and 2nd to none. The delivery drivers (co-workers) were great chatting buddies and both of good moral repute. The hardest part of the job was not always knowing if I - as only a seasonal driver helper - would get more work each subsequent day. The most enjoyable part of the job was the conversations with the drivers that we would have on days there was actually work available. I loved the work  !"
good,A typical day at work  I was a delivery driver who serviced the customers I learned about safety team work I enjoyed helping customers management was fair got along with all co workers I currently had 27 years safe driving the hardest part of the job was the long hours the most enjoyable part of the job was making sure the job was done correctly
good,I liked this company but I only did this seasonally. I know they work very hard and I love to work hard. But this was a position for the holidays only.
good,"I'm a temporary delivery helper at UPS so I haven't seen everything. Its very challenging but with the right co-workers it can be really fun. A typical day at work starts from 10 am and lasts to around 3 pm most days. If we have a lot of packages or had some trouble throughout the day we may have to stay until 6 pm. This was my first job and I really do not regret choosing it as my first. I would prefer UPS over any fast food restaurant job. My co-workers were very friendly, talkative and caring. We helped each other out and made the most fun out of the job. The hardest part of the job is just all the walking and going up the stairs, I'm not exactly the most athletic fit person but in a few weeks of working there I definitely feel like I had some sort of physical change. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing how happy the customers would be, and sometimes their pets too."
good,I would still be working here today if the office did not close.  This was a great place to work with great people to work with.  I hope to one day go back working for them.
good,Great company to get your foot in the door. Very fast paced working environment. Pay and benefits are good. Good place to begin and build a career. Good experience with management.
good,A typical day is running from house to house delivering packages. Have to be ready to almost run when getting ready to hop out that truck. Very good for some one who loves to exercise.
good,driver helper delivers packages just like the driver. its seasonal; on average i was working 5 or 6 hours 5 days a week pays alright i was making 13 an hour at redmond wa.
good,that working is safe is import and have to do the job right and stay froce on what you doing cause nobody dont want get hurt so i take safe very srice

good,"The job is hard and requires continuous lifting, employees learn lifting techniques, safety and team work. Employees are friendly and management is by the book of operations. The hardest part is maintaining energy and strength through out the shift and different seasons. The most enjoyable part is the rewards you can qualify for good work ethic, the free food bbq's and good wage raises."
good,Good job low pay and hours. Its all about getting the job done safely and on time and it can sometimes be bad because the conditions are treacherous
good,Meet weekly goals by making sure the employees are properly trained. Maintaining a safe and clean environment. Recognized those who produces well every month.
good,"the only bad thing is u never knew when ur shift would be over , it could range anywhere from 10-12 hour shifts. it was till whenever the work was all done."
good,"This sounds like an excellent company to work for & the other employees were quite satisfied with their jobs. My job had less hours than I first anticipated, but overall, the work was good & the other employees seem very satisfied, leading me to believe that I would like to continue to work here once the season is over. I also witnessed the employees willingness to work as a team and found value in each of their attitudes about everyone being able to finish the workload in a timely manner."
good,"Great Place too work would highly recommend to anyone."
good,I learned a lot working here. Provided training as well as knowledge in a different field.Thankful for the opportunity to experience having a great job.
good,Enjoyed working for UPS because we worked as a team. UPS was a very productive company. The benefits was great and management displayed positive attitudes towards the employees.
good,It was great place to work and I enjoyed the environment around all the people that worked there.To see all the things that came off and loaded onto to trucks was wonderful.
good,Pull orders all day. learned how to mange time and be quick.management let you do your work. Coworkers are great. Kind of a pressure cooker situation but the people there make it a good place to work
good,Straight forward job packager come down a conveyor belt and you place them into a particular trailer according to zip code. Learned how to accurate and manage my time. Management pushes you to do more work than physically possible but it does teach you the value of earning your money. Extremely physical but there is opportunity for advancement
good,"Cool working here, its goes fast every night. Peak season you handle around 30,000+ packages. Could be more prepared for some of the work in the future."
good,"UPS Package Handlers is a physical, fast-paced position that involves continual lifting, lowering and sliding packages that typically weigh 25 to 70 lbs."
good,"everyone there works hard and is very helpful."
good,"i only worked there a few months"
good,amazing how many packages get delivered everyday. finding the actual package for an address is sometimes harder than you'd think. dress for the cold on a residential route sucks when you start at the mall and get hot and sweaty then go residential as it gets dark and cold.
good,The people I worked with were easy going and easy to get along with. The work was physically demanding at times but that is why I enjoyed it so much. I learned the area around where I lived in more depth than I thought I ever would and it helps me out to get around now. I also learned how to work well with others and how to be in sync with my co-workers without having to say much if anything at all. The management was very nice and very flexible to my needs/limitations. Overall a very good working experience and I would gladly work with UPS again.
good,Had a great time at UPS working with hard working people from all walks of life. Most f the employees have been with the company for many years due to their willingness to provide us with as many hours as we needed as long as we worked the minimum.
good,Typical day is unloading trucks and package cars. Work with a sorter and sometimes alone. A lot of interaction with coworkers and management. Most days physically draining others days smooth
good,I will return to and add additional information to the summary after I have completed the upload. This information will be completed at a later time.
good,loved it! wish it wasn't a seasonal position i would recommend this job this position to a a lot of people who have thought about working for this company.
good,Everyone is easy to get on with and very helpful. I enjoyed working here because the hours are good but it is quite hard work physically.
good,"learned how to work scanner for packages delivery "
good,"The work days would move quickly with likewise fast-paced work with a set schedule, breaks, a good management infrastructure.  The pace required was challenging but working with motivated and determined team members can always make the work pay off.  The company offers assistance for school and good opportunity for advancement and benefits."
good,All employees were focused on package delivery.  Had many opportunities to learn the history of UPS and even went out on a package car for a day.
good,"Great place to get experience and place to get great exercise while working. Nice work environment, good management, gives snacks on break. Have to be a hard worker"
good,this would be a good company to work for part time or if you just plan on working their temporarily. the opportunity for advancement is very meek. the pay is low but excellent benefits
good,"I started as a loader and moved my way to the supervisor position. If you are a loader it's hard work. Everyone swears at UPS. Bring water, you'll need it. Benefited after one year free to hourly employees if you can make it that long. Wait a few years and become a driver and you make better money."
good,Fast paced great hours fun work place. It was seasonal holiday position. I got more job experience and it was close to home.  Got along with my co-workers
good,"Great family business as long as you don't mind some hard work.  Good people, better co-workers, and amazing satisfaction"
good,"The staff at UPS was friendly, hilarious, and extremely helpful."
good,I enjoy my current position as there are several elements - not the same thing every day.  My co-workers are hard workers intent on keeping things working smoothly and safely
good,Great job if it could be converted to full-time.only seasonal should have options for full time work.after season  .if permanent job could be offered  after season would be great
good,unloading boxes out of containers onto belts so they can be loaded on planes and sent to customers and had to unload to the loader that was sending it to the plans
good,"I have worked my tail off at this store for over ten years, I feel very underpaid. The owner of the store has also told me that he wished the store made more money so he could give me a raise. I have decided that it is time to move on I need a job for me and my son that I have a career and a future that I can financially survive in this world. I am not afraid of work I don't mind work its life if you want anything you need to work for it, and I am willing to work even harder now."
good,Hard and fast pase job always moving and always lifting heavy boxes and walking them long distances.  The pay was all right but I had to work very hard for my paycheck I started 9 o'clock in the morning to 4 PM.
good,Its a job for younger individuals would not recommend this kind of work for older working class individuals. The co-workers where excellent as well as management. Over-time was the hardest part of the job in the summer heat. Company rewards and recognition was the best part of working for the company.
good,Got a chance to use the technology I like and the boss was very accomodating. Good people to work with and respected my views and ideas during the meetings.
good,Stacking boxes in trucks in an organized manner or sorting boxes to correct belts and fixing jams. There is always opportunity to Excell in the work place and get hire pay. They keep you bust and work with a variety of people. Most supervisors are fair and good at there jobs some would treat you as if they were better than you.
good,A typical day at work was fun. I learned how to hold a box. Management was lively. The most enjoyable part was working. I liked the job it was my first job.
good,a very busy day packaging and loading up the trucks and unloading the trucks people are very help with keeping the areas clean

good,Found UPS to be a good working place where everyone can work with a healthy mind because of the fun working environment and the good thing that I found over here is the team which never backs in helping others and sharing ideas.
good,"I was given the chance to learn all the different areas in accounting in my 19 years with UPS.  I also got to go to school for accounting.  I made a lot of life long friends.  There was mandatory over-time the first week of every month, but I was paid time and a half for this.  The hardest part of the job was the commute to Miami airport.  The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the General Ledgers closed for the month and explained to management.  I left this job when they moved it to Canada and were only offering other job not in the accounting area."
good,"Very proactive job. Demanding, but also rewarding. Definitely a job for a hard worker that likes to wake up early. Would recommend this job for young males, that want to get paid every week. Off on weekends, takes energy."
good,"I generally open the store, so i get to see regular customers on a daily basis, which I enjoy. Getting to know the job, how to measure boxes, international documentation etc, was the real task at hand. Its easy to get hired into a shipping company, but when you sit and really think about it your handling other peoples personal items, that even if they hold no value to you, they may mean a great deal to them. I would have to say depending on the coworker that you are paired with, that would be the most difficult part of the job. You can either work great like bread an butter, or be the oil and vinegar, which in a small establishment isn't what you want."
good,"My time at UPS was short and tedious. They continuously try to make the job harder than how it is. Managers, and supervisors try very little to help out thier coworkers."
good,"This was my first job out of high school.  I worked here for a long time, but wanted to change my career.  UPS is a good stable company but I was only a part time employee."
good,"Working at Mc'Donlads is exactly what It sounds like it would be, working early shift, working late shift. Helping out others, staying friendly all day."
good,UPS is a great job to work with. UPS has a fast working environment which can take some getting used to. They also get paid every week on a Thursday which is great. Hundred percent benefits after 90 days.
good,ups teaches you how to handle a tough fast paced work environment. it challenges you physically and mentally while teaching you how to pick up packages so that you won't suffer from any long term side effects.
good,"Lost of room to grow within the company, great benefits, a consistent schedule and a genuine management team. It may be hard in the beginning with the low pay but it works itself out with all the opportunity offered."
good,"loaded and off loaded offshore supply vessels, completed general maintenance on the drilling rig. very physical job, worked 12 hours a day"

good,Good job to have easy advanced  good hour s great benefits great supervisor okay co worker good work and life great pay easy work employee cookout erc..

good,"UPS World Hub was my first venture as a young adult in to the work force.  I honestly do not have prior work experience to use as a conpairison.  But I found UPSto be a safe, fair, and learning experirnce that I was glad I had the opertunity to do."
good,"It is a great job. Excellent company to move up in. The job was very easy. Management is okay, It's not the best. My co-workers were fine. I learned nothing."
good,"Time sensitive day as you are working against the clock to make sure your customers get their parcel on time, every time. Good team around you, but basically once you leave depot you are in your own office and have to organise your own day. Also you need to be able to communicate with the office and your customers as you are the face of the company. There are always paths to go higher up the managerial ladder and there are always new training methods to be learnt. You must be physically fit for the job as the packages you handle can exceed 70lb. But if you enjoy driving, don't mind hard work, and would like a great salary, this job is fantastic."
good,"Fast-paced work environment with prompt deadlines to meet in the Sales department. Co-workers were great but it was a highly fast-paced job with strict quotas to meet. Loved working in the sales department working with new clientele, etc."

I will always put myself out as a leader, not a follower."
good,A typical day was good. Management was pretty good. Had some means one. Co-workers was pretty cool. Hardest part was lifting things. I loved going to work.

good,"Typical day making sure we have the correct staffing (When/If) I'm on supervisor duty.  Otherwise I'm processing packages to the correct location, making sure that they arrive at the designated area. I've learned how to work in a fast pace in changing environments ranging from extremely hot to extremely cold. Enjoyable part of the job would have to be at the end of the day, but it is enjoyable most days and never a dull moment."

good,Working at ups is somewhat fast paced but a well environment to work in due to the teams order of means to sufficiency.my only set back of such working habits were my hours of graveyard for transportation was beginning to become an issue.

I continued to this for about three years, then took a sort test regarding the United States and specific destinations for each package to be sorted to and have been sorting for another three and a half years.

good,"Dispatching with UPS was demanding, each week I clocked in around 60, sometimes closer to 70, hours.  The job was highly rewarding though, and I felt challenged by the onslaught of volume that would come in to our hub everyday.  Management did there part to put out any fires, but as a dispatcher it was ultimately me who was responsible for getting everything moved right.  This meant that at the end of every shift I felt a good amount of satisfaction. Only negative thing about it is the lack of a social life outside of  work."
good,The employees from the different UPS centers are great about guiding a new employee who has not experienced or has not been trained in the various processes. Wonderful people!

I was constantly learning. Between other tasks, I processed invoices and worked with more than 20 big account all around LATAM (Cisco, HP, Sony, Riverbed, etc)"
good,"Work is fast paced and easy. If you're hard working it's easy to advance but, the hours are intense and they are not very flexible with scheduling.

good,everything at ups is done in a specific way to provide safety for all the employees its a great place to works all co-workers and mangers and supervisers are cool helpful and get along well we all work together to get our job done.
good,Productive workplace with great flexible hours and good pay. Room for advancement. Nice staff. More training would improve the staff and be ideal for preparedness with growth.
good,"Not too many hours, you could call it decent pay. Management can be a hassle. The job is all hard work and you aren't really appreciated out-right."
good,"Its hard work and very fast paced. You learn alot about shipping and recieving, logestics, and trandsport. Hands on experiance with werehouse work. Management could use some work. In all its a great place to work. You get out what you put in."
good,Handling hundreds of packages for UPS to delver the customers packages rapidly is a fast pace job.  A lot of focus put of production and accuracy to meet the customers delivery schedule.
good,"I worked for a privately owned UPS Store, Nice Package LLC,. It was a small staff however we operated one of the top two stores in the state of Colorado. I believe the small staff and close working atmosphere, helped to teach me the absolute best customer service skills, as each customer was handled on a face to face basis. On a daily basis I would perform a variety of tasks ranging from sorting and distributing mail, to shipping furniture or other valuables across the globe. Tasks such as filing and handling damage claims directly with UPS from start to finish, all while keeping my customer informed. Anything from shipping cookies to grandchildren in neighboring states, to collecting monies owed from house account clients. Since the store franchises are also known as the small business help centers, I have also learned to use various computer programs such as microsoft office and photoshop."
good,"They gave me very flexible hours since I was still in high school. The work was easy, and the same work every day, The hardest part was the sudden wave of customers that happened occasionally. The most enjoyable part of the job were my co workers. The only thing I would say is that they did not take their time to train me."
good,"UPS is an okay part time job with good benefits and job advancement.But takes a long time to become full time employee for company"
good,Hard work that makes you appreciate the opportunities the company offers. Fast paced environment that teaches you the importance of team work and production fluidity.
good,"maintain a steady work environment, worked with a team, my coworkers were dedicated to the job and supportive of one another"
good,Strenuous labor not enough hours or pay for part time. Learned alot. management is a pain in the butt. treated unfairly at times. best thing about the job was the health insurance
good,Really have enjoyed working for this company. The work life balance is really good. Everyone make you feel apart of the team!
good,Great company with exceptional people both in management and union. Helpful people everywhere willing to take time out of their long work day to help those that need it.
good,"learned how to process address changes for customers"
good,"Manuel Labor, hard work hourly paid. full benefits working well with management. Truck loading non stop movement for hours .You must be willing to physically put your time in to reach maximum pay."
good,"loaded and unloaded trailers for distribution"
good,A really productive and forward moving company. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.Management is both understanding and willing to train.
good,everyday is a new challenge learning the right method is key to success learning never stops I find working for ups helps things outside or work
good,"A typical day at work would be 4-5 hours of hard hot labor including sorting,loading,unloading, and dumping packages."
good,"the pay rate is nice but the hrs. are sort so your check it alright....management does a horribly job with discipline,takes too long to fire anyone"
good,I control high risk packages to the cages in front of the centers so drivers can pick them up and deliver them while making sure that those packages get signatures because they are high value packages. I also track those packages to make sure the drivers did get the signatures. I also track the driver releases for 24 other buildings. Once a week I update the security managers report book. The management team in the security department are really good. I get along with most of the people I work with even though I don't really work with them. The hardest part of my job is to get the warehouse supervisors to get me the high val packages in a timely enough manner to ensure that I can get the packages to the centers with plenty of time for the drivers to pick them up to take them out for delivery.
good,A typical day at UPS includes a lot of physical labor. You have to be prepared for anything and be able to deal with a high pressured environment which I believe is the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with different people and personalities from different backgrounds. Management at UPS is very impersonal and mainly are concerned with numbers which can be frustrating. I learned to work hard for myself and my family and that's what keeps me going strong.
good,I worked here for the summer in between college semesters. The managers worked with me when I went back to school. It was an overnight position through a staffing company. Hiring process was swift and smooth.
good,"It was a great easy job. It wasn't any complicated but it did get tiring at times. Most of the coworkers were very hard workers. Everyone had very great communication skills. Only problem was we all didn't get enough hours at this job. The pay was good, but not the hours."
good,"Working at UPS varies, some days are strenuous and very busy with high volume of packages, and other days it's a walk in the park. I've learned to move at a fast pace, keep area clean, have patience and always meet my personal goal, which is to make sure packages are treated properly in order to get to the consumers, Management and co workers all works as a team and are extremely friendly. The hardest part of it all is keeping things organized by zip codes. The most enjoyable is the medical benefits I reap from this job."
good,"UPS is a company that is built off of hard labor and meeting deadlines. Being a upser can help mode you into a professional who meets goals and understands time management. "
good,Many positions within UPS can be fairly demanding. But the compensation and benefits for an entry level job are solid. I would recommend it to young adults and college students who are seeking to have their education paid for and to have a reliable source of insurance and other benefits. I might also recommend it to someone in need of a secondary part time job.
good,"Great company to work for, great atmosphere.  Short contract work only for the holidays, would work again if needed.  Many calls lining up helpers with drivers, making sure they all had to proper paperwork.  Bosses were all pretty laid back as long as things were running smoothly."
good,"starts out at 3:00 am and ends at 9:30 am consist of organizing three package cars to fit the desired amount of packages."
good,Fast pace work. Safety and team work. Management very dedicated   to there jobs. Friendly co-workers. Safety is the hardest part of the job. must stay focus. The most enjoyable thing for me is driving the forklift.
good,UPS is a great place to work because you meet wonderful people there and obtain even better skills that could be applied to life. Their business is organized and somewhere I wouldn't mind working at again.
good,I enjoyed working for United Parcel Service it gave me stills of multi-tasker that I didn't know I had. They were good to there people and that is saying something about a company in this day.
good,"Good co-workers.  Only seasonal  work but the job was good."
good,"It's a difficult and physically demanding job, but UPS offers fantastic benefits and great pay if you're willing to put in the time and effort."
good,Moving freight in tight spots was the hardest but I achieved it. I got along well with co workers and my Supervisor. Left because of the hours being changed which interfered with my full time job at Meyer.
good,"Good environment and more importantly great benefits. School subsidies as well as important incentives in terms of outside transactions (eg. shopping, companies, destinations...)."
good,Great benefits. Fast pace and competitive work environment. I enjoyed having contest who could sort/load/unload the fastest and make no mistakes.
good,UPS is a great ran company with great people and management. A day at UPS is fun because everyone has a sense of humor.You learn a lot from the management also.There always willing to tell you about the company and what it stands for.
good,"I delivered all kinds of packages to its locations everyday."
good,loading and/or unloading ups delivery trucks. fun environment with plenty of room for promotional opportunities. benefits are excellent.
good,Part time work. Great benefits. very low pay but raises are great . Very hot in the summer very cold in winter. things might had change since i work there.
good,"Productive place to work, flexible time hours, and fun friendly and serious at work people to work with. Management style was good, supervisor were respectful and accommodating"
good,"I enjoyed being out meeting people, delivering their packages. I learned to work efficiently and quickly. Management was always helpful as well as co-workers. There were o hard moments, I truely enjoyed working there and being a part of the team."
good,The schedule was good.  I worked as a am loader and it provided me the ability to work and still have a part of the day to deal with my family.
good,Everyday I'm assign to a designated truck and would stack the boxes in an orderly fashion.  I've learned how to be more discipline in my work and always check my work.  The management was fair and very demanding.  My co-workers were extremely helpful.  The hardest part of the job was falling behind with multiple boxes to load at a time.  The most enjoyable part was the moment it was time to leave.
good,If you like working independently without micromanagement this is a great place to work. Working at the UPS store has allowed me to meet a variety of people from all walks of life. If you are a people person and have attention to detail and know how to take initiative then managing at the UPS store can be very rewarding.
good,"I had a blast working with a UPS driver of 22 years. The hardest part about this job was learning how to work the PDA. A typical day started out at 7:30 and ended at 3:00.  I was one of the lucky temps hired for the Christmas season, my driver was one who hurried through his deliveries so that he could go home to his wife and family."
good,"If I am doing safety committee work, I would be conducting sessions with new employees on safety procedures. I will also have to make sure that they know and understand those safety procedures by testing their knowledge. Then if I am working with those new employees I would assist them on their task making sure they complete their paper work right and have proper loading technique. I would also make safety observations in areas and see what people are doing wrong and what they could put them at risk. When I am not doing safety work, I am loading packages in cans. This involves me being keen and detail orientated. This is because I have to make sure the right packages are going to their destination. The most enjoyable part of my job is communicating with my coworkers and new employees and hearing what is their concerns on the job. Being apart of the safety committee permits me to hear out what fellow workers have an issue with and making steps into resolving those issues."
good,"UPS management ""over"" hires number of employees needed for each shift  Due to the lack of commitment and probability of workers calling in, leaving or walking of the job. So, on many work nights when those factors were low many workers including myself would be sent home due to lack of work and having to many workers actually show up to work. Many weeks I would only get to work a few days. Those work days are part-time only. 4hr shifts max due to physical demand of work tasks. Work and weekly paycheck was very unpredictable and inconsistent. Seniority was not a factor either."
good,Typical day is very enjoyable. Since I am hard working person I don't have any problem. Hardest part is the commute since I live in Bridgewater and commuting to Wayne nj.
good,Everyday it was always busy and sometimes we will be really tired but the managers and bosses will encourage everyone to work hard and just enjoy it.
good,Fast paced.  The drivers are very friendly.  I would deliver about 75-100 boxes  day. Usually work about four hour shifts. Good management.
good,I started as a loader and within a month I was promoted to supervisor.I learned about how a successful business is managed. There was a tradition that I was part of and I gained much satisfaction from this. I was a part of the management team and learned first hand from some amazing people about leadership.Being part of a team allowed me to feel a sense of pride.The most difficult challenge was the heat and humidity during the summer months.I really enjoyed the people I worked with because they made a difficult day fun.
good,This company does a very good job at taking care of its employees. the pay and benefits are great. As part of a management team I learned that communication is key to a successful operation.
good,"I loved working here.  The employee's and management are all down to earth.  The store location I worked you were not micromanaged, you had fun with the employees and the customers and able to get your work done in a happy environment which allows productive employees. Because my family situation changed, I had to seek employment elsewhere to have the extra income"
good,"Sorting, unloading, packages by states that typically weigh 70-200 lbs. Everyday is pretty much the same during the week."
good,Driver helper position is usually during the christmas holiday season. However UPS has so many positions anybody can find their place in the company. I must say wearing that uniform you get very high respects from residents and businesses. UPS I would say is overall well organized and deliver extremely fast. However delivering all those packages can ware your body out. But team work made the dream work.
good,"A typical day at work is very fast paced with a great environment surrounding you. My supervisors were all close to my age, so it was easier to talk to them without being intimidated to express yourself. My co-workers all invited me in with no problems or drama. Management also welcomed me with a great attitude and listened when I had questions or concerns. The hardest part of the job was the fast paced lifting because we had to transfer all the packages in a short amount of time in order to move on to the next truck."
good,"Fast paced enviroment, days go really fast.like my bosses and fellow employees, hard work but definitley worth the time, also good benifits"
good,I would unload and load packages between 20 to 75 pounds. Communication was a big factor with co workers at UPS. It was also a very face paced working environment.
good,a very hectic work day i learned to appreciate hard work and the feeling of a job well done co- workers and management was very friendly and eager to help if a problem occured
good,I enjoyed delivering packages to clients and working with different drivers.  I learned from them and was happy to be working.
good,"high paced but rewarding"
good,"regular day start from 9am - 5 pm maybe to 36 , 49 loads"
good,Unload truck as safely and efficiently as possible. Fast pace. Work alone majority of shift. Its strictly Part-Time work witch is max 25 hours a week. work temperature conditions coincide with weather outside.
good,"fast pace.... must be on time. when theirs overtime they will give it out. unloading and stocking fast and on time."
good,"Very flexible scheduling, a good crowd of regular customers, and great people to work with. "
good,"very fast paced work environment. need to be able to pick up things quickly and adapt on a daily basis. if you can handle it, its not that bad"
good,UPS is a great place to work but I'm looking for a job that will support my family. The management is okay at best and they aren't as organized as they should be. I'm looking for a bartending position to help customers out and make them nice drinks and service so they will keep coming back.
good,"Everyday I came in with an open mind because each day you had to expect something different. Also, there was a lot of things to be done which made the day go by quick."
good,"A good place to work, would be better if it was full time, enjoy being a safety team member, have learned a lot about safety, and try to incorporate it into my job and home life every day."
good,During my time at UPS I supervised 24 team member and I found great pleasure in taking new team member to a new level. I watch each new member work performance grow.
good,"Takes a long time for a driving opportunity. you must be willing to work very hard. very hard on the body, must be in good condition. fast in pay increases"
good,very organized and productive work place excellent benefits the hours and pay are also great always got holiday pay and vacation pay
good,"- They provide overtime and other jobs within the company"
good,I enjoyed working at Danzas. The team I worked on all worked very well together. We were offered the opportunity for cross training and 3rd party offsite training to remain current with certain regulatory DOT and IATA requirements.
good,A typical day for an O.M.S. involves managing communications between the operations within and outside of the shipping center. The are also a broad range of responsibilities that change from day to day. Overall it is a well kept company that is aware of it's faults and gives all of it's employees an opportunity to be successful.
good,I do love working for the parcel service and the management is great when we all in good moods but I'm starting to get burnt out on 3rd shift.
good,"Best for starting your career,"
good,Most of the people I worked with were terrific.  I had the occasional employee that was not pleasant but that is everywhere.  The benefits were great as well as the training.
good,"Very simple, Stop and Go  technique with UPS. After a while of doing it, its almost robotic in function. Work can get hard, but its rewarding in the end."
good,"Work usually has various positions, unloading the incoming trailers, sorting the packages coming down the line and loading the delivery vans. I started during peak season as seasonal but have been kept on as a full time part time employee. During peak I was getting 35+ hours a week with weekly pay which was sweet but it was hard work and still is most of the time. Haven't gotten any benefits yet but have only been on for about three months waiting to see what will come of that. Co-workers and management are all for the most part really cool and helpful. The job is very physically intensive and isn't for someone out of shape, but one month into it I was way stronger than when I started. It's overall a great way to break into the warehouse field and good second job to have."
good,"Really good Management"
good,Excellent management great co-workers come join the team. i learned how to interact with technicians on the job and after hours in order to help them complete there daily job tasks.
good,It was a great place to work. I only did a seasonal job from November to December and it was a great place to work. It was great pay for a job that includes a lot of bending down to get boxes.
good,It's good job ..have a flexible time ..great management...you will work between 3.5 to 5 usually.but in last two month each year you should work between 4 to 6 some days .. you can work overtime .
good,working for Ups I've learned how to use the board in which you have to sign and scan each packege. Co-workers are pretty lead back. Hardest part about the job would be working in the below zero temperatures.
good,The management is not very stable and makes bad decision often. Most of my co-workers are good workers but some don't do their jobs properly. I enjoyed that job at first but the management changes too often and so does the employees and it makes the job harder to enjoy. I enjoyed the free feel of the job.
good,A beautiful and wonderful place to work for many years and great chances to grow from within the company Meet new people every year a lot of great benefits for you and your family
good,"I worked for UPS as a seasonal worker. My supervisor told me she wanted to hire me on and had the approval to. One week later she told me she had to lay me off as well as 3 others through a text. Three days after that she said she wanted me to be on call 2 to 3 days a week. I told her I could be on call if she at least called me the night before because the shift started at 3:30 in the morning and I also have a 1 year old that I would have to make arrangements for the next day. She never responded back to me. OTHER THAN THAT, the job atmosphere itself was great and the other preloaders were super nice. Over all a great place. Obviously not very flexible though."
good,"UPS like any other job has its ups and downs, the biggest con is the lack of hours and management. The management at UPS treats everyone more like robots and less like human beings."
good,"Everything about UPS Is great, the staff, The management, just about everything. I have worked there about 6 months now & i have learned a lot."
good,"The fast pace environment of UPS is would that I relished. I held many positions from building trucks, to unloading trucks and most recent on the sort isle."
good,Well mannered and respectful staff. Working outdoors is the best part. Deliver packages and sort through the truck's load.
good,"I really enjoyed the work at UPS.  I especially enjoyed the mix of working in the office and outdoors.  Working with my crew, working as a team and being in the elements was really enjoyable.  The managers that I worked with were pretty good and appreciated a good reliable and consistent employee and rewarded him or her with a good salary."
good,"I learned to be patient, but encouraging, because the job can be very stressful at times. We have a lot of deadlines to reach and rules to follow. Safety is key, everyone person must be careful and use the proper procedures to ensure their safety. I enjoy interacting with the employees, and learning about the life outside of the company. Organizing packages and loading them onto the trucks at a decent time can be challenging and you always have to work on it and improve."
good,a typical day at work would be me getting up at 2:30 and leaving so im there at my work by 3 and then i would clock in and check the board to see where im at and when the bell sounds i go do what the board or supervisors tell me to do.
good,Keep boxes moving so they can get to the next destination on time without being damaged. Learn something new everyday and the hardest part was having the sort go down on time so you where not there so late.
good,"high pay, plenty of hours. friendly and helpful coworkers. this job was great until i had to move to a new town. Nothing is perfect but UPS comes close."
good,"	Load and unload packages quickly and efficiently."
good,"Not for the faint of heart, this job will test your physical, emotional, and sometimes spiritual limits!  Imagine some of the hardest work you've ever done, then imagine doing it in the middle of July in a trailer at 110 degrees...for four to five hours straight...and if your are lucky, at the end of the week you MAY bring home $150 or so.  That's what your first year is like.  However, if you hang in there, your insurance (for your entire family) becomes free of charge, and it is AMAZING insurance, you have the ability to purchase company stock at a discount, 401K, vacation days, optional days off, and more!  If you want to drive the big brown truck, don't waste your time in Knoxville though,  Part timers on average must work 15 1/2 years before the first opportunity to go full time currently,.  So if you don't mind working two jobs for the next 15 years, and getting paid to work out when you show up to the UPS hub, come on down and fill out an application.  Don't say I didn't warn you though..."
good,Very busy work environment where management is promoted from within.
good,Deliver the customer to the home. UPS only. I helping the driver to house only the package.
good,"UPS is a great company to work for. A typical day involves lots of interaction with tons of people that enjoy doing what they do. I learned the importance of team work working for the company. The hardest part of the job is sometimes dealing with management. They usually treat their employees like they are lesser and do not matter. When in fact management does very little outside of directing other people what to do. Other than that aspect of the company, it's a great place to work."
good,"Provide administrative assistant to C- level executive management."
good,Hours are somewhat bad starting out. Management is very well. Employees are friendly and willing to help you in any way to get the job done. Hardest part of the job is working in the cold unloading semi trailers very early in the morning.
good,I really don't have any negative things to say. My coworkers and customers were great. The job is physically demanding- I personally loved that. All in all a fun job.
good,make about 100 to 130 deliveries and pickups daily...learned to be fast and efficient...management okay...most co-workers great...getting next-day-air delivered on time was hardest part...pleasing customers was most enjoyable part
good,Its a good place to work if you already have a job doing something else. Working there can be hard when you first get started but when you get the system down its basically a 1 2 step process. I have gotten promoted to 3 different jobs in a course of 5 months.
good,I would drive from Philadelphia to West Chester and meet up with my driver from there we would deliver packages on our scheduled route. If I needed assistance I would call Human Resources for information. The coworkers were fun an playful but worked hard when duty called. The hardest part of the job wasn't the actual task itself but just the repetitiveness. The most enjoyable part was getting free food during our break or after work.
good,A typical day at work requires me to go and unload trailer trucks as consistently as i could. I learned all the 8 keys to being a productive man in moving boxes onto and off trucks. My coworkers were nice and enjoyable to be around at times. My most enjoyable part about the job was that i was getting paid a nice amount but at the same time it was kind of a workout to me.
good,It is a fast paced job that has a lot of pressure and work on your knees. Me being young helped out a lot because i would run to the deliveries and get done even faster than what 30 year drivers could. The hardest part of the job that i didn't feel was very hard was being in the cold weather.
good,Repedative work day basic routine. Sometimes short days and or surprising long days
good,it was a fun active job there really wasn't a downside to this job except that it was just seasonal
good,"UPS is a very positive company to work for, both of the drivers I was partnered with were very friendly and easy to work with. A typical day was basically running from the UPS truck and placing the parcels at the front doors of all the residences and businesses on our route. The hardest part of the job is when it would rain, it slowed us down a little due to needing to wrap each parcel in plastic before we could deliver it. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to work outside in the fresh air."
good,"	Lift up to 75Lbs"
good,you are extremely overworked with minimum pay its hard to move up in the company
good,"everyone was very friendly"
good,I have been at UPS as a driver helper in my previous spring break. i recognize the way they deliver faster. Also they give the student a possibility to make some money and prepare their next enrollment am personally ready to work with them. I had a chance to work with professional and experienced drivers who helped me understand how  their job is and how they handle it.
good,it was only a seasonal job but the driver I worked with made it real fun and easy
good,"•Load materials and products into package processing equipment."
good,"managment is confusing, coworkers and usually kind, the work load varies daily but is usually decent."
good,"I was only seasonal but, everything was pretty much straight forward. My coworkers were helpful and this was the first night time job I've ever had and I actually really enjoyed it."
good,Co workers at this job are laid back but are alert on where the packages go or should go. The management is good because they are about business but still likes to get to know their employees.
good,UPS provided several opportunities for growth and to learn new processes. They were also very aware of safety issues and ensured a safe work environment.
good,"At UPS is I am the first point of contact for all HR-related queries and handling all personnel-related paperwork and documentation, such as employment contracts. My responsibilities include recruitment, background checks, training, sickness and absence tracking, disciplinary and grievance procedures, redundancy settlements, equal opportunities and establishing staff support systems. I arrange the advertisement of new vacancies, analyzing applications and shortlisting candidates, arranging job interviews, and managing any testing procedures involved in the recruitment process."
good,"Take packages off a large conveyer belt and place them on one of sixteen colored belts. Hard work and strong, fast pace are necessary to be capable, along with self motivation. Always try to move towards the work so fellow workers don't get backed up and to stay busy. Work is hard and fast, so you have to keep moving, but you do stay busy. Supervisors exist to help keep flow moving, albeit breaking jams, handling re-tapes(which we also handle ourselves), and leakers. Hardest part of the job is basically the job itself. You have to be able to lift up to 70lbs, and the work is consistent."
good,It was a nice place. Co-workers were friendly.  I learned how to stack packages in a neat row.
good,This job gives you great opportunity to learn about how to become a UPS Driver.
good,"Physical and busy always had something to do, with the most helpful co workers we worked as a team and always got the job done"
good,A typical day at work is basically the same everyday. Packages are recieved down a slide or conveyer belt. I grab the package watching for any reason why the contents might be dangerous or compromised. Scan the package in which a machine will tell me what particular truck route to send the package to. Quite easy but repetetive.
good,I only worked here as a seasonal employee but the experience was awesome. I was able to work side by side with an official driver who taught me a lot about delivering packages. Overall the UPS company made work for myself a breeze. I really enjoyed being out in the field.
good,"Co-workers were easy to get along managers,where easy to speak with no neatives other than the pay."
good,Came to work when scheduled and assisted customers in questions and concerns. Handled cash and credit transactions. Cleaned and organized work area and stocked shelves.
good,great place to work and they understand that life happens. very reasonable.
good,Great job with good hours and benefits. Good hours with weekends off. Management was okay. Co-workers questionable!
good,"Typical day in ups was 4 hours of picking,scanning,and loading. I learned the meaning of hard labor and how to multitask in a hastel environment. Management is all about results and push to get the most out of each employee. not much interaction wit other employees. Hardest part was the labor. the most for filling part is doing the labor a see u can stack almost 1000 boxes a night"
good,"Good Place to work, great people, great benefits"
good,"Fast-paced, customer service and good people skills needed"
good,When working as a driver helper they inform you when you are gonna work the morning before your driver calls you. You meet your driver at an agreed location. The work is very easy.
good,this is the one of the oldest company from the logistics domain..
good,"drop off packages, call everyday for work, a lot of stairs to walk up"
good,"Working at UPS entails non-stop manual labor. The job is physically demanding but it makes time fly. At the very least it provides a decent full body workout. I learned how to be very productive at a job  while working here. The upper level management seems to know what they are doing, but entry level management is often confused and very incompetent. All of the co-workers are friendly, and everyone seems to get along. The hardest part of the job is exerting so much energy to load packages. The most enjoyable part of the job is feeling part of something greater than myself because the union makes it feel like I'm in a family at work."
good,"I had a whole of fun work at UPS and I learn a lot about UPS, if you want a job while in college or you need a part time job UPS is the place to go."
good,it is a great place to work. i enjoy working for ups freight. the work environment is warm and friend.
good,its always a good day on the job delivering packages to businesses and residents.
good,"work here can get tedious if you let it get to you, but co workers can be fun to be around. benefits are great if you can handle graveyard shift"
good,"A typical day for me is, I would come and clock in, get my scanner and they would tell me which truck to start in, I would load the packages in the truck, and some days they would have me sorting packages."
good,"UPS is a good job, had to quit due to personal reasons. I learned that this is not a job for everyone. Had great managers and sociable managers. The hardest part of the job is it's physical demands, the most enjoyable part of the job is ensuring everyone gets their package"
good,A day at UPS was monday through friday come in and start pulling packages from the box line and loading them in the package cars according to sequence numbers. I learned how to load tight and load efficiently in a timely manner. The hardest part was when i would get slammed with boxes all at once.
good,"UPS is the largest shipment and Logistics Company in the world. UPS's primary business is the time-definite delivery of packages and documents worldwide."
good,"At a typical day at work I would start by signing into my scanner that would scan every box that goes into my trailer.

good,UPS was a challenging environment to work in. 24 hrs operation
good,Everyday is non stop. Working from start to finish to deliver packages at a reasonable time. Plus working in different weather conditions makes the job more difficult but managing your time and pace makes the job workable. My co-workers are fun and energetic and very dependable. The Hardest part about the job is working when it rain and snow. The most enjoyable part is delivery the packages to each customer on time and seeing their smile and hearing their thank yous.

My co-workers were the best people to work with all the time. the hardest part of being a guard was putting yourself in harms way all the time. The most enjoyable part was doing a double shift, because that was a whole other 8 hours all at once."
good,"Everyday presents new challenges and opportunities to learn. I started off as a loader and after a few months of hard work and determination, I advanced to a supervisor. I was glad to have started at the bottom so I could learn the layouts of trucks and how detailed the job needed to be.

good,"UPS offers excellent benefits including 100% company paid healthcare, as well as 401k, life insurance, and employee discounts with numerous companies. Management can be a bit on the overbearing and disorganized side at times, but I believe that is with any company. Do not expect to make a lot of money here as a part time worker, hours are between 10-20 a week, with 20 hours being rare, at least within my hub. Overall, pretty decent place to work."

good,"Though, hectic in Christmas, when I worked with them, there was still plenty of time to chat with the people by me. The managers though were distant from us temporary employment and only just tolerable of problems. I didn't have enough time to meet all of my co-workers and don't remember most of their names since it has been a few years, but we got along well enough for work. I'd say the hardest part of my work was the dizziness danger from constantly turning around to sort packages, but even so, I liked the activity and the exercise of it."

good,"I enjoyed working for UPS, I just wished it was on a permanent basis instead of seasonal"
good,This is a great job if you are looking for part time. You keep busy the entire time you are there. They are good to their employees.
good,The organization of the employees by Local 705 makes good job security. Most of the managerial personnel appear power crazed and come off as jerks. There are diverse employees and the company has wonderful benefits including CRCP and Earn&Learn which assist employees with school funding. The company offers stock options and retirement plans and programs for employees.
good,"As an hourly, you are expected to keep a fast productive pace to move the packages through the system.

My co-workers and I work very well together and we always seem to get everything done on time, except for the holidays. The most enjoyable part of the job is when work slows down and you get to see how sweaty everyone is from all the hard work. The hardest part of the job is around the holidays when we get more work than usual. It gets very intense, but it's a challenge that I love to face. Working with UPS, I've learned to be very observant. You have to be aware of the work coming at you, the people around you, and the contents that you are handling. "
good,Everything was great at UPS other then the union. When the union makes a mistake like losing an application they won't take fault for it but instead take half of your paycheck.
good,If you like waking up early and don't mind sweating on the job then this place is for you. The benefits are great and so are the hours needed to keep them.
good,UPS SCS is a very high paced work environment.  You are constantly busy which I like.  However there is not much room for movement within the company or advancement.  Co workers are the best you could ask for.  THe hardest part of working for UPS is the constant rule changes and implementation of many many steps in the process of importing / exporting.  The most enjoyable part is pretty much every ascpet of what I do.  I enjoy my work.  The only part I could say is not the best is the commute and the low raise scale.

My co-workers are fun and works hard and make sure that all work is completed. The hardest part about the job is dealing with the weather. The enjoyable part about the job is seeing the smile I put on peoples faces.
good,"There nothing to much i can say about this job.I clock in get ready for the work in the afternoon.I have very great co-workers,I've learned on this job if u feel lazy you work lazy so I always come to work with that im ready attitude, brings out the best of my ability to work. The management is not good they dont send help when it is needed they never check on the belts as much to see how everything is going and there horrible on going down on time. the hardest part about the job is keeping that pace when u need a quick water break,theres so many package coming at you,you cant stop.The most enjoyable thing about this job is the workout."
good,"this is a great plave to worl and very nice area, co-worker are great."
good,"-A typical day at work would start off with me putting on my uniform. You have to get dressed at work because you have to to leave your uniforms at the office.

good,"A typical day at work was full of packages to be tracked and forwarded to the correct consignee address.  I learned that if you do not make it happen; no one else will.  I worked with an excellent array of resources.  The hardest part of the job was to finish all the packages; and clear customs on some international packages.  The most enjoyable part of the job was when i received news that the package was received."
good,"The job itself is easy to understand, yet challenging due to strict time limits. The hours are consistent (Monday - Friday, stats off). This is a unionized job, so job security is fair, as well as wage increases and wage caps. The downfall is that this is only a part time job, and opportunities for advancement are minimal.  The company does promote within, however, and available positions are posted within the workplace."
good,"From the moment you walk in until the moment you are (trying) to leave, this company demands respect, safety, and a devotion to production in both qualitative and quantitative terms. The management team is exquisite and is primarily composed of veterans from all different branches of military. Your coworkers are there to support and head in any way possible. The hardest part of the job is understanding and putting together better operation plans, within the same amount of hours/employees that are at hand. "

The project allowed me to interact with different stakeholders from various levels and particularly the SMEs. Management team are supportive though at times, they could be extremely so busy with meeting up with their global targets but because they all bought in to the project, they were very supportive. There was great collaboration between the project team members and we interacted through walk through and JAD sessions.The hardest part of the job is the scope crippling because of ever growing functional requirements which the company always wanted to include and were later scrutinised based on priority, budget and value added. The most interesting part of the job is the support from the business and stakeholders, unhindered communication across the levels and structured workplace.  "
good,Delivering packages to residents and business all around  town. 
good,"This is a great job if you are not looking for a long term career. I would love to continue in this type work, however, there is no room to move up and advance in my career and pay. "
good,"Hard physical labor. Some of the most loyal and stubborn people to work with. Management is strict and will push you out if you don't meet exspectations. The Union makes it worth it as they make sure we where paid well and that our madical needs where completely met, for us and our familys."
good,fast paced detail oriented time sensitive work environment
good,I would provided customer service to UPS's clients who were looking to open an account with UPS. I would suggestive sell and maintain a positive relationship with new and existing account holders. I enjoyed working with customers and gaining the face to face interaction experience.

good,Review Dvir Daily
good,"Supervise 40+ employees,"
good,"A typical day of work at UPS is usually hard work since i worked in the facility. I had to load and unload a bunch of trucks, recycle damaged or unmarked boxes, & break box jams all day. I definitely leaned about safety when it comes to that type of environment. I learned how to stack objects neater than i usually did, and i also leaned how to lift heavy objects & keep a steady pace while working. Management at UPS wasn't bad. My Supervisor would sometimes rush me when it came to the trucks. I hated that but it was necessary. I loved talking to the more experienced co workers while unloading and loading trucks. We all got along well. The hardest part of the job was having to load and unload a truck alone. One time i had to unload a truck full of refrigerators. The most enjoyable part of the job (besides going home) is probably break time. I get to talk to my friends & we get a good laugh before we have to get back to work."

I got Roger to do a quick technical feasibility analysis whilst I went to see the Mr Babu, the Account Manager. he explained how important it was, so I reviewed the plan and found a way to get the change in without harming the critical path. The team weren't too happy to have to squeeze in another change, but when I explained how helpful it would be to the customer they got down to updating the specification ."
good,"A typical day would be I would come in at 10 or so depending on my schedule, go through security, clock in, and finally wait for my supervisor. After I get the say so I begin work on the conveyor belt. I stayed at the head of the belt and would stand there separating and moving packages on the two sides of the belt. I noticed that permanent workers were not as motivated to do work because of the new temporary employees. They gave us most of the hard work such as taking off heavy packages. I was evetually used to it not to say that I liked it though. The most enjoyable part was getting paid every week. Unfortunately I was only there for about 2 weeks. I learned that even though everyone else may not work hard does not stop you from working hard cause somebody will notice."
good,Working for United Parcel Service was a great experience. I have been employed with the company for 12 years. I started from the ground up to being in management. My internal and external customers worked as a team to have a safe environment and to exceed operational standards.

good,"I've been with UPS since 11/04.Started out unloading tractor trailers,then moved on to the Metro area where I am presently at.I have the highest seniority in the Metro area.I am the last to leave at night because I make sure all the trucks are empty with no packages on them that the other unloaders forgot to unload."
good,"loading and unloading trailers,I learned how to load and scan packages,my co-workers were laid back,holidays were the hardest,I enjoyed getting off of work"
good,"Typical work day consists of breaking frieght, which includes checking pro#'s to the bills/manifest and safely transporting said frieght to the corect bay for loading. Correctly and accurately filling out paper work and doing it all in a timely mannor. I have learned alot at UPS. Primarily how to operate a forklift and properly and safely handle frieght and hazmat alike. Management is solid, no big gaps in the chain of command. I always know who to talk to.The co-workers are some of the best group of guys i have ever worked with. The hardest part of the has to be finding the right blance of qickly unloading a trailer while still being as safe as possible with the customer's product. The best part is that i get to drive, it doesn't matter if it is a forklift, car, or semi, I just love to drive. Plus i get to go home everyday."
good,Working here required me to spend a lot of long nights. This has token way my ability to remember the experience
good,I enjoy working at UPS but not enough hours. Not alot of room for expanding your qualifications to different areas of the workplace.
good,Working with package and hub operations to get required packages sorted and delivered to accurate destinations. High level of internal and external customer service. Time constraints and detail-oriented. Production goals to be met.
good,working at your on pace making sure that othere around you are safe and working productive. picking up boxes of all sizes and objects weighting up to 70lbs onto moving belts along the warehouse.

good,the hardest was getting up in morning and had push two job in one day no fun
good,A typical day at work would be me coming in at 2am scanning and loading 15 trailers by 9am. I have learned not every job is easy because this job requires a lot of energy.
good,"My day was spent reading the order ticket then going to the right place to pick the correct parts and the correct quantity then I would scan the parts and take them to proper place. I learned to pick, to scan, and to ship different products. I had many supervisors in the four years that I worked for UPS they were all knowledgeable and helpful. I enjoyed working at UPS there were many nice people, and I had a fun time. The hardest part of the job was when I worked ten hours a day and had to stand up for the entire time. I enjoyed the variety of work the most."
good,Fast pace work environment
good,i work partime it so cool i love work sorter i would want back ups but my 2nd time i was young very miskate good pay hrs and good benefit
good,Managed all of the day-to-day operations of the business.
good,"It was a retail work place where the most enjoyable part was talking to people, understanding their needs and trying to solve their problems by providing them with the best solution to their needs. Management and coworkers were very cooperative in every respect in order to increase profitability and productivity of the Store"
good,work environment was friendly and everyone did their job well
good,"there was nothing bad about this place only good things. they gave benifits and were really organized, the hardest part of this job was just making sure you got your truck unloaded in a quick enough matter for the company. management was A++ and i would love to get the oppritunity to work at this establishment again"
good,I loaded trailers and built walls of packages from floor to ceiling
good,"UPS a global 105 year company. A great place to start your career, great advancement. Good training skills development."
good,ok job with horrible pay and you could easily get hurt. The long hours and hard work doest reflect the pay.
good,I enjoy working with the public and helping others. which is why I enjoyed working daily. I Enjoy learning new things and catch on quickly. The hardest part of the job was going home at the end of the day. My employees could count on me and know that I would listen when needed. My employer new that I would be there daily as long as he needed me to no mater how many hours I had to put in.
good,i would come in at 6pm and get straight to work. Unloading and loading trucks. i had to be done at a fast pace so we can go to the next shippment.
good,My duties included taking packages in and making sure they were packed correctly. Also to charge the customer and put them on the belt to be distributed to correct truck to be delivered.
good,"My day starts out by running my reports for my daily recon's, I close out my work in UPS Freight to balance out the days work that was charged by credit cards, I then do credit card billing for UPS Freight, SCS Scranton and helping with billing in Mail Innovations."
good,I only worked from 3 am to 8pm then right to college
good,Non climate controlled environment sorting packages thru out the hub
good,A typical day at ups is walking in hot trucks in the summer and cold trucks in the winter and unloading for hours with only a 5 minute break sometimes a 10 min break but i loved it cause it was a challenge for me.
good,"With UPS it was a challenge to get drivers to work with managment because union to non union, but the bottom line is we have customer needs that need to be reached and i would not stop til there needs where met that is my goal."
good,"Always busy, consistently moving, stay busy, work in all conditions"
good,"Could be challenging at times and have to put up with a lot, but overall its a good place to work at especially for students who need a part-time shop while maintaining a school schedule."
good,It was a good place to work and also they have school benefits meaning if your in college U.P.S will pay for your classes if your having good grades in College
good,What i have learned about UPS is that they really care for their employees.. it is very hot in there and the alway provided water and gatorade to the truck loaders. the BBQ for the worker twice a week and fruits at least once a week. It is a great place to work.
good,"I enjoyed working at UPS. The supervisors there were very understanding, and they try to help advance in the company."
good,"Great day at work always on time, great environment having a great employee working with you on daily basics. hardest part of the Job was picking up the even more heavier boxes. enjoyable part of this job is seeing the customers smile when they get there packages and tell you thank you."
good,Great workplace at a fast pace and great learning environment. With great Co workers. But the management just seemed aittle on the sloppy side.
good,loader/unloader. prioritizing special air cargo shipments. proper package handling. safety certified.
good,"I liked working at UPS. steady pay, kept me working hard. co workers were alright. Great pay every week."
good,I loved this job both as an hourly employee and as a Supervisor. This job is always a challenge and never easy. Required me to always be on my toes and ready for whatever can be thrown at me next. It required me to be Physically and Mentally ready at all time to ensure that not only was I safe the but the people who worked around me also.
good,a typical night was great. I sorted packages to different belts. I unloaded the truck that was full with the packages. my managements was very reasonable but there was one that wasn't reasonable.
good,Overall its a Corporate environment based off numbers and a consistent need to uphold company standards and minimum exceptable requirements. UPS desires hard work and 100% effort on a daily basis.
good,"Overall, my experience with UPS has been good. I believe that the compensation could be better when it comes to certain positions. I haven't had an issue with the people I work with or work for. Some of the management styles are different and I don't always agree with then. I have a pretty good schedule that allows me to have a personal life. The core values and culture can be a little better. There is a lot of favortism involved and politics,"
good,Make sure reports are completed in a timely manner for my management team. Help with training new employees to process packages.
good,Daily work would entail delivery of parcels or packages. Some packages would take priority due to next day air delivery status. Driver I worked with was very educated & very friendly.
good,"I enjoyed wirking for ups other than the management, I feel that the supervisors didnt know there job as good as they should."
good,"Work is very fast paced, if you plan to stay you need to learn how to work quick and carefully with the initiative to move from one task to the next in order to get the job done."
good,My day would consist of loading packages into semi-truck trailers for 4-5 hours.
good,As Security/LP supervisor you:
good,This is a great company with many years of experience and that has made a brand for themselves. There are definitely plenty of life experiences to take away from this company.
good,Enjoyed working there. It allowed me to work part-time and have a life. The pay was good and the work was hard. Would work there again if the opportunity presented itself.
good,"Hot , fast paced work environment with little breaks.Overall a good place to a start a career."
good,i enjoyed this company i miss this job though the work and hours were tough it was still a great job
good,"I retired from United Parcel Service (UPS) on December 31, 2010 (early retirement package) after thirty five years of service. While at UPS I managed different departments within Operations (Delivery), Transportation (tractor trailer division), Human Resources, Labor Relations, and Public Relations, Advanced Planning, Health & Safety and numerous employee training programs. I have managed union, non- union and management work groups."
good,"UPS is a professionally managed company. I am impressed by these company's recruitment, hiring, training and personnel mangement procedures within the two months period I have worked with this company sofar."
good,Working at UPS on a typical day is like summer vacation. It's ease a cave man can do it! You will always have a smile on your face when dealing co-workers.The hardest part of the job is been on time with delivers but your driver will help you compensate.good job hunting :)
good,I loved working for this company they have plenty of room for advancement and making more money. I enjoy the fact that u can move up quickly and i always had someone to answer my questions if needed.
good,"Great company to work for as an hourly employee, great benefits, good long term pay, 401k, stock, and employee union. However, dealing with management can be difficault and the work is not easy, it takes strong willed people to stay on and succeed."
good,"Typically, each day i would ride with my driver, scanning packages and delivering them to their delivery point (door, porch, etc.). I learned how to use the DPAD, an electronic board used to scan and ""release"" packages from the UPS database, and how to properly carry and deliver packages. Management at UPS was thorough in its training me how to perform my job and it was clear that the management cares about its workers' safety.The hardest part of the job was scanning some packages with distorted bar codes. The most enjoyable parts of the job was getting to exercise while working and interacting with people."
good,Overall a good place to work. Some supervisors are know-it-alls.
good,"Constant moving non stop fast pace, great co-workers and dedicated managers. Hardest part is everything if you dont put forth your best effort."
good,"A typical day of work is usually fast pace, heavy lifting, cordination skills and also managing your work area. I've learned to deal with all kinds of task and multitasking which is involved at UPS. The hardest part of the job is dealing with co workers that do not pull their weight."
good,UPS has a diverse workplace with opportunites to advance and flexible hours.
good,"Working for UPS was a track meet. I learned to do things in order very fast, from boxing, marking, shipping, and taking the package to the customer ""on time"". Management was strict, fair, and if you weren't moving at a productive and efficient pace, you were sent home. It was normally just me and the driver, he was so focused on his task of being on time, we were like clock work, he was a really good driver and friend for the short time I was there. The hardest part of the job, was not being ""late"" considering traffic, you never know how much time you had. We really put a lot of effort into being on time. The most enjoyable part of the job, is during the holiday, we receive gifts from customers."
good,UPS has very good values. Friendly people and fair for everyone.
good,"the beginning of the workday is always unpredictable, you have to be ready to whatever position the supervisor needs you working that day. The hardest part of the job is the constant lifting, but the camaraderie of the workers"
good,"Busy, lots and lots of packages.. Stay focus, get the job done.."
good,Not a bad place to work. Get paid to work out. Great benefits.
good,go into work early in the morning with about 20-30 trailers to unload which takes about 4 hours. I have learned the value of teamwork. The management will step in and take over some of the work if necisary. Co-workers are hard working. the hardest part of the jobs would be unloading a trailer that has shifted its load to a hazardous formation. but the most enjoyable part is being able to work and at the same time being able to be social at work
good,"The company in general was a very good place to work. Partnership was part of UPS culture, strong ethics, good people, good coworkers, friendships. Compensation was avg. but bonuses & stock were also a plus for management. It was for a long time privately held. Things began to change to typical company thinking, metrics etc., many management levels some good, some adversarial once the company went public. I still have great praise and respect for a company I worked for almost 20 years."
good,My type of day at work is non stop. we are constently moving boxes in or out of trucks. I learned to work safe an to work with others. my management team alway makes sure the job is done correctly. the co-workers at my job work just as hard as i do. everyones treated equal. the hardest part of the job would be making sure you dont get behind in your work. the most enjoyable part of my job is getting a work out and getting paid for it lol.
good,you have to want to work and be able to work by yourself. great co-works the bring entergy to the work place. laid back but u have to DO WORK.
good,A typical day a work would consist of loading and unloading trucks and or going with the driver to help deliver all the packages on time because sometimes during the holidays they get really busy
good,"everyday was the same as far as duties. However the opportunities are endless with this company. Excellent benefits. Only a part time job, but they promote from within."
good,Everyday you are met with a different challenge which can be fun and keep you on your toes.
good,On a typical day I would often have to open and close the store by myself which was absolutly fine with me I enjoyed the independent work. I worked directly under my manager so I was an assistant. The hardest part of the job would have had to be filing claims for customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was packing and shipping.
good,"Very intense job, fast work enviorment. Day would go by fast"
good,Sorting 3000 to 4000 packages in a four hours a day. benefits are very good
good,Great place to teach. Students are energetic and alive with the eagerness to learn.
good,good job. but was only pt postion. left for ft position. would go back.
good,This was a part time position during the peak holiday seasons. The company was very supportive of it's employees and had plenty of opportunities for advancement.
good,During my employment with UPS I was taught all about the shipping and receiving industry. The importance of safety always comes first in life and at work. The company stresses the importance of not cutting corners but expects such high production numbers its almost impossible to meet their demands. The benefits to working for such a big corporation is that I was able to learn about all aspects of the industry.
good,"Loved working at ups,valued my time there, and is a good place to work."
good,UPS taught me alot that goes on when it comes to loading/unloading a trucks and everything that goes on within the shippin and receiving business. It doesnt give u that many hours but it gives you steady work.
good,A good all round company to work for enjoyed working with co-workers. Enjoyed being productive and busy. There was a huge management turn over that would bring down moral of employees.
good,UPS is an exciting company to work for. Opportunities for advancement are great.
good,"The benefits are incredible, pay isn't bad and will increase yearly. Overall the best thing to do is stay with the company and become one of their drivers"
good,Overall this is a great company to work for. The compensation package is great and the room for advancement is always there. The only downside I see to working for this company is it involves physical and manual labor.
good,"was only at the ups job for little over a month. It was a seasonal job, but i loved the job."
good,For advancement this place was not the best - however the attendance policy and management were very good.
good,You Might Have Another Thing To do here like load or unload its an easy job with so so hours but you will get a lot during holiday season
good,Working for UPS was also a valuable experience. Being punctual and constantly consistent is essential when having a job like this. Also by working for such a renown company like UPS looks great on a application.
good,"Nice compny with awesome benefits, paid holidays and vacation time"
good,People with seniority get all the hours and it is hard to get a decent amount of hours.
good,I enjoyed working at UPS for the holiday period. My only regret was that they didnt have any open positions after the holiday season. This was due to lack of business.
good,"work at UPS almost 7 years start unlouding trucks ,next bulk driver after 6 years never full time"
good,fast paste productive and sometime fun
good,"Paid for college, and free health insurance. Warehouse environment on live airport. Management could sometimes be a mess with over 6 different bosses."
good,Working here has made me think alot about what I wanna do with myself and the people you meet here and stories you hear will inspire you to push yourself forward
good,"6hr work days starting at 4am almost everyday, however subject to change due to work load for the day. Management is good or working with you time off"
good,"Good part time job, but would like more hours. Hot in the summer. Peak season is the money time for this part time job. The job is a work out and the supervisiors and company provide water."
good,The benefits of UPS are great especially if your a school student in college. They reimburse you for your tuition when you pass the class. Also after a year you are able to get the good benefits like paid vacation days.
good,"trucks arrive, get unloaded then reloaded. pallets are checked for address, weight and size. pallets are scanned, reweighed to the next door or positioned in a staging area where when space available get loaded"
good,I enjoyed my time at UPS. Working here opened my eyes to know what patience & humility is and helped me grow in perseverance. They also treat employees like family & with respect.
good,It was cool the work was very rushed you have to be very in shape and fit for a job like ups you working under harsh weather conditions it can be real cold or real hot not very much in between typical warehouse job though
good,"Great place to work, great environment, fast paced and challenging.  Always learning new tasks and meeting new intresting people."
good,My co-workers are the best thing about going to work. Management is ok. Advancement is complicated. Need to move on and find something new. To much travel time on my personal car eith no reimbursement.
good,"Supervising my subordinates and performing of financial activities as per the job demand. "
good,It's hard work so u don't like working hard it's not a job for u  the only thing is not enough hours to live on if u have slot of bills to pay like we all do good part time job excellent benefits tho
good,"What I have learned while working for UPS (United Parcel Services), is a couple of things. But mostly I have learned is you feel secure in the knowledge that you will have sustainable income, you will have a job, and you are cared for."
good,"They worked with my personal schedule.  Great training, varied co-workers, involved supervisor and good  pay.  Employee safety a priority.  Great team building."
good,UPS was one of my favorite work experiences in my years. My supervisors we're personable and understanding while encouraging and uplifting the motivation of our team. Each day was consistent with volume and unpredictable so it felt nice to break the monotony of a predictable workday in my opinion. They worked with me to help get the shift I wanted and provided a safe and clean work environment for us.
good,My job was to pack trucks with packages at first it wasn’t easy but gradually it wasn’t so bad I enjoyed working with UPS You feel like you’re a part of a family if you don’t know some thing someone’s always there to help you out and that’s what I really appreciated
good,"I was just a seasonal helper, but I had a great time. The only thing that kind of sucked was toward the end of peak season, there wasn't really a consistent schedule. Great work environment."
good,"Is a good place to work ,friendly staff,all the manager are good to work with,the place is good for someone that is looking for small income,because they have pick period and off picknperiod"
good,"This job is a really good job if you are looking to drop a few pounds while getting paid, I highly suggest not overdoing it because it can put a major toll on your body after a few months. The supervisors are always willing to work with you to make sure you're as happy as you can be during a shift, the pay is pretty good. Has great advancement opportunities. Overall I like the job"
good,"Great and professional job environment, awesome place to work at. It was a contract position, but really enjoyed working there.  It was a very professional and diverse place to work."
good,I learned how to work as a team and communicate. The managers are all about saftey and making sure you are a happy employee. the health insurance is also very good incase of injuries.
good,you job is your life from morning to night and you should be very big on time management. communicate and organize everything to be efficient and get the job done.
good,"UPS has a lot of opportunities for all types of employment skill sets.  Management, dock work, driving, clerical, human resources.  The possibilities are endless and they are global."
good,I say it was all around good as a seasonal driver helper loved the job and the pay was 14 hourly I met my driver and he worked with my schedule so much. and the flexibility was 100% in my corner
good,I learned communication skills and learned problem solving and management skills. There are different challenges to learn how to conquer most days. For the most part employees and management were pretty close at my location.
good,As a supervisor the work remains constant. Move people around to the work and complete paperwork. The hardest part would be to keep your employees motivated to continue moving and not stand around playing on their phones.
good,You’re put on real audits and assignments as soon as you start and you get a great feel for what the job will be like after the internship. Everyone was very nice and there are multiple people on your team to help you succeed.
good,Loading trucks is very demanding of your body and maintaining a consistent pace for 2-3 hours at a time is everything. shifts are short usually lasting anywhere from 4-5 hours on the off-season but during peak season (mid November-first 2 weeks of January) can go up to 8 hour shifts. Must wake up early average 4 am start time in off season to as early as 12 am during peak season.
good,"Money, benefits, longevity of working with the company. Opportunity to progress within the company through advancement and the variety of locations..."
good,Im only filling this out beacuse its making me. Its a good work environment very chill not much hard work. Only a part time job if your looking for fil your looking for full time hours
good,"Don’t expect to get paid great unless you are full time."
good,"Everything in the warehouse is gray. But the people I work with are in general kind, smart and very energetic. The supervisors watch you like a hawk, so that's a little awkward."
good,Very interactive physical environment will lots of opportunity to move up in management or otherwise. Pretty laid back work environment despite the fast pace
good,I honestly believe this job was amazing for the simple fact that you can move up in the company very fast. My role as a delivery driver helper was to help the delivery driver to accomplish his goal of reaching every house on time and making sure everyone got their packages. This was a good experience for me because I got to build relationships with new people everyday and I got the opportunity to build almost a father relationship with my delivery driver.
good,It was a fun place to work and even though you work hard people are nice and like to have. Everyone was chill and made it a fun place to come every night.
good,"I worked as a Seasonal Delivery Helper for UPS and learned alot about the working environment over my three months working there."
good,"There is plenty of room to grow. The company makes clear there is a ""hire from within"" culture and actually follows through on it. good work life balance and schedule flexibility."
good,"Overall part time job.  Great benefits for part time employee.  Hard labor, lonhg hours expecially during peak season. Good Hours and fair management."
good,Really unable to evaluate UPS as I was only a temporary employee. My time spent was good. I like the independence of the position. Everything I did was well organized. Everyone I worked with was courteous and respectful.
good,UPS definitely has its ups and downs. It can be really hard and defeating work. What makes it worth it is that the benefits and quality of life that UPS can provide for you is outstanding.
good,It was a productive place to work at and a  good experience for me and i also liked that i could work 3rd shift and it was a warehouse job. My supervisor made sure we had everything we needed .
good,"I feel the overall business culture at UPS is strong.  Hard working employees are their strongest assets."
good,"As a truck loader and unloader, the company keeps the job simple. If you come in on time to your shift and load/unload the trucks until the work is done, it is easy to manage."
good,Overall my experience working for  UPS was outstanding friendly work environment plenty of information and plenty of work with options to take it as a career
good,an amazing job for any night owl! the job is fast paced but a great workout. does put you in a set back with real life at times but does help you out in any way possible with personal or school related life.
good,Would work there again if the opportunity presents itself.  UPS is a great company to work for.  The hardest part of the job was not knowing on a day to day basis how many packages were being delivered.
good,on a typical workday employees are consistently given clear directions as per what needs to be done.  keeping focus on amounts of inventory was of great importance. Location of various products had paramount importance.
good,was amazing i loved working here. they make sure you are safe and they make sure you know how to use every equipment before the put you somewhere they go over every safety tip there is.
good,"Everyone starts as a package handler at UPS, there are very few exceptions. Great paid work out and opportunity to advance position. Do not start on Amazon day."
good,It was a wonderful experience and a great opportunity..I learned so much life lessons there as well as met so many great people. My overall experience there was wonderful.
good,"Ups is wonderful to work with, they strive for customer satisfaction, ups makes it there priority to satisfy their customers. Working with ups has plenty of work positions to move around within the company."
good,"For my job I load trucks which basically is like playing Tetris you have to be quick. This job keeps you active and moving around a lot so you are losing weight and building body mass all in one like a gym membership, but your job."
good,"They are a great compony to work for, the best of benefits it just takes a long time to get there. They pay for schooling, you can go places here! Your pushed pretty hard but, once you get the hang, it's a piece of cake! If you can't handle a little stress don't even try. It all so helps to do the drivers helper at lest once to help you to learn the proper way of loading an that makes for a smooth delivery  and every one get a long"
good,"I take being a coach extremely seriously. When I interviewed for the job the head football coach of the Suns let me know he was trying to build a championship culture. All coaches want to have a championship culture, but view know exactly what is needed to get there. After our first meeting and me watching film, I realized that we had a lot of work to do. What I also realized is that our DC had no business being in control of the defense. Seeing this I told the head coach that he was not ready to be the DC, at that point I was asked to teach the DC how to be a DC. I was reinsure that this year would be different. "
good,Good easy job cool people to be around met some new people who are my friends now they are not up tight you can listen to music while working which is nice
good,Ups gave me confidence. Confidence in my physical abilities as well as in my own personal goals. They have a great training program. I felt well prepared. Other employees offered tips and assists. Managers that where hands on.
good,"Enjoy this job, great workers. Haven't been here long but enjoy it so far. Hoping to get on full-time and in a permanent position with this company to make a career out of it."
good,Worked as a package handler for a year and met some great guys. Not a job you want to do for the long run due to the toll it takes on your body but for a temporary job it's not the worst.
good,Great place to work. During peak season it gets really fast paced and tons of work. Very fast paced environment. As a Supervisor you may have to jump in and pre-load a truck with package handler because of the increase in volume during peak.
good,"UPS pays very well for a part time position. They also have great benefits for medical, dental, and vision which they pay for. They give PTO and the culture is very relaxed. You do not take work home."
good,Was not worth it only because of Operations Manager and Superintendent pushing us to the limit physically and mentally by talking to us like dirt and holding us accountable for many unfair things like pushing our employees to work at a extremely fast pace.
good,It was a good job only reason I don’t work there now is because of the sports I played. I don’t recommend working there if you are not ready to work for the money you do get depending on where they place you.
good,"Pain  hours. Pain bosses. Pain  drivers. But, at the end of the day well worth it..IF... you strong enough....long day all kinds of weather. It's not for everybody."
good,I enjoy working for UPS overall. The work is tough but very rewarding. The company is very important to other businesses and they take great pride in the services they offer.
good,Ups is a good company with many opportunities. You can grow within this company and open many other doors for yourself. It comes with great benefits and a lot of room for growth.
good,"Left due to cuts in benefits including medical and pension.  Over all UPS was a very good company to work for,  but over the years  the reduction in benefits  and the demands on an individual's time took its toll."
good,"Very fast paced/loud work environment with heavy lifting (70lbs+), walking at a brisk pace, organizing and team work. Communication and motivation between individuals to help keep up with and improve productivity."
good,"It was all easy and self explanatory so the training isn't hard. The only hard part were depending on the hours you work, but once you got going the days fly by."
good,"If you like to work hard, don't mind being in a fast paced environment, ups us for you. Great benefits, great company. I've been with ups for 11yrs. And don't plan on leaving!"
good,Work for the ups will give you a lot of experience on how tools and machnary work. They provide opportunity to grow you and you leave work learning something new .
good,"UPS is a great place to work. Lots of opportunities for growth. It was hard for me to leave, but family came first, and UPS management supported me in my decision."
good,i would start my day loading boxes then later on i would be unloading boxes and usually trucks would have over 500 boxes and needed to be scanned by the other employees
good,Good place to start out working. Definitely not a place you want to spend the rest of your life there if you don't plan to move up. Great people to work with.
good,"Though ive had my issues at UPS and issues outside of work affect my job at times it was a wise decision to apply at UPS. I make almost 17 an hour and i pay 10 dollar copays and thats it for my medical outside of that. Also, being part of a union gives you power when negotiating with your employer"
good,"Not an easy job for those not in good physical shape. It is a male dominated environment and very loud at times. The weather can make your job easier or harder, depending on the time of year. Benefits are very good for a part time job. I would recommend this job for any students as they offer excellent tuition assistance."
good,"Great company, fast paced, time sensitive "
good,"It is a very fast paced and physically demanding job. It requires for employees to be alert and physically fit. The environment can be a lot of fun, when you get along with coworkers."
good,If the pay wasnt so low id probably still work here. In my role i would spend no more than 4-6 hours there loading or unloading packages and when you finish up with what youre doing you go home-
good,"It’s not for everyone, but if you can stick it out then I think it’s worth it . It takes a while to get your health benefits, but you can your school reimbursement as soon as you start work there"
good,It's a good company to work for if you are looking for benefits. It offers tuition reimbursement good medical benefits and a hard-working environment they build you from within and help you to appreciate your paycheck because you earned it with the hard work you've done.
good,ups moves fast and efficient. you have to be able to keep up or you probably aren't the best fit. if you're able to maintain a balanced pace you should be fine though. ive learned a lot from the management there with work ethic and how to get raises or get seen by the higher-ups faster. So if you see yourself as a hard worker then you should be just fine.
good,"There is a certain climate, a culture of associates who truly care about the commitment to service, long before the package exits the truck onto the conveyor belt. Supervisors care about their lined and their crew.  The training is superb.  The climate, friendly, busy."
good,The workplace is a bit stressful during holidays but the management is respectful and professional. Workers are given plenty of accomodations and benefits such as sickpay and vacations.
good,fast paced warehouse bit stressful but work as good team work and mangers and all team in same boat and work through together and get hands dirty nice place to work
good,Busy and challenging environment. Many associates of differing cultures. Requires that you abide by workplace grooming and dresscode policies.   A good place to work if you need a dependable job.
good,"UPS, a true logistics giant, is gaining traction on becoming a more agile multi-faced beast (in the positive meaning of the word). With its financial capabilities and 'refreshed' mindset it will be an unstoppable train in the world of transportation (and beyond). "
good,Ups is a good place to work if you need a part time job and want to get paid every week. Other than that it is a hard labor job if you are a loader or unloaded.
good,"A typical day at work is answering work emails, reconcile accounts, do research, do any early adjustment entries, follow up on any aged items, communicate any issues that needs corrective action to management. During close, I go through the closing checklist, do accrual, adjustment entries, reclass entries, deferral and amortizing entries.  I learned how to manage my time effectively, work effectively under pressure, multi-tasking. Management at UPS are very helpful and understanding. Workplace culture is very friendly. The hardest part of the job is when certain application are down and we have to postpone the work. The most enjoyable part of the job is since we are busy most of the days, time goes by so fast."
good,"If you just need a seasonal job for some extra holiday money, it is definitely a recommended place. You must be capable of working at a fast pace and able to lift 30 - 50lb consistently, with heavier packages occasionally as well."
good,I learned how to work fast and and how to control any work environment I’m in. It’s fast controlled work area so you had to be strong and fit to work there.
good,"Working at UPS was definitely a challenge for me when I first started. I was a lot slower than the people that had worked there for a few years before me so I got very discouraged but after  a while when I got used to it I started to like it a little bit more but it was super hard work. I made a lot of good friends working there and they always made it a fun day and/or night. The friends I made and the amazing insurance they provided, and that they paid for your college tuition 100%, were definitely a few reasons I stayed there for as long as did."
good,I really recommend that working at UPS store is really good. The have a good working environment. Salary system is good for someone. They also have the job security.
good,The job is very fast paced. We’re dealing with thousands of packages a day. It keeps you busy so the time goes by fast. Everyone is working towards the same goal so there’s leverage. The benefits are really good.
good,I worked as a driver assist for the Christmas holiday and before the job was over my driver asked would I be back next year and I said NO..I almost got bit by a dog from a residents house if I didn't run I would have got bit and the only thing the driver did was laugh and told me not to kick the dog cause it was company policy not to hit residents animals cause you will get fired. After that I didn't care for the job..care about the job .
good,I liked working at ups but it was time for a new experience in a working life and I would like to expand my working environments and meet new people as I work
good,"If you like lifting heavy boxes and being inside trailers for 4-5 hrs a day being hot or cold then it’s the job for you. I worked for UPS In Russellville, AR and Columbia, SC and it was intense work and fast paced. I would recommend it to friends or family if they want to make money on the side."
good,A typical day would be clocking in and getting straight to work. I learned how the company was ran from the inside. The managers were helpful and cool. Everybody worked hard and the hardest part was having enough room inside the trucks. I enjoyed the employees the most.
good,Employers are supportive. Good atmosphere to work. Everyone supports each other in their needs. Sometimes work load increases which is good as it will allow more gain in knowledge and multitasking.
good,My time working there was a good experience for my first job. The pay was reasonable and the hours were good. The hours are very early in the morning and in the Christmas season you go in even earlier ranging from 12 AM to 3 AM. My sleep schedule was a bit messed up but the paycheck was definitely worth it.
good,The hardest part about the job is the physical effort you have to put in and at time it can be frustrating. It’s all about understanding things can change within minutes and a issue will occur but knowing how to pick yourself back up.
good,It's best while you're there to do your work nothing more nothing less because   you could be in Jeopardy of losing your job just for helping your full time supervisor. So be cation
good,It was really cool to work for ups. It was seasonal but i learned a lot of new things and learned there technology on how to the devices for delivering mail. Every driver i had was cool
good,UPS gave me  perspective of what it is like working in a warehouse setting . Working at UPS allowed me to push myself physically and mentally in order to successfully complete my shift .
good,Be prepared to sweat and hurt everyday. This is an environment with no heat and no air. You’ll have to lift on average 40 lb boxes all day for 5-6 hours.
good,UPS is a very good place to work and if you want to build a career. The environment is a fast pace and you have to be healthy in order to meet up with the demanding work duties.
good,Great place to work if you are willing to relocate for promotion. If you put in the effort you will get promoted. There are also options for advancement within the building.
good,I overall enjoy my experience at ups. The flatbed division closed down while I was advancing my career in school and going into management.  I am finding it harder to transfer into other departments.
good,"Loved the atmosphere. Loved the comradary. Great money, benefits. Learned alot about the job and, myself. Very good management with attention to personel. If their was a problem it got listened to and fixed. Very much appreciative of the friends the training I recieved while employed."
good,"I have worked for UPS for 11 years and it is a great company to work for.  They have amazing benefits and chances for advancement.   UPS is the type of place that will give you all the work you can handle, but you should be aware that they will work you like a robot if you let them, and they will not care when you start hurting from all the stress on your joints.  My suggestion is to get in and try to go into management if that is what you are interested in.  Otherwise, be ready to work hard in the elements everyday till you retire."
good,Unload packages from trucks that way from 5 lb to 70. Had the most wonderful management. I also learned how to work in extreme heat. The hardest part of the job was not being a full-time employee
good,"Amazing benifits for a part time job. Great starting pay and yearly raises. Its really hard work, in the summer youll be sweating and in the winter freezing. Weekends off and regular hours. 2 weeks of paid vacation per year. It is hard to get days off though."
good,UPS is a good job for people that are planning on becoming a driver but it my case I am not trying to become a driver and I want to go to college and I am not becoming a driver.
good,I love my job at UPS. I applied many years ago in another city and didn’t get hired. I’m happy although much older to be working for UPS work hard be on time and be dependable and you’ll be ok.
good,"i would recommend this job to someone looking. It was a very fast paced job, but managers worked with employees. When i was late to the job, they asked why i was late and never wrote me up. In my time there i learned how to unload and handle packages with care."
good,"From my experience, make sure you're apart of the union. Be a self advocate and don't allow management to over work you. Exercise, stafy, common sense and logic  while working."
good,A regular day at UPS was just unloading and loading trailers. I've learned how to properly lift and move around packages. Management was great friendly and straight forward. I think the hardest part of the job were the heavier packages and moving them to where they needed to go.
good,"UPS is a great work place with a lot of great opportunity, growth, & benefits. There's always room to grow and move up in the company. You also have the opportunity to join the union."
good,"Working at UPS definitely was a great experience as far as being my first warehouse job and also working hands-on."
good,"Fun, exciting place to work with constant change.  Opportunity to learn a lot and build a career within a career. Able to work on a global scale with great people."
good,Working as a Seasonal assistant package handler for UPS is a good job to work during the Holiday Season. UPS pays well and it gets you actively working. You just ride along with the UPS driver and deliver the package to the door that they specify.
good,overall good place to work Union based employee environment. hot working conditions and fast work pace. typical work day varies between 3 to 6 hours on  4 different shifts
good,Everyone there is pretty much friendly and productive. The work is hard but once you get used to it it's easy. Theres not alot of bad things I can say about UPS I think it's a good company.
good,"some days would be hectic especially during peak season, everyone would most likely do a double part or full time but other than that its a good job to have."
good,10 minute breaks are a little short but a lot of work has to get done. Every Friday there is a meeting to show who the top employees of the week are. The job can speed up very quickly and stressful
good,The job itself is very stressful at times and can get quite exhausting on the heavy/busy days. The weight of the packages can also cause quick fatigue and muscle soreness. The pay and benefits are what the hard days work worth it all.
good,"Management does not the recognition and support it deserves. The company makes it very difficult to move up within the company. If you are a union hourly employee it is an amazing company to work for due to the amazing benefits the union offers among other things like; tuition reimbursement, legal assistance and discounts for countless items."
good,A typical day at work was like doing my everyday thing boxing boxes and walking the lines making sure everything was right and not sending the wrong things I learned that somewhere in life I will need a hand from a friend and the hardest part was doing a line by my self so time it was just to much and I start to get pain in my body but over all it was okay
good,It was a really good job. I worked daily monday through friday and i liked it alot i wish i kept the job but i moved it was a hard job i would consider it one of the hardest jobs ive had
good,"Being a loader isn't the best but its good money. management could be better but overall its a good job and the people you work with are awesome. very hard on your body, wouldnt recommend staying long term. i have back issues and horrible cramps. they dont care about your overall health. either way i wouldnt want to work there i was just there to make money until i found a better job."
good,"I worked for this company for a lot of years.  The benefits are great.  It’s a tough place to work but has its upside if you put the time in. Downside, LONG hours"
good,"I was a package handler so it's a fast paced, no sitting type of a job but the pay was adequate. I just wished they would let me work full-time. The work is very heavy but it's worth it. Kind of like getting payed to work out."
good,My overall experience at UPS was very good. The interview process is very smooth along with the staff helping you through anything you would need. This company also gives great benefits.
good,"5k per year tuition assistance, fast-paced manual labor, wide variety of job positions available if you ask, management is highly concerned about preventing injuries."
good,"Everyday we started with a safety meeting, from there we started the unloading process of trailers, I trained new employees on how to safely unload trailers, how to correctly move people to trailers they worked in the best, the hardest part of the day was leaving because the job was exciting and the people i worked with were hardworking and fun."
good,There are duties to do a UPS and you get a lot of work. The paid is great and the benefit are through the roof.It is a great team environment. They train you how to do the job before you work the hard stuff or difficult stuff.
good,Got my start in the business world.  Felt proud to go to work while getting my education.  Great fun working so many hard-working people.  Salary and benefits were great.
good,Heavy work environment with a little of help from co workers management will help with a little of your problems just will not get any hours really and no new pay
good,A typical day at UPS varies depending on where you work inside the hub.I typically work as a sorter so I'll speak about what I commonly do. Making sure I correctly place packages on the correct conveyor belt as a sorter is what i do daily. You move at a rapid pace while lifting and lowering packages of fluctuating weights. Simple but can become physically tiring throughout the day. I've learned various things during my employment concerning operations/laborer and management. Your day as a operation/laborer can change greatly if you have competent management leading. Since its such a small barrier of entry to move up in management here you never know if your supervisor is adequate at management. Workplace culture is typical of any warehouse crude and loud. Hardest part of the job to me is following orders of a supervisor who may not have a plan of action to deal with common problems we face at the job. The most enjoyable part is knowing its promotional opportunities and a plethora of benefits to keep you with the company.
good,"Typical day is loading and unloading freight from trailers, Dock can get messy and the pace picks up very fast once drivers start bringing loads back from companies at night. You  work in the elements so its cold in winter, hot in summer. I like my co-workers, they're mostly good guys and easy to get along with. Some may have slower work ethic but most are efficient."
good,"Extremely high-energy, consistently brisk-paced. NOT a ""hold your hand"" company. You have to perform and take initiative at UPS. However, you are compensated fairly well. UNION benefits are top rate."
good,"There are many positions within the company where you can move or be promoted, there are never a slow day. Great people and great work environment. I’ve learned so much in my 3 and half years there I started as union and now im management."
good,"Decent Job if you don't mind labour. Reasonable hours and competitive pay, nice benefits too. Other workers are warm and friendly. Only downside is how they handle manpower at times of the year when packages come in droves eg holidays"
good,"I worked as a driver's helper for seasonal, but my time there was phenomenal. All the drivers were helpful and easy to talk to. The hardest part of the job was carrying heavy objects, like t.v., car parts, and foods."
good,"It’s hot, it’s cold but in the end you’re moving boxes to their next destination and you have to be able to adjust quickly. Always be sure to have water at all times."
good,Worked there for 2 weeks before becoming a belt tender.mark kopech was the one who would tell me where problem was he was good person to work with me and him had a system that worked and my supervisor ernest was a good guy to work for.I worked in outbound 10 but I was always helping out all the bartenders because I knew the whole building and where everything was and they would let me always get 35hrs in. was the best job I had I loved it and miss the people  there.
good,"The hardest thing to adjust with the job is the physical adjustment through the summer months, but the management, supervisors, and coworkers are helpful to each worker to encourage health recommendations (more water, stretching, and knowledge about what to do if heatstroke hits). The most enjoyable part is working with others and the allowance of music played while working."
good,strong operational structure and job security.  Very strong audit compliance required and proffessional  expectations.  dependable and predicable operational performance
good,"Good money, fast paced! Overtime hours available most weeks. Employees friendly and helpful. Career advancement available for those who want it. Great medical benefits."
good,"- oversee day to day operations"
good,UPS offers tuition assistance which is very attractive as well as fully paid benefits after one year of service.I have been there for three years and look forward to many more.
good,The most difficult part of the job is having to depend on others who aren't pulling their weight and supervisors who don't address that issue. Aside from that the pace is fast but mostly manageable.
good,A typical day for me is basically stacking boxes for about 4 hrs everyday. Didn't really enjoy much but i did learn discipline. Good for a first job or if you really want to rise through the ranks.
good,"Walking into the UPS warehouse brings a smile to those who seek hard work and lots of great sweat to burn off. Overall great working environment, love it and the hard stressful work."
good,I don't really think there was a hard about about my particular job at the time as i was a season driver helper and one of the things that made it so enjoyable for me is that I got paired up with an amazing driver and we just clicked so it worked out.
good,"A good place to work, good people to work for, other employees r nice, and comfortable to work with, a fast paced job, but pay is good, especially during holiday time"
good,"Everyone is very helpful, just takes a long time to move around to a desired position in the company. Tight security, very fast pace so if you cant keep up i dont know what to tell you"
good,"I love working for UPS. I love the physical part of my job. I am a stay on my feet type of worker who loves to multi task and work hard. UPS provides opportunities to learn different skills in several sections of the warehouse. All of the management team get along well. We work hard together to get the job done. Safety is a huge concern at UPS and I like that. Supervisors are heavily trained on safety as well as operations, labor relations,HAZMAT safety and much more."
good,I began to work at UPS since I was 19. I am 23 now debt free from college. The hours are flexible and make decent pay for a college student. I can’t complain about the job is hard-working environment.
good,"Good part time job for college students. Guaranteed 3.5 hours a day. Have to know how to drive, driving standard is a plus! It is a very up beat working environment. Have to work fast and efficiently, almost like a work out."
good,The work place can get pretty hectic and heavy especially during the holiday seasons.However the union benefits are very good especially for a part time job.
good,it was not that hard and a typical day was very easy i learned alot from my experience i would work there again if i could the people there was always happy
good,I enjoy working the fast paced day and working on my own. My managers are responsive and listen to my ideas and feedback on how to make things more efficient.
good,"Good company, with advancement opportunities. Management is very understanding of everyday issues. Fast paced. No time for lounging. No break until the end of day"
good,"Fun and fast pace a good place start for working and family friendly. Great benefits for a work, helpful training staff for the jobs as needed. Management work with you on all need work and family well being."
good,"I would stay as a package handler instead of moving up to management, less stress and get paid more. Because this is union job, good job for package handlers but not management."
good,"The typical work day includes loading packages into container, that is then put into an airplane. This job is very demanding and requires a ton of hard work and dedication. The best part about this job is our coworkers and the amazing benefits that you receive as an union employee. The worst part about the job is the exhaustion that you feel at the end of the day."
good,I feel my time at ups was not a bad experience. We were able to be very open with our sups i was challenged daily as a representative. I was afforded many opportunities for project and also be the chair over our non-profit team as well.
good,"I enjoy working for UPS due to the fact that each day follows a similar routine based on the arrival/departure schedules, but at the same time the details of each day (such as the number of packages for each destination) require you to adapt and adjust in order to perform well."
good,This is a great place to start a career especially if you are young and going to school. Work and fast paced and difficult at times. Great benifits and opportunity for advancement.
good,"The company have a great technology and logistics to perform the job on the best way ."
good,Good job for your future if you work hard. Very high paced with no guaranteed help. Will get you in shape and the people there are pretty cool once you get to know em
good,"workload is pretty easy and straightforward. the system there is pretty structured, so it's difficult to deviate from it. can be a bit stressful during peak season (e.g. Black Friday to Christmas), but overall, quite enjoyable."
good,"Everyone worked on their own trucks and although it was stressful and fast paced, it felt very good leaving out of the job site sweating. It was a bit of a personal race to get boxes into the truck by 8 am, but help was always provided. Sometimes you may get hit with heavy loads or more packages than expected but they definitely work you up until what you are capable of doing and dont overwork you. Overall they are a pretty great job to work for, very nice managers, and you can move easily to different departments."
good,"Greaty place to work. Worked out of Chantilly and loved it. Its fast paced and almost like working and working out at the same time. You constantly walking up and down stairs, lifting boxes, loading/unloading trucks. The only issue I had was the turnover on management, they were never there more than a few months."
good,"It was a nice job to have while in school. The benefits of going to school while working there help to make the experience better. Management cared about their employees and knew the situations of most very well. It was a relaxed feel, but also high paced work place that kept you moving and making decisions."
good,"I usually met the driver at a designated spot and parked the car. I was a seasonal driver, but since I was new I helped the driver and delivered the packages to residence. No businesses."
good,You have to work here for years at a time to receive a career advancements. I am applying for this job to gain more HR experience and see what else is out there.
good,"typical day at work is moving a lot of boxes around. "
good,fun workplace until people start hating. you get along with drivers. some drivers hook it up with bonus cash. Easy to grow at ups. you will need a lot if water.
good,"Work your designated job position. If they need help in another section you can be tasked to help there. If it's something you have not yet experienced they provide on the spot training and help."
good,Lots of good people to work for and with. Very strong leadership skills and department over heads. The work was fair across the board and the managers and team leaders were very concerned about everyone's safety.
good,"I would go through security and swipe my UPS card to begin my shift everyday at work. When I walked in, everyone was productive but not miserable. It was hard work and the managers did everything in their power to make sure their workers were okay and had everything they needed and that's why I loved the place. It was hard work, everyone took care of each other and it was almost like a family."
good,It is a great job with great benefits but often lacks stability which is part of the reason I am looking to seek another job to ensure I meet my needs
good,I began as a package handler and was later asked to move up as a supervisor for the operation. Managements notices an employees efforts to complete their job in a well and time efficient manner.
good,"Fun fast paced environment which is the most rewarding pat of the job. The hardest part was just the learning of the area you were assigned to deliver in."
good,"I learned to cope with people very angry about not receiving their packages."
good,"Fast-paced work environment! I work night shift, which works around my day job. Great benefits but it can be stressful if you are not into hands-on jobs."
good,"Una empresa seria e innovadora, hay capacitaciones constantes siempre buscando una manera de realizar las operaciones con mayor eficacia, valoran las opiniones de sus empleados para realizar mejor la operación"
good,"I was an Intern at UPS and my experience was valuable in teaching me about different kinds of engineering environments. The staff was very friendly and tight-knit but hardworking and expect a high level of return. "
good,"UPS is not exactly a place for the faint of heart, or weak bodied. It is a fast paced, active work environment that can be as rewarding as you make it. It also has great benefits from health care to college tuition reimbursement."
good,"Some people are very friendly and some are you know, but working here is very and the pay is exceptionally good wish i could stay full or part time instead of seasonal."
good,"Loved working the peak season, great pay, super nice people, great HR department. Hands down one of my favorite jobs and I wish there were positions available to stay on after peak season."
good,its a good work experience i liked it and im trying to get in to a company thats hiring the pay at my old job was okay but we  definitly should have been paid
good,Good company.  Promotes within.  Promotes training. Pay and benefits were excellent. Downsized and jobs were sent to India. Since  site was non union we easly displaced.
good,"From clock in to clock out, its a non-stop race to the finish. The job is highly stressful and requires complete concentration. The stress on the body is equally stressful."
good,"They say that I am the best worker at ups, and very active for my job to see if I get paid more if I do a good job by overwork myself I get extra cash. But they rip me off by giving me slave hours."
good,"UPS wasn’t the place for me to work , The pay was good but it’s actually hard work. I had to deliver packages from door to door in the brutal cold . Packages were extremely heavy at times too ."
good,"sometimes no breaks and/or lunch"
good,"I enjoyed the structured day, management was willing to help me to become more efficient at performing my duties. Late start time was the only bummer which generally resulted in getting home at a later hour. I was fortunate to work with a great team of fellow drivers that were more than happy help when ever I had questions. The most enjoyable part of the job are the customers and developing working relationships and growing the business. Hardest part of the job is winter driving and travels down rural roads."
good,"Very understanding people to work with you have to be ready for the weather since there is no air conditioning. Very fast pace, you have to ready for what ever job is thrown at you."
good,"I was the seasonal driver helper twice during two different Christmas seasons and it was fun for me because I stayed busy. My first year, I drove around a cart and had a pod storage unit full of packages that had to be delivered by the end of the day. My second year I rode in the truck with the same driver I assisted the year before."
good,"Technology department is great. Compensation is good for IT Support and job security is definitely a plus. Not much room for advancing unless your are willing to relocate to NJ, Alanta or Kentucky. Most of the management is great and respectable. The environment is very versatile and no two days are alike which is good. Work life balance is good, I'm able to take off work when needed."
good,This is an enjoyable place of work if you do not like to sit or stand in one place for extended periods of time. Teaches responsibility and time-management for sure.
good,"I felt like they actually wanted to see me succeed there. At the time, i just was there at a time of turmoil for myself and  the company top dogs. It wasn't complicated, just wasn't going to get me what I was looking for"
good,"Ups driver helper is a fast paced yet easy job to do and learn, also a good way to get a leg in the company. Other then bad weather conditions i had no issues, and my driver was a nice laid back guy."
good,"As a unionized job, it's a lot more stable and has more benefits than many jobs in the same league. With regular pay raises, paid weeks off for vacation, and overtime kicking in on anything after the 5 hour mark, it would be a good permanent job if you're willing to stick with it. Not to mention the opportunities to advance to a package car driver or management position."
good,"A typical day at work involves a lot of talking with employees to reiterate expectations, coupled with working as a team with others in order to attain a specific goal."
good,"The benefits alone make the low wages worth it to work at UPS. The health, dental and vision insurance cost nothing out of your paycheck, and the $200 bonus for showing up every day on time makes the job worth it."
good,"Attempt to find/locate position of package, not always able to do that do to missing scans. Labels may fall off, be crinkled, etc. Management is very helpful if you can get hold of someone in a timely manner."
good,a typical day was loading up to 1300 packages into 4 trucks within 3 and a half hour unless we were delivering in any type of weather. its stressful but your rewarded for it
good,"I enjoyed working at UPS. I had great benefits and the environment was good. It was very fast paced and competitive, which I loved. UPS is a great company to work for and I recommend it to everyone."
good,Looking for a company that has  New Age technology with a position that would allow me to use my knowledge and skills  to help grow the company and become an asset.
good,Everyday you felt rewarded with a strong sense of accomplishment.  I learned a ton of Microsoft Excel and access tools that will forever be established in my skill set.
good,UPS has great benefits for both Union and non-union employee's...second to none. The work is very fasted paced and you need to be able to make split decisions in order to work effectively.
good,Working as a sesonal helper at UPS is fast paced and tough but the pay is definitely worth it. The bonus for working every day of the week is a big motivator and was a big factor in my decision to work here.
good,"Good place to work, great workout if looking to lose weight. Hard labor but rewarding work. Great opportunity for career advancement. Patience will be tested working here."
good,"Enjoyed working on my account  base daily by reaching out to customer to give quotes and work on any issues that they might currently have with billing. "
good,A very fast paced job that pays well with great benefits. The UPS company can help many people in many ways. They can help many teens get into good schools to pursue there careers with great opportunities.
good,I consistently meet every challenge and matched their standards everyday. Terrific company to work for but maybe I just got lucky. I was given plenty of opportunities to learn different work constructions and procedures which can be used anywhere.
good,"a typical day at meeting my driver at the meet-up spot. next we sort the boxes in the truck then proceed on the rt. then we stop at the house and he scans the box hands it to me, and I bring it to the door and head to the truck."
good,It was a layed back place to work just had to be quick with your job. Had to make sure the boxes were in the right place so they could be shipped to the right place. Had to make they you didn’t damage the package as well. The people in the work warehouse were cool mainly because they had one goal and that was to get the job done get paid and go home. Helping out on the truck was also layed back but cold because it was in the winter time. Also fast paced because you had to deliver the packages in a certain amount of time. Being on the truck helped me remember street names and different areas and also made me beaware of dogs .
good,"The manager is cool.Its a pretty laid back job. If you work well with others,you're a fast learner and you need a little part time job it should be a good fit for you."
good,"work environment was fast paced and demanding, with a focus on team work to achieve daily goals and objectives.  multitasking was a must, and problem solving on the fly was a necessity."
good,"Great company overall but a lot of things as far fairness is reviews, and cliques in certain departments are very noticeable. Ability to advance depending on who is reviewing or hiring you in a certain department because most of the time not about what your capable of, skill, abilities, experience, seniority ect., but more about who you know in a  certain department in order to have a chance."
good,"Great company, job, and co-workers. Hard work but you're compensated very well for it. The insurance was excellent, too. I'd definitely work here again."
good,"United Parcel Services, from an operations management perspective, strives the importance of training. They continually stress the importance of developing your assigned hourly employees. The importance of safety, service and production are things that you can control. They are not variables. It is your duty to install that mindset, that foundation within your workers. I learned how to lead and to not simply manage through a day to day basis. The hardest part of the job was to be as efficient as possible. If you set highs in performance the previous work week, management will then consider it the standard. The pedal is never off the gas in terms of upper management."
good,"UPS is a fast paced job that you most keep up , but when you keep up it becomes fun and determined to get it done even faster, everyone is friendly to eachother and it’s easier to move up in your job status."
good,Worked in multiple facets of the operation and enjoyed it for the most part. Peak season was hectic but that was expected. starting pay for part time wasn't great but it was overshadowed by the great benefits. There was also increases in pay annually and rom for growth.
good,"the job was very exiting, especially the customers and the people around you and your fellow job members, they make it seem like real family! I love it."
good,Was a good place to work and some great people.  It has good benefits. It can be a little stressful and long work days during the peak seasons. Enjoyed working with my coworkers.
good,"Warehouse jobs are always taxing, but in the Dallas hub, there is always something going on.There is always another package that needs processed and moved around the building. But nobody is actually taught what to do by the management. If the job get's done, it's because there is a guy that's been there for 15 years and he's actually the one that trains the people around him and not his boss"
good,Getting $10.45 an hour .....not good. Even as a part time job. At least $12 would be better. Hoping to get a raise very soon. Fast paced. Short breaks.
good,i was part of the loading/unloading team who was incharge of unloading the hgvs coming in on the morning shifts and in the evening we would be loading the same hgvs to ensure that all out going packages have been correctly x-rayed and processed .
good,"I worked at a UPS Store, the work hours were flexible which helped with other things in my schedule ( i.e. school). It can be very fast paced at times, but also rewarding."
good,safety has allway been number 1! cleanlinss is number 2! I've gotten along with management throghout my career it must be my military experience. l look forward to hearing from you.
good,while working for UPS on a regular work day went by quick. And everyone I worked with was friendly including the management. The type of job I can grow at and love going to work to make sure everything got delivered.
good,Very good place to work.  Hard work was recognized and rewarded. Advancement potential was there for those with the obvious skills to advance to a managerial or supervisory role.
good,I enjoyed everyday that I worked here. I felt like I was part of a real team and never minded the hard work. I would recommend ups to friends or family.
good,The UPS Store was my first job when I was in high school. It was a great starter job and worked with my school schedule. It taught me how to work with the public and interact with customers on a daily basis.
good,No tips to give is  it’s slave work only get a 15 min break think we needed longer breaks when loading the trucks but we don’t get them and want people to come to work
good,It’s rough your first couple of weeks just stick it out and it’ll get better it’s very fast pace and gets really hot in the warehouse some days long as you drink a lot of water you’ll be fine
good,"You come in clock in and wait until its the ususal time for the trucks to start bringing you your trailer. Loader your trailers and when you are done with that or if you don't have anymore packages coming, get out and help out on Eregs."
good,The typical work day for me as a part-time supervisor is attending our daily meeting before the sorts starts. Also making sure my employees are on time to work and ready to work safely with all of their come to work items. Its really a challenging job from the management stand point. The job in my opinion is more skilled for you to think and use your mind more than having to do physical labor to accomplish goals and solve problems.
good,You're really busy or really slow except holidays. You get to meet people and that's always interesting here in this area because we have so many tourists.
good,The work environment is fast-paced. UPS has good benefits. Everyone on the dock is always willing to lend a hand if you have any questions. Managers are always wiling to help on with freight issues.
good,"UPS was a great company to work for. Everyday we would have meetings and establish our daily, weekly, and monthly goals. The benefits and customer service are unmatched."
good,It's like a very intense work out for four hours for the hourly employees also employees must be able to lift up to 70 pounds consistently for the whole shift
good,"Hard work but if you put the hours and the work in you were rewarded. It wasn't always easy to balance work and home life but you were helped out where they could. "
good,The job has its pros and cons and very fast pace. It is a fast pace job that requires you to lift up to 50 pounds maybe more . You get a good workout with this job.
good,"Ups,  is very stressful,  the more you do, the less they recognize you,  but again it depends on who you are and what department you working in. I have no more to say.  I dont like working there."
good,Great place as an intern. Really awesome managers and teammates that help really make you feel you are part of the team and contributing in a meaningful manner. Great opportunity if you are able to stay long term with the company
good,"While i don't recommend it as a permanent job at all, it was a good way to learn about a working environment and how to work with others. So i would only recommend it as a starting job"
good,"Typical to union shops, advancement was dependent primarily on seniority.  Entry-level positions are night shifts, however, the schedules are consistent and easy to get adjusted to.  Pay is adequate at first and gets progressively better.  The benefits are second to none.  UPS is what you put into it."
good,UPS promotes safety as an important factors for their workers. It is a fast paced work environment that builds teamwork. The benefits are very good for a part-time job.
good,A typical day consists of getting in and doing your work as quickly and efficiently as possible.  Management is always very helpful and understanding. They really help you along.
good,"Typical day:"
good,"Facilities well organized , employees under control and well behaved . The play rate is nice and fun place to be at the same time , I don’t want to leave but I just have to relocate"
good,"I have worked with the owners for several years. I have enjoyed outside activities with them as well as working with them. They help make scheduling your personal life and your work life very easy. I definitely recommend working there. The only real cons are lack of benefits, opportunities, and advancement."
good,Made calls all day. Some down time for planning. I learned sales and negotiation principles. The workplace culture is good and laid back. It is up to you how you dress and where you want to go next.
good,"Have coffee provided by UPS"
good,"Good environment with staff, treated like family. Big push for sales which is difficult for some (like me). Overall, a good but temporary job considering the $9 an hour."
good,It was a very strong fast-paced workplace and if a person can't keep up they shouldn't really go to that job but for hard dedicated workers it might just be the best place for and my overall experience was a good one
good,"A typical day at UPS is always what you make it. In my 4 years of supervising I have seen a lot of good and a lot of questionable things with my company. In the summer time it's extremely hot and in the winter extremely cold. On top of the weather issues the type of work we do on a daily basis can put a lot of strain and stress on one's body. From the constant moving, to the consistent lifting of packages over 70lbs, this job really wasn't made for the weak individuals. However with all the negative that does make up my company, the joy of a well earned paycheck every Friday along with the benefits to keep my family safe and happy, This extreme jobs is actually worth it."
good,I enjoyed my job very much! Fast paced work yet relaxed environment.  My supervisors were amazing and actually valued their employees as people and not just employees!
good,The best company that I have worked for that truly understands the importance of cost of living increases and standard pay raises. They allow you to be able to do 401K and match it.
good,"I worked with some great guys there and the manager was really nice.  The hard part was we were short handed a lot so you had to work longer days which made it difficult.  All in all, it was a good place, very fast moving, you had to keep up with the packages."
good,UPS is not a bad place of employment for a part time job to supplement your income while attending college or a trade school for technical training. I began to need and desire a job to supplement my income after I finished a certain amount of collegiate hours.
good,"A Typical Day at Ups I'm on the sort ale, its very facet paced. got to be able to left boxes no more than 70+ pounds."
good,"It really was an experience working here. I was able to learn how to use my muscles properly and get myself a good workout every day. People were always willing to help out and put me in a location that they feel suit me best, and were often more than glad to accept my help for whatever it was. While some days were slower than others, it was always kind of fun to help out in the hub with packages, which was always quick paced, and allowed me to get better with my organization skills."
good,"Love my hours.  Have time during day to spend with family. They give you opportunity to learn different duties within the workplace so you won't get "" burn out"" just doing same thing."
good,I learned to stay busy and to keep a positive attitude while doing a demanding job. I learned to operate a vehicle safely while trying to navigate the streets of Omaha/Council Bluffs.
good,UPS is the place to work at if you want a change in your life. You will get full benefits as a part time employee. You will Get a raise every year. There are so many opportunities to move on up within UPS.
good,"At ups, your routine determines how your day progresses. As long as everything is accounted for and executed right, ups can be a fun place to work"
good,Once you get used to the work its not too hard. The most stressful part about the job is the first 30 days. The time you use adjusting to the work style.
good,"Being on your feet for 4 hours or more, being able to lift more than 75 lbs. You need to have good organizational skills when putting the boxes in the truck. Putting it in numerical order, and making it easy for the driver throughout their day."
good,It’s a good part time job with very good benefits and I recommend that you have another job parting job because this part time job at UPS does not have many hours.
good,"Hard work fast paced friendly environment but the hours are short good for if you go to school but not for providing for a family. Good advancement. Great benefits after a year, annual raises, Union, paid vacation after a year, overtime (time and a half) after 5 hours in one day."
good,Depends on what shift you have. There is always going to be heavy lifting no matter what position you are in in the warehouse. Safety is always a main priority. There is good team work among the laborers.
good,"I work the 4AM-9AM shift; I like it because I still have time in the day to run errands.  It’s not an easy job and can often feel like a workout due to handling small and big boxes.  The benefits, however, are worth it."
good,Ups is a job that carry a lot of obsticles you really have to be mentally and physically strong to do this job that's a thing that I learned Plus it's Fun working there cause you get to interact with a lot of people so work cannot be boring
good,it's cool. people are cool. atmosphere is cool. management is cool. parking is ok. vending machine and ice machines are a plus. I have no complaints at all.
good,"Provided me a great platform to learn multiple skills as related to operating a business. I have gained skills including design, management, print workflow and administrative skills."
good,"I like working at UPS  because its a fast paced environment, my supervisor and my managers are always challenging me with new obsticals weekly, and I love it."
good,good place with good benefits and career advancement buy they take forever to work you up and they also lay way too many ppl off takes about 5 years to work up to driver
good,"For my position specifically it was chill and not really hard to learn but i didn't expect to be throwing boxes/bags to fill a truck. . . Didn't really help as far as keeping your body safe while working i felt like i was risking pulling something every time, full time workers also expect you to pick up for their slack too since they figure you will be temporary."
good,Upper management unprofessional make sure if your employed do what you job is to prevent any attention from your job only worry about what it is you need to do
good,"I began my career with UPS right out of high school.  My supervisor was very encouraging and recommended I train for my CDL license for more opportunity to advance in pay."
good,The work pace varied throughout the day from struggling to find something productive to do while customers weren't there to controlling the crowd of customers who wanted to ship large items but did not want to buy the large boxes. Management was great and the workers were always positive.
good,Both positions that were held yielded great results. I was able to assist customers with the status of their packages and then I moved to the department that allowed me to compensate customers for damages to their packages while in transit.
good,A typical day at work is face paced and has taught me customer service skills. The hardest part of the job is dealing with upset customer. Schedule/ Management is pretty flexible.
good,Great place to work.  High stress and quick paced.  Excellent benefits if hired on.  Pay is decent for the amount of work.  Training for office staff could be a bit better.
good,Early start time 5-7 hours. each day has a new challenge with package flow. the management has it's goals high and the culture changes daily with the demands of time frame. the best part of the day is the last hour because the flow slows down.
good,"Loved working here in this quick pace environment. "
good,"Great for benefits,you need to be in good shape, you need to stretch everyday before work, good supervisors,it's Monday thru Friday and have good energy and employees are good to work with"
good,"At the peak of the online shopping season, UPS is overwhelmed with hundreds of packages. Each day required anywhere between 250-350 delivery stops at commercial businesses or private homes. Each day I worked with a new driver, which was the most enjoyable part. Learning about each person and about the job at hand."
good,"UPS is a demanding job. It is fast-paced, safety oriented, and tough. I would recommend it for someone in their teens to early 30s. They provide good benefits and opportunity to advance"
good,The compensation package with pay and 401K is unheard of in a call center environment. I do appreciate the benefits that I've received in 11.5 years that I've been there. I have developed a rapport with my co-workers and management staff that I value.
good,"For better Opportunities and for enhancing my skills in other areas."
good,UPS is an organization that succeeds because they will not accept anything less than the best for their customers and people . Great experience and great company .
good,Great all around place with good people. But the pay was low and we only worked 20-25 hours a week. You got outstanding benifits and started off with 3 weeks paid vacation.
good,"Due to the nature of the shipping and delivery business, UPS is a high stress company to work for.  However, the benefits are very good for part-time associates as I was.  Overall, a very good company to work for."
good,a great company to work if you need a good benefit for your family and it easy to move up within the company and they help with you pay for school too
good,Co workers were helpful and nice. Supervisor was great and always made sure that i was comfortable with the job i was performing and answered any and all questions that i had.
good,job was pretty much simple just scan the boxes and barcode. after  you started building you a wall but the line is steady moving and a fast paced...rarely have a time for a break
good,"Was hard work but got it done when i had to, as a manger i need to rush from truck to truck and mange many people as well as new people regularly not a bad job."
good,"The job is repetitious and full of surprises at the same time. You're allowed to come in and set up the way that's most comfortable for you to complete your job. Mostly a relax atmosphere. Every job is a very much collaborative effort. I've learned to trouble shoot issues and how to improve certain areas of the process. In working in close proximity of co-workers, a lot is shared and supported."
good,Working for UPS was a very fun and exciting time. The biggest draw back for me was the ever changing needs on the floor. There were times you could be working in 3 different departments in the same week due to the current needs of volume. When i got into internal tech support it was the best job i ever had. There were so many applications to support (over 500) that it was always a fun and challenging time to master them all.
good,They teach you alot and it can get hard when weather is freezing and when it snows . Great people . Fast paced environment.. good pay not complaining.
good,"A typical day is full of challenges. The company is also willing to move towards latest technology with fast pace, which gives an opportunity to learn new technologies and concepts."
good,"Lifting the heavy boxes without help some times can get annoying. But overall I do like working at UPS. number one, it pays good. Number two, you are getting a good exercise."
good,"Great work environment, ability to contact supervisors when unsure of something, part-time position with full-time hours and benefits, keeps you very active, it can be hard on your body without the proper training and techniques"
good,"A typical day at the UPS store consist of sorting mails, sending out packages for guests, completing print jobs (business cards, resumes, photos) and checking in packages."
good,This job can either serve as a short and temporary job for extra money or a bridge to more jobs within UPS. The hours are very flexible and the job isn't stressful
good,"I worked at Ups around Christmas time and some days we were very busy and other days not so much. The atmosphere is very relaxing the supervisors are very nice and often very understanding. The down side was the hours vary and are not set in stone as ""Ups doesn't have an end time"" as the supervisors would say."
good,I really liked how I was able to depict exactly what I wanted my paycheck to look like. If I didn't want to run a load I didn't have to do it. The manager was very understanding to different needs.
good,"Very busy. Lots of interaction with warehouse, drivers and customers on phone and in person."
good,"This was a hard physical job, but the benefits made up for the hard work. They have excellent benefits and a excellent college program. The program paid mu tuition to earn my Bachelors degree in Social Work."
good,I'm currently still working there..Its a great place to work but you just don't get enough hours..I have been there almost 2 years but its just not enough money for what I do there..I love the environment an the people its just the time an hours an pay..
good,A great company to work for. The advancement is slow but they offer GREAT benefits especially for students who are looking to go to school or go back to school. I recommend this employer
good,"A great company to work for, good people, competitive work environment with the opportunity for upward mobility.  I was with the company for nearly 20 years."
good,"A physical and fast-paced environment, but not too demanding. I was always satisfied at the end of a day's shift. It's a company I can respect as it also respects its workers."
good,Ups is extremely fast pace but if you dont like manual labor its not the job for you the pay good but if you have children and bills its not enough at all that 10.20 wont help pay everything unless you pulling good hours even then you its barely enough cause they tax like crazy .
good,"I was a seasonal worker. I assisted in the delivery of ups packages. This is a good temporary job. However, it is very fast paced. On the up side, Ups pays very well and they hire pretty much on the spot, for the seasonal position, just as soon as you pass the background check. Its worth a shot.... I was a seasonal worker and the aforementioned describes that situation... It is another thing to be a regular driver... If you are a regular driver, it can take a while to get up to the kind of metrics involved with this job: specifically, they are going to want you to deliver so many packages per hour, while staying within their safety procedures and other policies... that's a hard job.. I don't think im the right person to do it... if you can, its like $17 per hour and benefits..."
good,owners are pretty cool. job is easy pack up packages send them off meet lots of defferent people sundays are off quick paced at times pretty laid back
good,"While it was fast paced, and a varied amount to learn based on your Driver, it was a good experience and some okay money for what you were asked to do. learn to pace yourself to not get injured or damage packages and you'll be fine doing this over the Holidays."
good,"The job is what you'd expect. A package handler does things like loading/unloading trucks and sorting packages. The job is fast paced and very physical. Management is not perfect, but good enough."
good,I worked as a driver helper for UPS over my winter break from college. The pay is great and anytime over 8 hours is time and a half pay. The drivers are really great and it is a great way to make some quick money over winter break!
good,I enjoyed my time at UPS. My supervisors awarded me often for the work I did. The salary was great as was the job security. The commuting time killed it for me.
good,"I felt challenged to do my best and a sence of pride for a job well done, As I got good in one area they gave me opportunities to learn other function of U.P.S  I likes that I could continue to learn more as I wanted. If you work hard it is noticed and chances to advance are available. "
good,I enjoyed this job because it was an active job and I was able to work with people. A typical day was to meet up with the driver and then go around and deliver the packages that were in the delivery truck.
good,"For part-time management, daily duties are paperwork, management of the shift duties, and working with your supervisors. Management is very tough, but fair in my experience. They will push you and be hard on you, but it is a competitive company that expects the best from you. The culture improved during my time there to make sure that everyone was treated fairly, and supports were given to help employees succeed. The hardest part of the job was that there were never two days that were the same, but that also made it very enjoyable at the same time. If you want to be kept on your toes, this is a good place to work. Advancement can be a slow process, though. I knew co-workers who waited for 5+ years working part-time before being offered full-time positions."
good,if your wanting to drive for a company. UPS would be the place. brand new trucks to drive. all the hours you could ask for. the pay is by far the best around. only if your willing to be on call first 2 years until you can obtain an route.
good,"My typical day consists of organizing the warehouse, sorting packages, loading trucks and preparing them for distribution, scanning and organizing incoming and outgoing packages, preparing documentation..."
good,"It fasts pace situation learning. But, your payroll raises are computer generated and you receive the best training from computer programs and upper management."
good,"I experienced, as a college freshmen doing seasonal help during the holidays, that most every coworker I interacted with were extremely welcoming and cooperative as we hustled during the freezing cold Connecticut winter weather. This was my first job and was a great way to start building my resume."
good,"Clock in head then head to your station, and start your shift by sorting the boxes off the oncoming conveyor belts onto separate conveyor belts by following the zip codes on the boxes (Advanced position) management was very great in the higher positions, managers in your current area/station can be 50/50. workplace culture there were much older people but awesome conversationalist. Hardest part of job was how fast paced it was at times, boxes seemed everlasting, but i enjoyed the people and benefits."
good,"Great company to work for with awesome benefits. Fast-paced work environment with a practical work load. I learned a lot about time management and patience working at UPS. The hardest part of the job was not knowing what was going to happen but that was also the most enjoyable part of the job. When things got chaotic, you were able to see the team work from yourself and the employees who you have gained great relationships with."
good,"I am a preloader. As boxes come down the belt, you take the ones for your trucks off and load them onto your trucks. Early morning hours, benefits and vacation for part time."
good,"A normal day is typically quick paced, repetitive and there's a lot of walking and standing on your feet for the majority of the shift. you're going to have to squat and lift boxes that could weight up to 50 lbs, sometimes unload trucks in bulk"
good,UPS was a good seasonal job to have during the holidays. You can have a lil extra change in your pocket during the holidays an enjoy your Christmas. I learned how to work hard a USP an to be consistent.
good,"been there five years, have had very few confrontations, very demanding and hard working, very few can handle the fast pace work alone with management who is very hard to deal with and is very often wrong but good pay and benefits, which you get after a year of working ."
good,"NEVER complained about benefits or compensation at UPS.  However, corporate management was very disengaged with employees.  Things changed after the company went public with stock.  All about making money and not about what the employee needs."
good,Great place to start career for warehouse management. Many different fields for you to find where you fit in at. Easy for career advancement. Great benefits. Hardworking work environment but it definitely pays off.
good,"Great company to work for, especially for advancement from within. UPS is consistently recognized as a good employer with solid benefits and growth potential. Employees are applied a proportionate dose of healthy stress without diminishing morale. Overall, a great place to build a career."
good,This job had great part-time hours. This job gave me the preloading experience that I didn't have before. I enjoyed working with a great team.The management is also great.
good,"I worked as a ""Peak Driver"" for my second year.  The work is physically challenging and fast-paced.  This is balanced by the reward of providing quality customer service.  "
good,"Stay long enough and the job gets better. Seniority is key, hard jobs go to new employees. Be tough, reliable, and the rest will fall into place. Don't expect a driving job right out of the gate, you will need to pay your dues for a while."
good,"It was an interesting environment, I'll say that much. Apart from employees and management resigning prematurely, due to being overworked and extremely stressed, it was a decent environment to work in. We were less than twenty miles from Luke AFB and let me tell you, hearing those F-26's flying overhead was exhilarating! By the way, working at the newest facility in Goodyear, AZ was really neat. The equipment was new as well as the ""management"", was really new and untouched (much like its' counterparts)."
good,Very professional and fast paced job none stressful work environment helps u learn about the company and helps u with growth  withing the conpany !!!!
good,Overall this job was very competitive and fun the only thing I didn’t like about this job was not getting enough hours. Other than that this job will do good for you in the future l.
good,"A typicals days work at UPS is usually or almost always the same as the day before which sometimes can become very repudiative. I did learn every basic dutie in a warehouse, shipping and picking are bascially all the same procedures, very easy concepts. Management had issues with communications no one ever seemed to be on the same page, other than so very professional and addressed issues proficiently. The atomoshere in any warehouse is what you make it to be UPS in general, very friendly I was felt comfortable with fellow associates. To me personally I never really found anything too difficult to achieve. The most enjoyable part of my job I'd have to say was all the reltionships I developed within the comany."
good,Very fast paced work environment. A lot of customer interactions. Have to be a fast learner and must be organized. Computer savvy. Have to follow directions and guidelines.
good,Its a good place to work. Team work is the name of the game. There is lots of room for advancement in the career. You gain a good bit of experience working with small business owners and interacting as a professional in the work place.
good,Mostly a customer service job that is very active. We receive and discharge packages. We have to lift boxes and load trailers. Work with computers and learn how to use the radios and dial boards.
good,"i love the work environment because everyone knows its stressful, things could be better, but overall it is a warehouse job, i did learn the truth behind the delivery system though"
good,Drivers are paid good but the part time insiders are very underpaid and mistreated. Good job for a young college student because of the tuition reimbursement.
good,UPS is an sonority face pace and always able to move up career. They offer some of the top health dental life insurance...in my opinion. It is also a union base job too.
good,Some expected challenged with collaborating with processing departments but generally a great job I wouldn't leave if it wasn't for the need to relocate out of State.
good,Premetto che lavoro da oltre 11 anni e mi sento anche parte integrante di questa azienda. Ho avuto modo di formare anche altri autisti. Sono cresciuto tanto sia dal punto di vista professionale e anche caratteriale. Rapporto quasi ottimo con tutti i colleghi
good,UPS is not for everyone and takes a special kind of person to be able to work there. Overall the people who do work there are people who truly want to be there because they know that UPS can help better their employees lives.
good,"On a typical day, I would be handling packages. Loading merchandise into the trailers and help my associates loading their trailers."
good,"A typical day at work is making it fun and being fast pace."
good,Working at ups was pretty easy the only problem was they didn’t give out enuff hours..the management was pretty cool overall...working there was very fun and a fast past environment
good,Work was very hard but pay was good. I enjoyed my job because i like dealing with people. I would recommend working at ups but be prepared to work long hours. The pay and benefits are great and make up for the long hours. Be prepared to work out in the intense heat and cold. You have to be able to take orders from management.
good,"A typical day at UPS includes where your going to work, what section. Once your there you have a paper thats has colors for ups packaging letting you know where each package goes. We work as a team to get things done. The workplace is satisfactory as well as management. The hardest part of the job is learning to place heavy packages on the belts. Overall its a great place to work."
good,have a safety meeting before shift starts and the supervisor will tell us what door to go to to start unloading the truck when that truck is done they will send you to another door to do the same thing its a repeated process until the shift is over. the hardest part of the job is dealing with the weather either its too hot or cold most enjoyable part of the job i became friends with good bit of people that works there i liked working with other people
good,"Make sure deliveries and pick-up times are met. Handle all monies. Set appointments for deliveries. Oversee all overages, damages and shortages. Answer phones and satisfy customers."
good,"I start the morning with a stretch I lead during the morning meeting.  I prepare my area for a safe and productive morning.  I take the packages off the conveyor belt and put them in their proper spots in the trucks.  When I the packages are finished coming down the belt, I tell the drivers about their loads and then I punch out."
good,"The UPS Stores vary, as they are ALL franchises. Many stores are owner operated, making it hard to advance into management positions. Most stores have structures that allow employees to earn more than basic wages."
good,"It was fun working with UPS, I learned alot about the back end process, ms office, excel, management, reports, email exchanging and interaction with clients on daily basis."
good,"Most of the managers there will put people on the first place. They will train and develop you if you have the eager to learn. They don't usually lay-off people and many employees have been working there for 10 to 20 years. For many UPS employees, they treat their job as a career."
good,"Depending on the area you are placed to work, the work atmosphere can stressful.  Excellent benefits and good working hours. Heavy boxes to lift if you are in the HUB"
good,I had the preload shift 3am-9am which felt great because when you got off of work you still had the rest of the day ahead of you. I took advantage of ups 100% compensation for schooling.
good,"I am grateful that I have the privilege to call UPS my first job. I appreciate the opportunity and love those guys. The hours aren’t what expected, but the environment is so rich in solid people that’s just a bonus."
good,"3rd shift was always the best. Even though I worked peak season, I had fun, and got a workout too....................................................."
good,"Quick paced, with competitive pay. Lots of chance for growth and moving up. Flexible hours, physical with lots of exercise. Weekly pay, with increased bonus during the holidays."
good,"Great first job!  Worked there over 10 years.  Hated to leave, but I need more hours and better pay."
good,"good company to work for. they make you feel like family and are always willing to step in and help when needed no matter what the issue, professional and personal,"
good,"I worked as a driver helper during the holiday season, a temporary position. The pay was good. It was a very stressful, fast paced, physically demanding job. You are exposed to all of the elements. Whether the route you worked was in a good area or not made all the difference."
good,Very MESSY..U got boxes every where u turn and u got a certain amt of time until u have to be done but besides the the workers there are very friendly and helpful cause u have to work mighty fast
good,Usually everyone works well together. For the most part everyone is treated fairly. I've learned about hazmat. Fundraisers are held at least once a week. Promoting safe work tips to avoid injury
good,Working for UPS has many advantages so long as you dedicate yourself. There are many different avenues for growth within the company. Fantastic benefits. Tuition reimbursement is available.
good,UPS wasn't a horrible job to have it just was very strenuous and the hours made it difficult to complete school task. Other than that no complaints. The benefits were awesome after you had worked there for a year which really helped.
good,UPS has a long and storied history which has created a rich and strong culture which endures still.  There has always been a significant promote-from-within focus so the company does an excellent job identifying and developing talent and leadership required to grow and improve.
good,"UPS is a great place to work as far as benefits , however the work is very very physical and not for most people . if you want to continuously throw 70 pound boxes over your head and stack them at the top of a 7ft tall trailer then its the job for you"
good,"UPS is a great company for progression in careers. You start on the low end of the company and work your way up gradually. You also get a week's paid vacation after you are with the company for a year. The hardest thing about the job is the labor part of it and management does not understand how hard it is to actually perform this job. Lack of understanding occurs a lot at UPS from the managers to the hourly employees. The best thing about the job was being paid for 20 hours of work while being on vacation. Overall, UPS is a great company for someone looking for a career, without much education under your belt."
good,A great job that has a fixed schedule and decent pay. Not long hours and its well balanced. Job is attainable with the training received and you learn to become independent.
good,Great for being a part-time job with full-time benefits. We get vacation days after a year of work. Very hard physical work and we are finished before most people start to go to work.
good,"Loading or unloading trucks.  Ensuring scans are accurate and packages are loaded in the proper cars.  "
good,"Working at an Ups hub had its ups and downs, the shift I worked processed the most packages out of the three shifts. Basically we were the anchor for the building, everything relied on the twilight shift. If twilight didn't do so we'll the building wouldn't. The environment at Ups was family oriented."
good,Everyone at the job knows one another easy too work with plenty of hours available you can always talk to your manager about any and everything the hours are great
good,"This job was a fun new experience for me,it helped me to improve on my team skills to get the job done in a timely fashion.Even though this is a large co-operation it felt like you belong to a family due to the fact that there was easy access to supervisors to address any concerns"
good,"A typical work day was very busy, staff and management worked hard to satisfy customer's need and meeting  deadlines ."
good,Great job you will work hard and takes a while to get used to.its fast paced it's not easy great benefits you will need a second job to make ends meet.
good,So enjoyed working here every day was a challenge experience had a set round for 2 years delivering all around the gower peninsular it was a pleasure To go too work every day 😊
good,"Great place for a college aged individual that is looking for part-time job while in school.  Part-time gets full-time benefits including heath care, vision, dental, and education.  Very physical and demanding work for your body."
good,"It was a really good temp job to have, since I was a driver helper it was fasted paced, you would not think it would be. The driver was cool, he showed my how to load and organise the truck."
good,Some days its really stressful when we don't have enough workers. Usually it's fairly easy as long as you adjust to the situation in question. Quick passed and a work out for sure.
good,"Worked hard for 28 years delivering and picking up packages. Developed good relationships with my colleagues and customers, had a good workplace environment and safety was stressed "
good,"My typical workday at UPS can be stressful due to the fast pace you are required to work at. However, the supervisors and managers keep the fun going, by offering incentives from friendly workplace competitions."
good,"Cool experience started when I was young , really uptempo , have to find ya speed & keep it consistent , short hours , kinda good pay  , supervisors aren't good"
good,"Because I was still in school, the hours offered conflicted with my first class which started at 9 a.m.  Fast-paced job which definitely wears on your back.  Slow to advancement of becoming a delivery driver.  Needed hours that were not conflicting with my early morning high school hours.  Hard to change scheduling. If not in school, definitely the place to make a career from with advancement."
good,"The work is hard, but the people are fun to work with. If you don't mind working hard, then you'll have no problem at UPS. Do not expect to sit around and take it easy ever."
good,Working at UPS off loading and loading air cargo. I've learned a lot working there with how they handle their packages and containers and how big of a work load they receive on a daily basis. The hardest part of the job was not having a good communication and help from co-workers. I enjoyed working with others but always seems there was a division in them.
good,"Just unloading packages from a conveyor belt on to trucks. Typically had about 4 trucks to load a day with aver 200 packages each. It is very stressful and tiring, the hours were not fun. My shift was from 3am-9:30am. Overall it is a great place to start a career, once you become a driver you are set. Great benefits and great pay."
good,Management was always willing to work with my schedule and always ensured I got the time off I needed. The only exception was December. December was a very busy month. It felt like I was working two jobs.
good,"Enjoy working at UPS Freight. "
good,"It is a fast-paced atmosphere.  Very physical work, lifting packages, loading and unloading trucks.  Conditions can be tough because you are working in an open warehouse/hub, so it's like working outdoors (when it's hot outside, it is hot inside and when it's freezing cold outside, it is freezing cold inside).  But when you become a union member (yes, union member working part-time) the benefits are incredible."
good,"This job is a good opportunity , it's not hard. You'll enjoy it if you like to exercise. You can meet all kinds of different personalities. You never alone , and some body always have your back."
good,"This is a very hard working, fast paced environment. I love the people that I work with, we all equally bust our butts. The pay for starters is not exactly what I would want, but perseverance and consistance is where it is at.. There is plenty of room for advancement, and you get full benefits, with in 3 months even working part-time."
good,"typical day at work varies on your job position"
good,UPS has a strong company culture with multiple opportunities for career advancement. UPS provides employees with opportunities to advance their education.
good,"I had a great time with UPS, I got the job done and enjoyed my time with the drivers I was assigned with. Some days would include hard work, but I was all for it. Great time, great people."
good,Fast-paced environment with many challenges. Unload and load feeders before the departure time of said feeders. Work with others to find ways to sort packages the most productive. Ensure UPS and OSHA safety regulations and laws are upheld and implemented.
good,I worked for four years for the company. I don't have any complaints about the work or the company. It was easy and advancement was often. I enjoyed my days there.
good,They  have a good company. And it's run very wel the benefits are very good it's a big. Company willing to help the people who want a  job at UPS  I loved working at ups  very nice people

good,"When the day start, its fast and non stop until the work is done. Learned what hard work is. Management was about production. It was a diverse work place. Slowing down would throw you behind. Team work."
good,"Working at UPS is tough, no matter the position. The pay is good, the benefits are amazing, and the potential for growth is very high. Having a union to have your back is also very nice."
good,"a typical day at work would begin with the information of how many shipments and pieces to be move on three different flights, get the the team ready with this information and do a set up with all the equipment needed to perform this tasked.  I learned FAA requirements as well as Federal DOT laws for the safe movement of air freight on the system.  Management culture is honest and will provide the necessary training to be very detailed  oriented to perform, The hardest part of the job would be working with high stressed, fast paced  to meet a timeline.  The most enjoyable part of the job would be your team of coworkers joining forces to achieve the same goal to meet a time frame."
good,Oversaw 10 union employees. Loaded and offloaded air crafts with freight with a certain deadline. Learn how to be a problem solver as well as to adjust to any changing conditions. Quick pace workplace. Hardest part of the job are the employees.The most enjoyable part is the friendly culture.
good,on a typical day i would pick orders then after the picking section was finish i would go help shipping so we all can leave. also helping load the trucks.
good,"This job will teach you the value of holding your people accountable. A typical day at work can yield high levels of stress if you allow it to be. Management are typically strait forward with their actions, at times can be viewed as a mentor."
good,"Lots of hard work, but well compensated. The building can often get a little chaotic, but in the end it's done in the best management possible, as they try to take care of us."
good,"Each day there would be a full work load, but also enjoyed the people I worked with, the employees knew how to laugh alongside of working. The supervisors were also laid back and we're all fair, really enjoyed working here.u"
good,Learned how to be a driver helper. Most enjoyable part was being in the truck fresh air. seeing everyone's happy faces when delivering them there christmas presents.
good,A typical day at work includes many different things such as setting up the area for a successful operation. Throughout the workday I work with employees by observing safe and or at risk behavior.
good,"A typical day (shift) is hard work."
good,"My day typically starts about an hour prior to workers arriving. I prepare for my night by getting all necessary paperwork for the shift started so that it can be completed though out the night. I then have a preshift meeting to discuss the volume for the night , number of employee needed per area. I then head to designated area, set scanners, log into computer and log into and open ll applications needed. Once employees arrive I do quick meeting outlining nightly expectations and  confirm work assignments. Once sort begins I oversee employees and manage area, ensure pull times are met, and complete paperwork."
good,Good part time job. Room for advancement and great benefits. Need to put alot of time in for it to turn into a full time position. But overall could be a solid place to work in the long run.
good,"I'm on the twilight shrift, start at 4:30 and end around 9 or 9:30 every night, load 1,500 boxes each day, I've learned a lot of skills from here and its a good friendly atmosphere and the supervisors are awesome, only thing I hate about this place it gets to hot in the summer times and very cold in winter"
good,"UPS was a fun job to have, you got to meet lots of new people, only worked 4-5 hours through the night, and the management was pretty great for the most part."
good,"Every day at ups is physically challenging for the majority of workers. the entire work day consists of lifting, lowering, moving, and carrying hundreds of packages, all while being on a time frame. Despite, these demands, the amazing benefits, and stable work schedule make it all more than worth it in my eyes."
good,Good company to work for. Refer within and most positions start part time.  Work well with management and coworkers. Supportive of having a balance home/work life.
good,"I've been with ups for 5 years. When it comes to constant work they're always there. It's great for people just wanting a part time job, or a career start. The raises are good. They start out pretty well when it comes to pay. It's good for balancing out school or another job as well."
good,"Its a pretty good job, however if your not used to getting yelled at or cant take constructive criticism its not the job for you. You learn on the go and you have to keep up. Its a great job to have if you want to grow within the company"
good,"Good place to build a secure career.  Long hours and a great deal of commitment go into this job, however if you can put in the time and are willing to do what is necessary to get the job done, there is no place like it."
good,"busy friendly office, full of long term staff who know their job inside out. "
good,It's a good place to start off and build character around. Easy paced and you get to learn how customer service works. Staff is friendly and manager is amazing.
good,Good benefits from part time job. Employees there were great and the same thing goes for the supervisors. Everyone is treated equally with the same opportunities
good,Great benefits and great people.  The work culture encouraged others to work hard and be promoted from within.  That was rewarded as well as the culture of UPS.
good,"I enjoy working at UPS because it houses a very fun work environment, and provides me with great benefits. There is great advancement opportunities and it is a great place to work."
good,I was hired as cover driver. Its been 1 year and they still havent qualified me yet. Not complaining because the benefits n insurance makes up for my running low on patience. I work with a great team during local sort pm. Its a great workout.  Im the unloader. No gym membership needed. Great place to work if you have patience.
good,UPS is a Great place to get working experience in a warehouse. Same benefits for part time works as full time workers.  Friendly and safe work environment.
good,You should be very strong and physically fit to work in this company . It is a hard and fast phase working company . physical fitness is very important as mental .
good,"Everyday can be different with different customers coming in wanting a new design and seeing their faces seeing their ideas printed on paper is worth it. Granted there are moments when you don't hit the mark right away but that's the best part about designing, right back to the computer and make those subtle or major changes."
good,"I took packages and put them on the line to be shipped. I enjoyed that there was always work to be done. The hardest part was just having to stand in one place the whole time, but this did not affect my work."
good,A typical work day at UPS facility will have you tired depending on your job you have to be able to lift 50 lbs or more.The most enjoyable part about UPS is probably getting off work after the long day.
good,"Not for pansies you have to lift heavy boxes for bad pay. The benifits rock and you can advance to making serious cash but that all takes time. It's worth the time, but it also destroys your body. Manegmemt doesn't respect you and you spend all day lifting boxes"
good,"Assisting customers all day long, packing boxes, and keeping the store organized. Only hard part was the customers who did not feel like they needed to pay for certain services."
good,Your general work day at UPS will be very fast paced.  The management teams are amazing and very understanding.  Very good place to work. I love the kind of people that work there and represent the UPS name.
good,very fun work environment met interesting people and customers on a daily basis. very challenging at times Christmas and holiday seasons were the busiest working conditions.
good,With this Company I can say that its an nice up coming start for further career goals and also if establish to the company an great career opportune. 4/5
good,Obviously this is a good place to work for some great benefits: however; you will not be making good money until you have been here for a decade. Hours can be unreliable depending on where you work.
good,The work environment can be stressful if you can't handle slight complications and the frequent incompetence of management. Otherwise it's a good work environment if you're willing to work hard.
good,U.P.S. in all its fame and glory is exactly how its presented in all the war stories. UNION benefits for you and immediate family. Guaranteed hours during peak season and advancement to management or stay union(light or dark side lol). Either way your set for the foreseeable future...assuming technology doesnt complete phase out the package handling function anytime soon ill be just fine as long as I GET A DEGREE!!! :>
good,A typical day at UPS as a sorter/unloader is we will have a meeting at the beginning to review how many trailers will come inbound. Some days I will start unloading or scanning packages and other days sorting. When everything is sorted and gone to the right destination then repackages are handled. Management are professional and communication is on point. The hardest part of the job is packages getting jammed on the belts and it would delay time. I learned that when handling customers packages in the right manner would make them a repeat customer. What I enjoy about this job is the great dedication in all of the employees working together in a fast face environment.
good,Delivered packages as fast as possible. The hardest part of the job is to deliver all packages in a timely manner in the cold weather and carrying packages upstairs in large apartment buildings
good,"You get a good work out working for this company, as to the fact that it is fast paced throughout the whole day while working. Learned all kinds of things about the packaging company, and how things are delivered. The benefits are excellent with being a part time employee. You get full time benefits. A strong union. Work in the A.M. and get the rest of the day to enjoy. Advancement is very positive within the company."
good,"The job is technical but somewhat relaxed. It takes about a week or two to become a competent employee but from there it's pretty smooth sailing. There isn't technically a lunch break but we each took turns going for lunch and you don't have to clock out. The environment is fairly relaxed in comparison to previous jobs I've had doing food service, farm work, and factory work. It only gets hectic around Christmas time. Overall, it's a great experience and if you're looking for part time or something just to make the rent payments I'd highly recommend it."
good,"Quick paced, collaborative work environment. Good place for advancement. Must be able to lift at least 75 lbs. Not temperature controlled. Hot in the summer and cold in the winter must learn to dress accordingly."
good,"It is a part time job starting out, which is not bad if you are in school."
good,Open learning process with high corporate culture. Growth for those who have experience even they are Professionally qualified. Good to work in this environment.
good,"The best thing about working at UPS is the free benefits.  The work is hard but doable.  Management is okay as management goes.  if you apply there, be willing to work.  Package Handler is a part-time job so you won't get rich if that's all you do.  UPS is a Union job so everything is done based on seniority which is both good and bad.  Opportunities to advance are seemingly endless."
good,Pretty physically demanding but the shifts go by quickly. I worked 3rd shift so that kind of messed with my sleeping pattern but eventually got used to it.
good,"This is the right job for teens that are in high school, and don't have much responsibilities such as bills. The work load is adequate, and you still have your nights to enjoy."
good,Everyone had their own set of duties to fulfill by time your work shift was done. At first its a burden on your body but like with anything you have to get adjusted to the environment your in and the faster that happens the better off you are.
good,"This job was a filler job for me. I worked pre-load and midnight shift and each job was very different. It was a a lot of hard work, but overall for the tuition money, it was worth it in the end."
good,The hardest part of this job is sometimes the people you work under or people in surrounding departments. Other than that it is fairly easy.The great thing about this company is that you get awesome benefits.
good,Best for those who are going to school currently or need a little extra income. Hours are no more than 20 a week. You may occasionally get a little more. Management is fair.
good,"Great benefits, hard work, only part time available at first. Loading is very physical, fast paced with no real break. You will get in shape or quickly quit."
good,"It's                                                                                                                 UPS!        "
good,"I started for United Parcel Service in 1979 as a part time pre-loader, and retired after they went public in 1999."
good,I was a driver helper during the 2016 holiday season. My job was to ride shotgun in the truck and help the driver deliver parcels. It was a simple job that taught me about teamwork and time management.
good,"Ups is not somewhere I recommend for a long term job, but it is a nice place to be a starter job for someone that's in need of some quick cash. The hours are pretty flexible too."
good,Ups is a fast pace work place. Every workday is different so expect the unexpected. Team work is always need to get the job done correctly. A great attitude goes a long way with the company.
good,Good benefits for a part-time job. Good teamwork oriented environment. Being on time is strongly emphasized. Annual vacation time is adequate and weekly pay as well.
good,"Great for a start out position (before you have children and a family).  Hours are long, demands are hard, working conditions are that of a facility where bay doors will be open during all times of the year.  Dress accordingly!"
good,UPS is a Multinational company and I real owe UPS because what I am today is all because of UPS. UPS believe in diversity.UPS give Opportunity and assist their Staffs to progress in professional life.
good,"Obviously a well known company that treats their employees very well with great pay and benefits. A very physical job, but the compensation makes it worth it."
good,"UPS was a great company to work for. They had great culture, employees, and management. Driving for UPS as a service provider was at times very demanding but also very rewarding."
good,"It was an ok job. I mean it wasn't the best but they paid good , the supervisor was cool. It was just a very tiring job, didn't have long lunch breaks."
good,"Ups was a great company culture, learned a lot from great mentors and made a lot of great friends- Used Earn and Learn program to complete GED and get into college, company paid $30,000 of my college education. ⛤⛤⛤⛤⛤"
good,I really enjoy my job at UPS which includes night hours but unfortunately I need increased hours and salary that are currently unavailable to me at this time.
good,"Our motto is clean up starts at the beginning of the day.  The employees I deal with typically have varied backgrounds. Dealing with the different personalities make for a very interesting and colorful work environment.  Working for them for the past 11 years has made more me patient in dealing with people,  more confident when dealing with challenging conditions."
good,"if this is the kind of job for you, then go get it. If not, don't stay too long or you'll be there longer than you expect. depending on where you are in the company it could be a fast paced work environment where attention to detail is crucial or it could be worse than a snail race"
good,i enjoyed my time with UPS and the driver I had was wonderful and he made it  enjoyable also. The management was great at giving the assignments and helping with getting other things that were needed.
good,this is a great place to work especially if ur working full time position its very productive team work is a necessity help is always sent when needed. from my experience I've learned to be the best you can be
good,Ups is a very nice company if you are college student and or looking for and good second job with great benefits. you will get a good workout. you only work three or four hour shifts I work twilight shift i have friday and saturday nights off and have alday to work a second job during my day. very nice company to move up in and have long term employment.
good,"I would suggest this job to anyone, the management team are very respectful. The employees are fun to work with. The customer service provided is phenomenal."
good,Rode along side the driver and help make stops an delivered packages to the client home  that was my maine purpose besides helping my driver with e code bar on the boxes
good,UPS believes in promoting from within. This creates a partnership among all management levels. UPS is compared to the military in the way we manage all facets of the business. This has made us successful for over 100 years. We continue to evolve and be leaders in the industry. The opportunity for advancement. UPS believes in operations rotations to make their management well rounded. UPS gave me the education I needed for success through internal training schools and seminars.
good,"Loved working there everyone is really nice and if you are working for seasonal only and really commit to it you will get a positive re-hire status so you can turn a temporary job into a permanent "
good,The first several months you only work if there is a high volume of packages and you have to wait til approximately 1 hr 30 minutes before start time to see if you even work that day. It is a union job and the benefits are very good. Safety is a huge concern and is addressed daily. There are also weekly knowledge assessments from which you can earn prizes. I have personally received a lot of positive recognition from supervisors and their training was thorough.
good,I would go in to work everyday pumped and ready. I had one job bt through out the day you really have bout 4 . I was a pick off meaning I sorted the boxes where they have to be in the truck by zip codes. I loved the people I worked with management was OK they can be real tuff sometimes and take the job to serious at time when not needed.
good,"Ups is a awesome company. I would recommend any and everybody 2 work there. There benefits are great,and u have chances to move up and get better pay."
good,at first the hardest part of the job is to talk on different people with different culture. On that way I've learn to have a self confidence that I shouldn't give up and don't be afraid talking to other people.
good,"The workday started very early which was a bonus for me as I was working 2 jobs and was a full-time student. The work was very fast paced and, at times, could be very physically challenging. This made every day exciting to me. The hardest part of the job was definitely when people would call in sick and you would suddenly be working double if not triple the amount of work you usually do."
good,"Intense labor, but doesn't need much thought to meet expectations. What I have noticed that makes or breaks the workers are their supervisors. a good supervisor makes good workers and a good belt. A poor supervisor makes similar workers and belts."
good,This job was fun and is great paying. Most the time it don't seem like it's even a job because the drivers are so friendly. the hours wasn't I worked was good not to much and not to little.
good,"On a regular work day depending on where you are stationed you will be required to unload, load, or sort through a large amount of packages. There's a lot of work that comes with UPS but in all it is a great job, good benefits, and great pay plus a great work environment."
good,"Although I was only there for 3 weeks, I was still treated like a regular employee. It really is quite physically demanding. I have no regrets other than that I wasn't offered a permanent position."
good,UPS was by far one of the most difficult and best jobs ive ever had. If your hired as a reg temp driver there is alot expected from you and they have a very strict timeline things should be done. If you can put up with strict guidelines and rough work then UPS is a very good job especially for the money and benefits.
good,"In my experience, this company shows its employees that it cares about them and offers plenty of room for advancement. And the benefits are very excellent."
good,During the winter you receive a good amount of hours but during the other seasons it gets quite slow and are a little bothersome when it comes to the stores sales.
good,"Great place to work.  Good Benefits. Job security is exceptional."
good,It was a fun work place everybody was cool in there but it was some hard work but I liked it a lot in I wish it was not just seasonal
good,Will start you out as a preloader typical shift is from 2-3 AM until 9 AM. Need to work fast and be able to be on your feet for the whole shift. It is part time but you work Monday-Friday. Pay is Average but can move up in company with great benefits.
good,"UPS is your average factory work they ask you be able to lift up to 70lbs. The benefits are unbeatable you get paid vacation, insurance, and they pay for school if you work third shift. (If you work first they reimburse you) on top of them paying for school you get semester bonuses that vary in amount. I'm not sure 100% on starting pay but I believe it's now $10-11 and hour. Holiday pay, double and triple time after a year. I think on Christmas and Thanksgiving everyone gets holiday pay. Over all it's a good company.if applying apply for an administrative position for the hub. It comes with all the perks but you're non union so you don't have to do hard labor. Typically third shift is 3-4 hours you can apply for different positions after a year which is nice. They take really good care of their supervisors as well if that's something you're interested in after working there for a month I recommend being union for at least a year because your supervisor pay is based off experience."
good,"It has benefits, great pay, understanding management, professional employees and I would highly recommend this job to beginning or experienced workers. This was the best job I've had."
good,"This is a good place to work with good benefits package. In the Supervisory position, it can become a bit stressful at times with long hours, but with a great support of team members, it makes it manageable."
good,"While involving early hours, Ups is overall a quality company to work for. Great benefits and wages for part time work.christmas season is very hectic and involes going in to work at very early hours. Loading trucks can be strenuous but the work is overall satisying."
good,This is a good place to start coming out of high school or college to make a career out of. It has a lot of perks and a few cons. Nothing that someone who is focused on making a career would see as detrimental.
good,"Hustle, hustle, hustle.... this is a great part time job/ supplemental income. There is certainly opportunities to advance, they hire from within, which a lot of companies don't do now. They have plenty of benefits as well. The work was much more difficult when I was there, but the culture was dedicated... get in, get your job done, go to your next job/ class. This place makes sense for a lot of people."
good,"I would come in and start the morning by preloading UPS courier trucks, sometimes I would be in the semi from Phoenix, or the conveyer belt.  I learned how the UPS system works, how to identify certain boxes for certain trucks, and what to do at the Sierra Vista airport to pick up packages.  Environment was always vigorous but in a positive way to get the work done, the hardest part I would have to say was trying to fight the cold while you are on the semi sweating profusely, the most enjoyable was the workout."
good,The way everything functions and the way the mangers work with the employees is very put together. There shouldn't be a reason someone who hate to go to work
good,"The pay is not worth the work. Another job is required to supplement it... However, the benefits make up for the lack of pay to a good extent. Also, if thinking of applying, be prepared to be lied to about available work and promotions and needing to double check your pay every week in case you were shorted hours."
good,I've only been at UPS for a few months but so far I like the company and most of the people I work with have been here for longer than I've been alive. They typically promote from within so there are opportunities for advancement. The pay is good for the location and the management is great compared to most companies I've worked for.
good,"I enjoyed my employment at UPS. It provided me with a great understanding of how the company operates and the importance of how UPS maintains there well known name and continues to strive along their other competitive shipping companies. I've learned the many facets involved with their finances, sales, customer relations, and operations being apart of their company. The hardest part of the job would be not reaching the demands of every individual. Though it seems disappointing at times, it is impossible to satisfy everyone's needs and wants with customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with other team members who are knowledgeable, helpful, and on board to contribute to the success of the company."
good,"Loading/unloading is a very simple job, but it is hard work. You have to be able to load a minimum speed but it's really as fast as you can go. It takes time to learn the job, and the crew you are with can be less than ideal."
good,Arrive at work ON TIME. Follow direct instructions. Be a team player. Complete my task efficiently. Give the customers satisfaction.
good,Overall it's a good company/facility to work for. Don't necessarily have to be in good shape to work here just show up and do the task as needed. This particular job is a job you can grow within and from. Rather if that means with the company as well as learn from the job itself. Great experience. Looks good on a job application
good,"UPS is a suitable job for teenagers and adults who have a lot of time on there hands, as this jobs only requires 4 hour shifts a night, 5 days a week and overtime if need be. Pay's very well, i would recommend UPS for anyone who is looking for there first job and wants to save a bit of money up. All the UPS staff are very welcoming and bring a great atmosphere to the company."
good,"This is an Educational company and I am working as a office assissetence since 2014, I worked hard with my best performence. And also recieve greetings from my company for my work."
good,Very tiring work place.always moving an helping others.lifting boxes an walking boxes to theur doorstep is tiring.Pays good money an gives extra overtime for those who needs extra money.
good,"I was a driver helper for last peak season. I would meet up with the driver at a location from Monday to Friday at the same time. The hours you work are depending on how many packages are on the truck. For example if there are 170 packages, you would work at about 3 or 4 hours. It would say it on your time card that the driver has. It is a fast paced environment for most people and I was told that many people just quit because they cannot keep up or don't like it. I pretty much was a team player, I learned how to use the Diad quick from the first day, followed instructions, and kept up with the driver and also passed his expectations as well as the center's office cordinator. I worked with many other cool drivers and got to know the community well, watching them smile when their packages are delivered. The most enjoyable part was riding around representing brown and using the Diad during business stops to collect signitures. I was on the top 5 of the recommendation list and was called for a position as a permenant part time package handler."
good,"UPS is known for it's benefits, pay rate, and career advancement opportunities but it isn't all it's cracked up to be when work becomes such a large part of your life. Like most companies the more time you put into it, the more it will reward you with vacations, and pay raises. This company is not for people who aren't accustomed to hard work!"
good,"Although the days are long and one drives in some of the worst Wyoming weather, overall, the customers were awesome, the pay is amazing, and management does the best they can with what corporate provides.  Hardest part of the job is not knowing whether I will be selected as a full-time employee, and stressing about finding work after the interim seasonal employment has expired."
good,working there is good and also good to stay and got good benefits and shape but the down side enough hours. i make sure every boxes or packages are neat and order and also make sure its going to the right towns/cities and make sure its up to day
good,"UPS can be very demanding, very intense. But everyone works together to reach  a common goal. I would recommend UPS to anyone"
good,"UPS is a great place to work if your looking for a company that will pay for college. It's a great place to get health and dental benefits as well. It can get difficult during the peak season, which is from November to December."
good,"The work wasn't hard, just delivering packages, and I found it fun, although the management is unorganized and frustrating to work with.  The people who lived in the area I worked were usually very nice, and gave my driver and me gifts on an almost daily basis (it was around christmas, but people knew my driver by name and treated him well).  The weather is pretty easy to deal with as long as you dress in layers, and the lifting gets easier as you go."
good,UPS is a good company to work for. Hours are a little low during non-seasonal though. Full benefits after a year is nice too.
good,"Has great job security and benefits, but at time it can be stressful and challenging. People are great and hard workers, but employee attendances is an issue there."
good,My typical day at ups consists of loading and unloading trailers sometimes sorting. I have learned how to work hard from my experience working here. I enjoy going to work everyday and I look forward to the opportunities that will come in the near future.
good,"UPS is hiring individuals to work as temporary, seasonal Driver Helpers. This is a physical, fast-paced, outdoor position that involves continual lifting, lowering and carrying packages that typically weigh 25 - 35 lbs. and may weigh up to 70 lbs. It requires excellent customer contact skills and a lot of walking"
good,"A typical day of work started with team meeting, then stretch and any changes needing adjusting for the night. We would sort until the very last truck was unloaded, sorted, and loaded. I learned to work both efficiently and safely. I had amazing managers as well as co-workers. The hardest part of the job were the hours I worked. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I met, and how we've stayed friends past my time with UPS."
good,Professional and helpful. Truly cares for employees. USP envested time and training to ensure I knew my route and expectations before sending me on my own. The most enjoyable part of my job was the independence and interacting with customers.
good,"I worked overnight, i learned how to work at a fast pace, management is good, most of my co-workers are great people, hardest part of the job is the hoildays, everything was fun."
good,"Great place to work, great benefits. Start out unloading then work up to loading delivery trucks or sorting packages. Option to be seasonal driver helper. Great pay. Unless you plan on becoming a driver, part time hours only, early mornings."
good,Great company I was working over night shifts for the seasonal position it was a good work environment very fast paced just after a while I found a better paying job
good,This job pays really well and has very great benefits. The management can be poor at some times where they forget how to treat you and the amount of hours could be better. But the people here are friendly and helpful.
good,"Doing it again my 2nd year with UPS was easy but also it refreshed my memory to some requirements I didn't remember when I started working with UPS the first time. Drivers are very laid back, some of them can be strict, but if you do your requirements great, drivers will attend to lock you in on their schedules. Hardest part was carry and lifting heavier packages. Enjoyable part was socializing with the driver."
good,"For the larger portion of my stay at UPS, I was employed as a ""specialist"" supervisor, known as Internal Package Level Detail. My daily routine involved data sheets, technological tool management in the form of package scanners, and unique logistical computer systems. Throughout the day I was responsible for correcting both technological errors, and errors within the operations. This could be as simple as accidentally scanning the incorrect package, to as difficult as rerouting an entire workload. The job was fast-paced and required a great depth of knowledge on many aspects. Proper communication was key to success."
good,"Hard work, but fun if your athletic. Great place to move around and try different positions. Non stop movement. Constant flow of packages. Get to know your Supervisors well."
good,UPS is a good company it does drain your life thou since the hours are so demanding but compensation is rewarding. Its good overall but hard to get into and takes alot of time to move up.
good,"Ups give good benefits if you are in school and if you been with ups for a long time . When I was working at ups it's was good at first , it's just your breaks are 10 mins long that's it , but overall it's a good part-time job"
good,A good place for a young adult to start working. You have a lot of opportunities to grow along with inside the company. Company supports education along with providing eligibility to grow inside to company.
good,Great benefits and awesome people for a part time Job. I like the hours and get to pick the area I want to work in. I just hate having to work in the rain
good,Great place to work. Even though the work is often hard and strenuous the people and environment is great. I was employed for about 3 months and got a chance to become a delivery driver. Also they are a company that promotes from within so everyone has to start at the bottom.
good,Loading and unloading trucks was hard work but fun. So was sorting the packages off the belts. While there I learned the zip codes to all fifty states. Management really didn't bother you as long as you did your job. My coworkers were hilarious and always fun to work with. The hardest part was sometimes picking up hundred pound boxes. The best part was how physically fit you were after.
good,"Typical day at work is very hot and busy."
good,"The best part of the job is the people. I enjoyed working with nearly everyone that was on my belt. The management team is just as great too. The supervisors can be either good or bad, it just depends on the belt. The job was really tiring, tedious, stressful, and at times completely unreasonable. That is the only thing I did not like was the actual job."
good,"I've learned how important it is to have a trained and motivated work force, while keeping a safe and pleasant work environment."
good,"a typical day at work for me is, coming in at 5 a.m. getting  the early drivers paperwork done on schedule, making appointment in the afternoon."
good,I was there for three and a half years but I made the mistake of becoming a health and safety rep and saw a supervisor working unsafe so I wrote him up and he lied to get me fired
good,"Excellent opportunity for advancement within the company, especially if you have a degree in any field. Takes some time adjusting to the hours but it comes easily enough."
good,"My experience at UPS was overall difficult, but achievable. I always received compliments (and some criticism) for my work. UPS offered great benefits which I feel makes them liable to only give part-time workers two-hundred dollars per week. I knew my coworkers by more than their major tasks at hand. The breaks were a good time to nurture are bodies back to physical health from all of our duties, and talk to the coworkers we will see on the work floor. Overall, the work and people were a great experience, but I could be working a job that pays more for what it is worth."
good,Didn't work there long due it being a seasonal job. Putting all the boxes inside of trucks in the right order. The hardest part was keep up with your packages for your trucks. Coworkers was great friendly and helpful
good,Руководство компании поддерживает сплоченность коллектива и всячески способствует его слаженности
good,"The company takes better care of its low-level employees than any other company I've worked for. Benefits really can't be beaten, and are guaranteed advancement (the benefits) as you gain more seniority. That being said, it is a very demanding job physically, and managers are openly berated by their peers and superiors in front of subordinates if production goes under plan. Still, great company to work for those up to the challenge."
good,I have worked at UPS SCS for seven wonderful years. the staff and management are kind and supportive. It is a wonderful place to climb the corporate ladder as long as you are willing to work.
good,"A typical day at work is usually light depending on the package volume, with repeated movements/actions."
good,"The daily labor is hard work, but it is something the body gets used to after a few months. There is a very small learning curb, and the management works with college students and family's very well."
good,"My co-workers are extremely friendly and caring but the workload can be very overwhelming during the winter season (in particular). The result can be long hours, resulting in burn out and sheer exhaustion."
good,Great company to work for. Fast paced work enviorrnment. Learned a wide viariety of skills while working at UPS.  For the most part great management whom are willing to take the time and help you as well as train.
good,first we would stretch before working to make sure we don't pull a muscle and then we talk about safety before we go to our work station the i would see how many trucks i have to load for the day and it could be 3 trucks and some time 4 trucks. what i learned about this job is that hard work goes a long way. management is great here the check up on you to see if your doing ok in work and in our personal life. the hardest part of the job is trying to get all the right packages in the right truck when we get really busy. the most enjoyable part of the job is how everybody like to joke around.
good,"Some of the best workers I have ever been around. You are on your own most of the time, and are expected to finish the job in a timely manner. The pay is good, as are the benefits and vacation. Like all big companies, the people at the top seem to forget what got UPS to where it is today. Management has some great people and I think UPS takes advantage of them. Hourly workers can and will be pushed hard. It's about putting your time in the company and hopefully retiring with a good pension. The equipment is on the newer side, but not top line. The clerks and mechanics are top notch. The hours can be odd depending on your job title, but they get better with more seniority.  If you take pride in your work you will find many people here with the same mindset. Yeah, I am a fan. Stayed there a long time, and proud to be UPSer."
good,"Hectic days for good pay and benefits.  Minimal training provided, more of a learn as you go company.  Great for anyone seeking part time employment.  Advancement is available."
good,"Great company, however, the hours are not for everyone. Longevity is the key to success. Benefits cannot be beat by any company!"
good,Not to bad of a place to work just wish they gave you more food. I also wish the equipment they would give you worked a lot better scanners always were broke or never charged.. management was always working they never had enough people hired. always placed people in the wrong areas and hardly got any hr
good,Great place to work.  I was able to develop my organizational and data analysis skills. I created solutions in order to win new business.
good,"My experience at UPS was very good and I had no trouble adjusting to the work at hand, they train you one on one so that u can get a comfortable feel for it also but it is a fast paced job"
good,One of exciting company to work. Dealing with customer service and efficient delivery. Handling costumer complaint. In charge of documents delivery and despatch.
good,I wish they would have kept me because I really liked the job.  I didn't like being told to throw boxes because I didn't know what was in the boxes and felt bad for throwing them.
good,I really enjoyed delivering packages to see smiles on customers face. The Co-workers was fun and helpful. The breaks were awesome and overall a very professional work place
good,Typical day at work load trucks on little coffins I learn to work at a fast speed with a small window of time the management stepped in when we're really busy you're backed up two people that are really outgoing friendly helped  you with  your work told you things you didn't know you needed to know to get the job done better and ffasterh ardest part about working there was rush of work outta the blue at times when the work was light
good,The work was fast past having to unload freight trucks and loading the delivery trucks. Management wasn't always on the same page as the workers and would often cause friction.
good,"Tough at first but once you get used to work, job isn't that tough, just tough days.  For most part great employees to work with and for.  Toughest part is getting use to the work, took me quite a while but now I have it comes down to whether I'm working with a new hire or not.  Best part is the people, all about the same age and for most part want to enjoy their time while at work."
good,"My review for Agway was a great working experience for me and I learned new skills each and everyday, also I learned how to operate heavy machinery."
good,"Early shift start time makes the morning seem a little longer, but the work day goes by pretty quickly. All co-workers and managers are professional. Definitely learned to adjust to a tighter disciplinary schedule and a high pace/physically demanding workplace. Hardest part of the job is the fast pace and time of day but the enjoyable is the single focus task."
good,"ups is a good shipping company and one of the best in the united state it offers a lot to the workers and staff that works there, ups is not only a job but its actually a career and I loved the time I spent working there and also I loved the benefits they offer."
good,"Great place to work. Friendly environment, management is great. Only bad part is in the winter you freeze and summer you sweat your butt off. So dress accordingly to the weather"
good,Responsible for the documentation and input of all data. Counting devices utilized to maintain accurate inventory. Had to thoroughly inspect damaged packages. Coordinated efforts to re-route packages to the correct destination.
good,"Releasing shipments coming into the United States Customs. "
good,"A typical work day for me is getting my work area cleaned up and placing as many bags in my carts as I can.  I enjoy doing this because it helps me keep my productivity high by not having to leave my work area to get more bags.  I then check for miss placed packages from the previous shift.  If I find a miss placed package I re-induct it into the system so it will reach our customer on time.  I work with a diverse group of people which I find most enjoyable.  The hardest part of the job is keeping the line running smoothly when the volume of parcels for the night is high and the line is short handed of its full supply of package-handlers.  I have learned a lot from my managers and supervisors.  An example of this is when one of my supervisors gave me a tip on how to bag out packages in a more efficient way as to optimize productivity.  I used her suggestion, and it helped me keep my work area from overflowing with packages."
good,"At the beginning its a fun job to have but after awhile that feeling wears off, with an opportunity to move up within the company just takes a moment."
good,"The company provides the best benefit for their employees, but the wages is below the average market. "
good,"I love working there.  The most enjoyable part would be the Co-workers, they are entertaining and fun. The work is fast paced, but simple."
good,it can be difficult at times to keep up with the flow of packages on the conveyor. it is stressful knowing that one wrong box out of 800 can affect your job.
good,"UPS is blessed to have many dedicated, hard working, loyal employees.The company has given me the chance to use my skills for the betterment of the company, They have been good to me. My day is never the same from one to the next. I enjoy the variety that a work day brings."
good,"Excellent training.  Good, dedicated front line leadership. "
good,"They can be a little hard on employees, but the pay and job security are great. Management can be a little hard on employees from time to time, but that is to be expected in a production based environment."
good,"I've been working with UPS over 2 years and it's good place to work, good benefits for part time, but pay is very bad at the beginning.  The pay minimum wage first year, even though the job is $25 worth of work."
good,The office team was great to work with. I worked as an individual contributor. I learned team collaboration and customer service skills.
good,"Great opportunity to earn a decent wage and employee benefits. The work is labor intensive, so being in prime physical shape is a must if you wish to thrive in this working environment. The job is 2nd shift, so it may not be suitable for everyone's schedule."
good,"Overnight Loader: Lifting packages up to 70 pounds, loading trucks fast pace, and being organized with packages overnight."
good,"I helped companies to get their products through customs. I learned a lot about what was required to get product across international borders. Management was very patient when it came to explaining how things needed to be done, They occasionally bought dinner, which was very thoughtful. I worked 2nd shift which was a more informal environment than 1st. Everyone was very nice and helpful. The hardest part of the job was getting used to 2nd shift with a teenager at home. I enjoyed the atmosphere, we even through a baby shower for one of the ladies during our shift."
good,"I liked it a lot, I ways able to make money while balancing my school and social life. They also care about their workers as well."

good,"Great management, Great environment, job security, clean work place, reasonable and competitive pay, reasonable and competitive benefits after one year of service"
good,"Ups is a work environment that is entry level, it does provide a variety of positions to work. its geared for college students and young people out of school looking to make a few dollars."
good,"A typical day at work is delivering 140 stops to 160 stops with 25 pick up accounts daily.  Hours worked vary day to day from 9 hrs to 11 hrs. I learned to plan ahead and know your stops at least 5 ahead, that is a great concept for starting any day any where."
good,"A very demanding job, a typical dayat work is delivering between 140 to 160 stops per day with 25 pick ups account.  The hours worked vary day to day from 9 to 11 hours, I learned from the job to always plan ahead"
good,"My experience at UPS so far has been a decent one. It is a bit demanding in terms of physical labor, especially whenever we get large volume coming through at night, but not excessive. Management here is definitely not something I like but it isn't terrible."
good,I would wake up early in the moring to assist my driver deliver packages to both houses and businesses. It was important to pay attention to the street names and figure out which route the best to take.

good,I love working at UPS great benefits and good atmosphere. There is always room to move up in the company. I have also been moved around a lot so I am being crossed trained.
good,Loved this job.  Worked in a warehouse. Extremely early hours.  Learned a lot about how to build relationships with union employees so they respect and listen to the tasks given.
good,"UPS taught me a lot about working in a warehouse environment, working with pallets, packages, etc. Management was very good as well as the coworkers were very friendly. Hardest part of the job is unloading 53' long trailers. most enjoyable part of the is working with coworkers."
good,I only worker there as a seasonal employee but it was fun fast paced and kept me on my toes if you work hard and they had hours you can pick them up
good,"It was a very demanding and fast paced environment"
good,"Um das melhores empresas que tive o privilégio de trabalhar,excelentes condições de trabalho, bons treinamentos para com crescimento do profissional. Colegas que trabalham como família, gerência participativa, boas premiações por produtividade (PPR).A parte difícil só foi ter que saído da empresa, pois estava em outro estado e não consegui transferência."
good,"Great company to work for that offers great benefits and room for advancement if you work there long enough. Keeps you in shape because the job is very physical, but also keeps you on your toes because every day is different."
good,"Typical day of work involves me loading the cans that are used to load the planes with. Fun place to be around. Management is okay, supervisors are sometimes hard to deal with the manageable."

good,a typical day of work will consist of continuously unloading packages out of a tractor trailer onto moving belts to distribute them to the proper package cars
good,"I enjoyed working there. The pay and benefits can't be beat. The problem with this company is the management and issues with the union. Also, got tedious going to the same place day after day. Can't request a route change for a year. Would be better if route changes could happen more often to lessen the feelings of having the same,  tiresome route."
good,"If you are willing to work hard and promote yourself, chances are you will get hired into a more permanent position.  The job is fast paced and great for staying in physical shape.  The diversity of the job allows you to see areas you would not otherwise visit or learn about."
good,"Working with the main driver to deliver packages to a wide range of residential and commercial areas is a lot more tiring that people may think! Constantly up and down, moving packages weighing up to 70kg and delivering them safely and efficiently to people in all kinds of places (warehouses, residential flats on the fourth floor, docking bays, laboratories etc)."
good,"goed salaris en fijne werktijden."
good,"UPS is a global courier service"
good,"It is a great place to work. Management may push, but that is only because it can be a stressful job. We have deadlines to meet and they expect us to work hard to meet them. Everyone is usually left to work, by this I mean that management is not breathing down your neck all day. I can at least say that I look forward to working there everyday."

Everyday, more learning experience that can be applied to everyday life and for future employments. The most enjoyable part was working with my colleagues or co trainers and learning from them. I felt so proud every time Im being called SIR or trainer. In every class i teach, new faces or new environment had challenged me to do my very best by sharing what my knowledge is."

good,"Usually a fun place to work. Enjoy most of my co-workers, and my job keeps me physically active, as well as keeping my brain sharp."
good,This was a great company to work for and I loved my route and the people on it.  Some days when the weather was bad it made for a difficult and unpleasant experience.  This was my first job out of college and really help mature and mold me to become a hard worker.
good,Nice environment to work if you are attending school or need part-time work. Paying attention to detail is critical when working in a positon.
good,"Hours were would almost always fluctuate every few days, depending on the amount of packages would come in the night before. Management was excellent in terms of assigning people to a workstation that fit the individual the best, depending on how many packages they could load with in a hour, they made you should for 150 packages and hour. Always pushing you to do your best and rewarded you for no miss-loads. The hardest part of the job was waking up in the early morning only to work for a few hours and then go home."
good,"I am responsible for opening the store, making sure we have stocked inventory, check for store neatness. Greeting customers, helping solve their problems and giving quotes on their shipping/packing needs. Selling and cross selling our services an products.

good,Offers a tour of the facility and training courses before being placed. You can take tests at your own will as a way of increasing wages.  Consists of team players. Hub temperatures vary with outdoor temperatures. A good learning experience for young employees who are in school.
good,Excellent pay and benefits and the work is steady and regular. It is very hard work and requires early morning hours. The work environment does not change much although more responsibility is given as seniority increases. The opportunity for full-time work is there but not too many full-time opportunities are available. The hardest part of the job is the early morning hours and the hard physical labor but the best part of the job is the sense of accomplishment felt at the end of the shift.
good,Its good experiences for me to work different positions over years. I had great communications with my co workers and supervisors about the positions. The hardest part of the job are unloading and loading because its about the time to meet their expectation. I enjoyed one of the position is porter. I worked 4:30am-1pm everyday as sunrise shift.
good,Good place for part time job. Has great benefits. Free environment.  great retirement plan offered. paid vacation and sick pay. great job for college student. opportunities for promotion
good,Great place for advancement. The pay is pretty good for management but not for the ones who are loading and unloading. Then again the benefits are hard to beat. Management can often be stressed due to time management and number crunching.
good,"I worked during the busy winter Holiday season's so it was long days with lots of packages to unload. However, each day was still enjoyable and the driver's who I worked with were extremely productive and efficient on top of being enjoyable people to be with all day. It was interesting to me to see how their whole delivery system functioned at UPS. Some drivers even let me work with their electronic routing device which was something new and interesting that I had learned while there. Even though the year's that I had worked at UPS were for short seasonal positions, it still gave me an inside look into a company with strong working relationships between employees (one driver to another) and a high paced high functioning work process. I really liked my time there."
good,"Incredibly hot in the summer, very exhausting. I personally liked management for the most part as well as my coworkers."
good,"I liked working here , everyone was fun to be around. Management helped out wherever they were needed. The hardest part of the job was getting up at 4am to be there at 5"
good,I loved the physical job that I work for. It's a nice a very its a very good company to work for as well become higher in the company. Your willingness will take you far!
good,Glad I have a place of work to earn a living. My evening supervisor is terrific. Love all the drivers and my co-workers. Some times the packages are heavy.
good,Would be a great place to work if everything you worked for there didn't depend on seniority. Worked 6.5 years there in the hub part time as well as a full time job until hired full time.
good,"At UPS I started out as a package handler, but eventually got promoted to supervisor.  Unfortunately, I had to leave due to conflicting schedules with school."
good,"I was fortunate to take on different roles within the company during my years employed. Although each shift/job required different tasks and duties, I was responsible for making sure each supervisor I worked with had every resource he needed in order to meet the requirements of each shift. Important responsibilities include the successful use of our company's computer application server to accommodate customer's needs, locate products, and perform data processing duties. During my time with the company, I was in charge of billing their largest customer's product in the the Northeast, Sunsetter awnings. I was able to learn multiple business tasks over the years that included knowledge of business management, customer service, billing, auditing, and what it was like to work for a successfully ran corporation in which quality requirements were expected. For the most part it was a pleasure to work with many different co-workers. With many co-workers in the company that are dependent on one another, tension can build up from time to time. I am grateful for the interaction because there are going to be times when we don't get along with a particular co-worker. We were still able to focus on the duties of the job nonetheless. The hardest part of each job was in some instances, having to multi-task in a pressure situation. At any moment I could be faced with multiple tasks from both customers and co-workers. Over time I believe I handled these ""rush"" moments fairly well as I was able to keep calm and handle each request by importance and in a timely fashion. Working for a structured"
good,"Although I briefly worked at UPS, I did enjoy my time there. I started out as a Package Handler and loaded an average of 300 packages an hour onto various trailers heading to various destinations. My supervisor was a glorified disco-loving water boy (I mean that in an affectionate way) who just loved to make you smile and motivate you, and it was overall a very positive environment and I enjoyed working here. They help you pay for school, so that's a nice plus, as well as offer lots of employee discounts to many popular store chains, such as Barnes and Noble and Apple."
good,was a great work place good people to work with just was part time work wish I could have stayed but couldn't afford to after getting laid off from continental airlines both were at the airport
good,"On a typical day, I would clock in and the supervisor would give you a bay number to go to. Then you would wait for the sorters to get ready and they would give you the go ahead to start unloading the trailer. Once you finished that trailer, the supervisor would give you another bay door to go to and you would unload that one. It would continue until our entire section of bays had no more scheduled trailers to unload. I learned how to quickly and efficiently unload tightly fitted packages from a trailer safely. Most supervisors there were good, but i had one that i thought was a little harsh and over the top.The co-workers were great, they were my favorite thing about the job. The hardest part of the job was unloading trailers that had a lot of heavy packages that are well over 100 pounds. According to training we are supposed to get help and not lift them on our own, but once you actually start the job you're usually alone in a truck and are ""encouraged"" by your supervisor to do it on your own."
good,"Na początku jest ciężko, jak to w każdej pracy, ale gdy już sie wpadnie w ten ""rytm"" to idzie z górki. Szefowie traktują pracowników jak kolegów, a nie jak niewolników, choć gdy popełni się błąd to potrafią przeprowadzić poważną rozmowę, ale wszystko na spokojnie i bardzo jasno tłumaczone. Dwa razy do roku firmowa impreza, np. na Boże Narodzenie całą firmą byliśmy na kręglach z kolacją, oczywiście wszystko na koszt firmy. Najtrudniejszym okresem jest okres świąteczny kiedy to wszyscy wysyłają sobie prezenty. Najprzyjemniej jest latam gdy jest mało pracy i można sie zrelaksować nad jeziorkiem podczas przerwy."
good,"Great company to work for with job security"
good,As a helper I witnessed how the driver knew those who he delivered to and make connections. taught me to adapt to oncoming duties. The hardest part was probably the constant running. The most enjoyable part is the ride from place to place rather than siting in one area.
good,"I love this company they explains what need to be done and assure you, you can get the job done"
good,"Package handling/sorting can be a very physically demanding job. Depending on the shift you work, the hours can be off-putting. "
good,I worked this job during the Christmas season for a few weeks. The days were long which was expected but overall the job itself was great.
good,At typical day at UPS consist of loading packages onto multiple designated trucks. I learned more about how to be a hard worker and how to appreciate other hard workers. My supervisors were very helpful and really made my job easy as possible. While working at UPS you realize the respect you have for other workers because everyone works hard in this environment. I believe the hardest part of the job would be the pace of which you have to go. The most enjoyable would be the exercise you get performing this job.
good,"Set up work area for employees, and continuously train and retrain employees to use proper company methods to safely complete the job in a timely manner. Try to find ways to make belt run more efficiently while making sure service numbers are made."
good,Consistently busy during peak season with a lot of commotion. Very helpful supervisors that ensure your safety and those around you.
good,"For my position, I helped my driver deliver packages to many homes and businesses along our route. Hustle and hard work is definitely required to get everything done at a decent pace. Being aware of your surroundings and listening to instructions carefully are some things that employees will get better at."
good,"delivering packages & returning."
good,"It is very easy to go to college and work here because of their flexible hours and nice pay. You get to build relationships with your fellow coworkers and management. I gained better hand eye coordination, performed admin. duties, and learned how to communicate better in a team. The hardest part is the job itself because there are risks of quite severe injuries if you fall or not paying attention or just being in the right area at the wrong time."
good,"At UPS package handlers constantly lift, lower and slide packages weighing between 25 and 70 pounds. It is a very fast-paced position that gets packages to their destination."
good,"Every day at work I was delivering packages, running them from door to door for the driver."
good,"Was a very good job just had some bad people working there. You will learn that the customer is always right. "
good,"Great job, pay and benefits. Had a lot of fun, perks were outstanding. Just don't want to be too detailed because this job I did was very unique and anyone I worked with or for that read this would be able to tell who I am. Sorry."
good,"A typical day at UPS basically involves unloading semis,and loading package trucks in the morning, and unloading package trucks, and loading up semis at night. Lots of lifting and lowering. All postions are part time unless your a driver, or upper management. But as a Part time worker, you are given full time benefits after your probation period."
good,"This HR Team requires a lot of commitment for time and a lot of heart. It is very worth it. UPS is a military friendly and diverse company that thrives on bringing an understanding to employees about the values at every level. There are not a ton of positions for Human Resources to advance right now. When they come up, they are worth viewing."
good,"Supervised and coordinated the activities of eighteen employees engaged in loading and unloading cargo."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job for me is when I work with a customer to identify their underlying needs and I am able to help them accomplish their goals.
good,A typical day at UPS was ran smoothly. I learned that working a scheduled routine is important as a package handler. The management was great. My co-workers were hardworking. The hardest par of the job was the heavy lifting. The most enjoyable part was training.

good,"Early in the morning I checked my emails to look for any urgent issues."
good,"Well, I was given a job at the start of the work, and work through the day with minimal supervision. I got a pick list (looked like a phone book) and went off picking for a first 2 hours, then 15min break and get back to work for another 2 hours. This is where everything changes, world become total riot, people run screaming, feeling helpless. I put down my scanner and go for lunch. Reason for such action is system gets reset at that time. After lunch I pick up my scanner, everything comes back to normal again, I continue as before, till the end of the day."
good,"a typical day would be help to filing paper or computer data , ansering and incoming or making outgoing calls to customers to asure we were giving the best service we can ."
good,A typical day involves clearing invoices of packages that are being shipped to the U.S from overseas. We give U.S customs a clear description of the commodity being shipped. The description has to be accurate in order not to be fined by customs and to also ensure that the importer receives the package in a timely fashion.
good,"UPS is a very fast paste work environment. The pay I pretty good. Once you accumulate a few years it will be excellent. The driver I worked with during the holiday season made 100000+ a year with great benefits. "
good,good place to work for part time.  Work is fast paced managers seem to know what they are doing.  It does get hot in the summer and super freezing in the winter.  Good benefits as well.

I get along with everyone.  I am ask to do just about everything."

good,"hard work"
good,"Ho lavorato in questa azienda come part-time, ho trovato l'ambiente davvero piacevole per l'accoglienza dei colleghi, lavoro pesante al punto giusto, e una buona organizzazione nel lavoro da parte di tutti. Orario un po pesante ma fattibile (5-9:30), pur di lavorare. "
good,"A typical day at UPS was fast paced. There was plenty of stops in each area, for it was Christmas season. I learned about how companies receive packages, and my job as a deliverer. My co-workers (drivers) were very helpful. Long days may have been the hardest part, but it wasnt really that hard. Overall, it was a great job."
good,Challenging fast pace work!! Loading anywhere between 2-3 trucks at a time. Packages weighing anywhere from 2- and up to 100 lbs.
good,"A typical day consisted of delivering over 250 packages as well as overnight envelopes.  "
good,"When working at a UPS Hub, the environment is very fast paced and results oriented.  Whether in a management role or as a member of the union, the job is very physical.  Safety is crucial at UPS and employees must always be aware of their surroundings. Constant lifting and lowering of packages will put strain on your body from day to day so it is important to stretch before the workday.  Loaders are required to load a minimum of 350 packages per hour.  Unloaders are required to unload over 1000 packages per hour.  UPS is a member of the Teamsters Union so seniority plays a crucial role in job bidding to transfer to other positions.  The benefits as a member of the union are ranked among the best.  If you do not plan on attending college, the Teamsters Union offers a great career path with pay increases every year you stay.  If you stay safe and work hard, it can be very rewarding.  "
good,Great place to work. Friendly and knowledgeable employees. Carriers are thankful and provide lunch during the holidays. Only wish the job wasn't contract.
good,"Get bags, Clean work area, bag overflowing bags, 10min break, walk back and fourth for entire shift checking bags, inducting, help others, use bathroom, drink water"
good,"I overall enjoyed my employment here, but there were often times of high stress and chaos as a result of poor management. A typical day isn't too bad, though and location is likely a key determinant."
good,"As a sales associate at the UPS store, I work closely with customers to ensure all their needs are met to satisfaction. Whether it be, processing shipments, assisting in the use of printers, copiers, faxes, customer e-mail, packaging, etc. I work as a team member in completing customer service tasks with co-workers on a daily basis."

good,"A good, stable company with great benefits and room for advancement. A company with a great philosophy that strives for perfection and is dedicated to the service of its customers."
good,It is a union job. Fast paced and hard work. You are however compensated well. If you stay there is opportunity for advancement and job stability is there. Only downside is it is almost impossible to transfer.
good,"Walking into the hub can be overwhelming and chaotic but once you get settled in and start working it becomes second nature. The hard part is dealing with the Teamsters union because they can be very combative but I have a good relationship with my employees and usually never have any problems that can't be resolved without shop stewards. I have learned a lot about motivating employees to complete the everyday tasks of effectively and efficiently processing packages through the hub process. At times, management occasionally make questionable decisions that can impact the everyday operation. Overall, the most enjoyable part is knowing you have job security even when you feel like you had an off day."
good,"Excellent company to work for.  "
good,"good work, steady work, good management, good hrs, and the indoor basketball court was a definite plus"
good,Fast paced work enviroment with ever changing conditions.

good,I love working with UPS and I feel like I can always have a job if I choose. The only problem is that people who work here tend to stay here and that provides little room to move up.
good,Working at UPS is usually a very repetitive process. You come in go to your area and take the packages that belong to the cars you are loading off the belt and load them properly. It is a fast paced job and can be overwhelming at times. my co workers are great and fun to be around.
good,During a typical day I am responsible for cycling through the systems on the computer to ensure that everything is working properly and is ready to run for the day. Over the course of six years I have learned about what it takes to make a company work and have gotten valuable management experience and computer skills. I get along well with co workers and employees at all levels. I really enjoy being able to work on my own while still being able to help others when the situation arises. I do not like how shorthanded we always are because it requires me to perform another supervisor's job and I cannot finish all of my weekly duties on time.
good,UPS has given me the knowledge and know how to manage and supervise multiple personalities.
good,"Loaded truck and went half a day to run."
good,"Had to drive to a location where more experienced driver would be wait to pick you up. Then spend the entire day delivering then evening picking up packages. Variety of weight items could take its toll sometime late evening. Drivers were very helpful and friendly, made sure you didn't fail, and delivered packages with you. Best part didn't have to stress about anything other than being there on time, and finishing tasks before a deadline hour."
good,"At first it was difficult but when i learned the routine it gets easier,i also learned how to get along with other people,make friends with doorman,securities and others"
good,"A typical day includes organizing and motivating my employees to complete the assigned work load. After the work is all moved out I'm responsible for paying everyone and completing my paperwork for the night."
good,I worked at UPS a long time.  The benefits offered were really great but you definitely earned them.
good,"Flexible if you are in school, safety and wellness are talked about a lot and encouraged in all areas of life."

good,UPS demands results. It is understandable considering its excellent benefit package. It employs classic managing tactics and employs them in modern circumstance.
good,"My work hours start very late in the evening and end early morning. It is a high stress job which consists of constant lifting and lowering of packages, ranging in many different sizes and weights. Very little time to socialize or focus on anything else other than the job one is required to perform. Team work is helpful, as many boxes and be over 70lbs. Management and other supervisors who work for UPS are typically easy going and free spirited. What I like most about UPS are the benefits. UPS offers excellent Health Care and Dental benefits. I feel lucky to say I work for such a well known company that has such a positive and successful reputation."
good,"part time you work about 5 hours and you never stop moving and before you know it your shift is done!"
good,The good thing about working for UPS is they showed me various skills in order to do multiple jobs and to apply certain skills for future jobs.
good,I was certified to operate forklift and pick up the skill very fast . At the beginning of my employment I was only unloading the trailers and docking the freight behind the destination doors .

good,"Started the day out every morning arriving at the center no later than 7:30 am and working no more than 10-12 hours a day (since it was during Christmas time) it was a fairly fast paced job. The driver was a nice guy, never came into contact with management since I was basically at the bottom of the totem pole."
good,"Demanding"
good,A very high-paced job. Learned to multi-task and also how to manage and coach employees.The most difficult part of the job was working out in the elements. The best part of the job was knowing the service we were providing.
good,"I have been working for the UPS Store franchise for almost eight years now. As a high school and then college student I couldn't ask for a better job. The hours a easy, the pay is good, and every owner I have worked for has been kind and more than willing to work with a school schedule. I got a lot of hand on experience in management and in the industry. The only issue is now that I am about to graduate from a university I have no where to grow. Benefits are not a reality here or advancement. I hope to carry the many lessons I learned here over to a new job that has advancement."
good,"Every night work to a tight deadline. "
good,"When you first start you can feel the tench-en in the air. At first you won't be paid much, but of you are there a few years you can make good money. The benefits at this job are the best around. You work hard for 4 hours a day and have your weekends off. The only issue is the supervises and management. You'll get the feeling that they don't always know what there doing."
good,Great job. Fits into my busy life schedule. And plus no weekends.
good,"Moving parcels all over the world is a big job, show these folks some respect; ground vehicles, jets and planes through DFW to deliver and pickup parcels to drop them on the intended doorstep."
good,"I worked nights loading/unloading/sorting parcels to different delivery trucks, going to different destinations. The hardest part was all the lifting of the packages and the hot summer months."
good,"UPS is a fun place to work at if you are looking for a part time gig and don't mind handling packages that weigh 100lbs sometimes. "
good,Joining UPS was the highlight of my career.  I was able to show my database skills.  My supervisor helped my gain SQL knowledge I have been able to develop since.  I have been able to branch out to other software products and develop my skills to a wider range.
good,"A typical day at work is clocking in and going back to the HSN (Home Shop Return) Truck, and putting the HSN boxes in a neat fashion. I've learned all the technical terms of all the machinery in the building, and I also learned how to take up space when it come to packing something. The management is awesome at UPS. They treat everyone the same. No matter how long you have been there. My co-workers are the same way. They treat you in a fair way. The hardest part of the job was waking up early in the morning. You will have to wake up at about 3 every morning to get ready for work. The most enjoyable part of the job is converting with the other employees. We would joke around and have a good time."
good,"very fast pace work place, very detailed and good hard working employees"
good,As a preloader you work early mornings which is nice because then you have the day to yourself for a second job. Typically as a Preloader you will load up to 3 trucks for drivers.
good,"Each day I went into work knowing that I will leave sore. I learned that although you may have people you know there, you will not be able to socialize because it is a place of business. My co- workers all look out for each other while there, making sure we ate and ready to work. The hardest part of the job is pushing yourself without slowing down because of the flow of business is fast paced. I really enjoy being able to come into work knowing that everybody is focused on teamwork."
good,"Compared to other places I've worked, it was the most social and well paced I've ever worked."
good,"During my tenure I had several positions and maximized each with educating and motivating others.  Even though I controlled labor supervisory positions, each level of management had their own nuances and result aspects.  My most proud moment was building an updated Training and Retention crew that helped enhance the new hire training and reduce the turnover percentage in an intense, fast paced environment.  Keeping focus on the growth of the new hire through building better communication, mental, and physical skills required to gain seniority in a bargaining unit position,  Promoting knowledge based training and improving the aspect of the job methods.  Organizing large groups of workers, supervisors, and drivers to achieve a tough goal is rewarding.  During this time, positive relationships are built and I never compromised my integrity no matter the situation, is a must.  Being consistent and dependable with instant feedback and using round table discussions with management and employees to build a better way of life within the walls of the work place.  I removed the silo's that were built between the workers and management which improved all communication and understanding for both sides.  WIN WIN"
good,"Clock in at work and sort packages be numeric code that run down from a conveyor belt.On my job I learn to work with different personalities,think fast on my feet and work up to 70 pound packages.

I am also responsible for all inbound loads and making sure they they are unloaded and headed to the correct destination. I supervise 10-15 package handlers. "

good,"An overall great place to work, I really enjoyed working there."
good,"The job was very organized and very efficient, everything that was done consisted of being accurate, efficient, and organized doing everything in a consecutive order."
good,"There are many benefits for working at UNITED PARCEL such as the ability to go to school and have a part time job that gives you the opportunity for reimbursement and health benefits that are, in my opinion, are exceptional.  I think  the warehouse work environment is the best part of being with UNITED PARCEL because the hustle and bustle of executing time sensitive objectives is something I grew up with on a farm so it reminds me of my childhood. The opportunity to learn new procedures and jobs is a great part of the company as well, over the years I have been able to learn a lot about the business of operations.  It's been ""policy"" to promote from within as long as that candidate has got their degree or nearly got it.  It could be a degree ""basket weaving""(and I quote that title from one of my managers) for all they care as long as you have that piece of paper.  My aggravation comes from that fact that if one has been there long enough, when does the experience become just as valuable as that piece of paper?  There are speculations that people have been promoted without having a degree only because they know someone well enough to get that influence."
good,"Fast paced warehouse where employees are loading package cars."
good,"Working for UPS was not a bad gig. The only difficulty is being on your feet a lot and sometimes in bad weather conditions depending on where you live. I'm in Michigan so you can see that sometimes, in the seasonal times when needed more near Thanksgiving and Christmas it was difficult but not impossible. Plus the drivers were extremely helpful and fun to be around."
good,"Lot of backstabbing going on here, lying, and unproductive blaming."
good,"working with the account excutives and getting their day planned out what customer to visit pulling volume and revenue reports. learned each customer and their needs as a whole. i was there so long my co-workers was like family we shared family stories and accomplishments. the hardest part was having to leave it was my first and only job. my most enjoyable part was going to work daily and seeing the people there , working closely with them"
good,"I have no complaints...Just wish I could have been an permanent employee, but there wasn't any positions available."
good,"I really loved working with the company. The only issue is that I had a son and the hours were overnight. I was hard to keep up with my daily life and social time. It was also far away from home. I lived in Augusta and the workplace was in Aiken. Long commute every night. However I loved the job. Very detailed oriented, also helpful management and trainers available. Co-workers were always fun to work with and sincerely a working time."
good,"My job was to ensure the sorting of packages and loading of the package cars in service to the Gwinnett County portion of the greater Atlanta area.  I supervised 16 people in 13 different work stations.  We got 40 package cars ready to roll out with packages loaded in good sequence stop order after the packages were sorted.  I learned that when you have ultimate responsibility in an area, sometimes there are no excuses other than you just have to make things happen (within guidelines and policies).  The leadership at UPS is very hard-nosed and stern because they have to be.  My co-workers understood the demands of the job and had to rise to the occasion.  The hardest part of the job was when some kids would call off and their workstations had to be manned.  I often had to drop down into their vacated spots but still had my normal duties to get done.  The most enjoyable part of the job was at the end of each shift knowing that it took a full team effort to get the package cars loaded and rolling out after dealing with what troubleshooting cropped up on each given day."
good,"Working with for UPS was a challenge physically. Your lifting, pushing and pulling products that range from 1lb-150lbs all shift long. The energy is very high and uplifting. The mangers are very open and user friendly. My coworkers helped me over achieve by competing with me on a daily basis. The best part about the job was the people because they genuinely enjoyed working together."
good,"I start off the night loading trailers. I learned from others while I work here on how to load. Management is great. My co-workers are all great and their also very hard workers. The hardest part of the job is trying not get sick because the conditions can be very harsh in the warehouse. I like to do physically intense jobs like this, it keeps me in shape."
good,"consistant not hard but not easy of a day it varies"
good,"During the day, I packed and shipped packages for customers. I learned the proper way to pack fragile as well as non-fragile items. In addition to packing and shipping, I performed many secretarial duties including: faxing, filing, making copies, print jobs, scanning, emails, phone inquiries, and ordering supplies. I was in charge of managing all mailbox related information. Computer and data entry skills were imperative. My co-workers were well trained, fun filled, and a pleasure to work with. The manager was a delight as well. I did not find anything hard about working with UPS. I enjoyed my job. The most enjoyable part about the job was interacting with the customers. I built a great rapport with many of the day to day customers. Building great relationships with many successful business owners was enjoyable."
good,I run reports daily. The hardest part of the job is that it's monotonous.
good,"A typical day sterts at 5am and ends around 9am."
good,"Loading boxes and practicing safe work methods"
good,"twilight shift: start time is around 3a.m. giving all my co workers their first challenge of the day. Next, its a constant rate of lifting 1lb-175lbs in a safe manner for their entire shift with one 10min. break. Sorting all packages to our drivers specifications with a good feedback."
good,You go in knowing exactly what to do each night. The worst part of the job is working night shift.
good,I had to stretch as soon as I arrived! BOXES everywhere. A well oiled machine where seconds counted.
good,Amazing Management but terrible work conditions. My commute daily was only ten minutes.
good,UPS allowed me to work through college paying 100%  of my tuition with the Metro-College program. This was very helpful and allowed me to get my bachelors degree.
good,"Unloading box cars and loading semi trailers"
good,Great job for learning customer service and boss is amazingly cool
good,"A typical day at work was either loading package cars or tractor trailers. Every day I knew what was expected of me, and that was definitely hard work. As long as I was doing the best that I could loading packages, I had no problems with the job."
good,Similar to Fed Ex in that it was very demanding and even more so a fast paced job. Although it was less based on working as a team with my coworkers and more of me focusing on getting my designated trucks filled with the correct packages.
good,Would buy another UPS store again! This organization is first class.
good,"My job was fast paced and spontaneous. Every night brought a new challenge and new objective. I enjoy being challenged and motivating my employees to push for the best possible results. Shifts would sometimes run longer than planned, this to me is gut check time. I have no problem working long hard hours on 5 minutes notice. The hardest part of the job was being able to stay awake from one job to next and balance school all in the process of receiving great grades and even better numbers at work. My co-workers were a great support system and competition. I enjoyed working for ups but I feel a change is needed."
good,Don't have anything negative to say about UPS. Typical work day is pretty easy management really laid back. Hardest part of the job is getting things done in a timely manner.
good,"Working at UPS is like getting paid to workout for four hours a day. It can be both physically and mentally challenging, but fun. There are many safety requirements you need to abide by because it can be easy to get an injury if you are not careful."
good,UPS call center in Visalia is an awesome place to work. I learned a lot of the skills I know now here
good,Great starting job for anyone. Easier to work with friends and family. Very fast pace environment. 
good,"I began working for this company about 9 years ago started out as a package handler  collaborating with a team of hardworking individuals. After 9 months I stated my interest in a managerial role and that I was currently attending College to improve my skills. Within a month of speaking out my intentions I was promoted to a front-line operations supervisor. The hours and responsibilities were intense, as an operations supervisor at UPS my duties centered on ensuring that there is cohesiveness within the UPS operation at a specific location.My responsibilities included making sure that the all departments are meeting quality standards, implementing programs that will improve worker confidence and ability and ensuring that safety regulations are followed. Operations supervisors can also assist in the hiring process by helping to select the best candidates. I would recommend this job to anyone starting out because it has taught me the value of hard work, teamwork and leadership."
good,"I go over the staffing and volume plans for the day. Decide staffing in order to accomplish and complete job as efficiently and safely as possible.  Delegate tasks among laborers.  Audit files and forms to verify that our operation is in compliance with OSHA, DOT, EPA, FAA, and corporate regulations.  Hardest part of the job is dealing with union employees.  Good part is the employee are good and are willing to do a little extra for me because I respect and appreciate them.  I have learned how to work in a fast paced aggressive work atmosphere with little tolerance for not reaching goals.  I have learned how to motivate employees, and be empathetic while still managing to complete task at hand,  How to organize, plan, staff, and think quick on my feet.  I learned how to talk and listen to a diversity of employees.  I learned how to become an effective leader and rarely do not reach, but exceed the corporate goals.  I hate to lose."
good,work very hard daily and we ship packages all over the world. managment were great.
good,"I learned in the 9 years that I've been employed at UPS that as long as the work gets done management won't bother its employees and, for the most part, we are treated like adults. Most supervisors and management go out of their way to make employees feel at home. My co-workers are a cast of characters from diverse backgrounds who all keep each other entertained while getting the job done efficiently. The hardest part of the job is waking up at 3:30am and some management harass their employees a bit too....all in all enjoyable place to work"
good,"ok workplace got to be motivated,fast; and be able to do more than one task at one time."
good,"Top pay within LTL industry and excellent benefits.  Terminal manager is fair to everyone and will back you up when problems arise.  Hardest part of the job is unloading over sized freight by yourself."
good,"It was such an enjoyable experience to be a part of the UPS company.  Enjoyed dealing with freight customers in assisting them with their cargo(s). Helping people with their concern(s) is something I liked doing."
good,first job that I really liked it was a good job I liked going there and the people was good to work with 
good,My job at UPS was very enjoyable because of my co-workers. They are great people that you can hold a conversation with while you're working. The hardest part of this job would be to handle the amout of volume we receive around Christmas time. 
good,"A typical day consists processing thousands of packages under a strict dead line. The goal being to safely and efficiently ensure all of the packages being processed make it to their intended destination. While working a UPS I learned to effectively multitask to accomplish many of my goals in a short time period while encouraging my employees to work safely and complete their tasks effectively as well. I learned to effectively communicate with my managers and fellow supervisors to ensure all work areas run efficiently. Everyday proves to be a challenging task, but once the sort is over the sense of accomplishment is very rewarding. "
good,"I am responsible for correcting the labels on packages being sent out of the building, labels containing; address, name, tracking information, and type of shipping. I have minimal supervision because my supervisors trust me and know i get work done and correctly. I learned to work at a fast pace and how to handle the heat. Working in a warehouse in summer time can be intolerable but ive learned to handle it and always try to make UPS customers happy by having their packages deliver to them on time."
good,"Need to be Head Strong, employess can be hard to handle at times. Fast pace enviornment. day goes by quick, always busy."
good,"Good place to work if you want to stay busy, mildly heavy lifting (50-80lbs).  The drivers are nice to work with and very sociable.  Hardest part of the job is keeping speed.  Most enjoyable part is the interaction with the drivers and customers."
good,"Working as a project manager in software design is most challenging and very satisfing in terms mental stimulation.   I have been able to sharpen my skills in building functional and business requirements, setting schedules and effective communication.  The culture here in the corporate office is great and inspirational.  The building has a cafe for breakfast and lunch, parking is always available and the building is maintained impeccability.  "
good,Get too my assigned unload area brief all of my employee on the work load for the day and the end of work clean up schedule and then head upstairs and complete all employee time cards. the hardest part of the job was the heat in the summer and the cold in the winter
good,Our sorting team would gather at just before the start of the sort for a brief preshift meeting. Also to information share and be briefed on that days customer needs requirements and any safety concerns. The supervisor would inform us of the days expected volumn and address any safety and cusomer needs as necessary. Sorting would promptly begin afterward. What I learned most was about the need for care in proper handling of and identifying any designated hazardous materials prior to placing in cargo aircraft following TSA federal guidlines. My management team coordinates with package handlers and our load planning department to assure prompt and safe transport of customer goods.My co-workers are a team. We help each other as needed to get the job done. Each knows their responsibilties with respect to safety and proper handling and securing of customer property for transport. We also show initiative to accomplish our tasks and take responsibilty for customer satisfaction. The hardest part would be the very high volumn. It can be physically challenging at times. But it can be after the end of the sort rewarding because after the shift is over you put in a good days work. You feel that you accomplished something.
good,lifting hundreds of boxes and stacking them into walls inside of UPS trailers. Management and co-workers are good as long as you know how to keep personal business away from the job. The hardest part of the job is keeping several trailers clean when there is heavy flow. The most enjoyable part of the job are when the days are light and there is not a lot of packages.
good,A typical day at work was always a learning experience. If you wanted to expand your knowledge for future career options the processing department was the place to be. Majority of the co-workers didn't mind giving you insight and information to help you grow not only as an employee but as a productive individual. It wasn't a huge crew which created somewhat of a family atmosphere which made work that much more easier and progressive. Management was real helpful and was there anytime you needed them. The hardest part of our job was actually cleaning out the warehouse when the building started losing accounts. It was as if you were saying goodbye to a family member. The most enjoyable part of the job was the information you gathered along the way and the many helpful and friendly people at work.
good,great fast paced job.
good,"Management taught me many things at UPS. Useful of some of supervision programs (ex. time cards, reports). I have learned the many programs there on the computer and many social skills due to running the Customer Counter when the main clerk is not available."
good,"Go in and unload trailer, very physical job, management could use some work, co-workers can be a very tough crowd sometimes but they are fun, unloading trailers and going out to be a driver helper is the hardest because of the long hours, seeing how the business is run."
good,"This is hard work, but it build character and some muscles also. Everyone who works for this company is constantly moving. There is no ""easy"" job @ UPS"
good,Like most places you have to work your way to the top and start off as a grunt. I did not go far only working one season but couldn't afford to only remain part time-seasonal for the time I worked there. I like being on my feet and the physical labor and would have loved to stick with it. Takes a while to get with the pace of things but can pick up on it.
good,"Sort packages, scan, label, load, unload, repack. I find the job enjoyable because you are always busy. The co-workers are fun and easy going."
good,Good place to work if you've the drive. Part time hours and flexable shifts make it perfect for those in college.
good,Everyone gets along swell. The teamwork between the hourly employees and management is amazing. The hardest part is the physical labor and all the lifting.
good,Part time
good,tasks included /sorting parcel / unloaded parcel/ monitor conveyor belt for jams through out the hub
good,labor work but easy to do
good,The culture and management made it easy to work here. Everyone was known by their first names. Overall a good working experience.
good,Come in Prepare myself for work. Get my supplies I would need for that night. Ask Co-workers to help me if needed to pick uop packages over 70lbs. The hardest part of the job was making sure you are putting label's on the right bags so they would not have a mis-tag.
good,good company to work for benefits second to none. It takes a while to advance from part time to full time driver took me 5 years but its worth the wait.
good,"The days vary between a fast and slow pace. Depending on the holidays. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people, mostly all of them are friendly, but they are hard working. The instructors are really nice. Make sure you can handle lifting up to 70 pounds repeatedly."
good,"Started as an unloader then was promoted to training supervisor, had to train new hires show them how to unload in a safely manner,how to use the belts, etc. Then was promoted as a Human Resources facilitator had to talk to the new hires in class explain all about UPS, policies, health insurance, other benefits."
good,"I loved working for the ""Brown"" becasue it introduced me to Global Commerce and allowed me to be a part of finely tuned machine that delivered 14 Million packages daily around the world."
good,"I start very early , before drivers come to work. Sometimes is hard to get up at 4 am but is nice to come back home when everybody has first break at their work. I learn that costumers needs are prioritet."
good,great place
good,Give station placements and daily assignments. Make and provide work schedule for my team. Inventory work & computer setup.
good,check the deliver list and then go get the furniture need for the deliveries and load the truck
good,UPS is a nice Job. Good benifits and free food. The coworkers are hard working and you have to be a team player to get the job done.
good,"I arrive to the building, great my employees with a smile as they prepare for work. Log on to my computer to check for messages, concerns and other administrative issues needs. Respond to any emails that needs attention. I then check on the progress of the drivers out on delivery routes, send them reminders and instructions as needed. Make outgoing calls and answer incoming calls to and from drivers and customers. Assist floor supervisors when needed. Complete all driver time cards for the day. Audit each driver's paperwork for mistakes and vehicle problems. Prepare financial records for next day delivery to corporate office. Submit financial report from the customer counter office to corporate for the day. Prepare files of reports and audits to turn in to several managers for the night and file a copy for my records. Carry out occasional disciplinary actions for employees that fail to meet company standards."
good,they keep you busy and makes your time fly by and it is a fun place to work
good,I like the physicalness of the job. I love loading package cars.
good,"Very fun, learned how hard it is to work for UPS. management and co-workers are very friendly. best part of the job is meeting new people."
good,"The must important experience i had at ups freight was the understanding of your position in the company and your responsibility to achieve the company goals I worked 14 hours a day 5 days a week for more than 6 months in order to reach our goals and most of the personal did the same, when you understand that the only way to reach your goals is working together and you do it, the success of any enterprise it's almost secure, you also need a management capable of guide the company."
good,I really enjoyed the job my typical work day would to have a team meeting about goals and what we were to do that day. My job was to audit packages and enter customer information and invoices with quickly with high accuracy.
good,"On a typical day I would assist the agents on the call center floor with questions and escalated calls. I also listened to recorded calls for quality assurance and scheduled feedback sessions to discuss that agent's progress. I learned a lot from this job like how to train and motivate people, a lot of administrative duties, and about freight shipping. The management was mostly great. They were pretty fair, direct, and professional. Management constantly challenged and groomed you for advancement. My co-workers were great. Everyone mostly got along. The hardest part was dealing with some of the escalated calls. The most enjoyable part of the job was that I felt important, like I made a difference in the company and with my associates. They made me feel like an asset!"
good,"UPS is rock solid, great pay, benefits, but you give up a lot. Not easy on the family, very tough and almost abusive bosses, they just don't treat each other nice. Tough management job, but good benefits. Best part of the job is the people like most places, I would take a group of UPSers anywhere and work the next group into the ground, ""Determind Men can accomplish anything"" (Jim Casey)."
good,"its a OK place to work. good benefits, you lift a lot every day."
good,enjoyed my time there but didn't get to fully explore what they had to offer. Had son while working there and had to quit because money wasn't enough to compensate travel time.
good,"I would start my shift with typing in my personal code and assigned area number in my scanner. I would put on my gloves and back support vest, tie up my hair, and go inside a trailer. There, I would pull out the belt where the packages will slide down to and begin scanning and creating a wall with the boxes (Like playing a game of Tetris). I learned how to safely lift packages and properly handle hazardous one, which had a different procedure. I learned codes to make sure the packages are on the right trailer to avoid delays in delivery. I remain friends with my former co-workers. They were very helpful and a pleasure to work with. My supervisor and managers were very friendly and praised how I performed at work. The hardest part would be my lowered energy level towards the end of my shift sometimes. It's a high paced, working environment. Much of the packages were over 50+ lbs. It's definitely a long workout, and I enjoyed it much of the time. I enjoyed working with others, conversing while still keeping up with the pace and quality that the job requires."
good,A Place where people have a sense of pride in working for a company where they treat their employees like family and always take care of the workers if a problem is presented.
good,Its a fast paced enviorment. A very rewarding job. I learned mangment skill also leadership skills neede to manage people.
good,"UPS provides great benefits, retirement, 401k match, and discounted stock. They also provide many additional perks like discounts on your monthly phone bill and tuition reinburstment for college."
good,"Load the truck, unload the truck, try not to hurt your back. Repeat if necessary."
good,"always enjoyed going to work.i learned there was alot of resposibility expected of me by the company to represent them.got along with managment team although it changed often.also got along very well with all of my co-workers.i really could'nt say anything was hard about the job, but I must say I really enjoyed making my customers happy."
good,Great teamwork atmosphere. You get a sense of accomplishment when you meet your time deadline goals. You trouble shoot multiple problems and learn how valuable it is to be proactive.
good,It was a pretty ordinary place to work. It demanded what it needed of me and I did the best I could and got paid for the work I did.
good,Each day involved delivering packages to both businesses and residential complexes.
good,"It is a sweat shop, but the benefits are great. Can move up the ladder with time although enough seniority is needed to be a driver."
good,"Worked my way up to a management position, by starting out as a preloader. I learned to lead a group of people and make them successful. Overall great place to work, gives a great sense of accomplishment and pride."
good,Great place to work but hard to advance from part time to full time
good,Great part time jobs especially for students. Good benefits
good,come in and get the sort ready for unload. Then load semi trailers.
good,"UPS is a great company to work for because it offers great benefits, career advancement opportunities and promote from within. The three available shifts are convenient which allow employees to attend school, which UPS has tuition reimbursement programs."
good,A typical day at UPS would be to unload or load at least 2 freight trucks. I learned how to stack packages in different types of freight trucks. The hardest part of this job was lifting tractor tires. What I enjoyed the most was the work was remotely easy!
good,"UPS is UPS very fast paced, hard, but in the end very rewarding"
good,Handle packages
good,This job was fun to try out. I drove a golf cart and delivered packages to homes for UPS during the christmas season. You have to be great with directions and following a map. VERY fast paced delievery needed.
good,UPS is a very comfortable palce to work. I have been there for 9 years and I enjoy it everyday. Management is very nice and my co-workers are some of the best ive been around.
good,Was a great time working there i didnt mind all the hard work in such a short period of time.
good,"During my time at The UPS Store I encountered a wide variety of customer personalities and unique challenges. My felllow employees are fun, intelligent and hard-working just like me. I enjoy the constant challenges working there brings and the fact that I am constantly learning."
good,"A physical, fast-paced position that involves continual lifting,"
good,my typical day at work is my managers greeting me with a smile or joke or just a friendly gesture. I learned that everyone is to be treated equal. My management is awsome they are always there to anwser questions and make it is for me to ask them. I enjoy my co-workers we all help each other out and respect one another.I have'nt have a hard part yet. My most enjoyable part of the job is when every one is getting along and we have a good productive day.
good,The UPS was a seasonal job opportunity where I was to deliver multiple packages to business companies and household families during the busy holiday season. This was a great opportunity where I enhanced my interpersonal skills and my networking connections. This job requires you to think quick on your feet while maintaining a safe and healthy work environment. Overall I had a great experience.
good,dropping of packages to different neighborhood
good,UPS is an enjoyable place for me to work. I enjoy the people and the tasks that I am responsible for. My typical work day consists of loading and unloading trucks. The hardest part of my job is the constant lifting of heavy packages. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people I work with. The management that I typically have to deal with are very good at what they do. They are on the ball and make quick decisions to ensure the place keeps running as smoothly as possible.
good,i have no complaints it was a nice fun and fast paced working environment and everybody was treated equally the job security was great and etc
good,Fast paced environment with good benefits. I learned how to work with many different types of people. Management is okay. My co-workers work as a team most of the time. The heat is the hardest part of the job. My employees are the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,It was a great experience to work for UPS doing something I'm great at; couriering. The HR dept was great to work with and the managers and drivers were great teachers and motivators in reference to anything work-related.
good,"Loved working there in Call center, great benefits, opps for advancement. Although, this call center closed and moved to Utah."
good,Loading and unloading assigned trailers.
good,"I can load anywhere from 1-7 trucks, occassionally help others out in different areas such as the primary where the trucks are unloaded in a timely manner. The work volume can be anywhere from 400,000-800,000, which typically means the lower the volume the slower the day. Our busiest time is the holiday season, of course where the volume is at it's peak. There's really nothing hard about the job, it's pretty self-explanitory. The most enjoyable part of the day, for me, is knowing that you're not the only person doing this ""hard work""."
good,get your equipment ready scan into your truck and start loading packages. learn how to write the paper work and what everything mean. had a great manager very cool and respectful. my co-workers was a lot of fun always made you feel welcome. the hardest part was the weather if you can't deal with heat or cold this job is not for you.

good,"great exerice,hard work.quick days at work make the week go by faster"
good,Been working for UPS for 4 hrs.. Love the fact I can do my job with less management... I can actually say I'm the best they have... Without me the job would not get down affectively or on time. Benefits are the best.
good,"They have great opportunity for advancement if you are hard working quick and efficient. At times can be very stressfull. Physically demanding, Fast work pace, rewarding if tasks are completed in timely manner and accurate. If work pace and performance aren't what expected nagative reporcussions."
good,This was a good job and i would work there again.Very easy work for anyone.
good,"I enjoyed my time working with UPS. Payed well. Did not encounter any problems whilst working. If I could, I would be willing to continue employment with them."
good,"Began as an seasonal hourly for the benefits, asked to stay on and was moved up to part time supervisor, alot of paperwork and ever changing expectations from upper management. Sick family member was very well taken care of because of the benefit package from ups... :)"
good,Great starting job with great benefits. Extreme weather conditions so be ready for that the avgerage an 10 min break but other wise great job
good,The company overall is nice in how things are done even though it can get a little chaotic sometimes. But the supervisors and manager make it an enjoyable place to work most nice.
good,"I really enjoyed working with this company. I had a small ownership percentage with this company, which gave me an invested interest. The thing I liked the most about the working here was the high level of communication we had to get the best out of the business."
good,"Good place to work, great benefits, the people i work with are very helpfull and over all good people. UPS is also very good with letting me off for Navy events."
good,I only worked here during the christmas season. it was very fast paced always something to do.
good,"I started out as a loader and eventually became a part-time supervisor. I ended up leaving UPS because it was a long process to get into a full-time position, despite having my Bachelor's degree."
good,This company taught me how to manage my time and how to bond with people as well as working in a group. Be a team player and never let your guard down.
good,It's a great place to work and they care about their workers. I have thoroughly enjoyed my managers and supervisors and enjoy working there on a daily basis
good,Excellent place to get a good workout while working at the same time. Great benefits after 9 months. And the pay is good but if not in peak season no overtime opportunities are available. Unfortunately due to seniority no promotion or full-time positions are available to me a this moment and there is a several year waiting list from what i was told.
good,I would love to work there again . Respectful people and enjoyable environment. Good pay weekly . The only thing that was wrong was the management didn’t make a schedule they call you in randomly .
good,I would recommend other people to do it as well because you do learn a lot that you never thought can help you benefit in life.  You meet new people new cultures and learn dad likes and dislikes.
good,"I started working there when I transferred to a new school, and it provided better pay and treatment than my previous retail job. I was able to continue my education and achieve my degree while working there, and have continued working there while job-hunting."
good,"Great company to be part of, part-timers have a strong union behind them, excellent benefits for you and your family. Great company to have a career in its a lot of inhouse training and hiring."
good,I enjoyed the company I worked with just wish management was better. Building was very old and made it hard to work in raining conditions. Besides that I overall had a good experience.
good,"Hard work, not for the week. Able to move up and it’s encouraged by management. Insurance benefits are excellent. Looking forward to moving up with the company"
good,Good benefits good competitive pay good hours good people to work with fast pace environment you can meet new people in your community.pearn how to become a perfessional
good,"Good company to work for with great benefifs over time. Steady work schedule."
good,Throughout the job I learned how to focus my mind under pressure. It's not a easy job but it's not as bad as it seems. Supervisors work with me and enable me to speak my mind.
good,When I first started I was a package handler for about 5-6 months before I got promoted due to my hard work and also look to advance in the job. Management gives you all the tool to help move up.
good,Great place and awesome benefits and insurance.  Opportunities for a stock and a pension.  Bid on jobs to better yourself and get raises every year.  Starting rate pay is 14 dollars and august 2020 jumps up to 14.65

good,The place make you work for your money. You will like it very much. Just stay focus on your work. Your task will bet to load the trucks. Free food !!VERY HEARD WORK .
good,"Throughout my time here at UPS, I have learned quite a lot about what it really means to work for such a company. I have learned of my benefits, how I can improve my performance, how to go about the other jobs around the warehouse, etc. This was all possible because of my supervisors and my ties with most of the people in the building. The main problems that one may encounter while working at UPS is time and work efficiency as sometimes it can get difficult when there is heavy loads. Other than that, my time at UPS has been an amazing experience and one that I am grateful for."
good,Days at work was alright cause it was well balanced with my life. I was not stressed out about anything and didn’t get into trouble at work cause everyone was super social.
good,this is a physically demanding job that you have to stay ready for. There is an intense push under a timeline to accomplish your tasks. High energy is necessary
good,If I am someone who has health issues the  United Parcel Service takes better than any other company I know of.  They offer a competitive salary with 401K and pension.
good,loved working here...want to keep it going....looking to continue my career path here...very supportive and assisting with my desire to work and continue my career path here
good,"Supervisor got favoritism with the old employees when you are new employee, nothing is good enough for them. Talk behind your back or send the old employees to rely a message because the don't want to be bother with you. I can go at the same speed like the old employees or better speed and the Supervisor say you have to go faster. I check the numbers and I got more than the old employee."
good,"If you've never worked in a warehouse type of job, this will teach you a lot about it. They will teach you safely and efficiently all the machinery to assist with unloading and loading packages."
good,Good company and great  Pay it's only a seasonal job so I don't no much of the company would love to be hired as a. Permanent worker so I've applied for store associate hoping and. Prying I can get into company on a PERMANENT BASIS
good,Great benefits for permanent employees and their family. Hours vary depending on your position and time of year. Option to move up when time is completed.
good,"If you are looking for a lifetime employment with good benefits, good pay and room to grow, this is the company for you because there is a lot of management opportunities, driving.  I am definately retiring here."
good,Alot of dust and heat good thing nobody breathes down your neck during work hours are decent but they expect you to make it to work rain sleet or snow  regardless of your situation some supervisors will even pick you up
good,"The work you do at UPS is very strenuous and will seem tough at first but you will become accustomed quickly. As long as you are capable of lifting around 70 pounds, you will fit right in. The training process was a bit unorganized, but the trainers will make sure you understand the essentials before your hands-on training. After that, the job is simply a matter of strength and routine. Your day-to-day activity is not likely to change and it simply requires your strength. The benefits provided after the pre-seniority period are phenomenal, covering dental and medical."
good,"I loved my first year working there until they started taking money from our checks. I felt like I gave my all to that job and I didn't get a promotion like some of my other fellow peers. I needed something better, plus I was only working part-time."
good,At UPS they have a lot of different routes you can take to get to where you want to be in life because they help pay for college as soon as you are hired. Making it easier to achieve your academic goals.
good,"You can starting a new career!!!"
good,"A great company to work in with rich culture and core values: integrity, respect, responsibility and partnership! This company is very good and best of the best I have ever worked for!"
good,I love the work that I do and enjoy working with my coworkers this job pays fair & I love the flexibility of the hours I work. I would recommend this job to family and friends
good,"The most important in this job is the health insurance, free and one of the best..the pay is good too, you get a race every year,( average 50 cents)."
good,Supervisors helped out when needed. Fast paced and fun to be at. Having a team to work with. Got encourage to do better and work harder. Helped drivers with making sure they could make their day easier.
good,"As a supervisor, the average work day is fairly easy. You’re there from approximately the same time everyday unless something unusual happens. Everyone on your shift usually knows each other and has a very comforting vibe. If anything it will be the people that keep you their, not the work."
good,It depends what hub you work at in which city. I've worked for two and I found Jacksonville is the best out of the two on safety and its employees well being
good,"If you your looking for a fast paced job and to move up quickly to being a supervisor you have to tough it out."
good,"Go to work and do your best and you can move up in the company. You can become a supervisor, manager, truck driver or division manager. Also you can become a engineer"
good,Very fast paced. When it’s hot outside it is a lot hotter in the work area and vice versa. There was no uniform only to wear steel toe boots so wear appropriate clothing for the weather.
good,"great place for anyone looking for advancement oportunities"
good,"Being a package handler was quite simple indeed, though you do have to be at work by 3 am. The work environment is clean and everyone's number 1 rule at all times is safety, that you'll learn either through visual experience or the supervisors you'll be working with and they'll say it from time to time to ensure it's set in stone, though it does help you learn to properly and carefully do a job."
good,Work is work.. they can take out the old rollers .  The scanners are always broken.  They need to hire somebody to break the jams instead of one person walking back-and-forth in the truck
good,UPS is a very tough job to do. The work that you put in is very equal to the amount of money that you get out from the job. Keeping up with your work flow is the main job requirement in this very fast paced environment.
good,Great company. Be willing to work hard at a fast pace all day. Work long hours. In all weather conditions snow heat rain. UPS is a union company with great benefits.
good,"Nette Mitarbeiter, sehr gute Vergütung, korrekte Geschäftlseitung"
good,As Package handler I would Scan every box that was ready for delivery. Stack them up in certain positions that we were taught. Any hazardous materials put to the side.
good,The job is very physically demanding but the benefits make it up.  not a hard job to learn but does require a great deal of verbal and computer training.  the environment is light industrial not an office environment even in management.
good,Started out on the bottom loading trucks . Worked my way up over the years. From sorter to a tender and finally to DA. DA was a QA/QC job where I worked with management and plant engineers to solve sorting and package damage issues.
good,A very fast-paced environment but the pay and benefits are well rewarding. You work with good people who will help as much as they can. Your getting paid to work out basically.
good,"UPS expects hard work, but if you give them that then they have a lot to offer in terms of career advancement. They start out at a good and competitive pay and there is a lot of opportunity for overtime and new positions. The staff is also very nice and willing to work with one another."
good,Very interesting job if you like to stay on the go always.  Have to stay on your toes and always be safety minded.  Very good pay and benefits for drivers
good,"A work day is definitely intense, but doable.  For the most part, everyone is very respectful.Work area is kept relatively clean for a warehouse. Management allows you to work independently."
good,UPS is a really good job in the long run but just starting in the ware house is stress for you work very hard for a very long time in the day it’s hot and stressful and we don’t get paid enough for what we do but overall people are good there and so is management but ups is whatever
good,"Very simple once you get in there, honestly easy money if you aren't lazy. Got the job pretty quickly and the airport location just requires a few extra steps, and wait time."
good,"Even though fast-paced, was easy with proper team work and dedication, friendly environment, and promotion-friendly. It was the best job I've ever had!"
good,Great place to work room for advancement helpful management job training provided many jobs available learn to work all jobs great energy in work environment
good,"Difficult in the beginning because of all the boxes you lift for 8+ hours. You get used to it after a couple of weeks. Other than that, fun and easy job. Coworkers were like family and would help eachother out whenever we needed it. Lots of opportunities to get promoted into management or to become a driver."
good,"Working UPS Little rock Hub is a simple but not an easy job, consistency, hard work and willingness to improve makes the job much appealing. Definitely takes some getting use to, mentally and physically."
good,People are very friendly. It’s a fast paced job and it’s stressful . The only thing that I didn’t like is that I didn’t really get training . I was supposed to have a trainer with me but I didn’t
good,"All hands on deck situations, learned about my industrial engineering field, friendly managers, some job titles will have difficult hours, there is always work to be done"
good,I had fun while working there and the thing that shines through the most was the people working there the hours seem that much shorter because of the friendly and helpful people who work there
good,"It is a good place to start as an intern. One gets to learn a lot and put everything you have learned from school into practice, You get an assignment and as long as you get the job done one can use any programming language."
good,"When UPS hired me as a Package Handler I wasn't planning on staying with this company no more than 6 weeks. Two weeks"
good,For this job it was important to have a good work ethic. You constantly moved throughout the entire shift and would use all of your energy. You would be tasked with moving boxes into trailers that weighed anywhere from 30-200+ lbs. At the end of the shift it felt as if you just finished running a 5k.
good,"MUST HAVE WORK BOOTS "
good,"I loved working there, but there just wasn't enough hours to maintain all the things I needed to raise my family. I did learn a lot about planes, the equipment and how the airport functioned. In all a steady job."
good,"Management can be a bug sometimes. The work is easy, money is good and the benefits are amazing. They also offer extra work during the winter time, which is great for us who want to get our loved ones and ourselves something extra."
good,It was a bit rough starting out but eventually I learned the ins and outs of this overall simple job. The toughest part was figuring out the best way to get there when I lacked a car at the time. Once I figured that out I quickly learned how to perform my duties and do it well. My work ethic was finally brought to bear when I took on this job. I learned how to work hard and to keep up a steady pace of boxes flowing out of whichever truck I was in. The management while initially tough became bearable and even enjoyable at times. My coworkers were very likable people and my supervisor wanted to the see the best out of all of us in a section. I enjoyed eventually being able to go very quickly without the help of my coworkers. Overall though tough at first I enjoyed my time working there.
good,For all of those who are looking for jobs to make careers UPS is the one page to do so but for the others who just wanna make a quick buck UPS  is also the place
good,The job is very fast-paced very hard very physical at the other jobs I’ve had it’s like getting paid to work out but you really work at UPS but the benefits are great
good,"UPS is a good place to work, Upper management can make work-life a little more stressful than it needs to be, but that's their job. The hours were hard, being a full time student and then immediately going to work and getting home at 11pm made social life an abstract thing for a while, but the tuition reimbursement is great."
good,"Hard work, tough hours. Learned how to scan packages and organize them properly in a UPS delivery truck. Constantly supervised.Cheap snack machines. Hardest part is making sure you take off all your packages off the conveyor belt while maintaining up to 5 trucks."
good,Management is a bit lacking on the department. Overall the company is excellent. Management does not assist you on your work place. Communication between management and employees are lacking.
good,"It’s a great place to work at. The hours are what kinda kills it but for the benefits we receive to be honest it’s worth it. About management  and supervisors, it just depends where you work at or who you get. Most of my supervisors are very nice and understanding . Not rude or very arrogant... which happens a lot in a lot  of other places. And like one of the people on the reviews mentioned if you work hard you can and will move up and up .you’ll be able to grow in that company . If you’re mentally  and emotionally weak you’ll never go anywhere and you’ll stay right where you started. I have 1year and 5 months with UPS and to be honest I love working there. I got to help by doing driver helper, was the best experience ever. Waiting to become a driver is worth it... you just need to have self motivation and not be negative. The pay for it is totally worth it!"
good,"The job is exactly what anyone would think it is.  Physical labor for a few hours a night.  If you are going to college, it is great.  Otherwise, there are better jobs."
good,"I have the autonomy to run my sales territory as I see fit, with oversight by my Area Sales Manager.  Having been in Sales at UPS for 20 years, I was given more leeway than most."
good,I really enjoy working at UPS but I’m looking for something more first shift or something that I don’t have to work till 10 at night. Benefits are great also.
good,Its a fast-moving environment. Get to know the veteran workers rather than on an excel spreadsheet in order to better perform the job function. It is ok to ask for help.
good,Fast paced and very hot. Work day typically 4-6 hours long if part time. Pay weekly. But pay is great during peak season and very easy to move up in management.
good,"I enjoyed ups, sometimes i felt the pay didnt match the work but i appreciated my weekly wages. Management was usually on point so i never felt i had anything to complain about."
good,"It’s fast paced but the coworkers help time fly by. After one year of employment, you can get paid time off and optional days. It’s hard to become a full time employee, unless you become a driver."
good,"It was loading and unloading airplanes, trucks, and trailers. I loved the people and the job. Top 5 job of my life. great for a part time job. With decent opportunity to advance."
good,"Bonne ambiance, travail intéressant."
good,"Very fast paced and continuous lifting and lowering 5 days a week. Strong Union, Fairly dusty environment, Supervisor and full time mangers rotate every year."
good,"A typical day involves around 1,000 packages to load between my set of 4 trucks. They can range from 1 pound to around 130 pounds as well as a variation in sizes. I have learned a good order and organization of packages within the trucks. The hardest part of the job would be keeping your drop clear as the most enjoyable part in my own personal opinion would be relaxing on break."
good,I find that UPS is an excellent company that offers many opportunities for growth and leadership.  The more you put into your own career goals and aspirations the farther you will excel.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the day was making the best of fun each day at work with my fellow co-workers and competing with them just for fun in a very fast-paced, friendly, and positive environment, while we unloaded the trailers in the early mornings, sorted, labeled, scanned packages into the computer system, and loaded them onto the UPS delivery trucks as fast, efficient, and as accurately as we could."
good,"As a seasonal driver helper, UPS doesn't care about you. You'll be working quickly once you get your packages. MAKE SURE you have comfortable shoes, as they are a MUST for the amount of running you'll be doing!!!"
good,"Typically worked on a certain belt but would often help in other belts/areas which was a nice change."
good,I enjoy my work at Ups it's a fun hard working job. My employment is rewarding.The company offers great benefits. If you're a hard worker this would be a great job for you.
good,Great place for part time employment and amazing benefits . I very much recommend ups especially for students and new comers to Canada. love the people and the work
good,"I’m currently working here part-time. It’s a great company to work for; employees receive full benefits at part-time and it is unionized. I hear the supervisors do not get treated that great though, so I wouldn’t want to move up to that position. It’s a great place to work at if you need benefits, but still need a schedule that allows for family or going to college. It is only 4-5 hours a day though."
good,"In additional to ensuring that packages can flow without any problems or delays from one point in the building to another,  A typical day at UPS might involve putting out fires or solving general facility problems as soon as you arrive.  The hardest part at times can be keeping everyone satisfied or at least feeling that their fulfilling their need is the most important priority of your day."
good,"Both hub and air ramp jobs are hard work. You just sweat a lot in the hub, loading and unloading packages, and you get rained on at the air side, being by the airplane."
good,"Productive work environment. Great benefits. Gainful employment. Easy after the first two weeks. The first two weeks, however, are brutal. great management."
good,"Good company to work for. I made a good living for 30+ years. good benefits, stock options for management, 401K matching and very competitive salary.."
good,"moving boxes around can be very physically demanding. this job can be stressful, especially if you are in management. good opportunities for advancement."
good,Typical day during a day UPS was showing up between 7 and 8 am and loading packages into containers then pushing the containers off to the side to be loaded into a plane until 4 to 6 pm.
good,I enjoy my time at ups. It provided me with the environment and tools needed to better myself and train and mentor others to further our careers inside the organization
good,I met a lot of people. All different walks of life come together for a common purpose. To get the packages moving! I would recommend to anyone athletic
good,"I enjoyed working for them for the time period, they work with you when you need help, they work on getting you the hours that you need & always let me get the extra time."
good,Great job to move up in. Lots of positions available and locations around the world. Great benefits and 401k savings options. Paid vacations and also sucks days
good,Fun to work there hours were a killer but got used to it overtime. People are kind and welcoming and just and enjoyable place to work at for a time. Great place to work tho.
good,"*A typical day at work is 4 to 5 hours "
good,It is a demanding environment in that they have high expectations on the quality of their service.  The best managed company I have worked for and it shows.
good,"This job is really well worked. you bust your behind off as you get worked out on the boxes, putting them into the trailers and you got to go fast. not overly fast pace of your level but the level of fast you can go. this work is a workout that dropped out of my gym membership. Overall, everyone is nice. a fast pace job."
good,The best thing about UPS is that it will provide to you what you put in to it. It is one of the few places left that gives you the opportunity to turn a job into a career.
good,I loved working here. left because I'm a women and men can be sexist. management is relaxed but gets the job done..........................................
good,I really enjoyed Working for ups even though it was only for seasonal I would love to work their permanently as a driver and I appreciate them giving me the job and being good workers.
good,"Very challenging job, takes the energy right out of you, very rigorous, cold, and sweaty, but if working with a loved one the time flies. A LOT of fast paced moving, walking, running, climbing, etc, and the stress and strain will manifest as pain in the knees, thighs, lower back, and feet."
good,Safe an fun work environment. Easy to get trained and moved to a better fitting area. Provided schooling opportunities for employees that attended college after high school.
good,"I worked for loss prevention, I loved my time there, even though brief. the staff is friendly, encouraging and supportive. Very understating within reason. Fast passed and at times hectic, but they wont give you more than you can handle."
good,"The people I worked with at UPS were more than coworkers, they were family.  I learned a great deal while there and I still use a lot of my training, knowledge and Mgt style to this day."
good,Ive learned a lot from working at ups it's hard most of the time but i like a challenge plus at the end of the day if you can hang in there your family will be well taken care of. It's worth it
good,"If you're looking for a hardworking job with decent pay for Virginia, this is a good place to go. After working with them for either 9 months or 1 year, your benefits kick in and every year you get an extra vacation day. A good job only if you like hard working long standing and moving."
good,i enjoyed my time at UPS my team was awesome and we worked well together. the bonds and the support that is given is great. they would have competitions and the winners got pizza.
good,I worked on a hub expansion project. All of my colleagues in my immediate team are excellent workers and I learn from them every day. The project is great professional experience. I get to work with different contractors and equipment all the time. There are constantly new problems that we get to solve in order to make the our project more successful.
good,"Review the load of my vehicle and inspection of vehicle"
good,"This was a great place to work part time, hours were steady. Was easy to be promoted if you put in the effort and showed consistency in your numbers when loading packages."
good,"If you do not have a strong work ethic for manual labor UPS is not the place for you. Heavy lifting, awkward positions, aggravated managers, extremely fast pace and you have to keep up with the minimum. At Ups it’s all about production and output. Break time consists of 10 minutes so that means run from your area fight for the next accessible toilet hopefully make it to the roach coach to down something on your way back to your area before the buzzer goes off. If it’s hot out it’s 100* minimum in the building, if it’s cold you better dress warm but still be functional. "
good,"Need to be able to lift more than 70 lbs"
good,"At UPS, you were always busy. Staff was very driven to get the job done. People who worked there were very friendly and was always together. While times the job was difficult, it was very easy to get in a good work flow there."
good,"great company. its my dream job. but i never get any hours for the seasonal drivers helper position. I don't know why they hire us, but its a fun job I love it. we meet new drivers every other day but mostly have the same driver. the drivers have the power to give you hours but most wont unless your cool with them. The reason I say that is because if the driver allows you to stay until final deliver is made then it cuts the drivers hours short because we finish the route faster than he would normally finish alone. laid back job however and legit company who give people opportunity."
good,"I only was there for seasonal and rode around with two drivers, but my time there was enjoyable. We played music in the cab, had our homemade lunches, and had brilliant talks with each driver and additional drivers. That we would help after we were done with our cargo."
good,Manage employees on the sort to make sure that things are running smoothly and that all packages being sent out are sent out and not left in building.
good,"management was pretty cool and they were very helpful, the atmosphere was nice being outside rather than staying in one location like some jobs. ups can be an career."
good,"Family like atmosphere everyone is motivated to be successful and work together to come out winners, always remember no one person is bigger than the team"
good,It’s a very stressful place if you don’t do your work. You get to meet a lot of people and you can build friendly relationships. You get real nice Benefits
good,"Working from the start off the day until you were off, but not overworked. I learned a lot about the company and how to deal with stressed / angry customers. Management was understanding and kind. Workplace culture was very group based and you could make friends quickly. Hardest part of the job was learning how to do the work haha. Most enjoyable part was the phone calls :)"
good,"Mi è piaciuta questa esperienza in questa impresa,perché lavoravo con brave persone sia italiani o sia latini."
good,Ups is a very helpful loving and hardworking environment everyone works at a good work pace they keep the flow going throughout the whole building and everyone is equal
good,The hours are not too long but I usually end up working 25+ hours per week. Management is great and co-workers are enjoyable. The job is physical and fast-paced but fun!
good,"The work is really hard physically but if you can handle it then it's a really good place to work at with really great benefits and the pay is really good, but it's only part-time to begin with."
good,I would recommend ups to anyone trying to obtain employment. I always enjoyed going to work because I knew that I would be learning something new everyday while getting compensated for my efforts.
good,"As with all companies UPS has its ups and downs but overall its a good company with good pay.  For those that took time to plan and work, its was a good company"
good,Working at UPS was very fast-paced but I learned quick. A lot of that other employees were helpful especially when it came to heavy packages. also seen my manager get down on her hands and knees and help which was a plus.
good,"If you are a lazy person you will not do well at this job. They will work you very hard but they do make you feel valued. Free healthcare after nine months and they will pay over $5,000 a year on your tuition! If you put in your time in as a package handler you can become a driver and make a nice career for yourself. Overall I would recommend it if you have a good work ethic."
good,"Working for a supply chain, an offshoot of the hub that is UPS, I learned a complete area of production that most people don't even see. Forklift certification, advancement, and performance based pay are some of the perks that would bring me back to UPS in the future."
good,"My time spent at UPS was considered time well spent. The benefits package offered by this company was probably the best I've received from any company. I paid for school and still got to go to school, which in my opinion was very helpful for a struggling student."
good,It's usually a very simple day. The management was roughly fair and would understand most circumstances for any individual. The culture is competitive but everyone usually gets along.
good,Came in and had a meeting before shift. Went to my assigned trucks and loaded trucks according to addresses on packages. Became a supervisor and overlooked the productivity of my Belt.
good,"Fair and  safety is always first equal treatment of employees,  very strenuous work  but priority, low pay for such hard work but makes up for that with other benefits like tuition fees,  401k, life, health and dental insurance."
good,"Typical work day is fast pace.   Loading and unloading trucks and planes, getting them out in a timely fashion."
good,high pace work place.  plenty of chance to move up within the company.  physical job that keeps you in shape.  good amount of time off to recharge your batteries
good,Part time is okay but the full time guys/girls make a lot more. The union is the best. Job security is high. They can’t really fire you. However part time hours are low so you could juggle to jobs and work there until you hit full time. Benefits even for part time are the best you will find other then military.
good,Work is pretty much the same on a daily basis.  When you come in to work there is a new problem to solve or some issue to handle.  Nothing is ever too serious unless there is weather conditions to plan for.
good,great place to gain experience in the work field however not a very great job if your over 30 and trying to support a family as full time isnt offered until youve reached 10 years more as it is a union job and there is a waiting list
good,UPS was a great company to work for but the position I held was seasonal/temporary. While I was there they allowed me to work all the hours I wanted (regularly scheduled plus overtime) and I was never penalized if I needed to take a break. I worked during the holiday season so this might explain the reason for all the overtime but I enjoyed it. My only wish was that they had called me back for a full time position.
good,UPS management is high paid job however it’s not very good for families as you have odd shifts to work. You’re pulled away from your family a lot. I would not recommend for families with young children depending on which shift you work.
good,"On a regular day at UPS its a start up which is normally at 3:00am but some people come in late so we could start up between 3:15 to 3:30. "
good,"UPS offers advancements and training to grow within the company. Once you are employeed with UPS, there's no limit to the differnt promotions that they may offer."
good,"-very loud and busy"
good,"A job that is not that stressful, so many benefits that can help the employees out, very fast paced job, which keeps you very busy, making time go by faster"
good,a typical day well technically night so a typical night at work would be going through a guard shack making sure you dont have anything prohibited in the warehouse and once your in you work hard and fast for at least 3 1/2 hours a night
good,"I loved it. Always great to get to work, went by fast, great work-out, friendly and great team-playing co-workers. The benefits are amazing, and the pay is good."
good,Great company to work for. A lot of opportunity for advancement. You will work very hard in extreme heat and cold temperatures. Plenty of hours in the holiday  season
good,"Great work environment, just under paid. Very competitive work environment, not enough hours given out. Management was also an issue and how they ran things and made decisions."
good,Only reason im not still working here is because its hard to get in there full-time. I needed to be working full time. Did definately enjoy my time here.
good,"Great to work for especially as a temporary worker to make some extra cash during the holiday season. If you are willing to work six days a week during that 4-6 week time period and are working 30-40 hrs. a week you can make up to about $2,000+ in extra cash."
good,"Ups understands their workers because most of the management and super visors started in the package handler position, Ups reconizes hard working workers and positive attitude employers"
good,Well in the little time i did have with ups it was very good . The pay was good and it was a great start for as UPS being my first job. I learned different skills and a lot of safety rules that i can use in my future .
good,"a typical day at work is just sorting out mail wither it be heavy or light it depends on you body build, i learned how to sort mail its not really much of a learning curve its a really easy job. management is really cool and chill. The hardest part of the job was lifting the heavy boxes on your own."
good,this is the best place i have ever worked at. the only bad thing is its very very hard to get hired on. you always start off as a temp. so dont count on getting in perm first time
good,"Not really much to it just keep a clear head and a consistent speed of unloading and you'll be fine. Drink plenty of water and make sure to eat before you come"
good,"I had fun. My boss was a wonderful person who held many long-standing corporate accounts and repeat customers. "
good,This is a good company that pretty alright to work all the ppl they treat you like family wen stard working there.  The people that helo u out wen u need help
good,"UPS has high expectations of their employees from the drivers to upper management they expect everyone to achieve results.  They want their people to give excellent service to both external and internal customers.  They are working on work life balance, but the younger management people are more inclined to stress this trend.    Two of the things I love most about working at UPS is that I am given a large amount of autonomy to achieve my goals, and the people I work with are unique and inspiring."
good,"Typical day starts off with a meeting going over the day prior then after set up the pick lineup,and then go through trucks and check for miss loads and load quality, and then make sure that everything will fit and if not find a new truck to put the packages in,"
good,"On and Off situations"
good,UPS is a great place to work that offers great benefits for its employees. Family oriented environment full of advancement opportunities. UPS prides itself in taking care of their employees.
good,"Great people within, stress free work place, just wish it was more full time options when I was working for them, Great benefits at no cost to you, Great opportunities"
good,"The work there is physically demanding, but the benefits are well worth the time and energy spent. We get all major holidays off from work, paid, given you have been there for over a year."
good,"Great place to work, rough on your mind and body. But worth it in the long run. The benefits at UPS are AMAZING, totally worth working there just for that alone."
good,I love work at ups.good place work u will enjoy work with ur coworkers. It show people skills  an hour are good because able take home business.  I'm grateful to work there.
good,It is a good place to work for the benefits.  I enjoy my job thoroughly.  Management on the day side needs some weeding out. Too much fraternization..
good,"Hard work at first ability to get better jobs. Able to get promotions. Paid sick days, vacation days, personal days. Laid back  atmosphere. Good for extra money."
good,"Everyone hears the horror stories. And of course there will always be bad parts of a job. But no other job can beat paying for school or the insurance that is offered. I am a supervisor in the freight facility and the environment is amazing. I walk in every night ready to do my job. My management team is supportive and honest. My partners are extremely helpful and respectable. And the job is cake compared to other areas of UPS. I know the harsh experiences of working in the hub. It can be laborious and tiring. But, the starting wages are going up in august of 2018, and with that you wont be able to beat the benefits and pay."
good,"When at UPS you have to use your time efficiently due to the timing process. Working at UPS i learned that communication,timing,and teamwork is the key.The managers were very genuine and respectful to all workers. In Ups the the culture was very diverse to where everyone in the workplace had a connection to where we all worked as one.The hardest part about working at Ups is the hours and learning how to adjust and maneuver in the environment. The most enjoyable part of the job is the communication and friendship i had with the coworkers and management."
good,"It was good job for college grads or high grads. For me  It helped out, benefits, pay was ok, overall I would give it a C +. Not something i would return to ."
good,Overall UPS Is Not A Bad Company At All As Long As You Like To Work The Co-Workers And The Managers Treat You Good. It Is What You Make It  At The End Of The Day.
good,"I enjoyed.  It is work."
good,High-paced and physically taxing. Early morning hours that can be tough. The pay and benefits are good but the job takes a lot out of you and the environment can be harsh-cold in winter and hot in summer.
good,"Demanding.  Well structured.  Fast paced.  If you can handle stressful times, you can get a great experience here, long hours, and a great opportunity to build an awesome team , you can have an awesome career here.  They take care of their people ."
good,"The culture at UPS was amazing.  A relaxed dress environment, most employees were wonderful, management was amazing, my issue was with the customers.  Many were unreasonable and combative.  I could handle it and was quite good but it took a toll on me and my health."
good,Very fast pace setting but on hand training helps a lot and is a very easy job to do. Pay is great and is great with transportation. Nice job to work at.
good,ups is a decent place to work if you looking for a part time job that's close to your home cause they don't pay enough and they let you know that when they hire you
good,"After a year of service at UPS...you will gain the perk of having a great medical, dental, vision, pension, 401k plan and a set schedule. UPS provides the best part-time position."
good,"A typical work day, i would moving packages from a slide to color coordinated shelves. The hardest part of the job would simply be the heavy lifting. The most enjoyable part was that the pace of the job was relaxed."
good,The company specifies in customer service when delivering the packages. Management is great and very understanding. Many of the co-workers range from college students to Seasoned workers around the age of  50+
good,"Working at UPS is slow pace when you first start of your shift but as the day goes on then the trailor will get full with packages and the pace would have to increase, also depending what trailor you get assigned to. Lifting and stacking packages on one of another making good, tall, and tight walls."
good,"Nice company, good benefits, always understand workers, close to work. I would recommend this company to anybody, including my friends and family members"
good,"Worked at the UPS warehouse in Bowling Green which was a small, relatively unimpressive looking building. However, each day was a new and challenging experience trying to successfully load our packages on time. My muscles hurt and I sweat a bunch, but I enjoy it."
good,"With dedication , dependability and willingness to be teachable...any opportunity is available to you. Stay as hourly employee, receiving excellent raises and benefits as part time or full time employee. Want management opportunity? There has never been more opportunity to advance as there is now!"
good,"Nice place to work at have to work as a group to get the work done faster have to work fast cannot be slow "
good,"I was doing this as a second job for extra christmas money, and love it.  The company really takes care of thier workers and there workers love what they do."
good,"As a driver helper you don't work too hard for the pay, you just have to be willing to get the job done. "
good,"The environment can be stressful, but if your a hard worker its a great environment.  All of my co-workers are friendly, the hardest thing is the physical nature of the job, and the most enjoyable thing is being outside on beautiful days."
good,"Worked here in 2015 as a high school senior and needed an entry level job and heard good things about UPS. I applied as a Driver helper and got the position. There isn't a lot of effort required in order two obtain the job other than just applying and showing up to the interview if they email you back. A typical day for me was driving around the roseville area and delivering packages to homes, businesses and apartment complexes. Your enjoyment in this position os pretty heavily dependent on which driver you are paired with for the season. Thankfully I was paired with a really nice and down too earth driver who shared similar interests and was understanding of my severe social anxiety. Don't really have anything to complain about other than the minimum wage pay but that is to be expected for this position"
good,"United Parcel Service takes care of all their employees. The benefits are incredible, and they even offer tuition reimbursement.

good,My typical workday as a UPS driver helper consisted a lot of lifting and walking.I learned how to lift and unload a truck properly without harming myself or others.The hardest part of the job was having to find houses at night when you had no flashlights. Other than that I really enjoyed the respect I received and the free food on Fridays.
good,"As a Package Handler, you will be in a stressful, fast paced, but friendly environment. As many other package handlers know, this is also a good workout and you will lose weight!"

good,"I enjoyed working here due to getting a five day a week workout.The only down side is working only 22-25 hours a week, it was not enough to live on. The hourly wage was good but not working part time. I would recommend this company to anyone who wants school paid for."

good,"If you are looking for a job that pays you to work out and lift weights then package handling at ups is what you want. For hours you will be standing constantly moving and pushing, lifting, or sliding packages that could weigh up to 100 lbs. at times there may be an extreme amount of packages to load onto a truck. Such an amount that at one point I had to swim over boxes to get out of the truck and try to organize everything very quickly with a co worker. After every shift I was sore and tired but after a couple days or week I started getting used to it and working more efficiently."

Its so busy in the ware house that you wont have much time to talk but there will be a lot of small talk. The hardest part of the job is loading but you catch on after 2-3 weeks. i really enjoy the work though.

good,"It is a fast-paced job that requires attention to detail. It can be stressful but with time and experience it has become easier to deal. I like the people I work with. For the most part  management is good but could be better organized. The hardest part of the job is loading extremely large or heavy packages but everyone is always willing to help anyone who needs help. The most enjoyable part of the job is the team effort everyone shows. After one year of employment, you receive full benefits."
good,really good pay for part time. Would love to be able to work 40 hours a week.  But guarantee 27.5 hours for salary based workers as long as you work five days a week

good,"If you want to stick around longer than Christmas as a helper you'll need to give some effort. Don't just walk, many drivers want you to hustle. Legs were often sore, but this kept me in good shape. Pay is fair, no paid breaks though and I only took one break throughout the season. Some days short some very long. My driver was great and we got along well. Overall, it's a great short term gig."

good,working for ups a typical day at work was getting my scanner ready and loading the trucks. on average a worker would load about 1500 to 1700 packages a night. boxes and packages all weights and sizes. I was at about 1700-1900 on average nights. 2000+ on a good night when loading.
good,"Its depends on what your doing/job title is. Overall its okay, there are some perks. It is what you make it, there is room for improvement and growth."

It was great to be a part of a company that has winning as its goal and customer focus as its mantra."

There were people from different ethnicity and everyone got along well...the hardest part of the job was to get someone to pick up item and the most enjoyable is when that product is delivered on time.
good,It's a alright place to work for a second job because of the lack of pay and because most people there or not full time it's hard to work in the warehouse and make a living of of it but you can move up would just have to be  patient.

Although I was constantly getting on and off of the UPS truck, my driver made the experience better because he made our objective clear and did his job well.

good,I worked for a short time yet my fellow employees were great and made the day fly by. I ended up quiting due to the shift manager constantly yelling at everyone. However shortly after i received a phone call saying he was no longer employed there and asking if i would come back so they management was poor when i was there as soon as they became aware they approached the issue. Other than the shift manager this was a wonderful place to work

good,"A usual day involves taking calls, creating cases, resetting passwords, and assisting onsite techs. I learned to quickly move from one program to another, multitasking, and better communication skills. Management was always around to help and offers of overtime were frequent. The workplace culture varied from experienced to those that were new in the tech industry. The hardest part of the job would have to be the rapid way in which calls were received with little to no time to prepare in between. The most enjoyable part of the job to me would have to be the hours offered that allowed me to take overtime often."
good,"I was a Seasonal Driver Helper during the Christmas season. It was a week of nearly 12 hour days. You could see it in some of the other guys' faces, they were tired and just wanted to go home, but they would still joke around to keep the spirits up. I learned a lot from the veteran guys during my week there. I won't look at any postal or delivery jobs the same way again."

good,Ups is for young guys or gals fresh out of high school willing to commit to a company for more than 5 years in order to see some progress. Ups is nkt for guys in theirs mid 30 looking for good money. In the long run waiting at ups will pay off. However with certain circumstances in my life I needed a job that was full time in order to support my family. The benefits are great the people are great I honestly would have stayed if not for certain events.  If you can work here you can work at any warehouse. The work load does not compare to what ups workers go through.
good,UPS is a really good job with a great union. It is in fact a hard working job as well. But with the benefits and the career paths it takes you into makes it very worth while.
good,Very good part time job. Labor intense work but easy. Not a female job but a good job for any young man who is working his way through college looking for a little extra money with good health benefits.

good,Great team atmosphere. Made good money and hard working job. I was only a driver helper but really could get used to working for UPS. They do a lot for their employees.
good,"trabaja sobre tiempo "
good,"I worked seasonally at UPS. Although coworkers were aware of the fact that I was there temporarily, they all treated me as though I were a valuable member of the team, and made me feel comfortable. The hours were tough, and the work is VERY fast paced and physically demanding, but it is rewarding, the benefits and compensation is the best in the business, and the union is strong and supportive."
good,It's really fun working there you see places . You just have to work at a fast pace. And able to lift 70 lbs or more. Just apply as a driver helper or a sorter
good,a typical work day for me starts at 3am and ends at or around 8am the job itself is hard work and fast paced you have to pay attention and work in a safe and timely manner. in this job you will learn to work as a team to get packages out on time to the customers. the best part of the job is the benefits and pay the longer you stay the better it is. UPS is one of the only jobs i liked doing because of the people i worked with and the time i had to work there. of course its only part time unless your a driver so dont expect any amazing checks. the hardest part of the job is learning to toughen the body and mind its hard to work here but if your willing to go above and beyond you should check it out.
good,"Ups is a company that has many opporunities to advance."
good,"It is the same exact thing every shift, nothing changes. If you are a quiet person this is a good job because you can keep to yourself and just work. The hardest part about the job is potentially lifting heavy boxes."
good,It was a good job to learn about the shipping industry and how it interacted with other business. United Parcel Service was a good job while it lasted as a seasonal and I would do it again if I had the chance.
good,Great company with many positions for advancement. Good co workers an great with benefits. Able to earn extra cash being a driver helper. Hours gives time for another job
good,"Working on and off with UPS over a 12 year period, never burning my bridges with them, I was able to join their team again recently in 2016. I started from the bottom and with hard work and mental placement as where i saw myself furthering in management. 4 months i was able to accomplish that goal. UPS has great opportunities for life changing long term goals. It help me gain knowledge and motivating skills to push others and myself pass their own expectations. You work hard and stay focused and you can work there the rest of your life being safe and getting paid every week."
good,fast past work time flies management it good its a phyisical job and can get very hot in the feeders but the people are friendly and the safe and well being of there employees are great
good,A great place to work. Provides full time benefits. Most employees are surrounding university students.. A short break and the most difficult thing to grow accustomed to is third shift.
good,this job didn't really help me get to be more sufficient with working there. I need help but had to adapt on my own and figure out how its done by myself .
good,Working at UPS has been a great experience for my future development. Working with different types of people has helped me grow mentally and achieve success doing various ever changing tasks.
good,"I like to work most of the time, I think they keep you in one place for to long. and the culture is young people only there for money, so they are careless."
good,"fast paced hardwork with high expectations. great pay. amazing benefits. great people. lots of work. nonstop working. ONE 10 minute break, move fast. pick your job carefully."
good,Benefits are excellent but overall management is poor. In the end though the benefits outweigh the cons. Still it is excruciating to deal with bad management.
good,"This is a great company to work for.  Great benefits, hard wok and a sense of belonging.  Everyone here treats you like you are part of the family."
good,"Great benefits, job security and advancements make the stressfulness and physical demands worth it. You come in and work as a team to get the job done"
good,my opinion on the work day is that the work is consistent. also slightly repetitive. I've learned a great deal on simple rules to increase safety. although I didn't come in contact with management personally they definitely know how to run the business and how to deal with productivity. coworkers like always vary on personality. I can say the ones that I came in contact with took there jobs seriously and were well experienced in there position. the hardest part about this job is the constant walking. I wouldn't suggest walking or repetitively lifting packages to someone above the age of 55 or to those with back related issues. The most enjoyable part of this job was the consistency. knowing what is expected of you every day and not getting big curve balls thrown your way.
good,"Great Health care and benefits plan. Unfortunately, it is a Union work area, so all promotions are handed out on a seniority basis, not necessarily a competence for the job, basis."
good,"As a Driver Helper, I delivered and picked up packages to and from both customers and businesses.  I also maintained relationships with customers and businesses."
good,UPS is like any other job where you deal with situation on a day to day base. I do enjoy the people that I work with even thought we have ours ups and down moments. The hardest part working at UPS is loading the heavier trucks. Most of the time it either could be one or two people to load the truck.
good,While working here the work is hard and constant. Its also easy if you think about it just putting boxes on a belt. The supervisors are friendly. The group I work with is caring and kind and make the job a friendly environment. Only downside is working everyday of the week and also going to highschool. I usually come home dead tired and go right to bed. I fit homework in where I can. Social life is now a weekend thing only for me. The pay is good as well. Overall i like my job but wish I had more free time.
good,"Whilst working with United Parcel Service, I was given an opportunity to learn valuable experience in a different working environment. It was my responsibility to sort through, record and deliver parcels to as many as 120 adresses a day. Communicating with customers to make sure they get what they want, when they want was also a big part of the job. Being punctual and committed was key for a successful day."
good,"You could be yourself , the job is very easy and maintains a balance with your personal life . It's something new you learn from anybody on that job"
good,"Good job only a seasonal position , good work environment and I r3wkky enjoy doing the physical aspect of packing moving and organizing all of the other boxes overall something I enjoyed doing ."
good,"UPS is a great job for a college student since they have tuition reimbursement and they even give you money towards books. Hardest part of the job is getting use to the high-speed scanning and stacking of the packages, if you are a loader."
good,i learned the ins and outs of the company. working with friendly people who were more than happy to help others. i loaded and unloaded hulls and trucks. the management was really nice and they offered me a position as supervisor after my season employment had ended.
good,"I loved the job, management was all over the place. Really wasn't to much leadership, from my department. Other accounts were grade A."
good,"UPS creates wonderful employment opportunities to several people. The company does not discriminate against people that they hire, and they compensate you well for your work. The hardest part of the job for me is the fact that it is seasonal and I am not guaranteed in any way, no matter my performance to obtain a permanent position. At the same time this may be a beneficial aspect to others who are looking for a little extra money for the holidays without a huge commitment or maybe younger people that just need a little income."
good,The way they work their employers is up for debate but they are union & great benefits. They also promote within the company & hire only part time entry level pre loaders & seasonal driver helpers.
good,Getting right down to business. Ready our work stations and start. Going with the flow the capacity will sometimes increase but remaining calm will make the heavy work loud die down with your team or coworkers. Nice an Neat knowing the enjoyment when all the drivers are in an the workload is done. Management stays on top of things making sure nothing gets left behind or goes wrong.
good,"UPS Capital is a great place to work.  Management is very flexible and believes in a work-life balance.  UPS Capital focuses on employee engagement, which encourages employees to bring their ideas to the table."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job just working at the airport being around the planes was very cool I thought. Also driving a tug was a cool experience.
good,UPS is a great employer with enormous benefits in a variety of different aspects with the only catch being that you have to have worked for them for a while before you can enjoy these benefits.
good,"A Typical Day Working At Ups . The Operation Is Started With The OverNight Shift . Preloaders Complete tasks Such As Unloading trailers,Sorting & Other Warehouse Tasks."

good,"Typical Day: "
good,"UPS is  a very fast pace working environment. Daily duties are setting up the work area, communication between employees, drivers, and dispatch centers, to giving employees instructions and training them in safe work methods."
good,"UPS is a great job in regards to benefits and raises! However, you won't want to work here if you don't want to do any labor."
good,"A typical day is steady. You move with the flow of the volume and help each other out. I learned teamwork, social skills, and how to keep pace with any type of volume. As far as coworkers go, you learn to deal with a variety of different people and learn to work together. The hardest part of the job would be the actual physical aspect. The most enjoyable part of the job is a day completed with no mistakes and everyone has done their job successfully."
good,The great thing about this job is its a workout and you get paid. The benefits are great also. My coworker are very friendly and the managers treat you with respect.
good,Good pay. Typically only 4 hour shifts for unloaders/loaders. Good benefits but only after you've been working a year.
good,UPS can be easy if you make it easy. It's really hot but you're in there for about 3 to 4 hours a day. Hardest part is the heat and the cold because there is no AC
good,Alot of work for little pay but very enjoyable atmosphere supervisors are down to earth real tolerable to your schedule. great second job for the evening shift.
good,A typical day at work is pretty fun but it also can be very long and hot days and what i have learned at UPS is that you have to work as a team to be successful
good,the hardest part of the job would be lifting more than 100 pounds by yourself. the most enjoyable part of the job is you can laugh and have fun while making money.
good,"While UPS was a physically exhausting job it was simple enough to do for the three and a half hours I was usually there every week night. The pay was good but sadly the lack of hour proved to be a major issue. Either you had to be there for awhile, or be lucky enough to win a bid for a better position or another shift. Most of the management there was okay to deal with, even if at times they were difficult to deal with."
good,i have learned  IBM system AS 4000 UDC and OPSYS. great company benefits and encouraged  by management for career enchancement.  great potential for growth.
good,"UPS is the perfect place to work if you need a job while you're going to school. The pay is decent, you get some of the best health benefits even if you're part time, and they help you pay for school day one. Most of the jobs are quite physically demanding, which can be a positive and a negative. You get plenty of exercise working at UPS but having the energy for school after work can be a struggle. Job security is excellent. As long as you're working steady and safely, it is very hard to get fired. It's comforting to show up every day and not having to worry about your job not being there tomorrow. Typically the only real downside is that occasionally you will get an assortment of supervisors who are too inexperienced to run their sections effectively. Poor management can have a domino effect on the rest of the building making the shift more stressful than it needs to be. Other than that I've very much enjoyed my time at UPS."
good,"At UPS they treat the employees with lots of respect. The benefits they offer us are great and my coworkers are a joy to work with. For the most part, everyone has a good time there and even when the going gets tough, everyone puts in the effort to finish the job together."
good,"A typical day consisted of answering customer inquiries over the phone, handling damaged/missing package calls, ordering supplies for businesses, and assisting customers in tracking packages. The workflow was constant a large part of the time, with call queues consistently being full. Each day had a new surprise and a new experience."
good,Great teamwork. Pay was nice with great benefits. Co-workers lvoe to help and it makes the work easier for everyone. The most enjoyable is the fun we had working together
good,"The day always started out with stretching before we head into the trailers. The intensity of the day was an exciting aspect for me because of U.P.S I lost 125 pounds and I'm truly grateful. They taught me many things, but most important to them was the safety aspect as well as having a ""never give up"" attitude but the most important lesson that they taught me is too succeed in any workplace and I want to bring that intensity to your company."
good,"Fast paced work,I t was  like getting paid to work out. Full insurance after 1 year. 25 hrs/week. Line always started on time,  workers stayed until all packages were loaded. So some nights longer than others. Good employee interplay. Management too concerned about keeping the belt running no matter what."
good,"a typical work day consist of 3-5 hrs of loading/unloading. The job is a fast paced, physically demanding job. If in the unload your working typically from 6-10 pm. In the other hand preload starts from 4-9am. The Job is flexible enough to attend school/ other job , etc."
good,I absolutely adore my job at the UPS store. My coworkers are some of the greatest people I have had the pleasure of working with. I've learned all about how the shipping industry works and it's all intriguing.
good,This job was a workout. It deals with alot of upper and lower body strengths. The climate can vary depending on what time of the year it is. It was very easy to make friends and you get a chance to work in both teams and individually.
good,Small or big packages gets delivered with care. speed sorting for fast delivery. handler handle with care. great system in place.
good,"leuke sfeer, ik heb veel geleerd binnen ups. het moeilijkste van me baan was als we het druk hadden dat ik geen werk af geef maar alles zelf doe, dus moet leren te delegeren. heb me werk altijd met plezier uitgevoerd, alleen vind het nu tijd worden voor een nieuwe uitdaging en ik wil met nieuwe systemen gaan werken."
good,"very relaxed, customer friendly, environment.  I really enjoyed my job and its requirements. their open-door policy was amazing and management were great."
good,A very safe and good company to work for.  Competitive pay and great benefits.  Advancement opportunities are available.
good,"A typical day will be a five hour job of continuously being led to a truck by your supervisor , if not already assigned to one and you load that truck in a very organized manner to the top. I learned through the many weeks and months of loading and unloading there is that being consistent is very important and being aware of your surroundings can help you rom being more than safe. My managers and co-workers were very similar in many way they were understandable and patient as well as firm about there job.The most hardest part about the job was being put in a truck were boxes were already in the truck before I could start . The most enjoyable part was being able to relate and enjoy working with other employees who had similar futuristic expectations as myself."
good,"A typical afternoon at UPS requires one to be physically active and positive. I put away anywhere form 1500 - 2500 packages a night. As a loader I face problems such as jams on belts, miss-loaded packages, and keeping up with the flow of packages. It is important for me to lift and lower packages correctly and work safety. As the safety representative, I need to make sure my co workers are safe as well."

good,Great place to work. Teach you you to become leaders and value of hard work. Good people to be around. Only downside is part-time employment.
good,"I'm an extra pair of hands so vary day to day; I work in the mezzanine scanning and labeling packages, folding bags the packages come in and help sort mail. I help unload 20 to 40 foot trailers of heaver packages that come to our center; this is the most enjoyable position, makes the mornings seem to go by fast because its constant work. I can also load trucks; which is definitely the hardest job, making sure to load the right packages into the right truck. Management is fair to their employs."
good,Productive and fun place to work in. It has a fair salary and with good benefits/incentives. The hardest part of the job is when it's peek season because there are lots boxes and are too heavy. The enjoyable part of the job is having nice and friendly co-workers around.
good,"I worked here for several years and actually came onto the site as a temp employee through Spherion. I was laid off by the company or no longer needed however I was requested back to take a permanent position in less than a year. The job was easy and he hours worked well for me as a student and parent. If I could have stayed I would have. Great company to work for ,not perfect but what job is."
good,"A typical day consisted of waking up around 3am and unloading trailers until 9am. I learned how to work hard, multi task, scan many boxes at once, manual labor, and proper lifting of heavy machinery. Management was very nice and polite, but like every big corporation, management has their cons. They would usually take their problems to their workers and work them five to six hours straight without a break. My co workers never really talked since it was such a fast pace job, workers needed to stay in front of the belt for packages. The hardest part of my job was waking up at 3am and going to sleep to get enough sleep for work. The most enjoyable part of my job was having the whole day free of work and the benefits."
good,Great organization to work for. Many opportunities for advancement at this stage in the game for me. No complaints so far towards how the company is run
good,I had a good time working with my coworkers and going from place to place with my driver everyday. Even loading the trucks were fun because my coworkers and I had fun doing it by just making sure each of us doesn't feel miserable doing it.
good,A typical day at work is full of constant movement. I learned leadership with UPS. Management is good a lot of career advancement opportunities. My co-workers work together to get the job done no employee is bigger or greater than the other we all have to work to get the job done. The hardest part of the job is when we get slammed with shipments. The most enjoyable part of the job is when we get the job done.
good,"A  great place to work, but must be determined and hard working mind orientated. Co-workers are a good help and offere hellp when able to assist another co-worker in any way."
good,You can move up to management positions quickly.  The hardest part of the job for newcomers is preventing injury on the job and staying fit.  Need to be able to handle the consistent loading and physical demands of the job.
good,"While my work at UPS was cut short due to me moving to a different state, I'd have to say that I enjoyed working in at UPS Worldport. I learned a lot about staying safe in that kind of work environment, and how they get things done at UPS. During a typical day of work we'd clock in, stretch to get ready for work, work , have a break, work more then get ready to clock out a the end of the day, making sure we have nothing else to do."

good,"Upbeat work place, positive environment. Employees got along well. Supervisor helped the employees load trucks also when things would get backed up."

good,"UPS is physically demanding. Its like a session at the gym without the membership fees. If you enjoy fitness, its nice being an hourly employee. If not, you could become a supervisor.

good,"A typical day at work is 5 hours or less delivering different sizes of boxes off a box cart truck, taking packages to house to house a lot of walking but it is enjoyable! It is a physical job that everyone can't do on a day to day basis. I have learned if your not ready for it just don't take the job. If you are try to hang in there for a year to move up. The management team is cool they will not sugar coat anything for you and let you know how the job is it is demanding and physical. The co-workers are up beat and willing to get there job done. The hardest part of the job is maintaining a speed and doing the correct lifting for the job. The most enjoyable part of the day is meeting everyone around you that is trying and determined to move up and get benefits from UPS."
good,"Overall Great Job"
good,"After clocking in, the pace starts off steady at first. The main objective is to use the cornerstone strategies from training and to apply them in the different trucks that we load. The managers are in place to motivate and assist as the pace picks up from the packages conveyed from the sorters. Co-workers assist each other whenever the loads are caught up. The hardest part of the job is when the pace is at full speed and packages jam on the conveyors. You have to carefully dislodge the packages from jamming while the conveyors run at full speed while simultaneously keeping the packages safe for the consumers. The most enjoyable part of the job is the camaraderie between co-workers when problems occur. A great team helps everything run smoothly and creates a very comfortable and stress free work environment."
good,"You meet your driver at time set by the driver and place to meet."
good,Management is very kind and takes their time teaching new people what is needed for the job.

good,"It is a great company.  Great benefits and job security.  If one is able to adapt to the physical demands of working here, it really is an excellent place to work"
good,"I worked overnight, really was exhausted when I got home. I worked 11pm to 8am, but over time in December I got used to it and adjusted to the hard work and was really focused. Co-workers were friendly actually made two friends. Hardest part of the job was working for 3+ hours straight lifting boxes but I got used to it. Had no problem with management at all, very helpful, mentor like people. It would of been great if my position was not a seasonal position because I am in desperate need of a job."
good,Short hours and small checks but they have full benefits and will pay for almost all of your college expenses. Hard work though must be physically strong if looking into working there.
good,"Job is fun to work, typical day is 13 hours but goes by fast. Very family oriented culture, team work is required to survive."

good,"a typical day at work is loading planes with air cans for 3 hours, I learned how to successfully tug, ground spot, and work well with other people, supervisors are nice to you, but the upper management are hard on you, co-workers can either be cool, or really lazy and complain all the time, and don't help each other out, it's 50/50. The hardest part of the job is Sunday's when you load trailers, and the most enjoyable part of the job is having fun with co-workers or getting paid to wait inside the plane while you wait on aircans to come out of the hub."
good,I got along with all my co-works and most of the supervisors. The hardest part of the day was at the end of the day due to clean up. My enjoyable part of the day was break time.
good,"a good place to work "
good,"The workplace is generally diverse in age, knowledge and cultures and makes for great networking as there is a great amount of transparency between work groups.  Management tries their best to adjust to the needs of everyone to make the work/life balance as feasible and least conflicting as possible, showing in the individual management policies of their employees.  The goal is ensuring efficiency and timeliness but with the nature of the job requiring all to remain compliant to current government regulations and standards, being abreast of current methods as well as being agile enough to quickly adjust is a necessary skill."
good,"A typical day at UPS consists of sorting packages, loading and unloading trailers, as well lifting packages over 70 lbs.

I've only been working at UPS for one month in counting but already I have learned how to manage my time. I make sure I accomplish everything I need to accomplish before 5 p.m. so that I can be in bed by 5:30 p.m. and get seven hours of sleep before waking up and getting ready for work. "
good,"As a seasonal driver helper, it is fun, many of the bad people leave within the first month and the rest are usually hard working people, the drivers I got were pretty cool and the management was fun and encouraging. It is a lot of work but you get paid a correct amount, not under or over paid and it is kind of like a free workout"

good,Working at ups I have learned how marshall aricrafts. Learned how to drive tug and beltloaders. Manage to work with others well. Easy job to learn. Fun job
good,"I like working at ups. Its a part-time job with good benefits and works around my school schedule. At ups I load trucks, and that is not easy. I'm constantly moving at a fast pace and working hard. It does keep me in shape. But I'm in college to make a better life for myself and my daughter. I wouldn't say that I would retire from ups because that a lot of hard labor. I can handle the work but my real passion is graphic design not busting my butt in a truck."
good,Everyday at the you must work at a fast pace. The fast pace is needed for the delivery packages to set up for the next day. This job can definitely become a place where u can work out physically. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know your co workers while you are working.

I learned the value of teamwork and how to interact with others. My managers are very skilled in their fields and know what needs to be done to run the center properly. My co-workers are easy to get along with and are well prepared and able to complete their jobs. The hardest part of the job is sorting the amount of package volume within the company limits. I enjoy mostly everything about the job even the difficult parts.
good,"I may be the only person who feels this way about working at UPS, but I love it. I look forward to going into work everyday, greeting all of my co-workers by name, and knowing that I am a part of something, a team that works together, in which every part is integral and important."

good,This is a very fast paced job. But in all the managment is cool the pay is cool so everything is cool !
good,You can never be bored at UPS. You'll meet a variety of co-workers. What i learn at UPS is Time Management. Every package had to be scan and delivered at or before an appropriate time. What I like the most about UPS is the fast pace environment. The hardest part of the job is the long hours
good,"Working at UPS is a rewarding experience if your willing to work hard, and put in the time and effort."
good,I learned the job i had was seasonal and at that point you have to ask for the hours your want. My co- workers were all easy to get along with there were no problems at all generally. The hardest part of the job was adapting to the weather whether it rained or was really cold. I enjoyed sending out the packages during the time of Christmas.
good,"My typical day was to arrive at the meeting point to meet with my driver. It was always important to us that we developed a system of working together so we would know what to do to make our progress even better. The one thing I have learned is that no matter how long a walker/driver has been working for UPS, there are still some features of the DIAD that they have never seen before. My co-workers always took their job seriously, but they were fun and cool to hang out with. Whether we were at the UPS centre or with fellow walkers/drivers on the streets, we always did the best we could and had a good time working together. The hardest part of the job was working out in the cold weather. What I enjoyed about the job was when people received their parcels and had the thankful smile on their faces showing how much they appreciated me and what I did."
good,"If you didnt want to work, this was the wrong place for you! Very fast pace job and i learned about how the mailing system works."
good,"Unloaded, loaded semi-trailer. Excellent management team to work with you. Great people to work with that helped me out when needed. Worked the grave yard shift so was hard at times to stay focused. I love that there was so many position to move up into once you got your foot in the door."

good,I load three trucks everyday.  I pull packages off the conveyor belt and load them in correct order.  Most co-workers are enjoyable to work with.  The hardest part of the job is when it gets busy and you don't have time to load your packages into the trucks and you have to stack them.  The most enjoyable part is the people I work with.
good,"I learned every zip code in Texas, then sorted up to 100 packages per minute.  Moved to irreg"" driver (drove small train inside building carrying packages that did not fit on sorter belts)."
good,I really enjoy working with packages going over seas.  I have learned more than I ever thought would be involved in what is necessary for a package to get threw customs.
good,Most of the day you are in the truck loading packages. you learn a lot of things like how to work fast and efficient. the supervisors are friendly for the most part. I never had a problem with and coworkers. The hardest part of the job is moving fast enough to get the packages in without hurting or straining yourself. I found the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and when they did special activities for the workers like pizza day.
good,"A typical night at work consists of unloading/loading air crafts and marshalling them back out onto the run way. I have learned so much about safety precautions and just how important communication is to make a work environment and task run smoothly. My co-workers are great and we are like a big family. We have parties and pot-lucks all the time. The hardest part of the job is the manual labor and now that I am a single mother the over night hours are very hard to adjust too."
good,"It's hard work sorting packages at a pace of 1,200 per hour, but I enjoyed the challenge. Plus I got a workout everyday of the week without attending a gym."
good,"Fast pace physically, hard work environment, labor intensive"
good,I worked less than hand full a months and during that time per each passing day I had worked there I improved my performance as I was learning more and more how to do my job. Sadly though I was laid off at the first of January of this year. I was suppose to be permanent but I guess that was just a con.

good,"Its more than just delivering packages, you have to make sure you delivery packages on time and accurately. Days where you get over 200 packages a day you have to be fast.

good,"Coordinated with freight forwarders to expedite international shipments."
good,"I enjoyed working at UPS, you just have to be able to endure the elements because it is a warehouse. Great beneits, and pay, most co-workers are awesome!"
good,"FULL TIME JOB - STARTS 8AM - 8PM"
good,"I have worked with UPS Freight for 2 years now and I have had little to no issues with this company. They treat and pay you very well for what you would be doing. As long as you do your work and don't get involved in drama, you won't be bothered with it. If you do your work satisfactory every day, more than likely you will be rewarded for it. It's a great place to work if you don't mind union jobs and having to bid for full time job positions twice a year. I have enjoyed my employment with UPS and would highly recommend this company to anyone."
good,became familar with the logistics industry.  Was on my own most of time.  career advancement was golden.
good,"A typical day at UPS supply chain solutions started by clocking in, signing in to the system, checking email, inbounding shipments, processing orders, processing returns, reporting defective returns.  "
good,"This was a fairly simple job.  I started out as an unloader in which I would jump into trucks and unload all of the packages.  General labor, but after showing commitment and enthusiasm by volunteering for the safety committee and staying after work to see if there was anything else I could do I was promoted to supervisor.  As supervisor I was responsible for delegating tasks to the unloaders and making sure strict deadlines were met.  I was also responsible for coordinating the trucks to their designated hub efficiently so that minimal time was wasted.  It was my job to make sure everyone was following the safety guidelines and making sure we met the deadlines.  My co-workers were great and humorous people and worked hard.  The management was fair, but would constantly be watching me to make sure I was pushing the unloaders to do their job faster.  It was stressful at times, but you must make sure the job gets done when running a business."
good,"waking up at 2 am to get to work by 330 am, to lift heavy boxes all day. Not a good job if you have back problems. You have to load a certain number of boxes in a car and that was extremely hard. Decent job, you got a whole day to do what you want since you were off at 9am every morning with the weekends of."

The typical day started at 3am worked until 2pm, first 4.5 hours were devoted to the production of getting all packages loaded on to the package car.

good,"A typical night there would just consist of me reporting to my supervisor to see what specific truck they would like me to unload. I've learned a lot about how packages should be handled when they're getting delivered to a customer. I also learned how long a package should regularly take to get to the person receiving it. The people I worked with were very nice and welcoming when I started on the floor. The hardest part of the job depended on what was in the truck I had to unload, sometimes it'd be an easy truck and sometimes it'd take me over an hour to unload one. The most enjoyable part of the job were the benefits that were offered."
good,"Excelente compañia para trabajar,  otorga estabilidad y salarios acordes al cargo."
good,"early am schedule, has given me a oppurtunity grow with the company and learn about logistics"
good,A typical day a work is being on point and focus with every package that you deliver to any company and household. I learned how to work in fast an helpful work environment that with great people and co-workers. My management and also my co-workers were very helpful in every way where if i didn't know anything they will stop what they were doing they will reach out to help me in every way. The hardest part of this job was keeping up with the delivering to commercial stores at a certain time everyday. The most enjoyable part of the day was working with my driver was a great teacher to me with everything.
good,"A typical day at the job at UPS. First things first is I clock in to get the day started. After that, I go through the process of setting up my work area along with my co-workers work areas as well. Such as opening the hatches and doors on all the delivery cars and checking them for send agains. Which are packages that couldn't make delivery the working day before. After that I set up a device known as an I-SPA. This device pretty much links up with the Wi-Fi network and retrieves data from the dispatch department for where a leftover package is now designated for the working day. After that I begin work in the work area that I am assigned to. Usually three brown package delivery cars. I usually retrieve between the amount of 700 to 1200 total packages for the working day. While doing this type of work I make sure that I maintain a safe and clean work area in order to prevent injury. All while scanning each package and keeping count of how many packages are slated to go on each car for the day. Also I examine and deal with HAZMAT and perishable items. What I learn on a day to day basis at work is that you have to prepare yourself mentally and have the mentality to do your part in a working team environment in order for everyone to have a good day. I would say the hardest part of my job would be having the mental endurance to carry on with the working day. I would say the most enjoyable part of my job is my co-workers. We rely and count on one another on a day by day basis."
good,"Its a good place to work, the work schedule and work flow isn't to much to handle if your going to school and working. They have good benefits and decent hours if your trying to have two jobs or go to school and work."

good,This is a great company to work for. I have been a supervisor for 7 years and have learned a lot during that time. 
good,"Spent every day multitasking in order to complete the days deadlines while working on various customer service inquiries."
good,"     Generally the day started off by my making sure that all planes came in the night before. This to ensure that our vehicles were filled with that days deliveries.  Next I'd create the 100-150 driver routs via our (DIAD) system, while downloading the prior days (DIAD) route delivery information.  I'd assist in loading vehicles if necessary due to a high volume of packages or a late plane.  "
good,i love my hours. My boss was the easiest person to get alone with. I also enjoyed helping people.
good,"UPS is a great place to work if your going to school, cause they pay for it. You can advance quickly and they have great insurance. Work though is extreme, but doable."
good,"A typical day at work involves 4-6 hours of physical labor, which includes lifting and moving packages that weight up to 70lbs. I learned that hard work goes a long way and never goes unnoticed. Management is both structurally solid but also flexible with employees. Some co-workers are very helpful to one another while others don't care too much about their job. The hardest part of the job is being able to pace yourself to not over work your body while working 5 consecutive days in a row. The most enjoyable part of the job is only having to deal with management and other coworkers as oppose to customer service jobs were you can easily become discouraged by costumer interactions."
good,UPS has taught me hard work and how to work in a safe manner. UPS is a physical yet rewarding company. I've been there 12 part time years.
good,"I was responsible for various and specific areas of the country (example: Northern Border/Canadian crossings) to insure the air and ground international sites in that area remain compliant with all U.S. regulatory requirements. This entailed working with the UPS site personnel/management, site visits, auditing, and working with regulatory agencies in Washington DC and UPS Corporate Headquarters personnel."
good,Having a time period to get all of the packages unloaded and loaded onto the right trucks.
good,UPS will put one to work. Stick with the company and the benefits and opportunities will pay off.
good,"If we are work as a team is really have fun, its seems you never know the time is there already, time to go home,but the hardest part of my job is if the winter is coming because i`m working outside but happy sometimes because we have free coffee and bread from the management"
good,"Myday as a driver basic duties are to remove package from the truck, walk them to the door and get a signature, if required. If a signature is not required, drivers leave each package in a safe place. They often leave a note for the recipient that indicate where the package is. Each driver has a ""diadboard,"" that has the information for each delivery. That is the large electronic tablet that the recipient signs. It also tells the driver where he is going next."
good,"I learned quite a bit from UPS, also gained a nice bit of muscle. The typical day consisted of moving around 1500-2350 packages in a four hour time span. The management was very flexible and understanding. The hardest part was at the end of the night when you were exhausted but I pushed through that."
good,"A typical day at UPS-SCS, follow up on customer cargo, open new client files and statues updates on data intel. While doing so I learned valuable data entry format and excellent customer service skills due to the 1 on 1 service we provided for our cutomers. Management kept our plates full and able to send a team member to assist if needed to close the deal which in all cases was not an issue but it was good to know that they where there to send support. The challeging part of the job is when shipments where delayed or a customes issue with cargo but with my excellent troulde shooting skills I was able to keep the customer happy. Overall I enjoyed working for such an illustral company and appreciate the experience that I learned."
good,Entrata flessibile dalle 8.30 alle 9.
good,I had a lot of fun working there but it was only seasonal.
good,"A typical work day consist of hard work and dedication. I learned alot there. For example, I learned how to operate a conveyor belt, forklift, and how to build a strong box wall. Management was great. They was always welling to go the extra step to help you progress in the company. The hardest part about this particular job was the constant flow of boxes coming down the shoot and trying to keep up with it. The most enjoyable part about this job was the satisfaction of making each and every customer package arrive on time."
good,A typical day getting their and and daily streching with the team getting our invoice for the number of items we will have to load/unload. I learned that its a great place for team work management has always got a handle on things the co-workers use team work well help each other and are not just there for there time or self needs the hardest part is trying to keep a stedy pace when you have 20-30 boxes your trying to sort out coming at one time. the most enjoyable part is the down time you may get when trucks run a little late you get a short break in between trucks
good,"Bottom line, the job is pretty tough and very physical with very little pay. However, the advantage is from the benefits that the employee receives such as medical and dental after one year of work plus the same for a family member/spouse after 18 months of employment. They also offer tuition assistance and mobility to the top is fairly fluid."
good,"After working with so many different people for my duration at this company, I was happy to have been able to impact the company's productivity and profitability in a positive way."
good,"This is a great job for anyone with a family. Working a few hours every morning provided enough money to pay the bills, plus you are home on time to put the kids on the bus. It is a very difficult job physically, so be ready. No rest for the weary! It is fast paced and challenging. There is room for advancement if you want it. It is fun and intersting. The level of difficulty makes teamwork a must, and there are plenty of great people around to team with."
good,Attentive on people career development
good,"It is a fast paced job, depending on the weather out side is pretty much tha same on the inside. U have to adapt to the harsh climates but after a few months working there i adatpted very well"
good,"Service and PM inspectiions on heavy duty conveyor systems. daily, weekly and monthly visuall inspections as well as anuall inspections."
good,"Great place to work that provides benefits. I work with 20 other part time supervisors and four full time supervisors. We unload and load aircraft with freight that is shipped around the country. Job can be stressful at times, but overall a great place to work."
good,fast pace always competitive management was pretty good co-workers pushed each other to the limit.Hardest part of job was the long waiting list to become a driver. most enjoyable part was the daily competition.
good,"Great benefits, very challenging, and overall great experience."
good,Great company to work for . The hard & dedicated work is just a gift . You want something go get it attitude here is a plus .
good,No down time whatsoever. Business was #1 and some employees were difficult to work with. Otherwise was a good company to work for in regards to advancement and job security.
good,Arrive at the UPS HUB warehouse and start working. Setup the container for loading and begin the work.
good,"great place to work,"
good,coming in and loading or unloading about 2 to 3 trailers before lunch..working there showed me how to lift and put down packages without hurting myself..as a supervisor i was able to try a maintain a work place that was safe for me and my co-workers and gratefully able so send off documents and packages to their right delivery points..my fellow co-workers loved that i was a supervisor because i was able to understand their needs around the work place and was able to get what we needed to get the job done for the day..i think the most trouble i had working there was when i started and i had to learn these colors and zip codes ( over 1200 zip codes/8 colors ) it wasnt a walk in the park but i got it done..but i can say that i enjoyed working with them again because of all the good air and people around me day by day
good,"As a loader you report to your area, clock in, grab a scanner and depending on how your area is managed you figure out which trailer(s) you're responsible for. You only work part-time so shifts are 3-5 hours long. You receive one 15 min break approx. halfway in your shift. It can be labor intensive but the atmosphere is a mixture of relaxed and hard working. As long as you're doing your job you are pretty much left alone. There is room for conversation at times as well. I found this job to be great as a student for the benefits and the work schedules offered."
good,UPs is a great company for someone who wants to learn the core values of hard work.
good,"You will work the entire shift so be ready for it, but it is worth it if you can handle the high volume fast pace"
good,A typical work day at UPS is like a physical workout at the gym it requires a lot of lifting and moving. I have learned a lot about what goes to what city/state I have learned a lot of zip codes . I have also learned how to keep my composer as I work at UPS. Management is kind of hard at UPS it requires a lot of leadership skills but other than that it is ok.the hardest part of the job is working in the heat.
good,As a Nordic security investigator you:
good,This job holds intrest. even with communication gaps your direct Supervisors listen and try to help if any problem. Rewarding to help and be respected.
good,"A day of work at UPS consists of loading transfer trucks with boxes and bags; the bags are filled with boxes. The boxes and bags come to the trucks via a conveyor belt. On a typical night at work I will load about 1,000 boxes and 50 bags. I have learned how to work and collaborate with fellow employees, build 10 feet high walls of boxes without them falling and understand how a very successful company operates. I enjoy working with the people that I work with. Mostly everyone who works in the same area as I has a sense of humor and a strong love for sports. We all connect in a positive manner and have fun talking and working together. I enjoy the jokes and laughter more than anything else in the workplace. The management is terrific; my supervisors do an awesome job of making sure the belt is constantly running, there is enough people in the work area and that everyone is helping each other. Honestly no part of the job is hard; I have worked at UPS for 2 years and 9 months and frankly it has become second nature to me. I approach loading the trucks as a huge game of ""Tetris."""
good,"As a part-time warehouse employee, the pay wasn't the greatest but the full health benefits were indespensible. Well worth the lack of monetary compensation. Numerous shifts to work around your schedule. Physical labor is involved, as are solid lifting practices so this is no place if you are prone to being lazy or are fragile. Driving the delivery truck is a young man's job, you must have good knees and keep up a steady, consistent and determined pace to keep your days short. Easy to see your personal successes daily. Very gratifying."
good,Most days you drive around with the driver to deliver packages. Hour long breaks were great.Some days you get free lunch.The managers were also very kind
good,Hard work fast pace out of sight benefit package great managment work life balance is great set schedule
good,"I have worked her for over a year now and I must say I have became a better worker, and have gotten stronger, its a good 3-4 hour workout per night. The hours arent the greatest and neither is the pay. It is a good part time job to have if you're busy during the day."
good,"When you are forced to be an ""hourly"" as they call it, the job isn't that fun because they can tell you to go anywhere in the building and you can't refuse. Management is awesome, you get to direct your own area, control the flow of the volume and how many people you get on your belt at a time... way better than being an hourly"
good,They have four shifts. You do not work weekends and you only work 5 hours a day. Its the perfect part time job.
good,"My time at UPS was a true learning experience. I did not start in operations, as most did at that time. As a result, it took me a bit longer to grasp the way ""things worked"" in the UPS world. Once I learned it became fun!"
good,I love to work there because of the environment and the people were very nice and outspoken....Even the mangers were very nice and helpful and you can pick up alot of overtime
good,Great experience and training provided.  Daily routines and learning different task to improve skills.  Temp position was standard as work place culture was a good fit
good,"I worked here for a decent amount of time. The day starts with a supervisor meeting and goals for the day and week. Attendance is taken for hourly union workers. Work begins then you punch out afterwards."
good,"The supervisors are very welcoming and hard working , as well as organized and driven. Everyone in the warehouse pushes to help each other and motivate each other on tasks."
good,Great part time job safe environment light start the pace picks up through the day  breaks are very convenient consistent flow of packages late nights
good,The driver I worked with was amazing. He did his job correctly and professionally. I enjoyed working with him and even thought about staying in to work in the warehouse.
good,"Those are to the best and very truthful and honest ratings I have giving myself , I would like to have a supervisor, or team leader give my ratings for my work ethic and my abilities and personality and customer service skills i have been know to work well under pressure. I am and work very well in a fast paced working environment. I enjoy help out our community also live to put a smile on a person's face. I feel as though I have accomplished there needs."
good,"they cater to their employee needs, respect your balance with work and your outside life. Management was understanding. Good Team work. Everyone is willing to help each other out."
good,"Really enjoyed working under UPS during the holiday season, Great work environment. The Manager was very helpful during training/walkthrough, as well as the employees"
good,"It's a very good place to work for someone in school.  The benefits are outstanding.  Unloading is pretty easy although, some trucks are heavier than others, that isn't such a big deal though as we have extendable conveyor belts."
good,"It was an overall easy job, loved being my own boss during work and working at mt own pace. Addresses can be hard to find, but if you enjoy driving, this is a great job! Pay was decent,  but time cards being accurate when guaranteed 8 hrs is in play, but you don't work the full 8, time correction and payment for such has been a challenge."
good,If you arent mentally and physically tough then this probably isnt the job for you. I went in there pretty scrawny and after just 6 months i have gained so much muscle just from the physical work. If you stick with it you will be able to do it. In the summer time it gets really hot bring water. In the winter it gets really cold bring a jacket. Anyday you work you are going to want to bring some tissues to mop up yours and others tears.
good,There was time where I wanted to quit but I didn’t because I need to work and I to understand the work was hard and that I need to get my money to pay my bills
good,"good working environment, good management, the most enjoyable part of the job is working in team, good work culture, the hardest part of the job is waking lifting heavy packages"
good,Job can be physically demanding but is not hard to learn. Moving up takes time but each position pays well for starters. has very good benefits if the time for benefits is put in.
good,The Driver helper was good I feel like it could’ve been actually job in some cases.But I think it was good over all people there are nice they hired quick.
good,"A face pace, must be organized type of job.. Must be able to make decisions quickly. Also remain safe by following the methods UPS teaches. Also greeting the consumers with a smile."
good,Great company to work for and ability to move on various career paths.  Team oriented and motivated to succeed-great benefits and stock options also able to create some great friendships.
good,Everything was awesome other than being on call! Everyone was friendly and it was really fun to deliver packages. It wasn't stressful and we delivered about 60 packages with the driver but in total it was 140.
good,The company helps employees by allowing them to learn through others. The managers were very helpful and the employees were very friendly. The company provides good benefits and resources to their employees.
good,"fact paced, physical job. great benefits and decent pay. job offers great advancement opportunities along with the chance to make extra hours when needed."
good,I really enjoyed my time at UPS. Great company to work for. The whole management team would be more than happy to step in and help whenever needed and would be will to answer any questions.
good,Great Company!!!!!!!!  Easy opportunities to advance in the company. The company provide free healthcare to all employees. Would be a good part time job.
good,Working at UPS. Taught me to care for others packages when it’s in your possession. Communication is key! And having a coordinator or manger work with you through your day to make sure everything was correctly delivered
good,I worked there for peak season of 2019 as an HR Supervisor.  Great environment and I learned a lot about the company.  Lots of opportunity to advance within the company.
good,You need to be very fast and quick with your eyes to be great for the job. I’m that but the company doesn’t give out motivating hours for their employees.
good,"The job here, even though it was seasonal, was a really great experience. Me and the Driver developed a great bond that got us working twice as hard and we were motivated."
good,"Love the overnight shift, its very fast with the loads and volumes we get every night. I certainly like moving every night. Overall, it is a fun place to work."
good,"helped delivered boxes from truck to homes. helped truck driver organize . also worked mornings sorted boxes into the trucks.  Works tedious, but not hard."
good,"This job taught me time management, even though the job was hard it allowed me to push myself. The job was a seasonal so it didn't last but three months but out of the three months I believe that it allow me to be more of a hard worker."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was I got to see how packages are shipped threw out the county. I enjoyed how the company have everything organized so if a package is in the wrong line u’ll be able to detect it before loading it on the truck, and the customer will receive they package on time."
good,I worked for ups loading trucks. The job was frustrating at first but when i realized the technique to it and the way you can make work more efficient and moves faster it became easier and my days we t faster. I also liked it a decent amount because it was only a couple hours a day but i got paid every week. I also like my co-workers.
good,"hectic, intense, amazing work out, tough, always busy, extremely busy during the holidays to the point where you can het overwhelmed. Drink a lot water."
good,UPS ist ein guter Arbeitsgeber. Es gibt immer viel zu tun daher wird es nie langweilig.
good,"Amazing company. Most people don't last, but if you can hang in there, it's more than worth it. If it weren't for personal illness, I would still be employed with UPS."
good,"Good Company with job security and excellent benefits. Dedicated to the customer and it can become a family like atmosphere. However, it is not the normal 9-5 job."
good,"Drivers are extremely nice, fun, and down to earth.  Everyone has great personalities.  The job is very physical and (possible noxious) fumes inhaled from certain manual trucks may be harmful.  Be ready to blow black gunk from your nose for a week following last day. My personal opinion is that Drivers are underpaid for the work that they perform. Most of them opt for overtime."
good,I loved the job and the people. If it wasnt for the hours I would have stayed! Great place to work! Management is easy to get along with as long as you do your job.
good,This company  is  so helpful  with everything  is very  efficient   I love the people  I work with my supervisors are cool could  be better  but they get the job done
good,"UPS was paying only $10 hr and was waiting on the contracts to go the in which they were to still give us back pay from that, also they started to decrease hrs as well. The benefits for school was a big factor and advantage point."
good,Gutes Arbeitsklima bei uns in der 17 Uhr Schicht auf der ramp
good,"UPS is a high paced environment for a part time position, with good, hard working employees, as well as great benefits after 9 months. They also provide tuition assistance."
good,"Most positions are part time, unless you are a driver. In operations, your consistent daily effort and positive attitude will get you promoted! The medical benefits are great, and consumer discounts for being an employee are amongst the best out there. All you have to do is remain coach able by your supervisor and you’ll be successful."
good,"Good part time job with excellent benefits. Room for advancement, they want you to make a career and become a driver. Driver’s work long hours , good job for a young person."
good,Needs more benefits. They need to set a health program also. Have a set for yur hrs for each employee and make them permanent so they wouldn't have to be changing.
good,"Lots of packages. On a typical day it is very busy, time flies, and be ready to get dirty as well as free work out enjoyed the experience you meet lots of people"
good,I enjoyed working at UPS for the fact that you are always busy and on the go.  It makes the work day go by much quicker and is less stressful in my opinion.  Im a fast paced worker so I like being handed down more work than the average person.
good,"i have been at UPS Dordon for 2 months or little more i found the job to be very fast paced which is expected. The best advice i can give to anyone looking to work as a parcel sorter/loader would be if you like physical work and have patience can work as part of a team and being able to employ"
good,"Where I worked, people were really friendly and never had problems with anyone. If you’re having trouble with ANYTHING, don’t hesitate to ask for help they’ll be happy to help you with whatever."
good,UPS Packing Handler Is Great Side Job It’s A Great Exercise And Good Way To Stay In Shape The People There Are Awesome I Even Made A Lot Of Friends There
good,I love my job at ups it's was some fun days and it was some hard days but the people I work around was so cool to be around it was like a family at times we got the job done no matter what.
good,The amount of the work load don't add up to the salary you get . overall the benefits is good.Its a very fast paced job and heavy lifting if you don't have the stamina and the ability to move fast then this job might not be for you . meeting the deadlines when sorting and delivering packages .
good,I worked in a small center with around 15 people. We knew each other well and got along great. UPS would provide time for cookouts and bring in drinks and snacks on the hot days.
good,It starts off with the interview being an tour of the warehouse and learning everything in the warehouse. Taking the class was easy and also a lot of information. Then once you've learned everything you start your actual first day of work and it's difficult but will get used to it after a while if you paid attention in class.
good,I was a driver helper and I was running all the time. It was fun to deliver packages to people’s houses and other stuff like doing pickups from paper companies and t short shops. Overall pretty good job for a first job.
good,"There are a few managers that have poor personal interaction skills, if not for the remaining staff with excellent IPP skills, I would have never stayed."
good,I really enjoyed working for them very professional and the hours are great when your just starting off. Easy steps for safety and the food you buy at the facility is great and is cooked fresh and you have a variety of snacks from the vending machines.
good,"Management lacks in professionalism.  Although I was asked numerous times to become a supervisor, I was not going to subject myself to be berated in front of 35 other supervisors AND keep my mouth shut.  I'm sure I would have lost my job."
good,Seasonal helpers make really good money. The culture is great and the team environment is very fun. I had a good experience working for UPS during the seasonal holiday.
good,"Fast pace work environment that needs hard working and motivated employees to successfully operate daily. Early start times, in a warehouse environment that you should expect to work up a sweat. Several jobs require you to multi task. Various jobs require lifting 70 lbs or more. Repetitive motions and standing on your feet for the entire work sort."
good,UPS offers a decent hourly rate with an average of around 23 hours per week. The supervisors are pretty good and sociable. Most people find a group of people that they hang out with at break.
good,Friendly work place. Highly recommended if you’re looking for a steady Monday through Friday job. Easy work along with other position options. Flexible shifts.
good,Ups is a wonderful place to work as long as you have the effort and the mind set to keep going. If your like me and you come from a small town and attend church every Sunday starting at ups to some may be a bit of a culture shock. Once you begin your career at ups it may be nerve wrecking at times but once you get the hang of it as long as You show up to work on time and demonstrate the skills needed to be a supervisor your job is secured.
good,"Das Geld an sich ist ganz gut, jedoch ist die Arbeit etwas anstrengender als bei den üblichen Jobs"
good,"Working here is very physically demanding, but the pay is definitely worth it. All the people are super nice and very easy get along with. And all your co workers are super helpful with things when you need them."
good,UPS was a hard working job. There was no slow days at UPS. The supervisors were very chill with the workers. Hardest part of the job was keeping up with all of the packages.
good,"On the workplace people work together, help each other and supervisor also helps other employees in their works. Overall, it is nice place to do work having good environment."
good,Clock in and do your job until told otherwise. The managers are nice and seem like they care. I learned UPS is a job you can progress in. The hardest part of the job is when things get backed up and you have to catch back up.
good,"Fast pace "
good,"unloading packages from freight trailers into facility, scanning them an distributing throughout facility. hardest part about working at ups is unloading trailers"
good,Very fast paced work. This job definitely will keep you fit and healthy. Seems like a good job to stick with. Highly recommended for people with no life plan.
good,"A typical dat at UPS is very pace optimized . sometimes we would have a volume of 90k packages , sometimes we would have a volume 0f 20k . Depending on the volume determines or slow or fast paced the day will be . The hardest part of the job is constantly moving your body and shifting your body to lift heavy packages for hours straight a day . The most enjoyable part of the job is working with cool outgoing people and it makes the work period go by quicker . The workplace was very factory oriented because it was a warehouse job , A lot of machinery such as forklifts .I learned how to stacks boxes , Talk to people , wok at any type of pace needed , how to work good when slammed out of nowhere , and to assist when I'm called on ."
good,A good look for a seasonal job especially the pay but everyone was quick to load their truck and gettin to work the drivers seem cool and so did the hiring managers
good,"As I'm writing this. I'm unemployed so that means I am really trying hard to search for another job before I go straight to college. "
good,"A typical day at UPS as a package handler is waiting for packages to come down the belt, scanning them and loading them on the trucks. After only weeks there, I learned that this is not as easy as I thought, but is manageable. At the UPS facility I work at, all my co-workers are willing to help. The hardest part of this job would be keeping up with the belt. Sometimes it can be slow and you'll be able to load everything with little trouble, but other times there will be so many packages coming down that you'll have to stack them outside of the trucks until it slows down. I learned pretty quickly at UPS that teamwork makes the dream work."
good,"Everything just moves nicely and smoovely, everyone is friendly and ready to work. Ups thought me a lot working there.Specially working with the computer."
good,"I have gained more experience working here and there is a lot of opportunity to grow. The management is friendly, however there is very little pay, which is the worst part of the job."
good,Alot of hard work. Short hours. Alot of room to moved up. Great employees you work with. Management can be more organized. Equipment needs alot of work to simplify your job.
good,Fast paced work environment but if you get cool with the part time supervisors it’s not really stressful and they don’t really push you unless it’s a super heavy day or it’s peak season
good,"UPS is a very results oriented company.  They expect a lot from their employees.  You have to be able to stay focused, deal with stressful situations, be able to achieve goals despite set-backs."
good,The job is good for a part time job. The pay and benefits are good. You have a chance to advance if you would like. It is a big company so there are of course some bad things as is with any company.
good,I enjoyed my time with UPS.  It was a good opportunity to gain team skills and attention to detail.  Everyone was able to stay on mission and help each other when needed.  I recommend this job.
good,great company to work for the co workers are very friendly. The supervisors are great they will work with your schedule if you go to school or have another job.
good,"The typical day at work is arriving around 4am. the managers will have a meeting before to tell us how many trucks we will have to unload, then we start to stretch. after we strech we will enter then tucks and start unloading. "
good,maybe it might of been the location that Im at. full time management is disrespectful and they lied to your face just to get their way instead of being honest.
good,"Had some issues when the seasonal work started. My paychecks were wrong the first three weeks, but they worked with me and fixed them. They did everything I asked for and answered all my questions without side railing me. It was an honest mistake. Other than that, it was great working for them, and I will do it again next year."
good,"This is a great company to work for. They are always posting trainings for employees to improve their skills. "
good,I liked to work  ups but the only  problem. I have before  .I don't  like  the  shift.and sometime i get off late. I wanted to work  over time.they  don't have that.
good,I enjoyed working there for the time I was there but the mangers were always rude even for it being my first few days.They gave me more trucks than I should've had and scolded me when I made a mistake even though most people did too.
good,"UPS is a company that is well to work for, prefers to promote within and has a very competitive salary and benefits program. The company also offers tuition assistance."
good,Was a seasonal job and wasn't there long enough to say a whole lot but the time I was there it was a good work environment and fair supervisors...would recommend it
good,the management is always looking out and the people really enjoy there job. they also have good ways of rising up in ups and the benefits are good. i really enjoyed it
good,"Very good workout, nice people to work with, but keep in mind that they will having you working nonstop and have you do heavy lifting. You will get tired everyday."
good,"The workplace is fun, but challenging at times."
good,"I provided customer service, I entered the addresses into the database and corrected incorrect labels on a daily basis.  I slapped a label on a package and the packages were sorted into the correct lines and truck for delivery."
good,Loaded planes then worked in IT.  Great company for anyone to start a career at a young age.  Started in college then went full time.  Should have stuck with the company.
good,This was a very physical job.  I enjoyed working with everyone there.  I was really surprised how friendly and supportive everyone was .  I  wanted to hire on permanently but there wasn't any openings at the time.
good,This is one of the best jobs I ever had. The employees and co-workers treated everyone with respect. I felt an important part of the team. They took questions and feedback better than any other company I have ever worked for. The only reason I had to leave is the boss at the time could not accommodate my scheduling needs for an internship I had to fulfill.
good,"Loved night shifts atmosphere. Full time supervisors kinda sucked, but PT supervisors were awesome. Extremely good pay for the few hours that are worked each night."
good,I enjoyed working at UPS my body just took a beating while i was working there. Overall the pay could have been better but the long term benefits made up for it.
good,Working here as a first job was a great experience. It was stressful because of the amount of volume we had to get through in one shift and you are required to stay till the job is finished. However when i worked here it was 15 an hour and after 5 hours in one day it was pay and a half so at the end of the day it was worth it. I even requested as much hours as I could get.
good,The job was very easy and simple. The most challenging part was the climate inside the trailers and the extremely fast-paced environment. The pay was low but benefits were great.
good,We got in at 3a.m. and right away we started organizing the packages into the delivery trucks. I learned right away it was fast work environment and you had to make sure you follow your managers orders and not injure yourself. Management is so and so meaning they do and don't know what they're doing with their job. The workplace can be friendly. the hardest part is if you make one mistake you get an earful from the driver and manager. the most enjoyable part is making the job fun.
good,Great place to work flexible hours great employees if you needed help they would provide it if possible great pay got paid weekly easy hours great benefits
good,"my day at ups is a workout. I learn how to load trucks the right way."
good,When there is a job to be done it gets done everyone is working together.  The Employees are very kind and helpful. If u need a hand just ask. No job is to hard .
good,Its a great job for college students and just anyone who is willing to work and also a great workout. Hours are early mornings or late evenings. Great for someone who is looking for part time or holiday work
good,"I enjoyed working at UPS. The employees were good people and the environment was good to be at. The building was cool, and you would only get hot when working. The pay was pretty good and also the benefits once you made it full time."
good,"UPS provides movement in the company."
good,Great job to help you stay physically active. Always lifting packages. Managers are really nice. Set work schedule. Training was helpful to learn the job.
good,"The work detail at UPS isn't too challenging mentally but can be physically challenging. The time for reporting to work changes daily due to what workload may be, so your assurance of time may change from week to week."
good,Working at UPS was a nice place to work but in the summer it was too hot and too cold in the winter. My supervisor was a great person to work with. I only work three and a half hours a day. I started working five days a week and was cut to four days a week. They have great benefits.
good,The environment was pleasant in working with other team players in getting the job done. This was a great experience for seasonal work. This can be a stressful job because you have to beat the time to have the trucks ready for delivery.
good,easy job and the environment can be fun at times. sorting packages can get very repetitive but overall its easy once you get used to it. part-time hours are nice because you can easily fit a second job into your schedule or vice-versa.
good,"Loading and unloading packages, as well as sorting packages in a faster pace.  It is a good work place especially for working out."
good,"This was a seasonal job for me. Only made it through the driving academy, but was never placed to work. It paid well for those three days in the driving academy."
good,UPS is fast paced and extremely physically demanding. The benefits you receive out way the stress and good people work in Harrington. After 30 days you become union so you have people who have your back if anything goes wrong. You must be able to get to work On Time and you must be able to wake up & get going Early. Average Start Time is 415am. During Christmas start time can be as early as 1200am. So be ready to be awake and moving.
good,"Great training, options to move up in the company, paid training when necessary. UPS kept up on all rules and regulations, making sure everything was done correctly and in a timely manner. Good company to work for."
good,"As Operations manager with UPS I was responsible for all phases of operations for one of Indiana's largest package delivery centers."
good,"I was there not even 30 days when I was promoted to a different area, and it included a pay raise and opened up more doors to grow as an individual to succeed"
good,"UPS is an over all great company to work for. So many opportunities for advancement, as well as a very diverse atmosphere to work in. Coming in everyday was exciting because no day is ever the same."
good,"azienda seria e con buon salario, buona organizzazione"
good,UPS is a really great place to work. I made many friends and the job builds character. Management and supervision are always there to help and steer you in the right direction.
good,"(Hub) Unload off trucks, sort to new destination, load on trucks.  Breaks dispersed depending on need and volume of product.  Works you hard but full benefits and overtime (some optional, some mandatory)"
good,"Team was very organized, makes things go smoother."
good,Enjoy working at UPS because there is always room to better yourself and they will allow you to take those chances if you'd like too. Would recommend anyone.
good,"I enjoyed working at Ups and with the people as well. They were all amazing people and made me feel comfortable. A typical day at work, I had to wait for our designated plane to arrive, and after taking the van or walking, we would go and fill the plane with cargo. Due to the cargo being over 1500+ pounds, you had to trust and work well with the team you were assigned to. After your team was finished, your day was over and you were allowed to clock out and leave."
good,The work atmosphere there is fast paced with a lot of lifting. If you choose to do the sunrise shift you’ll work from 2:00 am- 8:00am. The breaks are about 30 minutes.
good,"Customer inquiries and consistent phone calls, angry customers hardest part. Drivers sometimes encounter problems delivering which causes extreme hardship for customers. Excellent training prior to going live."
good,"Excellente entreprise, équilibre de vie professionnelle, personnel, avantages sociaux, sécurité de l'emploi, évolution de carrière, management et culture de l'entreprise."
good,Overall a good place too work. Supervisors are flexible and the environment is relaxed. Pay is bad. Promotions dont get you much of a raise either. Small office.
good,"you will get a workout here, and it is extremely fast paced. you will start off with a lower pay and minimal hours but increases in pay and hours will soon be available. great place to work and benefits are awesome."
good,There are a lot of opportunities to advance in the company and being a package handler is step one.  It's physically straining but you don't need a degree in rocketscience to make a decent wage.
good,Just coming out of high school this a great starter job and you could either leave or go to their school to advance higher paying job opportunities within the company itself
good,Great place to work if you are wanting to test your ability in a fast pace work environment. I was always able to enjoy work because of the people and how they all work together.
good,The best part of working for UPS is the benefits.  There is opportunity for advancement.  UPS has a very good education plan.    take advantage and go to school.  After 6months you can apply for other departments.
good,"Normal work experience, but you have to work at a fast past. During peak season the volume cood get to overwhelming numbers and cood be very stressful."
good,Some management are horrible they dont keep their associates occupied or are fair. some are on their phones through out the whole day  on social media ect and they dont say anything towards them. When i get on mine to play music or check an important doctor message i received they tell me to get off my phone.
good,"Shifts were usually 11:00pm/12:00am - 8:00am/9:00am.  Sunday-Thursday.  No dress code (as it was the night shift). "
good,Excelente compañia buen ambiente de trabajo aprendi mucho
good,"Great job, and basically a free gym membership. The faster you work the quicker you can go home. Made great money working as a driver helper durning the holidays."
good,For those looking for a part-time job this is the place to be. You also have the chance 2 lose weight because of the work. If you have no felonies you can get on quick. They pay $10 an hour with yearly raises however benefits you get from UPS are great.
good,"You start off working in a warehouse learning the fundamentals of how the job functions. An employee is given the advantage to progress in the company be it a package car driver, part-time management, or another available position depending upon their degree and inspiration. Through working at UPS I have gained the experience to better manage a group of employees. The management is very helpful in training new employees on how best to perform at their jobs. The most enjoyable part of working at UPS is being able to work with your hands and know that you are affecting the growth of the company even in a small way."
good,Fast paced no time for slackers.   UPS really takes care of the people.   Do your task that is assigned to you come to work you will be fine.   An individual will be able to advance to an other position or go into management.
good,"The pay is excellent .health care is 100 % paid with 100 %coverage.with exception to eye and dental which is about 70%..coverage...pension is outstanding..full package with wages and benefits is worth 130,000 yearly..without a college education I am grateful for the standard of living UPS HAS AFFORDED ME AND MY FAMILY! .the job can be hard on your home life but if you can make it through those years you and your family will enjoy the financial freedom that UPS provides...and now I look forward to a prosperous retirement!...so hang in there all you young drivers.I would consider some cons to be the lackadaisical hiring process/standards, wage determination (set wages per job grade regardless of qualification or experience), some of the politics."
good,"you go, work hard, sweat in heat or cold and might hurt your back if your not careful but the pay is for gas and the benefits are spectacular, better any fortune 500 company i've worked for full-time. unlimited sick days but if your part time you don't get paid if you don't come in but you still get insurance. tuition reimbursement and only a few hours a day"
good,The staff is great but the job wears on you.  Expectations are conntinued to be improved no matter what.  The longer you are there the more slack you have to do whatever you want.
good,its a good opportunity when u taje the time to learn and work hard cause in the long or short tine it could really pay off in the long run but u have to be patient  and willing to learn
good,"Ups is a great place to work. Like all jobs there are pros and cons but, what job doesn't. The work is very fast paced. But very flexible in the jobs they offer. they wlll train you in several job areas to see which area best fits you."
good,"Good benefits,,,organized,, intense. Its a new challenge everyday dealing with drivers and new hires. Ups treat you like family. Also they pay for your education."
good,As a union employee you are well taken care of and compensated. I was offered a management position and accepted. Everything changed when I did because you are no longer a union employee. Not much good to say about them outside the union.
good,I love ups its an great experience I would highly recommend alot of people to go and try to wor there it’s awesome has great working environments Great job.
good,working at ups was a temp job I got a called from USPS and you can not work for both companies so I took the Post office instead of the UPS. The pay was more
good,"Being a seasonal employee, I dealt with customers and moving packages to and from the truck. Safety was number one concern. Was outside all day, which is nice. Decent wage for part-time helper work."
good,"its very fun the people around you are great.the work environment is very cool,fast paced its a job that keeps you busy. you can get frustrated at times but its only temporary"
good,"Working as a package handler at UPS during the twilight shift can vary from time to time. Nights can go smoothly and I'm out before 9-9:30pm and nights can go horrible wrong and I'm stuck til 9:30-11pm or one part of the machine breaks and the building goes into crisis mode (rarely happens). Through the last year and 4 months I've been there I've noticed different things learned different things and understand the shipment system better then i use too. The managers treat you nicely sparking up conversation to get to know you better so you're not just some drone unloading boxes. The benefits are amazing but to get them you have to make it a whole year first. UPS covers Life,Health, Dental,and Vision."
good,Being a package handler at ups is a pretty good gig can be stressful at times but once you get used to it it's not bad at all. Full benefits even for part time employees.
good,My Manager was great  i moved from a temp employee to a asst supervisor in 4 years. Unloaded containers from over seas and loaded trailers for outbound DCs. Drove forklifts to unload and load. I managed all inbound and outbound product for there destination. So much more but do not want to type all day.
good,"Multiple jobs to do at any location.  You can usually find a job that suits your desires.  Very physical, so never any need to join a gym or exercise."
good,"Worked a seasonal position, enjoyed it fairly well. Bursts of fast paced and work at your own speed. Heavy lifting sometimes. Working outdoors, be prepared for some weather."
good,"UPS was a fast paced and high stress job, but I loved the challenge. Everyday started with running reports from the previous work day and reporting to the Hub Manager. I would them get the drivers information distributed to their boxes in a timely manner. After the drivers were off and on the road for that day I was responsible for customer service, which was to answer concerns in a timely manner and locate packages and ensure the proper delivery of them."
good,"I am currently working as a drivers helper, the job role is quite easy and once you know what your doing the job becomes so easy. I would advise any who is looking for a job at UPS to apply asap"
good,Great hourly wage. Great management. Very relaxed work are. Break is an excellent way to meet new friends. The soda and snacks there are very cheap and very filling.
good,Ups has one or if not the best benefits as a job. You can grow in the company. I liked working at ups but you can only work 4-5 hours 5 days a week. Ups is good company
good,I’d recommend to others and friends. This job requires you to work fast and work efficiently. The pay is pretty good for only working 20 hours a week.
good,"UPS is a international Company used for shipping mails and parcels. Excellent company to work for, good management, wonderful employees and a pleasure to work at."
good,"The hardest part of the job may have been the peak season rush, but when worked the correct way with everyone knocking out their task it would run smooth as the ocean."
good,"My job is pretty easy, we just move boxes. Sometimes they can be a little heavy. The people I work with are cool. My boss isn't terrible. And the hours are great for my schedule."
good,After 34 years of service I was able to retire.  Enough said.  Good hard working people.  Everyone wants to provide the best service possible. Buildings are too small to process the volume properly.
good,typical day at work entails ensuring that our workers are practicing the safety protocol set by the company also ensure that us a a team meet or exceed the standards for productivity
good,"I was only there for seasonal, but it was a fun job. I had a great driver on my route. All the customers we delivered to were also pretty nice. The pay could be better since they re a multi billion dollar company, but I was only seasonal, so maybe regular employees are paid better."
good,"Mir ist es wichtig das ein Arbeitgeber seine Angestellen"
good,"Great temporary job, steady work, only negative was fluctuations in schedule, but with Peak Rush, that was to be expected.  At Hermiston location, some newer trucks would've been nice."
good,"I would enter my office look at my calendar for my planned schedule.  Read my e-mails.  Prioritize tasks.  Then, I would travel to the UPS building or Gateway to train or audit.   I would train employee to accept hazardous material packages using IATA, and the 49CFR.  The employees were very hard working individuals willing to learn and do their best every day.   The hardest part of my job was holding upper management accountable for compliance.  I would overcome this hurtle by education each person on the responsibilities and the consequences of not following regulations, rules, and UPS policies.  I loved making the difference and networking with employees and customers.  The more knowledgable a person is the more successful they will be in all they do."
good,"Work mostly on your own"
good,"3 am - 9 am shift, unloaded boxes from semi-trucks on to a conveyer belt. Everybody at UPS was very friendly, it was a good job, just very early hours of work."
good,I enjoy working at UPS the short time i was there and the workers i worked with were really helpful and hands-on overall it was a good experience for me.
good,Pues una empreza ordenada responsable de que los empleados esten conforme
good,"Package handling at UPS is no easy feat, but the feeling you get when a truck finally ships off is the most rewarding feeling ever. It's an excellent way to stay in shape and learn how to do things quickly and efficiently."
good,"Owned a retail/print store which encompassed customer service, printing needs, logistics, packing/shipping, supply orders, mailbox service. Started off as a  manger and was able to buy out previous owner."
good,"This is a very fast pace job with a lot of physical work. You need to be decently in shape to handle the big packages that are thrown at you. Pretty relaxed environment, there are a lot of good times. Get to really know and understand your coworkers."
good,"Fast pace great benefits but management is not all good"
good,"Fast paced enviroment with package handling, learned alot about the company, Great benefits and advancement in career opportunitities. Depending on your shift determines your job description."
good,I personally am content with the job. The management is well-trained and everybody does their job to the best of their ability. Everybody looks out for each other and makes work easier when everybody is doing their part.
good,"You work very hard and get paid very well, benefits are great but way too demanding physically.you lift all day sweat all day and no money in the world is worth having a tough time getting up the next day off your bed."
good,This is a huge company and it can be a very good job if you have the right attitude and outlook. The opportunity for advancement is there if you know what you want to do and possess the drive to get. The benefits are as good as you're going to find anywhere.
good,Ups is an environment all about the numbers. We strive off being #1 in the district at the Hub. We push the limits & meet expectations that weren't even set
good,"Very fast paced and sometimes stressful.  Organized with a lot of available training, Great stock options, excellent benefits, excellent "
good,It was fun at UPS working at Documents Section. Har to work while fasting. Days are too long too fast and work at ups. Documents are always messed up and need to fix and show to the manager.
good,Awesome experience at such a huge business. Trained and interacted with employees to make sure they know the safety guidelines and procedures of the work location..
good,I started as just a seasonal worker and loved it the pay was fantastic in the warehouse even got a raise even though I was only there for a couple months overtime payed great the people ere easy to get along with and shifts ran smoothly when everyone gets their job done i think the problem fits into not into season when fewer people have to do more trucks and advancement should rely on how well you do in the company not how long you have been there.
good,Het was fysiek zwaar werk omdat je vaak zware pakketen moet optillen om het op de loopband te  plaatsen
good,"UPS is a good starter job similar to a warehouse job with similar tasks. Loading, unloading, packaging, sorting and delivering certain packages to the right stores"
good,"Hard work for 4 hours, just think of it as a work out for the day and remember to use your legs and bend at the knee. Gets stressful some times but it's generally a good work environment and you really do start to feel like a team with the right people around you"
good,"Fun place to work but very professional Great opportunity for learning"

I learned how to work as a team, and give assistance to any co-worker as needed to make sure the work flow is smooth and at a success. Management was extremely helpful and knowledgeable if you need any question that was with asked. It was always indoors so you were comfortable with the environment and could always be focused on your duties. The difficulties would be keeping up with work flow if there wasn't enough personnel present for the day. Positives of the workforce was everyone was in a teamwork relationship and got along very easily. Made the work day smooth and end with a success."
good,Working at UPS as a part time supervisor is very challenging but is a great way to gain experience in a leadership position. The pay is good and you get plenty of hours.

good,Each job is different at UPS some jobs are more mentally exhausting some more physically exhausting. Management likes to put blame on you if things go wrong so just make sure everything goes well.
good,"The ability to help the driver deliver packages door to door. This job was fast paced.. I was always on my feet. Overall I loved the job not only was it good exercise, good benefits and good pay"

good,"Should have never left this job. By far, the best corporation and culture I have found in an Information Technology, package delivery, transportation, or logistics industry."
good,The management always look out for their employees and make sure that they are giving their all. So employees are hard to work with and some give their all into what they are doing . I am glad to work their and to say that i was employed at ups.
good,My job at UPS was overall okay experience I really like the weekly pay but I did not like the hours and I did not like the overtime you worked but didn't get paid for your overtime work

good,"I have no major complaints with this company or site. The managers were very friendly, the pay was very good, and the opportunity to advance was great. Sadly, there was too much travel involved. WARNING: This job is very tolling on your body."
good,"If you want a job that gives you time for school this a great option. If you are looking for a career this job is also a great option if you are willing put the time and the effort in to move up. They make it relatively easy to move up to supervisor but to recieve full time hours will take years as a entry level employee or as a supervisor. If you can handle hard work and working with your hands you will thrive in this type of work envirnment. Yearly raises, health insurance, and vacation time is offered after the first year."
good,"I worked here for about a year and a half. Management on Sunrise sort was pretty good. A few difficult supervisors, but, that is to be expected. Follow all safety rules and you'll be fine here. Also, don't expect to move up quickly here. This is a Union Job, promotions are based on Seniority."
good,"While you do have to work the whole time you are there to meet pph,you can still have fun with co-workers. You can be by yourself and not be bothered. you just get to work and it goes by quick. Easy to learn."
good,"If you're just getting out of high school this is a great place to start and if you choose to go to college they'll will work around your schedule and help pay. The only downside working here is being a single person living on one income. The starting pay is low, but if you can hang in there and work hard you'll move up pretty quick."
good,"UPS is one of biggest worldwide parcel delivery company after DHL, and it has very strong management structure and Good pays."
good,"Good Life Balance, but not very good compensation."
good,"My main responsibility is payroll. I also do a lot of Customer Service, following up daily with customers to make sure deliveries and/or pick ups are don't correctly and at the scheduled time."
good,"After clocking in I go to stretch before the shift begins. Then I head to the the sort aisle where I am required to assist other staff with the production line in the factory. Identify items to load and unload from machines, carts and dollies. though on the sort aisle I frequently place items onto conveyor belt for processing all at a very fast pace depending upon the pace of the unloader I'm sorting that day with the assistance of my co-worker I sustain the flow of the belt quite well. Towards the end of the shift I'll organize the product area, sweep, mop and remove debris to prep for the next shift."
good,"This was not my first pic for a job, but I needed a job since I just moved to the area.  It was not as bad as I believed it would be.  They train you on how to properly load (or unload) trailers.  The only down side was the injuries I received (""injuries"" like tendonitis, hay fever, pain in joints, etc.)  None were their fault, it just came with the work environment.  The body wears down after a while no matter what; I recommend to listen to your body and know what is going on.  I also recommend watching out for yourself and then others.  Your safety comes first.  And also, try to have fun with it; make friends, talk to people, get to know the company.  It is a great company to work for, package handling is just a first step to something greater."
good,Loved working there. Great environment. Great pay. Great staff. Wish I wasn't there for just Christmas. There are a lot of great people there.
good,"unloading and loading and working safety around co-workers"

good,"UPS has a great outlook on retaining their employee's and I have loved working for this company over the past 10 years.  "
good,"ups was about the easiest thing, I have ever done. I only worked through the holiday season and the driver I worked with tried his hardest everyday to make sure I made it home in time to put my child to bed at night. when the season was over, I was put on a list as far as to work for them permanent. everyone I came in contact with was very nice"
good,I liked working here because it was challenging . and I met a lot of interesting people. they had great benefits. and everyone was easy to get along with
good,UPS is a nice company to work for they have great benefits and different ways to advance your position in the company. At first it's really hard to get adjusted but over time things become more easier to process and do.
good,UPS store is a productive place to work and develop skills to go far in life. The most enjpoyable part of the job was the christmas season when it is filled with customers. I love the high enerygy that provides in me and makes me work harder.
good,I have enjoyed my experience with UPS. I have worked there for nearly one year as a package handler and supervisor. The workers and management are friendly and always willing to help out where ever needed. Some days are harder than others depending on the package volume for that day.
good,"Everyday consisted of the same routine, getting your trailer done and doing it as fast, yet as efficiently as possible. The days would get hot, and the word would get harder, but it was considered a good workout."
good,"- si llegaban trailers con mucha mercancía pero los empleados se hacían responsables y si los terminaban en buen tiempo"
good,Ive worked for UPS for almost 2 years unloading trucks . Ive become one of the best unloaders in my section. The managers there were great people inside and outside of work . It was a good work environment with great people to talk to . The hardest part of the job was dealing with the temperature. Weather it was 100 degrees or 10 below zero we had to keep on working .
good,Driver's Helper was great and showed me a lot about being a part of UPS and realized it wasn't the path for me with the plans of one day having a family I feel I'd be away from it all too much with the crazy hours you do.
good,"This is a wonderful company to work for. I am PT and have awesome benefits. My benefits include medical, 401(k), pension, vacation time, personal days, and sick time. Management has been great; they have a good attitude toward employees and are willing to teach the necessary skills for my job in a positive way."
good,"I was highroad as a part time employee and worked more than full time employees at times. I was in charge of at least fifteen employees daily. I ran my operation and handled all the day to day duties. I preformed job set up, retrieving of supplies. I worked one on one with every employee. Handle complaints and concerns daily. I was the communication between lower level employees and upper level management. Co workers lacked professionalism, however we relied on each other heavily to complete daily tasks. "
good,"Working with 21-18 union workers. In my certain area I deal with around 20,000-30,000 package on a sort span between 5-7 hours a day."
good,"This is a job only for someone who desires to work. This is a physically demanding job, but is extremely rewarding if you stay with the company long enough. The benefits allow people to stay for many years and retire. The hardest part of the job is the physically demanding demeanor of the job. You must be able to take the hot summer days and the cold winter night because you are working in a warehouse."
good,"I learned what hard physical work meant. It was a great jb, excellent benefits and definitely kept you in shape. The staff were great!"
good,"Working for UPS is what you make it. If you want free health care, weekends off, and part-time hours, it is a great place. Be willing to sweat your tail off and push your body to the limit, however. Advancement opportunities are available to everyone, and it is up to you how fast and far you advance, if desired. There are a few shifts to choose from, so if you have a second job or are in school, it is a perfect job. If you are fortunate to land a full-time management position, be ready for 12 to 14 hour shifts, high expectations, and paying for your healthcare."
good,"The supervisors are great. The job is hard, but if you are fit you will have no problem. Pay is good as well. Great place to work, very much recommended."
good,UPS was a great company to work for. They have wonderful employee benefits. One of the most difficult parts of the company was the fast paced training courses and daily changes.
good,Working here was my favorite. i always enjoyed going to work. the benefits are great and the money is worth it if you dont live too far away.
good,This is a great part time job that I have had the honor of working at for going on 3 years. My co workers are great and we treat each other like family. It is very quick paced and that helps for getting in and out each day.
good,plenty of opportunities to move up in the company. they love to promote within. everyone works together as teams supervisors are very friendly
good,A typical work day includes pulling the package of your assigned trucks which could range from three to four trucks a day. Once you pull your package you place it into the truck in its assigned area. Also you must help your co-workers if they miss a package and they do the same for you. this allow you to work on team building skills and leadership qualities. The job can not be done if everyone isn't working together. Management was great the main concern was making the costumer happy by getting them their package on time. the hardest part of the job was if your truck had to many packages and not enough space but it also helped with patience because you have to take your time and figure things out to make your job easier and also easier for the driver.
good,"watching for boxes to come down on a belt while diverting in to are trailers and use loading them. Knowing how to work with are RF scanner's, building effective wall's for load equality from the front, side and back. Management can some time get on your nerves beacuse of the dissagreement  work flow. Besides all of that the people that works around have great personaility and are fun to work with."
good,"Loading packages into package cars"
good,"very punctual work using exciting equipment's and the companies procedures applied based on the training I received, "
good,A typical day is just to pick up boxes and put them down on a belt. I really just learned how to be safe cause that is really important when working with UPS. the management is great if your in school and you make it in late they will understand because you have another life besides UPS. I really didn't talk to my co-worker because we where placed in different trucks and planes. There is no hard part you just need to know how to lift and lower and be safe. Their is no enjoyable part its work you don't go there to have fun you go to work.
good,"Responsible for loading and unloading boxes on the tucks that weight 70lb or more"
good,"Unloading and loading packages from trucks to delivery trucks. I worked an early morning shift-3:30-8:30 am. I learned zip codes in the Arlington, Texas. I loaded every delivery truck in this Arlington warehouse. The job was very physical, but I enjoyed the hard work."
good,Traveled throughout the Southeast. Opportunity to advance.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of getting up early, getting to work, clocking in, saying hello to the guys, and waiting to hear the pre-shift announcement. This usually included needed improvements or praising employees for their efforts the day prior. We would then get sent to our work areas and begin loading our trucks with the packages that came down the conveyor. The hardest part would have to be when you would have to deal with a ""special,"" which was a large amount of packages going to the same location at the same time. Each day was usually pretty hectic but we were still able to communicate with our fellow employees and supervisors which was nice. Before long, the job was over and you were sent home."
good,"It is a job i would definitely do again. Good pay. You are not stuck in at a desk all day, you get to converse with people and most people you will see daily so you do make friends out on the job. Drivers were nice.The most enjoyable part of the job would be that i am outside all day."
good,"A typical day at UPS consist of a steady and consistent pace as far as working is concerned. I seem to get along with all of my co-workers, we all have a great form of a teamwork effort. The management at UPS are professional and are strict as far as making sure everyone in my department are doing there part as far as completing assigned tasks. The hardest part of this job deals with the seasonal change as far as working in the winter. In the warehouse it tends to reach a very cold temperature which causes my hands to become numb while lifting boxes. What I find most enjoyable about my job is when the company shows employee appreciation by sometimes grilling after we're are done for the day or even bringing snacks during break. This job has taught me a great amount of humility and has shown me an even clearer sense of responsibility."
good,its alot of teamwork everyone works as one unit its a great work out
good,"Very fast paced environment, very little training given and expect you to know every thing with that training."
good,"While working at UPS, i gained a lot of time management skills and learned to work under pressure. This has also helped me become more organized"
good,"Job with great benefits. A very helpful staff, and dependable managers."
good,A great place to work not for pay but for benefits. Also the benefit package is great for families.
good,A typical day at work was cold and busy. I learned nothing in this world can get in your way but yourself. The hardest part of the job was working in the snow because I'm not a winter type girl but I had to get the job done and that I did very well. The enjoyable part was meeting new people.
good,"Not so easy to work inside truck to unloading the packages. You will have 40 days training once hired. Best suggested for high physical human being. Pass over 1200 packages per hour before 40 days expires. After training, keep flow up your strength, stamina, and ability while working inside truck to unloading the packages. Only most safety tip, try not to get injure by do wrong ways, simply do right ways what no matter how are you working."
good,unloading i would have to lift 1400 boxes an hour lift bulk  bend my knees lifting every box for support  sorting i would have to lift box with serten codes an put them in the same code section over an over

Safe work methods help from management when needed. coworkers are freindly and get along with well. hardest part of work is lifting 100 plus lbs packages.as with any work most enjoyable is going home."
good,Had help when needed and always motivation to safely and fast pace work
good,Great company that provides work/life balance opportunity. Corporate and Region level support for injury prevention and health promotion activities. Limited promotion opportunities for Nurse position.
good,"A typical day at ups is you work hard and you do a high volume of packages that i have to sort around the building."
good,"The hardest part  about this job, i learning to hustle as well as learn the tasks at the same time. My coworkers were very helpful in aiding with my training in the Mezz. Most of the time they took the initiative to teach me different skills before management even asked them. The most enjoyable part about  the job was was correcting people's addresses, it made me feel as if I was making someone's day easier.  The management was supportive and would always look for ways for us to improve our numbers and would encourage us when the numbers were low, I learned time management and patience at this job, due to the daily tasks I was given."
good,The employees were great to work with. It was like a family atmosphere. Benefits were awesome.
good,"It's a very physically intensive job, with poor shelter from the weather. You are expected to show up to work even if the roads are iced over, however many do not, and there is no punishment for not showing up.  If you don't mind hard labor, and having management that likes to yell, then its a great job. You just go into work, load or unload packages then go home 4-5 hours later. The pay is great, the benefits for part-time labor are probably unmatched, but when I was working there, you didn't get benefits until you worked there at least 6 months. Automatic raises and a few very quick dollar raises to start with."
good,Everyday is a busy day at UPS. My co workers are very friendly and are easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job is being able to keep up with the packages on the conveyor belt. The best part of the job is that when I deliver I get to see/meet different people everyday.
good,The UPS store is a great place to work. Nothing too difficult once you learn the different packing and shipping methods.
good,get to work get assigned a truck and load till its filled. Unloading on to conveyor till trucks is complete.
good,"This was a very good company to work for. It let me balance my home and work life. The management team was very open to new ideas, they where understanding, and very helpful. I enjoyed working with my co-workers, they made it a fun and pleasent place to work. The hardest part of my job was getting use to working in the heat during the summer months."
good,"Review and Print paper work for management in the morning, and data correction. I pretty much work by myself at night."
good,its a good company to work for if u are in school and need a good part time job
good,Steady union company that has good benefits once you work for a year. You can get tuition reimbursement the minute you start.
good,"Union employees can be hard to work with as management sometimes but we still build each other up by setting goals and being rewarded for reaching them. I have learned how to effectively motivate employees with different personalities to all achieve the same goals. The most difficult part of my job is the physical strain as this is an extremely fast-paced and the hours aren't so great. Meeting goals, that don't seem attainable at first, is one of the best feelings."
good,"A typical day at UPS as a seasonal worker was this; wake up, work harder than you ever have in your life, go home, then come right back a couple hours later. It teaches you how to be on time and what makes a true hard worker. My coworkers were fun for the most part But you only see them about once a day depending on how you performed at work. If you had to reload the truck and you were late, you might not see anyone but your driver. If you're early: same thing. But if you're on time, you'll be everyone but you still cant socialize because work needs to be done. The hardest part of the job was physical. As a helper, you're carrying a 30-70 lbs box(es) from truck to destination (no matter how far) and the entire time you have to run because There Is No Down time. I was exhausted, and so tired but I couldn't stop. I will never stop until I reach my goals. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting my check every week. I love weekly pay and the salary was nice and sometimes that kept me going. Money means I'm one step closer to college and one step closer to my dreams."
good,This is a fast-paced work environment with great people and many opportunities for advancement and different types of career paths.
good,"For me this employers treats employees very fairly,The management was so Great, we treat its other like family.were having a good time everyday.Co workers are great..For me.. honestly if you work together helping together, is the most enjoyable part of the job.."
good,-The management is very good to the employees except when they're power hungry.
good,"great pay, minimal management, and awesome benefits. beware of working seasonally though. i was told there would be strong chance to become full time. after earning the position, i was told that there unfortunately weren't any current openings."
good,"Very phisical job, worked 5 days a week 4-5 hrs a day. Had to be extremely flexible with your shape, able to lift 75 lbs."
good,hard work but I had an issue with the company. The benefits are amazing though.
good,"New challange evry day , work safe ,fast and right that was the best , the thank you that I was getting from the drivers evry day was the pain relief for me ."
good,Ups is in my heart a excellent place to work and start building a good work ethic.
good,ups had several programs for people to further their education and opportunties to become managers
good,"Greeting customers is my first part of the day. If anyone needed to pick up a package, it was my duty to track it down and find it. It wasn't always easy but it was rewarding. What I liked about this job was that my co-workers and supervisor all put in the same effort so no one gets left behind."
good,had to wake up 3 in the a.m. We on 18 wheelers unloading boxes non stop for an hour straight.

good,"Fun company to work for. It was very easy. Great hours. I would have stayed, however I needed a higher salery. Management was great."
good,Great company to work for . The hard & dedicated work is just a gift . You want something go get it attitude here is a plus .
good,A typical work day starts at 4 a.m. That is the hardest part of the day for me is getting up so early. Upon arriving the trucks need to be checked for packages to be sent and then notify your supervisor. Once the buzzer sounds the belt starts rolling and I sort through the packages locating my packages for my three trucks. Loading them as quickly as possible in the correct place on the truck and get right back to the belt to catch the next set of packages coming my way.
good,Boxing and shipping
good,"UPS has a consistent work flow, laoding heavy boxes in a strategic manner. I would have to say compared to previous employers that UPS has the greatest management crew, caring, organized, and avaliable when needed. They always stress safety first!"
good,A typical day at UPS is nicely paced.
good,"Great place, Great benefits, great shift, tuition reimbursement, advancement opportunities."
good,"Cool an alright place to work at. Sometimes hot and sometimes cold, but the most part teamwork was a must."
good,"Discipline, Integrity, and Personal Courage was instilled early on and it is still deeply rooted."
good,United Parcel Service produces many great opportunities . If enough time is invested within the company there are many opportunities for promotions. Managers Respect employees and they are treated equally. Benefits are great and UPS will pay for your education. Job security is great with the company. Work and personal life can be balanced due to the work schedule.
good,"Their benefits are great. They do offer union and 401k which are way better thank any other company I’ve ever worked for. Also, they take care of their own."
good,I loved working there because of my coworkers the working conditions were really bad and the facility was old so rain would drop on you while you load
good,"UPS and FedEx was the same duties. FedEx is more up to date with equipment, cleaner environment and more organized. UPS was a self motivated job that was fast paced. Physically you had to be ready for the job and I was everyday."
good,"I had a great experience working at UPS"
good,UPS has a great opportunities for advancement. You are expected to work hard and with others to achieve the necessary results . The educational work program is second to none .
good,"Was a good pay for a starting job or seasonal but sometimes the work will be tough on your body big time so be ready for those days. Also some days were so busy we don’t get breaks, if we did breaks were only 10 minutes."
good,"This was the perfect job for me unfortunately it was only seasonal. They pay every week, with direct deposit that’s every Thursday(: The hours are extremely flexible. Wonderful job for anybody conisidering."
good,"As an employee of Ups I’d say the job is fairly difficult. Physical and mental strength is recommended on another level. It’s hard, but the money is what makes it worth it in the end, and that’s what I’m all about. Money."
good,"I loved working for UPS, they were great with Training and supporting the teams. The one thing I didn’t enjoy was only having 4 weeks holiday. It’s a very heavy and physical job, and I think another few days would have been good,"
good,"Working as a Driver Helper was enjoyable. The position involved meeting the driver at a designated point, riding with them, and walking packages to residences and businesses. It was somewhat strenuous, but I was accustomed to working in frigid conditions while maintaining a walking pace."
good,"i have been at UPS Dordon for 2 months or little more i found the job to be very fast paced which is expected. The best advice i can give to anyone looking to work as a parcel sorter/loader would be if you like physical work and have patience can work as part of a team and being able to employ common sense and can adapt to changing conditions you will enjoy working at UPS . oOn the other hand if you have a short fuse are not very active this definitely is not the placr for you as with all busy work environments being a team player and having the ability to recognise that everything you do will have an impact on  not only your team(section) but everything and everyone else including yourself  Thats basically the environment at Ups. (One thing to bear in mind there are people who have worked there for years but the majority will be  new and inexperienced.  due to the nature of job and also the in-house employment/promotion environment which is a bonus if you are looking to further your career at UPS."
good,Needs work on building . But I hope one day it could be better than it was and maybe I could get my job back so so soon. Ps I mr walk it how lllll loves ups in griffin

good,"For the competitive more athlete type of person, Its chaos and very fast paced. I seen the line break people, and I also seen People take on the challenge get paid and get in shape. Hardest part is remembering which zip codes go where. other than that, fun place to work"
good,A typical day at work was not knowing how many of hours we would work daily due to the work load for the client we were working for.  The workplace was pleasant employees worked together to get the job done in a timely manner.  I’ve learned you have to stay focused on what your job is daily to get the job done right the first time. Working with many different nationalities was a good experience and learning their culture
good,"Only problem I had was too much taxes taken out my check but the environment, people, the work it w,as tough but left a great feeling of satisfaction."
good,"I have worked here about 6 weeks. I had great training, there is room to grow almost immediately, my leads and managers are easy to work with as well as helpful. The only complaint i would have are these: sweating all day in the heat,  no sitting  allowed at your station,  sometimes the equipment  craps out on you."
good,"If you can handle hard work, early hours, hard work, getting dirty, hard work, lifting heavy items and hard work, then this job is for you! I personally love it!"
good,"Everyday is different. But it's also challenging. I try to push myself to new limits. I want to be Great in every aspect. I learned how to load trailer, I have become one of the best loaders in Our Facility. I've loaded 2025 packages, (Not to Toot My own Horn). I try to enjoy every part of the day.

good,"Working here was fun. Surprisingly I got the advantage of working for the small sort department. This wasn't as bad as loading and unloading although some days I did have to participate and help out with the trucks when certain areas were short staff. In conclusion, small sort was a fast paced yet an easy and cool environment. Managers weren't all that bad."
good,Family friendly and very helpful.  Team work and good coordination of employee with management.  The staff was patient and supportive during training.
good,usually what i would start doing is going into a certain unload area and start unloading a truck. I would have a certain time limit to get the truck done with the help of someone else.
good,I really liked working here just good people minding their  business and getting there own work done because it’s such a fast past environment you don’t have time to converse before it’s time to clock out
good,Demanding work considering physical state. You'll be working through hot and cold days no matter what. Making sure you keep up the pace of the trailer flow will make your job and everyone's job easier
good,hard working environment with a caring feeling from the other employee's helping with any questions that i would have at work the hardest part of work is making sure that we get all the packages out to make sure the customers are happy and the most enjoyable part is connecting with employee's to make the job a little more enjoyable to go every day.
good,just working with packages waking up every morning early bad mangment great job if you would like to drive in the future .and always keep track of your hours at ups
good,"I loved my job at UPS mainly for the tuition reimbursement! But there is so much more. The hours are extremely flexible, and everyone there genuinely wants to see you do well at your job."
good,"Be very cautious of the work place,it's 24/hour working place,a lot of vehicle and a huge conveyor,we had a safety training especially lifting and safety,a continuous"
good,Working at ups is a big job. U have to have strength and be quick on your feet. It’s basically a big game of Tetris when scanning and loading. It’s almost like a family when one is falling behind someone will immediately help you get back on track.
good,The job gave me a better outlook on life . A hard worker is very well appreciated and will be blessed with promotional as well as growth opportunities within the company . Consistency and teamwork is key
good,"Friendly enviroment, fast paced, you receive good pay and excellent benefits, people there are friendly. You have a Hershey park day every year where the park is closed to the public and you get discounts on tickets for that trip"
good,People was very nice to work with worked as a team always made the work place fun to work at gave gifts and food for break time offer more work to make more money
good,A typical work day at UPS was good i had to be at work at 8 am that was not bad. The learning experience there was good my first i was moving fast to deliver those packages that was my was first like that you have move quickly because you had to deliver the packages several time deliver to the customer in time.
good,"As I worked for UPS I enjoyed the company of my coworkers and management making the environment fun and productive. At times it could be stressful during the peek season due to high demands of packaging. This stress was easily eliminated by the friendly competition, such as who has the best package per hour."
good,"Work well with others, clerical duties, providing feedback, computer skills, great tolerance for stressful situations. ability to type 50 WPM. Not enough hours during the week working part-time."
good,"It was friendly,safe and most of all work friendly great place well run by the mangers and supervisors the trainers was excellent and co workers too yes"
good,the manger at ups are wonderful. they are willing to work with people to fit their mission. The con of working at ups is that you are always on feet and dont expect to make money
good,"If you like working with very little interaction with other people then this is a good place to work.  Each position is supervised but once you start working you are primarily on your own.  You could very easily get moved around from position to position when you first start.  Once you work for around a year you get to choose a new, somewhat permanent, position as the positions open up according to seniority.  You can choose from multiple shifts and that will be your shift unless you ask for it to be changed."
good,"Ups is a fun and friendly environment to work.Usually real busy around holidays but has a great way of dividing work so it doesn't just fall on one person. Flexible hours, paid vacation time, and good salary. Also lots of career advancement opportunities available."
good,You load a lot of packages a day.  I learned how to load a trailer properly and how to properly lift a package. The management was excellent. The culture was great.
good,Being a UPS driver was very demanding physically and mentally. But it was worth it. It is a great company where you can have a great future making great money.
good,It was a really relaxed yet exciting place to work. Always had something new coming in the door to do. The management and ownership can not be described in words. Amazing people and family all around. Treats people with the utmost respect and compassion in all areas. I will surely miss them.
good,It is very fast paced. Don't expect high weekly pay or breaks. UPS is meant for college students who need the benefits and pay.  Advancing can be quick but you won't be full time till at least 10 years.
good,"UPS is hard at first but once you get the hang of it, it gets easier, especially if you're a loader/unloader. Management is understanding and good to work with. They're very flexible with how you work when you first start. The workplace culture is kind of sad and depressing but it's only that way because everyone is focused on doing their jobs as fast and as much as possible. Honestly it's a very fast paced and heavy workload, but if you're a hard worker and like focusing on your work with the help of your co-workers then I would recommend UPS."
good,"My experience is good with UPS, just seen some partiality with favoritism and for change of work environment, with seeking high-up in salary decided to look other opportunity's"
good,"good salary and good overtime,good hours,but was only part time without benefits. Bad  they always called at the last minute without notice about any changes."
good,"Come in and obtain truck number, start the belt, sort boxes and mail, assigned to truck number and sort in truck. Management was fine, never any problems, and helped when needed. Diverse workplace, the most hardest part was taking"
good,was fun place to work. enjoyed the culture.  fast paced. safety is number 1.  everyone is treated fairly.  Full time cadillac plan benefits for putting in part time hours. awesome place to work.
good,"If you can handle a job that is very physically demanding, you might survive.  Working as a loader or unloader in a hub is very fast-paced and stressful. I lost 50 pounds in the first 6 months I was there.  Most employees don't last that long, to be honest.  If you stick it out, you can advance within the company and make a great salary. It's union--unless you go the managerial route--and there are great benefits."
good,"typical day at work is your busy the whole time get no breaks, you learn good work ethic working at ups the hardest part of the job is doing what your suppose to the whole time, there is no really enjoyable part exept when you find out your shift is over"
good,"The position is very demanding.  A very face pace environment. I have the opportunity to work with a diverse group of people. I travel a lot.  The hardest part of the job is making changes at a second notice.   You are given a small amount of time to react to changes."
good,The only hard part about the job is lifting heavy packages other than that it's a easy day but most importantly the place teaches you about teamwork and hard work pay off
good,"Loved working there, good people and atmosphere. The benefits were awesome. The supervisor's always there to help you and show you safer and better ways of doing your job."
good,"Part time hours with full time benefits.  Easy work for most, very physical.  Plenty of overtime available during peak seasons.  Special benefits for students."
good,The job was fun workable but it was. A part time job and the pay rate was no a lot. We was only getting bout 20 hours per week. So its was like I was making nothing.
good,"Great pay, Great benefits easy job. just very boring. Training was not the most informative. If you can make it past 7 months then the job will be easy. anything under you will be confused."
good,process and assit with making sure packages are going to the right customer. making sure we provide 100% customer satisfaction. working hard as a team player.
good,Definitely a job where you will excel if you want to work hard.excellent scheduling options and fun people to work with . Ups feels like a family. Great managers
good,"Loading and unloading 18 wheeler trucks. I will started off loading and eventually, I switched to loading. I was responsible for scannings the correct zip codes on every package, before loading them on the truck. And I had to load up to 4 to trucks a day from 11am to 6pm. And I made a lot of overtime."
good,"I enjoyed working at this job during the winter season. It was rewarding because I made people happy with each delivered package!! Since it was Christmas season, kids would watch you to see if they could intercept their presents."
good,"This is a very physically demanding job. You will go home tired/ sweaty etc.. but if you stick it out it will pay off when you become a driver. The money isn't the best for the beginning, but every year you'll earn a 50 cent raise."
good,"Great Job, Wish job advance was more better. It's hardworking and great work environment. Like working there it offers me a great work resume and chance to increase my job promotion."
good,"Once I became management, I really enjoyed my job at UPS. I was a training supervisor, teaching new hire how to properly load and work safely. hot in the summer and cold in the winter."
good,"Small package and supply chain are great places to work.  Solid job security, competitive pay, great benefits.  Freight left a lot to be desired.  I regret ever taking a position there.  Management has not caught up to the UPS culture there."
good,They treat you well. A lot of great benefits. Work area is enjoyable. Employees are great partners. Management is very caring about you. I will recommend a lot of my own family to this job but I will tell you it's not easy.
good,It was working night in the Hub.  There not much more to say.  So I'm going to type random things so here to I can move on to the next part the process on here.
good,"Physical, fast-paced, outdoor position that involves continual lifting, lowering and carrying packages that typically weigh 25 - 35 lbs. and may weigh up to 70 lbs. It requires excellent customer contact skills and a lot of walking."
good,Working​ here was great however the position was part-time. I was working as hard as ever but they let me go to bad so sad. What's meant to be will be!. UPS is still awesome.
good,UPS is a very active job. The hours we great but working in the winter time was really harsh. I gained lots of experience and appreciate it greatly because now I know what they go through. Overall id work here again.
good,"a typical day at work is working in a hot or cold trailer."
good,Working at UPS has showed me how to use my body to help me get the job done without hurting myself. If you are lucky enough to have a fun and talkative group working with you it can make for a enjoyable work environment.
good,"I got hired right away. They also reimbursed me for my time, travel, hotel stay and meals, and work training!! Wonderful things to learn, not just about the company, things I could apply to my life and children. I drove truck for the peak season and am now working the clerk counter. Im happy with any position within UPS. And I'm completely happy with the location/center that I am employed at. Everyone takes pride in their job ajd responsibilities within our UPS family."
good,"I enjoyed working at UPS as an admin. Its a very fast paced yet laid back atmosphere. All management were very knowledgeable, helpful and personable. The compensation and benefits were satisfactory. There was nothing about the position or company that was intolerable. The only things I would complain about would be that there are no full-time positions and that you are working in a enormous building where if its hot or cold outside then it is the same inside which sometime became uncomfortable. Also the hubs are very dirty and infested with mice which I understand is unavoidable in a warehouse type setting."
good,"Some days the work is tough but just having good people around makes things easier. The healthcare is pretty good. The month of December is usually pretty hectic, they hire seasonal workers to help out. Usually stress free for hourlies unless you take on responsibilities."
good,"Good union job. Supervisors could use some leadership training but overall good job. Employee working conditions needs improvment, exposure to elements and Winter time its cold inside and Summer time its hot inside."
good,"Easy work to do not a lot of hours, but if you learn a lot you get paid a lot, and also if you stay a fews years you'll make a lot of money. Management is okay. Fun co-workers. Hardest part of the job is not getting a lot of hours from the beginning. The job is very easy."
good,I really enjoyed working here. Everyone was friendly but here and then the team leader would be a b**** even though she did f*** all
good,Day went by super fast really fast paste and was an awesome place to work in great people funny bosses it was just awesome great coworkers who help one anotyher theyer a team
good,"working for ups is a great career to start off with. A typical day at work is quite simple for a driver to get his or her shift started. If you are a commercial driver you are expected to have 1 specific route that you are assign to and you deliver packages daily and collect pick ups. The management works with you very well and there are very little mistakes with the pay roll system. Most of the employees are friendly and easy to work with, there are some that rather work alone. What I've learned from working with a Worldwide company is that you meet a lot of people they provide great benefits and they have a lot of flexible hours."
good,This seasonal job was a little hard for me because of the cold weather and having to be dropped off on every block in the freezing cold
good,I loved knowing what to expect when coming to work. There was a lot of orgainization and team work being administered. I was paid on time and I knew my job and was able to complete my task in a timely manner.
good,"fun places, free meal, cash bonus awards and beside good reationship with my cooworkers an managers, Id livke to help customers with problems to find the packages."
good,"I love my job, I learned to track packages, how the healthcare market get specimen picked up. I learned more about excell and access."
good,"I love my job at UPS, the only issue is working as an auditor the shifts are only three hours per night which is not enough for me to live on. I enjoy working here however I need an extra salary. A typical day at work is just meeting the quota of auditing at least 160 packages on average. I learned how to audit and why we audit as a company. My management is great and organized. My co-workers are nice. The hardest part of the job is the minute amount of hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is it in it's entirety I love it."
good,"The typically day at work was communicating, assisting, and being accountable in a team working environment. I continue to learn how to take initiative when my workload was decreasing, how to communicate with diverse personalities, how to encourage safe and effective performance from co-workers. Management is always exceptional and improving. My co-workers maintained good attitudes. I enjoyed my duration from start to finish."
good,Unload 56 ft trailers in a timely fashion with a hub provided conveyer belt and company appointed gloves. It was a seasonal job so it didn't last as long as Id liked.
good,"I have fallen in love with this company, great work environment and great benefits. Family life not so great but over all a great place to start a career."
good,"A typical day at work is busy depending on days & delays "
good,It was great for the hours I could work that were opposite of my son's mother. We were able to have him all day without a babysitters care.
good,"Good work, good benefits, part time work for full time pay.  I worked mostly alone on the evening shift and sometimes worked on the counter and with customers and other employees."
good,"As long as you're not enrolled in the college program this job is great, you're not over worked and the benefits package is one of the best on the market."
good,"During a typical day I would clock in roughly fifteen minutes before start time , to ensure that I had enough time to stretch , fill my water bottle , and set up my scanner. Then at start time the bell would go off and I would go do my load assignments. Keeping a productive pace I would load the boxes that were in one trailer then go to the next and repeat. Whenever a trailer was getting lots of flow the trailer name or number would be called out by a sorter. Supervisors were there to help push stuck packages down the rollers and motivate you to keep pushing. Some team members were not as productive as others witch made the atmosphere tense sometimes, because it effects the other team members. If the job wasn't done on time we had to stay until the job was finished. After all the packages were loaded , team members had to shut the trailer doors and take misplaced packages to the miss-load belt. After all of that we clocked out. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the heat. Our building was not air conditioned and I worked on the west side of the building so it got miserable at times. And the most enjoyable part of the job was joking around with my co workers . They made the job fun and really knew how to motivate struggling team members."
good,"A typical day at work consist of working 4-5 hours in the morning with a 15 min break halfway through the day trying to get everything done so the drivers can leave out in time. I have learned that you have to cover yourself in the environment because you can get seriously injured if nonchalant. The co workers will look out for you a few times a day if you're slacking because it will slow the company down and you will definitely get behind. The hardest part of the job is lifting heavy packages, putting them in the right places on the delivery trucks (mostly requires two people for this) because you may have to walk a little distance with the package. The most enjoyable part of the job is peak season salary, you can make a living off of it by yourself during late OCT. to early Jan."
good,"Not easy. Is very big company, but if you need to do a different staff because your health or something like that, they don´t do nothing for you, instead your pregnant"
good,Since working at UPS I have learned how to direct hourly employees and speak to others in a way that will accomplish any and all required job tasks. The hardest part of the job was developing a critical eye and spotting trouble areas and dousing them before they had an opportunity to flourish.
good,"A typical day at work consist of 5 to 6  work shift with included pay for overtime. I've learned that UPS is not required to release you do to transportation if you ride the bus; Ups can work with employees who ride bus lines to a certain level. Management are filled with great wonderful workers who ensure everyone are feeling great."
good,Very fast paced job but once you get going the shift blew by. The hours that a loader works is only 3 and a half hours a day so its needless to say that paychecks weren't all that good. But the insurance benefits were second to none.
good,"As part-time management, lots of audits, reports and paperwork. It is a fast paced work environment. Management is great, but as it is anywhere, management focuses on the things you do wrong, as opposed to praising you for doing a good job everyday."
good,"a good place to work "
good,everyday i learned something new.i wish this it could've lasted long but sadly it was season. i would work with this company again once i get the opportunity in the future
good,"I really enjoy to work for this company, busy mornings loading trucks, reading shipping labels. friendly co-workers."
good,I enjoyed making sure that customers receive their items on time.
good,UPS is a very energetic and exciting environmet. this job is very low hour job but pays great for how easy the job is and has great benifits when you pass 90 days. co-workers dont communicate much but the managers tend to every need in the warehouse and are very successful at doing so.
good,4 hour work day on night shift. Sort and ship glasses and contact lenses to Wal-Mart stores across U.S. Job isn't difficult at all. Anyone can fully catch on within 2 months.
good,I loved working in a high paced environment and building relationships with people.
good,"i would work night shifts from 11 to 4 or 5 the pay wasnt all that good when i started but over time my checks started to increase, the hardest part of the job is peek season..."
good,"Très bon équilibre entre vie pro et perso."
good,"Great early morning workout, feels more like a gym membership than a job."
good,This was my first ever place of employment. It is a good stable company to work for. With many opportunities to move up or advance. Also providing a good work out.
good,its a hard job but the hours are good for school and its like getting paid to go the gym.
good,"At UPS, you work hard and earn your pay. Every job is challenging. From package handler to operations supervisor, you come to work everyday with your game face on and muscle through the operation. After a period of time, you learn different techniques to improve your production. I thought it was a great place to work, unless you were blessed with a bad supervisor, then your day/night was not so great. You had to develop teamwork within your group or you were fighting an uphill battle throughout the operation. Fortunately, I had great management and co-workers which made my time at UPS great."
good,"union job, management vs union culture, if you politic you will go far in the company, coworkers were cool"
good,"Scanning international packages in computer system it was interesting. The learning experience was interesting, got to learn about different international zip codes and improve on my typing skills. My co-worker were cool they nice to get along with made some nice friends. I feel the hardest part of that job was standing on your feet the whole 6 hours but after awhile you get use to it. The most enjoyable part was get to work with the people that I meet there it made the job go by fast to me."
good,Its a very good place to work benefits are very good its not full time job
good,Room for advancement and they really care about their employees.
good,"My shift starts at 4:00 PM and I do all of my pre processing, Setting up the cash register and figuring out the incorrectly addressed addresses. from 4:30-6:00 I run the customer counter helping customers with their shipping and receiving needs. After the counter is closed I count down the register and send away the the profit to the cash receiving location. After counting down the register I audit the international packages making sure that they comply with the DOT rules and regulation. During this time I also help process the air shipments making sure that the air truck leaves the center at 8:00 pm. When the air is finished I address correct the packages that I processed earlier double checking and calling people with addresses that I am unsure of and need verification to ensure that corrected the address is right. This is finished around 9:00 pm and at this time I email all of the invoices of the from the evening to the international receiving location in Lenexa. When that task is finished, usually around 9:30, I go and sort the ""smalls"" packages by zip code so that we can send them where they belong. this is finished usually around 10:30 and then the shift is over."
good,"Working with UPS was a learning experience. I worked a seasonal position there and I learned a lot about working in Human Resources. I wanted to gain a permanent position from this opportunity but because of downsizing after the season there was nothing for me to do in the department. A day in the HR department was very eventful, from answering calls, redirecting calls, greeting employees and future employees, scheduling interviews and orientation and distributing uniforms and checks. Towards the end of the season I was receiving uniforms and making calls for non working employees to come back and turn in their uniforms. I enjoyed always having something to do, there was never a dull moment. There was nothing that I really considered hard about the job. Every job has its moments both good and not so good but that again was a learning experience."
good,"Hard work daily but not to much, i learned how to stack &pack boxes according to size & weight of the package, The managers are helpful & understanding. My coworker were also helpful in the work place. The hardest part of the job is carrying the E-regular packages by yourself because the E-reg packages are 70 pounds & over. The most enjoyable was getting along with my supervisors & co-workers being in a comfortable work place really help me do my job better."
good,"good atmosphere my coworkers are great to work with"
good,"I really enjoy work at UPS, it is not just a safe place to work, but also fun and very fast paced area. I've have learned numerous independent and team work skills. the hardest part is preventing jams, at the same time maintain etiquette egress. The management here phenomenal, the managers/supervisors are very supportive and perform their job to the maximum."
good,UPS is an awesome job if your looking for fast paced and a good workout. Management and co-workers are nice. Hardest part of the job is keeping up your package speed. Most enjoyable besides pay day is the workout :)
good,How UPS does their day to day delivery and got to meet with some great people in the neighborhood
good,"over 30 years experience in transportation business looking for dispatch position, have worked in 3rd party logistics for fed ex, apl logistics, carrier corp, worked in management at ups freight and retired, "
good,"Great job, with great sociables co-workers, very nice management to work with, I had a good supervisor that became a great friend."
good,Train and supervise daily activities of package handlers and clerks to ensure that all assigned duties are accomplished safely and timely.
good,"UPS proved to be a great place to work for the time that I was there. A typical day in the life of an OMS was fast paced from the moment you walk in to the moment you walk out. Office Management Specialists have to handle customer related issues, driver issues, management issue, payroll, corporate customer needs and a myriad of others things that might come up in your day. I learned a lot about conflict management, customer service, and corporate environments."
good,my job is pretty simple.i just sort packages i do address corrections.
good,Fast paced work environment
good,"Very good place to work, great benefits and pay. This job is a keeper , don't join the army and think you will come back with a job though."
good,"My overall view of United Parcel Service was a high volume, very busy atmosphere. I generally worked only 3-4 hours a day, as a part-time employee."
good,Working at UPS was an educational experience. They teach you about the system and how packages get delivered to millions of Americans everyday.
good,Enjoyable atmosphere along with great people to meet everyday productivity levels in a warehouse environment. Benefits are exceptional and weekly pay is a plus. Physical demand keeps you in great shape as well.
good,Good job to work at great benefits like my hours overnight & great people to work with & u get along with everyone most part is I like loading packages
good,This job is very challenging but so worth it in the end it's a great part time job keeps you in shape  supervisors treat you like family in there very helpful when help is needed
good,"Manager wasn’t to nice, some one the workers were really annoying and didn’t help, but a lot of them helped out and got the job done on time, even though the semi would run late almost everyday"
good,My day would start with getting to the building and going out with my driver. I would ride around with him and deliver whatever packages he gave me at that stop.
good,My time working at Ups was excellent. I wish I could’ve stayed longer than I did but I was only seasonal. I definitely would like to return if possible.
good,"Okay place to work for the money and benefits, I worked there for about 8 months and honestly wasn’t a bad job. Nice people and helpful trainers. Would recommend."
good,I love working there because it gives you that pumped up energy first thing in the morning. Imagine working somewhere that fully wakes you up before you go anywhere and actually look out for your future. That’s UPS.
good,Very good experience. Learn something new every day. Fast pace. Early morning start time. Working with different level of coworkers. Not hard work. Keeping focus at all times.
good,If you are individual that doesn't enjoy is a cool activities or can withstand harsh weather conditions this would not be a good fit. But overall friendly understanding management team.
good,Everything is going great except for the fact that they are taking 20% for taxes. They need to fix the problem or a lot of people are going to become extremely unset
good,"A typical  day at work is you chilling out of the man cave and come to the abarbanel Warehouse."
good,"Package handler, averaged 1,000-1,500 package scans a night. Hard work, very fast paced. Teamwork/ teamlifting is involved. Depth of Knowledge keys always required at all times"
good,great review i liked the fast paced work environment and everyone was always in a good mood. very good people and everyone works together nothing more to ask for
good,"Working at UPS is amazing. However if you work as a ramp or sort employee you risk your life working there. You typically work for 3-4 hours unless otherwise. I work as a part time day ramp employee. I work outside with planes which could get really loud. I marshal planes that are arriving or departing which is really cool and scary. You have to make sure you can see the pilot or else something bad may happen. Anyways, they have really great benefits. The employees who work there all care about you and your safety, they just have different ways to show it. It may be scary at first but the longer you stay, the easier you realize the job is. They do call you out if there is not much work to be done which could either be a good or bad thing. I, however need more hours so that would be the only con I have."
good,"Typical work day consisted of assisting customers and drivers with any problem that arises. The OMS is the link between the customer and the driver and has been called ""The backbone"" of the company. Could sometimes be stressful depending on the situation. Takes a lot of quick thinking and improvising to meet the customers needs as well as making sure the drivers workload is completed in a safe and timely manor."
good,Be careful and know your five C’sOh boy oh my boys my boss is excellent Very friendly coworkersI have no problem with anybody in the Blu My jobI like the fact that we can take a break why I like checking  for the trucks Numbers and check in a perimeter and best of all ally getting off work
good,When you come to ups you work no slacking off. You work for the money for the company. You can have a great career with UPS if you get your work in order and do what you gotta do in a good timely manor
good,"Arriving to work on a normal they was like any other. I would go through security and then I would clock in. After clocking in I would go to my work area. When I first started off on the job I was kind of just observing learning what to do or how to do what while working. For example one thing I learned was the appropriate way to lift the boxes. If you are lifting wrong you may go home with back pains. When it came to my manager it was if I didn't have one; management was poor. The hardest part of the job was loading. When loading the trucks you have to make sure you are stacking the packages the correct way if not everything will come tumbling down. The most enjoyable part of the job was your fellow employees. Getting to work with new people and meet new people is always a good thing, also when working as a team you tend to get the job done best."
good,Everybody at my location is chill. They get along pretty well with newcomers and the higher ups will work with whatever your time schedule may be. the work environment just puts you in a good mood.
good,UPS for a great starter job! Management was phenomenal! I would love to work for the company again in the very near future!  I think  UPS corporate could benefit having me apart of their team.
good,"I was a driver helper that means I would ride on the truck with the driver I have the driver deliver packages off the truck And we would do some pick ups and Then the day would be over with SEASONAL JOB "
good,I loved the people i worked with. Although the job was physically hard i adjusted and moved up fast. i got good management experience and learned how to handle unique challenges
good,The environment was very welcome.  Heavy lifting required and organizational skills.  Packaging loading and unloading task all to be finished in a timely manner.
good,UPS is a very kind place to work. People that work there are friendly and love to meet new people. The only problem I had with UPS was the salary and amount of work. The amount of work that was required each day was not worth the pay in my opinion.
good,Working with UPS was a big experience for me being of the work we had to do how far we were the environment was different great job opportunity hardest part of working there was dogs and the once it’s nigt time is very dark seeeing people so happy to get the packages melt my heart
good,"management at ups is enjoyable but i need more hours."
good,"Good working environment"
good,Great promotion oppurtunities.was able to be promtoed within 20 days of working at Ups based off of my work ethic and how well i communicated with others. The people there are very thoughtful and considerate. I would love to go back there if I could.
good,"It's a very fast pace job,"

good,"UPS is a really good company to work for, I supervised both the load and sort aisle and really enjoyed being there. just not enough hours to take care of a family dude to them only being part-time."
good,"A typical day at work will be clocking in , depending on how much time u have until your shift start ,you can sit in the break room and socialize/eat. I learned that you have to prepare yourself to be physically fit for the job .You are on your feet all day and you will be constantly bending , squatting ,and lifting all day/night.Just be on your feet all day and night. Just be prepared. The hardest part of the job to me is not being able to sit down . The most enjoyable part of the job is when you actually start getting the hang of what your doing. Once you actually get the hang of your work you will be more comfortable."
good,Varied start time and varied end time usually 4-11.  Had around 10 people work for. had to be up help to fast paced or would get left behind. Most enjoyable part of the job was the people who worked for me.

good,The hardest part of the job is being able to lift heavy boxes and stand on your feet for a long period of time. I've learned to work as a team member with my other coworkers.
good,My managers were great and were always there to push me forward AND guided me towards advancements. I always felt encourage to do more and felt noticed when I went above and beyond.
good,All I had to do was load and unload trucks as they came in. I had fun doing that because myself and the other employees would compete to see who can get their truck done the fastest. I also liked it because the staff was kind and understanding

good,UPS Supervisor life is very busy. Have to do a lot in a small time frame and limited help. Great place to gain experience. You have to hold your workers accountable as a Supervisor. There is a lot of paperwork that has to be completed at the end of each shift depending on what is your job title. Training for Sups need to be completed every month.
good,I really like this job. The managers are cool and friendly.All you have to do is work hard and you will be fine. The only thing I dislike are the hours are from 4-9am and only like 2 days a week

good,"Most people hate manual labor jobs. I do so as well. But we live in the world where we  either sell products or services to make a living. Every night I clocked in and go straight to work; Clocked out and go home and sleep. The hardest part of the job is to not mind the job. Not minding the job doesn't necessarily makes you automatic robot. By not being to mindful job, is to be able to endure stress. Sometimes lift packages helps me lose stress. The reason is because there is something to do. I get along with my coworkers, sure once in a while they may have something going on with their life, but I usually try to steer them away from those issue, if it hinders their performance. Be diligent and consistent is key to success. Ultimately, I learned that hard work does pay off."
good,"Unload and load trucks"
good,"While being the manager was a stressful job I really enjoyed it. there were bonuses, and incentives that lead to workers that enjoyed there jobs because the felt needed and appreciated. the management had and open door policy and everyone felt like family. I enjoyed my position at UPS."

good,Having to work in a hot area all day. having to work in steel boots all day
good,Great for those that are enrolled in College. Great hours and Benifits. I work there approximately 9 months before I moved up into a supervisory position. Great Company to work for. If it wasn't for getting the run around trying to get tuition assistance I would be in a full time management position.
good,Unloading trailers and sorting boxes into designated transverses
good,A typical day at work:
good,i love working at UPS but i didn't work enough hours to pay my bills.
good,Great place to work at. They promote from with in so everyone has a chance to grow in the company.
good,"UPS is a job that allows a person to show off their dedication. You get to unload packages showing customers you really care about their purchase by getting them their packages in a timely manner, in an undamaged box."
good,hard work and sweat but in a good way
good,Go to work at 5am n got off at 8:30 am m-f Got along with everyone My management is very good to work for The hardest part of my job was to get everthing done in 3half hours but i always did my best never give up till i was done
good,Good pay
good,"Good company to work for. Drove to other terminals and rail yards to deliver freight. Not the best equipment, trucks are single axle and some are really beat up. This was seasonal position."
good,Working with UPS is a hard working fast paste company depending on your position. Its a fun work environment and can be a good physical work out for your body.
good,Job is good for a bachelor. Aka no kids no dogs no girlfriend or wife. Initially it seems awesome. But you might think your done early them be told you have to help someone. Don't get me wrong you work mad hours and make good money for no college education. But ups doesn't care about your life. You keep going till all packages are delivered. Some days off at 5 pm other days 8-9 pm
good,"Great company with a outstanding reputation but the work is very physical and demanding.It requires a person to do way more than they should especially for the pay that they give.I would put in overtime every day and 3 checks went straight towards transportation as well as food so I wasnt able to save anything.Some of the upper supervisors are the worse,they would show favouritism towards alot of the employees.They wont let you advance, grow or learn without going thru the seniority status thing.The hub was very unprofessional you would think you was on the street corner or a bar the way they would be talking or acting.They even made me say I will never use UPS to deliver any of my electronics(televisions,etc) because of the way they handle peoples items(throwing them,dropping them,stacking things on top of them)no good work ethic and you can blame an employee who hasnt been properly trained and who supervisors dont care about standards"
good,Call in to the center every day on a time and where to meet the driver or the driver would call you. Be sure to be on time to meet the driver. Take the package up to the house knock or ring the bell do a fast walk back.Some drivers are in a hurry to get the job done others not so much. All the drivers I had scanned the packages and got signatures.  All of the drivers  were nice! They said the job would end in January be it was before Christmas it ended. Pay was great. The hardest part of the job was watching out for dogs not knowing if they were friendly and delivering in the dark.
good,I haven't began working for the company thus far. A friend of the family works for UPS and they said it was a great job/career.
good,"While I liked working there I also did not. Work life and home life were out of balance. At times, holidays mainly were busy and could be stressful! Management just wanted a body and did not care if you knew all steps to the job. You were left on your owner to it figure out on your own. While I can work independent not being able to go potty for hours was a horrible thing at times!"
good,hard work  unloading trucks and loading trucks slinging packages  down shute to  convaer belt to be loaded on trucks seen  all  the packages  from  all  over  that was good
good,"The work is hard no lies there, but if you stay and make it a career it's absolutely worth everything it will no doubt put you through. I loved my job here and honestly wouldn't mind going back some day."
good,"Honestly anyone can do the job but they don't care if you get hurt or if you feel bad or if you need to pay your bills all they care about is time money and working you like a mule.  "
good,Go to house to house delivering packages and learned how to scan boxes.I got along with all my co workers.It was only part time no benefits.
good,worked equally well independently or as part of a team creative problem solver who developed solutions that saved time.
good,"Need security on stand by, Very unorganized, the scheduling was all over the place. The only thing i enjoyed at the job was socializing. Workplace is very diverse."
good,Working for UPS is very fast paced and there are hardly any breaks. The benefits are supposed to kick in anywhere from after 90 days to 6 months however they tend to not. You are allowed to have a union representative but you must apply and they can cut your hours at any given time.
good,If they would pay more than what they do now to exceed from people what cant been done they would try harder and complain less. It's not to bad of a job but it's also not a secured job because its seasonal and they shut down the company.
good,"Working at the UPS store was probably one of the best things ever. If you are a college student and need a job that's going to help you with your schedule the ups store is the best job. "
good,Going downhill.  Bad management and supervision that doesnt care.  Good pay but benefits suck. Only upside is pay per hour but long hours and always have to help the lazy drivers
good,working for this company you do not feel human. you are meant to be a robot and not have a personal life. UPS only cares about numbers unfortunately and not about the employees.
good,The UPS stores are franchises. Working at one of the stores would be beneficial if you are looking to eventually open and operate your own store or become a UPS driver.
good,I love the people that comes into the workplace and the employees are very professional and friendly.
good,"Stand by, the worst is yet to come."
good,They pay poorly and expect a lot of work to be done. Its like a sweat shop . one break and that is if u get it . Certain leads are rude and don't need to be in their position.
good,"I worked at a part time seasonal driver helper. Barely got any hours. Daily positions were first come, first serve. Mass message would be sent out and first replies would be paired with driver. Time helping the drivers was enjoyable."
good,Everyday was different due to late loads staffing issues you had to crave controlled chaos to work there.  Always looking over shoulder to see if someone was else was using your ideas to move forward.
good,every day is good to work over there but salary and benefits are so less that everybody is fed up with little money. so thats why I want to leave the job.
good,"Opening the store in the morning, turning on the music and right to work."
good,"Good benefits, pay, great place. Many people have worked here for a very long time.  Excellent pay< vacation, benefits, etc.  Many employee benefits too."
good,work at ups for the holiday times for short time. this job is not hard came make money every week and get paid every Friday. packages coming in fast and u have to move fast to be able to keep up with your work load.
good,The pay was not reasonable at all for the amount of unsafe work conditions. It was a very unsafe work environment.
good,"I generally packaged and shipped packages, but we also did a lot of printing for small businesses and wide format printing. I learned a lot while working at The UPS Store. We filed loss and damage claims with UPS and I also did the monthly billing for the in house accounts through Quickbooks."
good,"i liked the driver i rode with ,he was very nice and helpful,was alot of phyical work,but good for u"
good,fast pace deliver packages stay focused time management assisting with dropping off packages need to be in shape. must wear uniform part time for season
good,Great company bad center upper management
good,None of anything that I can remember ever telling me of any of the results that they found out about my background up until they hired me. ok. They never told me anything
good,"Responsible for loading and unloading trailers for Airplanes as a package handler for the sortation department. Verified inventory by providing assistance and direction to other stockroom, warehouse, and workers. Compared inventory to physical counts of stock and investigated discrepancies and adjusted errors. Cleaned and maintained supplies, tools, equipment to ensure compliance with safety regulations."
good,"Terrible working conditions, and worse equipment. No AC, just small fans blowing hot air. The management is often lacking and apathetic."
good,"This job offers a lot of benefits and they try to get you brainwashed when they mention things like ""raises"", it's simply one dollar added to your check. the shifts can run anywhere from 3.5 hours - 5.5 hours and they feel like an inferno. you could do your best Monday but have a brand new workload as if nothing happened before on Tuesday. Management doesn't really care about you either i mean why would they, they hire every week so right when you are useless they just get another guy right behind you."
good,"El trato con los compañeros de trabajo siempre fue cordial y ameno; pude aprender a tratar a grandes consorcios mercantiles importantes para la empresa; creo que adquirí conocimientos adecuados respecto a mi labor en ese momento."
good,"I enjoyed the job very much. It was good exercise, fresh air, and fun driving around. My driver had a positive attitude and a fun personality. I would love to do it again."
good,"Avoid saying anything negative about yourself or your previous employer. If you had problems, explain them without being negative"
good,"Daily task at Ups will include loading/unloading trucks, sorting and picking packages. Making belt runs. help your supervisor out with small tasks."
good,"A very short and powerful words about this company and the people that work there. (Outstanding) this company takes the extra step that most of your parcel company won""t. do. And that is putting there  customers first."
good,Would make copies and put mail into customer mail box packaged and shipped items and lletters
good,"It was a challenge and fast moving,worked with a nice person,sometimes long hours and that was fine with me."
good,Responsible for Unloading and Scanning air packages
good,I loved it here. Not enough hours for everyone. But the work was hot
good,Ups is a good job but didnt pay as good it in a store was it own franchise and working for ups it self has benefits and pays better than the store. ups itself is a better job
good,"it was fun but the supervisors suck, and the schedule is all over the place, the managers are too much. and the breaks suck,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
good,Many if not all supervisors pretend to own the workers and doesn’t make it easy for anyone to work except the ones who spy on others and be witness on supervisors side at moments notice are well protected
good,"I loved my job.  It was chaos . But i loved it  I was OMS , most employees did not make it . They could not handle the stress.  To me it was the most rewarding job I have had, I would do it again in a heart beat if I ever had the chance .    I never missed a day ."
good,"The conditions in which we work in I would consider dangerous at times. Air circulation at the hub is not great some of our water fountains don’t work ice machines go down, and employees only get a 10 min break on a 5-6 hr shift. 5-6 hrs of straining work!"
good,I was useful to working manual labor since I lived in Texas so it wasn’t much to me but to other employees they struggled with the pace and the constant calling for hours
good,"As an employee at The UPS Store, I really enjoyed interacting with customers, helping them solve problems, packaging the items that needed to be packed. I even enjoyed doing the light cleaning that was involved in being an employee. I did not appreciate the circumstances that I was working under that were put upon me by the owner of the store. As a young woman working alone in the store the environment became very unsafe and I had to leave for my own safety."
good,I liked working at ups because my supervisor made sure we felt comfortbale the whole time there. The people there were friendly. I liked that we could talk while getting our job done all the time
good,it was a good company to work for and if I could have worked longer I would have. The person that trained me was awesome and the work environment was good
good,Ups is a Great job for kids in school to work . The benefits are amazing but the work environment itself isn’t the best. The management isn’t at its best either but the job itself is a great Job.
good,it was a good job and i had flexible hours  and i learn  a lot  i worked very hard my driver said i did a job and he really liked me. i was able to do this and goes to school.
good,"in UPS once you apply make sure that's where you'll want to stay because there is more of a chance of them finding a way to let you go "
good,A great place to work and solid when it comes to job security.  Work life balance is not valued at the Supervisory/Management level and promotions & job changes are not necessarily managed fairly.
good,"Good pay, bad bosses. This branch is very disorganized. The company in a whole is amazing, but the local management is so ragtag. And small time politics at their worse."
good,Ups very good company but the management and supervising is very bad in Abudhabi thats why I don't intresred. In Abudhabi ups management and supervising is like this they like some peoples that peoples get easy jobs another peoples get hard works
good,"A typical day at work is sometimes very busy trying to help customers with their packages and putting mail in their box. "
good,If your a college student or a driver then UPS is the place for you.  If your just working in the warehouse.  UPS is not the place for you.  None of the operating procedures or practices are in place.  Safety is a constant issue as well as damaged packages.  Retention is also another issue facing the company that has a very high turn over rate.
good,"All around it's a great job. When I'm ready to go, I'm ready to go. Some of the supervisor have nasty attitudes. Everyone complains about no one training the new hires but no one attempts to train or help them."
good,"Arrive at work"
good,"Manage and execute the daily operations of a Pricing Department that is responsible for the East Region, Inside Sales Division.

good,"A typical day consisted of sorting mail, packing items, entering data, and basic office skills. If there was available time we would do online class training."
good,Did not like working at UPS because of the hours. Other than that it was it was a very fun environment to work in and I liked the constant moving and how fast paced it was.
good,I loved the position I had was very disappointed when the contract ended.  Management is great. Friendly environment. They have a point system that I did not like but other than that it was great.
good,"A stable company which has a solid work history. As long as there are parcels needed to be delivered, UPS will have a need for its customers. For example, the company Amazon uses UPS services to help gets its product to the customers quicker and faster. Depending on what services a customer of UPS uses, whether by land or air or next day, the packages will be there in a timely manner."
good,"i did not like one aspect of my position as a driver helper, but i enjoyed the fact that i was helping delivering those packages."
good,Great company for a seasonal job but only hired you to work park time. Didnt want you to work full time and you had to finish all your and could not go over 40hrs.
good,If you’re a hard worker they work harder they don’t care at all about the numbers they have no people skills management Can’t even do the route their training you on but they expect you to do harder and more. Upper management doesn’t like to talk to our drivers although they are the face of the company. And they definitely get treated the worst
good,"I was chosen for an interview for a full-time non seasonal position i applied for, non the less ups did pay for my orientation time, my first i week realized like everyone else ups do not care if you have to travel an hour to get to work then spend another hour or so starting your route, it was never told to me that you get paid only when your first delivery happens, be prepared to literally waste 7 hours of your day just to get paid for 3 or 4 hours also the drivers supervisors continuously let them know to get rid of their helpers, i would love to become a somebody at this place, but its hard to see reality while i am literally overhearing the supervisors tell the drivers in public use these guys for a few hours and drop them off. horrible!"
good,"It was a very diverse environment, fast paced, the people were very helpful and made sure I knew the policies and procedures. I was able to balance both my work and personal life well."
good,One of the hardest part about working at UPS is you rarely have any help. Around peak season its rough an get off late nights. But good thing the check was pretty good.
good,Alot of pay hour miscalculated.. Constant issues with management. Had to call Union rep multiple times within the first 2 months. Management non Union while parcel drivers and package handlers are teamsters union.. feels like two separate companies within one ..
good,"A typical day at UPS starts at 12:00 pm, after having a safety meeting we go to our assign trucks, We empty the trucks for any excess materials so that we can load the materials onto the trucks. The hardest part is of the job is keeping the paste up with all the boxes coming down the shout very fast.  the most enjoyable part of the job is that if felt like we were playing textress the game.  the workplace culture was very hot on summer days and very cold on winter days"
good,This was only a seasonal job for me during the Christmas holidays... I would have gladly stayed had it not been a seasonal job.... I completely enjoyed everything about this job
good,Lots of work stress and physical challenges however very satisfying . I don’t like the job cause it’s easy but because it is hard. Great place to work if you don’t mind working hard . Benefits are the best and beneficial to your family can’t be beat . Would not find compensation like this anywhere .
good,This peak position was a challenging fast paced opportunity and it was a great experience! I would definitely do it next peak since I was really involved and more familiar with the ends and outs.
good,"hard job position specially during the winter"
good,"pack up,  the trucks, unload the trucks, and make deliveries to homes. the hardest part of the job was the conditions of the warehouse and the management"
good,"enjoyed working there great people and you learn how to pack fragile and expensive things to ship across the country. "
good,A typical day is working in a fast pace environment with over 30 or more forklifts on the docks at the same time. I learned how to load trailers properly according to weight. The hardest part of this job is working in below freezing temperatures on third shift.
good,The hardest part of my job was trying to package an item and the having to figure how to package where it wouldn't get damaged. A typical day at work was always busy and during the holidays its crazy. The management was unorganized when it came to scheduling shifts they were always changing it.
good,"I only worked for UPS over Christmas break while in college, but it wasnt that bad. It was very tiring but not bad. I was pre-trained with pay so I knew what was expected of me before I started work. Everyone was friendly and honest and didnt push you to the breaking point like Walmart. The pay was great for a college student. I wouldnt want to have to do this job again, but then again i'm not 20 anymore either."
good,"They training was long and extensive 4-6weeks.  Everything was scripted was that was pitched to beneficiaries.  No free will to act natural on calls.  Information was readily available to provide to beneficiaries if you can find it in their system."
good,"I was a trunk unloader from the hours of 3-9 AM.  I have described this job as one of the most stressful things I have done, but I believe it was just because it was around the holiday season."
good,"CSR/Counter Agent, Data entry, bookkeeping.  Ordered store products, post cards, packing equipment. "
good,"This place is very productive and fast moving. The Management team is always running around and under pressure, so I'm under a certain amount of pressure as well. I would rather be in a more slower pace environment. I want to work in a much more diverse environment with less noise. There is not much room for flexibility in regard to the available shifts. They are allowed to curse and yell which makes this a hard environment to strive in. I learned how to enter important data into their information system. I learned how to calculate percents for their on time network and how to enter payroll information into the payroll information site. I learned how to monitor outgoing information and how to assist employees. I enjoy dressing in business attire as well as my work place being in a clerical setting to perform administrative tasks."
good,Helping customers in all aspects of packing and shipping needs. Made a lot of friends through UPS with the benefit of a positive working environment. The hardest part was working the holiday rush and trying to get customers taken care of in a timely manner.
good,was able to meet new people and at the same time loss a li wight
good,I wrote other peoples resumes and printed  out photos  for them in the desired  sizes.
good,"As a helper, I was a seasonal helper so I didnt get to work very long"
good,"I was a seasonal package handler, loading the package cars for delivery."
good,"great place to work wish it could have been full-time.Really liked the job and could have seen myself there for a long, long time....."
good,"Not oportunity to grow few permanent positions, however the place is well equipied with machinery and trucks"
good,Ups is a great company for people who are just joining the work force. For myself personally I felt that it was a great starter job not to many responsibilities and the work load was bareable
good,"Its a hard job on some days but other days its easy an lots off good people to have a laugh with, just got to keep your head to the job an get it done"
good,Delivery of the seasonal Xmas packages was fun and helpful to me in seeing what's it like delivery of Xmas packages...it was the trust that I enjoyed more than anything...very important
good,great place to work if your single.. got along all the employees.. fast paced job.hardest part of job is remembering all that was taught to you in 3 days or less. you learned the job basicly on your own
good,"Ups is a very good job with tons of great people and you can learn a lot there"
good,great place go work even for those with there first job expiriances.. looking to move up this is the place . also looks great on a resume search...........
good,"Job was everything that it was offered as, which also involved being seasonal and I knew I wouldn’t be scheduled after the holiday season had come to pass."
good,"In my time at UPS I have developed in many areas. I had the opportunity of working with all walks of life, supervising many different employees of different age, experience and background. I became a better speaker to large crowd. I am very grateful for the fast paced environment that allowed me to excel using my quick problem solving abilities."
good,"This job was a seasonal type, the opportunity to advance in the job work place was very competitive. I enjoyed the time I worked there even though I feel I wasn't treated with the amount of respect as I put into my account there."
good,Pretty fun and pretty easy for a warehouse job most people will tell you it’s not for girls but honestly most of the men were showed up by us women. I wasn’t scared to go for what I wanted and they looked at me as equal and great no Excellent team work. If I needed help someone was always willing and ready to do so.
good,"For the amount of work you do, you dont get paid enough. The hours are not the best either. You will only get 3-4 hrs a day. The only way to go full time is to bid on it and its hard to get a different position at ups unless you been there for a while."
good,I love working at ups very fun workplace. Love being a driver helper they don’t work you that hard it was. Love workplace it was very easy only thing was wrong didn’t get enough hours.
good,"Developed many close customer relationships that generated repeat business and customer/sales growth . Working for a small business you can physically see the actual impact of quality customer care and your hard work. The store numbers(customer count/sale numbers monthly) were average when I started, after a year or two the store is one of the busiest in the state. I am a very active person which fit well in that environment. You are always on your feet and there is always something to do."
good,UPS great company and overtime is a guarantee that include 12 hour workdays. Working 6 days a week doing a various amount of different jobs that need to be done to make the company strive forward.
good,They werent very flexible and didn't give me any medical benefits. weren't very understanding with medical crises but was a good working place overall.
good,"A typical day would involve a lot of customer service and hands on projects. This was The UPS Store to be clear, not UPS. The UPS Store is independently owned, not a corporation"
good,I left UPS for personal reasons.   After 18 years it’s time for me to start fresh with a new Company.  The skills i acquired at UPS will be a huge asset at a great company.
good,"Great Company to work for but their vision for growth is based on management holding back qualified employees who have the degrees and qualification to advance in different depts.,"
good,it was okay to work there very tiring not worth it recommend for fast paced wanna work hard tired people does make u sore and weak not worth it to me at all
good,"Nice owners at a slow pace being ran by a ghetto of rude gossiping fraudulent backstabbing crew -1 employee"
good,"long hours in the heat and cold."
good,I was a seasonal Helper and I would definitely recommend my friends to work with UPS. I had a steady amount of hours for roughly a month which sufficiently paid my monthly expenses
good,"I enjoy my job at UPS. I mainly QC the products getting ready for shipping for accuracy. I agree it is fast paced and dynamic. I like a quick day, the pace and being on your feet 12 out of a 13 hour day is tolerable. I have difficulty with the bullying by some of management telling you that you can not leave after 12.5 hours or that you need to do more ? I feel sorry for the employees who are not capable of doing Saturdays and sundays due to family obligations and are written up!"
good,"UPS is a great company with good job security but if you're looking for advancement based on skills and knowledge you're better off elsewhere. Advancement opportunities are few and far between that if you aren't constantly bragging about your achievements you will get passed up. Moving up within the company increases commitment drastically, division and district managers are on the road more than not, so family time is something that is rarely available"
good,There was a lot of training. After the training they allowed me to apply my recent knowledge toward the very high risk job which I excelled at. The job was very demanding but well worth the benefits.
good,"Driver helper daytime, package handler night. Great hours making holiday pay. Work is optional daily but bonuses for showing up! Wear comfy warm clothes as a driver helper. Don't let them make you do all the work!"
good,I started out seasonal but was offered a permanent job. I like the work and the people at ups. It is very fast past. I wish we were offered more hours it would be even better.
good,"A great workplace to start of a career or maybe to make side pocket money. It is a family owed operation, almost all of the employees and managers were family to the owner. But I left because I just couldn't see myself growing as an individual within their company."
good,"Typical day at work includes learning the routes, organizing the packages that need to be delivered, and working the scanner. Hardest part of the job is finding apartment numbers and lifting heavy packages. The most enjoyable part of the day is when the truck is empty."
good,"This place is ok to work when just getting out of high school. And working hard is something that has to be done, over all I lost 7 pounds working there from all the lifting."
good,"My day at UPS, was to come in and to do the inbound drivers paperwork. I learned something new everyday. "
good,i enjoyed my coworkers and the ;management staff.  I had a problem with being held accountable when a driver is late with a package.  I did not like that part at all
good,"The job was very demanding but the health insurance, 401K & salary made it all worth it; plus they pay all major holidays.  Plenty of room for growth within the company."
good,UPS has grown me into a man. I have mastered abilities about myself that I didn't know lied deep within. Ready; moving forward exemplifying integrity.
good,"I had my student placement at UPS and learned so many new skills. I had to deal with customers, copying machines and cash. The owner was pivotal in my learning."
good,"working for UPS was a great experience to get out and gain extra money, but the supervisors were terrible when it came to paying out and the clock in and out time, they were supposedly paying us 10.45 per hour, id word 8 hours every day except for the weekend and my check would come back as 145, and they weren't willing to fix that!"
good,Management makes many promises that they cannot keep.  To many politics and favoritism. They lose great employees because they would rather promote relatives of other management.
good,This position is very labor intensive you never stop and you unload the trucks and sometimes you get placed in different positions such as scanning packages or getting the air shipped packages.
good,An average workday at UPS was pretty good. We load and unload the packages. Overall UPS is a good workplace. It's very active and good.
good,"Supervised small sort, car wash usually about 5 employees at a time, more at Christmas--about 7 to 12"
good,"UPS always provided good benefits"
good,bonne equipe mais pas de job a plien temps pas asser d heure c est une bonne entreprise le personnel est tres chaleureux
good,"My day starts by delivering packages , really don't come into contact with the client when delivering early morning, either the package is left at door or returned the following day. Mornings are always a little, but very peaceful. I learned time management, The safety of myself and the packages, I've learned to take my time when delivering and to pay attention to my surroundings. Management is the best they are on top of there game 110%. The hardest part of the job was delivering packages in the rain and snow, due to it being a little difficult to see. The most enjoyable part of the job was the end of the day when you know everyone received there packages and the lovely smiles and joy you received threw the customer."
good,"UPS is a professional environment with a traditional corporate vibe. It is great that you are able to work with contractors and supervisors on interesting projects. The most enjoyable part of the job working with people who shared in-depth knowledge on historical projects, leading a way to educated decisions on future project impacts."
good,A typical day at work is answering calls making sure customers leave satisfied. Providing the best customer service possible.
good,"In other respects, UPS with being such a large company, it was very hard to move up in accordance to you work performance.  Unfortunately, this is was my situation, however UPS was able to pay for by college education completely with absolutely no debt and because of this opportunity it has allowed to grow and expand if i so choose in other companies.  I will forever be thankful this for this opportunity."
good,if you have a great driver this job will be great. you meet great people on your route and you learn a lot along the way. i would love to work there again
good,I love working at my current job. I am just looking for a career change. I love my co-workers and the management team.
good,"no job security"
good,i enjoy working with the company it was great got a chance meet new people and learn a new job.
good,We hop on and off the truck and deliver packages to customers door steps. 
good,you always felt like your job was injeporady. not a good place to work
good,UPS is great for first time job seekers and students. You stay long enough you get rewarded with a raise and also benefits. Its hard work witch if you able to make it will build character. I've how to work hard and get through a rough week let alone day with a good head on my shoulders and also to let things go no matter how big or small. I've learned how to process things faster and move and faster rates and also how to manage how much energy i use so im not completely drained at the end of a shift. I've learned how to work safely in an environment that is always changing and moves at a high rate of speed with lots of moving equipment.
good,Being a part time manager I had to motivate my peers to perform at their highest levels.
good,Reading and loading packages into trailors in hot humid trucks.
good,The climate control everything watch free lunch to be late can be early work right hours everybody's always in a good mood friend request to be around friendly co-workers environments clean
good,I like working because the feeling of earning my own money makes me feel good as a young man to be able to help out around the house as much as I can and not depend on my parents
good,Most jobs are seasonal. Best thing to do is get a seasonal job then continue to check site for a part time permanent position. After that it’s easy to get in full time.
good,"Well the job is physically demanding and interesting at the same time."
good,Low boxes get trucks down on time and do much more and do your job punctual worker one time I'm going to work any hours can always count on me to do what I got to do for you and the company
good,"I loved the job there, but was seasonal, and no chance to advance, and could not get a full time position. I want a place that I have chance to advance, and be full time."
good,"Willing to work hard, fast, and able to sort and load work truck, and unload tractor trailers for at least 4 hours and handle heavy any all weights of packages on the belts and go to different job sights such as sorting but zip codes."
good,"lifting and haddleing bb boxes work overnight, lots of phycial moveing love to work there and meet frings it was an okay job and I qas able to add to resume"
good,"My day began at UPS very early (1:30 am) unloading tractor trailers. it was expected to unload 1,200 boxes per hour in which I exceeded the limit. I later became a splitter (separation of boxes on a belt). The pace was difficult to keep up with as the conveyor belt does not slow down when you are having difficulties reading address labels. I enjoyed the fast pace, however at times it was difficult to keep up with the extreme amount packages."
good,"fast paced, be ware of the weather cause you might be in it,           "
good,"Overall a decent starting place or for some extra Christmas money. The workplace is intense and high motor required you'll be handling between 400 and 450 packages a day, ranging from, 10 lbs to 110 lbs and make sure you can turn fluidly, lift heavy objects above your head and can move with grace as well because packages do fall off conveyer belts"
good,"I personally really enjoyed working with UPS, but my experience was with the UPS Store, not actual UPS. The bosses are different, but the environment is very similar... Just more graphic designing and customer service than anything else. Great work areas!"
good,"this is a very fast paced job and require a lot of bending, lifting and carrying of packages. You are constantly on the move and require comfortable shoes with support."
good,Was very busy most days especially during the holidays. I learned a lot about shipping and rates and packaging. Management was good and the people were nice.
good,"UPS is a very good company to work for with a good reputation. They pay good, and have good medical benefits. UPS is very hard work. Its general labor working in the warehouse or being a delivery driver loading and unloading trailors or delivering and picking up packages to and from businesses and residental houses.Ups is very strict and has production numbers you have to meet or you get in trouble."
good,So much to take from working at UPS. With all the crazy union workers and the demanding management. You can get caught in between if you're not careful.
good,"It was ok, the hours weren't great, but if you're looking for a good workout at 4 in the morning I'd definitely recommend it. Coworkers were pretty negative most of the time though"
good,MGR of HR and other staff members helped my out in what they wanted done with ChoicePoint software.  Trained everyone how to use also and the trained me back.
good,upper management needs to change how things are at the facility and the job could be a very good job.   The hours take some getting use to and can make for other part time opportunities.
good,"Customers are number 1. You need the ability to be flexible in providing a variety of services, for example: providing copies, assistance with basic printing from computer desktops, large format print jobs, facsimile important documents to sending them for receipt the next day. Helping customers with shipping returns or sending a family member a gift. Processing corporate accounts like Apple, AT&T Cricket, and Dyson to name a few."
good,"This is a good part time job, get to meet lots of people, but not a life long career unless you are a driver.  Working in the store is very fast paced and have to multi task."
good,"I really did like working at UPS, but if you become a supervisors you did not get treated the same as union workers. The requirements that they ask to further my career was to much for me at the time"
good,"Fast paced, we have to deliver packages in a timely fashion. Stand and walk, sometimes run for a long period of time. Very fun when u get used to it, since i was seasonal had trouble with pay got it situated after 3weeks of calling. Wish it was permanet"
good,"I learned to work fast in all types of weather with few breaks long hours and used new IED machine It was a three week position and I feel the pay was good, but for what you do could have been better."
good,"The job is not difficult, and can be easily mastered, I enjoyed having so many different tasks to learn, it kept the job from becoming boring. The owner is great, and really cares about his customers. We are a neighborhood store, with many ""regulars"".  During the recent hurricane we quickly became very experienced in shipping generators to Puerto Rico. The only difficult task is picking up very heavy boxes - 60 lbs and more. I let the younger employees move them. The most enjoyable part is seeing the regular customers when they come in, and helping the older customers  solve their challenges."
good,"UPS was a seasonal job, and it turned into something I could turn my career into, I really enjoy myself working for UPS everyday , its always something new."
good,"Enjoyed delivering packages during the holiday season. Customers were great to work with.  Most of the time the weather was great, and it was difficult to deliver when the sun went down.  Pay was weekly."
good,"very Good job "
good,If you like to work and nit slow down then I would recommend working here. I enjoyed working with the drivers the most. Especially during the holidays.
good,Job is very nice and I like that you can go at your own pace ( if your a driver ). I do not like that management was back and forth and I never got any calls back after I has a 1 on 1 interview
good,"I worked as a driver helper, temporary only during the busy holiday season. Fast paced, physical work. Fun if you like being in the weather and on your feet. Not fun otherwise."
good,a wonderful work place were the employers are careful and patience when it come to loading and packaging an customers belongings but also appreciate a long day of hard work
good,You don't work here for the pay or the advancement opportunities.  They have great health benefits and you don't have to pay for a gym. Its a short shift in every kind of weather and its long road to seniority but its worth it.
good,Bassically I delivered the package to the destinations while the driver orginized the truck. It was an excellent experience and wouldnt reccommend it to the out of shape person.
good,"It gets very hot and sticky in the warehouse. You only get a 15 min lunch, Peak season is the hardest without help from other people. Teamwork is not a major deal there even though it should"
good,"Typical days work was 10 or more hours. Trucks were way overloaded for casual drivers and under loaded for regular employees. Management didn't care what happened as long as no accidents and if you were injured they blamed you for not following the training. "
good,"I enjoyed loading carts and organizing the boxes"
good,"Working at UPS seasonally for me personally was the best work experience I had. Though it was a bit of a handful at first, eventually everyday you get into the routine and get into the cycle of your route,  the type of work you're dealing with everyday, etc."
good,"Greet and Assist customers with outstanding service, evaluate and package items properly, correctly enter data into system to ensure packages will arrive on time at the appropriate location, handle incoming/outgoing calls, preform fast pace transactions and multi-task many duties efficiently. I learned a basic knowledge of office equipment: fax, copy, laminate, scanning to email, etc. The UPS Store was a great place of employment, the staff and customers were a pleasure to work with. The most difficult part was having to go through the training process, it was all videos and reading pamphlets for the first few weeks."
good,Ups is a great place to work because of the pay and benefits. others then that be prepared to drive your busted truck all day. So pack a lunch and learn your route because you might be stuck in a area with no where to stop and get food. Your day is never done during perk but dat overtime is nice if you are about that life. But over all amazing pay and benefits just not time to be home or with family and friends. In at AM out at PM not a 9 to 5.
good,"Great hours, the pay was great, I enjoyed meeting new people, worked with fast past delivering packages to peoples door."
good,Excelente compañeros de trabajos y excelente empresa para laborar. Mi único inconveniente con UPS es que deben tomar en cuenta a los empleados que contratan para posiciones temporales y hacen un excelente trabajo para que los tomen en consideración para posiciones permanentes.
good,easy job and great people to work with. very fast pass of work. It's pretty busy during holidays. The only down falls to this is watching people carelessly throw peoples stuff around braking tv's ect.
good,It's a good company to work for while you're in High School. The manager will help you if you needed help with school work.
good,I liked it at first but then the environment changed I felt as if I should e making more than I was I approached management about that and still got no results
good,Job was very stress-free and was able to have some flexibility with my days.  I was mostly alone during the day and didn't hear much from management as long as I completed my task successfully.
good,Terrific experience even though it was a temporary position. Met some wonderful people. A lot of interaction with people. Responsible for delivery of packages and pick ups.
good,I learned about order and separation the right way and also to do this in an orderly fashion and time management. Good work schedule and benefits available.
good,"Fast paced environment."
good,UPS is a place to grow but it is all work. great people to work with and some to learn from. there is only one peak season which means its only one time a year you can get un limited hrs to work and save money.
good,getting to meet some great people and having a good crew to help u along your day. if it was not for then friends i made while i was there i would have never stayed.
good,"Great Job, fast paced you work hard and time flies should be able to lift more then 50lbs great as a second job during the holidays for extra cash"
good,The driver would call or text me where to meet him. We would drive around and deliver packages. The seat that the driver helper sits on is not comfortable especially during brutally cold weather. I enjoyed the job overall.
good,"I didn't really work at ups for to long, I was only seasonal, but the job was fun and educational. We would all go on break when the day started to slow down and all get to know each other, become friends and learn from each other."
good,"UPS is a fantastic company, but there were times when the required hours far exceeded the norm, causing burnout and potential health and safety issues."
good,"Suitable Working hour"
good,i had very fun co workers ive learned alot  did alot most enjoyable part was going to differt cities i also met a bunch of famous
good,It was a seasonal Job for the Month of November and December 2014
good,Fast pace package delivery all over island was seasonal 2nd job great company
good,"a typical work day consists of timely deliveries and pickups to and from customers, long hours"
good,Ok company to work for . No advancement opportunity. The most enjoyable part of the position is knowing that I was able to get done what I set out to do each day.
good,"rutinario."
good,This job is very interesting and rewarding to those who are patient.
good,"While working this job, I realized that being physically fit is all but necessary. I also learned that the term ""fast-paced"" is not to be taken lightly. I enjoyed working with my UPS driver since we had a lot of traits in common."
good,I enjoyed working there and would have stayed if the hours did not interfere with my schooling. I am being paid to go to school through the military and can not miss any school and UPS said they would work around it but didn't fulfill that requirement.
good,One of the most enjoyable parts of my job was that the runs were dedicated throughout the U.S.. WHEN I saw and/or spoke to other employees the were friendly and pleasant.
good,"I prepared the paperwork to receive and send the incoming high value packages and outgoing send agains. I prepared the dispatch summary report. I then retrieved the high value packages from the trucks,scanned,labeled,determined their route numbers,and gave the packages to the drivers. I learned many different skills;time-management,interpersonal skills,management skills,computer skills,problem-solving skills,and organizational skills. Probably the most difficult part of the job was chasing after the drivers who forgot to pick up their high value packages. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that I did everything correctly. "
good,"Being a driver helper for UPS was a good first job, hard but satisfying work. It was only a seasonal job though which resulted in no benefits or job security."
good,"This a a very laid back position management was great, I was able to meet a many people of different backgrounds and became a Notary Public"
good,Good place to work learned a lot work environment was nice staff friendly people and great overall
good,well managed company compared to public sector this is enough already thank you.
good,It was a great place to work great people when it gets hot it get real hot when it gets cold it like a freezer in there I worked there a long time I wanted to get in those trucks but I was taking forever and the management they are real nice
good,"A fantastic company to work with but like all companies there are a few rotten apples in the barrel which can devastate one's career. The UPS motto has and has always been, e promote from within and we stand by our people. But. do not get sick or have terminal illness. At first they are most responsive but as the months, years wear on, they as a company forget who you are. l as one of a few lucky ones in management was given full pay for one year and then % for the next four years. My insurance cancelled after my first year of disability so it was up to me to find the funds to LIVE!"
good,"I enjoyed workin there until i hurt my right wrist due to lifting boxes, and then was ordered by my supervisor to keep working for the next 3 days."
good,I learned a lot while at UPS and look forward to returning to this job. The fast pace and strenuous work was a great tool. The coworkers were helpful and friendly.
good,Great people and work atmosphere. Fast paced and upbeat . Supervisors are always available to answer questions.Coworkers are always willing to lend a hand .
good,The staff are great friends and friends. They make you feel as if family. I would have loved to stay but I just didn't like the pay. People are friendly and great
good,I appreciate the offer that they have provided to me and there is always work. I was able to learn how to work as a team since everyone at the company does that to make the business succeed.
good,I love to work for this company I was only there for a short time due to having a seasonal position but in the short time I was there I was very happy with the company.
good,This job is overall great and so is the pay and the benefits are well worth it. Especially if you’re planning on going back to school and have children
good,"The tight labor market has made workers pickier about pay, benefits, hours and other aspects of work."
good,I had fun working at UPS it was to bad I had to move so quickly unable to transfer n time.. I had a great team to work with but overall wish it was full time not part...
good,un ambiente de trabajo acelerado pero nada dificil
good,Ups was a good place to work the staff and you stayed moving at all times. It's a good way to earn money and stay energetic and loss weight at the same time
good,Great company to work . They are very fair during the interview process. Also they pay yo I very well for the work you do.  I would take another job with them any time.
good,if my trandsportation situation wouldnt of changed i would of moved up in position there. if you can hang in there and work the hours and do the task at hand you will make it.
good,It was manageable had fun cold working in warehouse it's a great opportunity easy eith day to day life..................................................
good,It’s a fun hard at times chill job I would recommend it to anyone who is having a tough time job hunting it’s pretty simple and straightforward but it’s also hard work so keep that in mind
good,"UPS has always been good to me and my family. It hasn't always been easy, nor should it be that way. UPS is large, very large and growing. I have never worried about the doors being open for business,the company is run well. A lot has changed and many complain, but again, change is better than gone! I am very grateful for the opportunities I have been given over the years and for the many great people I have worked with."
good,Been working there almost 5 years and it’s the best place to look for opportunities.  While I was a loader I’ve slowly gained experience in the building just until I got offered to be a supervisor.
good,This job is very easy just have to take ur time especially in the peek season it gets out of control with packages but if you are in good health you’ll fly right throw the day.
good,The job keeps employees busy with a good balance of urgency and calmness. Good working hours for the pay and very nice employees. Would recomend for others
good,Part-time or full-time UPS has grate benefits to offer. If looking to be on the field with a team this is the place to be. They maintain variety of locations around the Tri-City's
good,UPS is great start for seasonal or non seasonal job a lot of driving in and out of the vehicle in different weather could be a little hectic for some days overall fun experience
good,"Good personal administration, clean area , good security."
good,"Work hard and have integrity - you'll do just fine.  A lot of new opportunity at UPS.  Great if you just want to go to school while working at UPS(tuition program), or continue on with a full time career."
good,AmazingAmazing great working Forssman great company great job to start a career our coworkers work together help one anotherVery great environmentNationwide company
good,"Working at UPS was somewhat stressful, but the company is a great place to work. Management works long hours, and the work life balance is not great due to the schedules. You do get a lot of experience in a fast pace environment and working with a lot of people."
good,"UPS trainers and supervisors made me feel welcomed and as a team member/UPS family.  I was disappointed that my seasonal employment came to an end, but I look forward to UPS recalling to join them again!"
good,"It was a great experience with fair pay."
good,"Great company, great supervisors and a great management I love UPS everyone I met was very helpful and very safe. UPS is big on safety which was great."
good,"It is long hours but, the benefits are so rewarding. You can definitely move up in this job and make more money. They help all their employees out. Great job!"
good,It’s only worth it around peak season the money is great. The people are really nice and they will help you if you need help. I’ve been working here almost 2 years.
good,"It’s hard depending on your driver . My first driver tried to over work me , had me doing all the work while he sit on the truck. My second driver was a nice help we worked together."
good,Great working experience. It helped me get together a good work ethic and understand manual labor. It also helped me be more organized and to be able to better manage the time i have on my hands as well as how to treat others.
good,They where really understanding and when they had a problem they came to me about it! They gave me good hours and paid me right. They are a good company to work for and I would definitely recommend people to work for ups.
good,"I loved the fact even as a personal vehicle driver, I had all the support if needed to do my job well. The down side is not getting hired in permanently."
good,It was a great experience working for UPS. The managers were hands on and very helpful. The workers were all new but we all helped each other as we figured something out.
good,"I only worked through the holiday season but the job was great and the people are totally amazing. I truly enjoyed my working experience there, I only wish it would have lasted longer! Although, it really was a fun job it does require paying a lot of attention to details and it also requires a lot of stamina so if your okay with a good workout and don't mind the details, It's the perfect job. I loved it and hope to do it again next year!"
good,Would like a full time opportunity as this was seasonal great company to work for had a lot of fun! Hopefully when permanent opportunity comes along I will be hired would like to work here for 20 years!
good,My most enjoyable time at this job was being a Driver service provider. Nothing was more important to me than servicing the customers on my daily route.
good,"Es macht mir im Moment spass dort zu arbeiten, jedoch könnte ich mir eine bessere Arbeit vorstellen."
good,"It was great working there I did alot of helping an made sure every package was sent in the right place, Also driver helper, to help driver's deliver packages"
good,Ups is a job where you can make friends and show everyone how hard of a worker you are. You can also make a career out of working at ups. It is a very fast working environment
good,This job requires you to run all day long. It makes the days go by pretty fast and you get great exercise. The pay was great and everyone I worked with was very nice
good,its a hard phsycial work if you are woking out bound. but once you get the hang of it. it becomes easy like working in the gym. hard part is remembering the zipcodes
good,"UPS is a hard job to do, your working in trucks all day and it can get very hot inside them but they do give you breaks in between trucks mostly work 5 days a week about 7hrs a day"
good,"Great job just not a lot of hours, would totally continued to work there if the job was not only seasonal and if it wasn’t a 30 minute drive everyday from where I live."
good,I learned how to stack large & heavy packages to the top. I learned how to work as a team to get the job done & to get all the package to all our customers on time .
good,Growth consistency respect loyalty money is great and benefits managers are strict but respectful great educational opportunities as well as financial helps a lot
good,"The job itself is pretty easy, it all just depended on what shift that you took and what made you more comfortable to work there. Be prepared to be sore!"
good,I enjoyed working for UPS as a Seasonal Helper.  It was even enjoyable (for me) when there was bad weather.  The job could be hectic at times but there was not a lot of stress as a helper.
good,I in turn really enjoyed working at company it was nice fast paced and easy.    The staff were a little on the slow side but most humans are so we can learn to live past it
good,"Good company that has multiple locations, you have the opportunity to grow with the company and to improve your skills. Learned how to work In a management position."
good,I'm a hard worker and im here to work. I'm here to pleases I'm here to help out any company. I'm here to complete any project that is assigned to me one hundred percent.
good,it was a great place too worker worked early got off at the same time every  day it just was not a part time or full time job i like the company it was great
good,you will be helper your driver 25/8 you will be every where really helping other driver with their stuff and the pay is good so you will do it honestly
good,"This is a fun place to work at for the first few months but hours are limited to 3-5 a day. However, the culture is great and they do try to hire internally often."
good,It’s a job to get someone new started not something to stay at a long time you can’t live off of the hours that they give you because i’m my opinion it’s not enough.
good,The hardest part of the job was learning the area that my route was on. The neighborhood had new construction but also older houses. I loved working for UPS great  company. I hope to get on with them full-time they have excellent benefits and take care of their people. Everybody was very nice and helpful with my question. The training and operations of the UPS Company is by far the best. I'm crossing my fingers that I get offered a permanent position.
good,"I have worked seasonal at UPS for 4 years, the work is consistent, the hours are long and you have to be in shape to walk all day long. There have been 2 seperate years i have not received my bonus checks on a weekly paycheck. !st time it took them 5 months to fix this issue, and thhis last year, nobody has returned my calls as promised and its been almost 1 year and i am still owed 300.00 with no response yet?? over all i like that i have freedom during the day and the pay is fair, but getting compensated for what is owed to me has been a real hastle. I like woring there alot, but id like for management to address my isues more promptly with my pay for working. i was the top runner this last year making 55 deliveries an hour and im 48 years old. the only downsides are long hours and wondering if i am overlooked for my hours if i will ever get paid or addressed. It really helps during Christmas time @ 15.00$ an hr with 150.00 weekly bonuses if your attendance is perfect."
good,"I signed up for driver helper first couple of weeks was good 1500 easy every Friday, but After thanksgiving they started cutting my hours telling me I can’t work more than 10hrs a day. Now I work every other day this center is very unprofessional and unorganized. San Francisco 16th and Potrero center smh"
good,Hard work but a good great part-time job! I got to work out a lot and meet different drivers. You get to meet with different drivers and get to know a lot about this job.
good,I like the job. Get along well with coworkers and the hours worked with what I could manage at the time. Be ready for any and all weather type conditions if you plan on being a tug driver.

good,i loved working at ups its the type of work i love i actually got hired permanent but my background stopped me from getting hired permanently i had got hired threw peak season
good,"In my experience, UPS is a great company that provides its employees a great opportunity to make something of themselves. It offers great compensation to people from all walks of life, however the workplace culture is lacking. The relationship between employee and employer is often strained due to excessive workloads and varying time constraints. The hardest part of the job, in my opinion, is being consistent with your work ethic in spite of your management team not setting you up to be successful. Conversely, the most enjoyable part of the job is the overwhelming sense of accomplishment that comes with completing your route for the day and going home."
good,I was a loader at Ups. The supervisor and the team leaders was very nice and  helpful. They were always there when i need the help and they also led by example.
good,I was still in Highschool Full time when I was working in Los Angeles. I came into work to show them I go into a school in New Orleans and I was let go a couple days later because of relocation.
good,A typical day is fast paced and provides an opportunity to learn new tasks and new routes.  Management is supportive and responsive to the needs expressed by their team members.

good,"It's a great seasonal job. The exercise that results from walking so much feels good. That being said, the hardest part of the job is enduring the exercise through the shift."
good,UPS is a wonderful company to work for.  I have been there for quite sometime now.  They have great benefits. from time off to employee discounts and 401 benefits and much much more.
good,Its ok but not for me.  Im tired of reviews so you must excuse me. I wanna another job because it all depends on culture. In indiana they play favortism
good,Very hard to work there it’s gonna take a lot of hard work and dedication to work that that place your gonna get super hot and annoyed of all the packages

good,It was a good job that was only seasonal so unfortunately it didn’t last but it allowed me to move around a lot and make a decent amount of money. It was nice having a bonus at the of each week.
good,Packaging the boxes is like a challenge because you have to make sure you ain’t putting light things under heavy boxes an damaging the packages now you have to return them

good,I never personally worked at UPS but from the time I've spent on the phone with them sorting out shipping issues or having my questions answered they were always very pleasant.
good,Great environment great job would do it in a heartbeat. I drove 80 miles a day to because I loved my job but I was let down by my boss with my taxes. My bonus that put gas in my tank to was put on my taxes as a different business when I was still working for the same employer.i had to pay taxes back and I thought it was very selfish and unfair because that wasn’t the agreement when I was hired.
good,The UPS Store is a small store with a relaxed environment. There are only 3 employees at this current location but it is a great job. You are compensated fairly for the work that is done.

good,Working at UPS gave me a good work experience working in the warehouse. UPS provides flexible hours the time i working there. Thankful for the opportunity
good,"Great place to work, great benefits, vacation time, management.  The most enjoyable part was family office environment.  However, UPS downsized and lost my job."
good,"UPS is a multi-billion-dollar corporation by clearly focusing on the goal of enabling commerce around the globe. As a MuleSoft developer, I was primarily responsible for implementing functionality to create applications, where a user can check their delivery status with the tracking number and for the further search, we can get back the result either from the database or cache. UPS provided me a great platform to learn new technology stacks and helped me to grow."
good,At first it's hard work but after a week your body becomes used to it so then it just becomes a fast-paced job which will leave you ready for bed. It is mostly physical work but if you plan ahead and use your mind then you can excel at the work.
good,"The owner of the store was fantastic in taking care of his staff. I enjoyed working for the company. The customers were regulars so you tended to be on a good first name basis with them, and I find that I love that about a store."
good,This was one of the best jobs that I've ever had.  I wished things would have been different.  Great place to work but starting part time puts a damper on your wallet. Great Leadership and great benefits.

good,As a package handler at ups i would sometimes scan packages as they are unloading off the trucks and sometimes i would load or unload trucks. Had to work fast and steady
good,"It's the brown army. very little in the way of surprises.  I had some great managers and some lousy ones.  only left because my career development path was railroaded by some short sighted managers."
good,This job was the best first job to have in my opinion. It kept me on my toes and got plenty of exercise while working there. Only reason I stopped working there was because seasonal work ended.
good,UPS is a great fast paced environment with competitive pay. The days fly by as a delivery driver because you are constantly moving. It's a great job to get into shape.
good,This is a great company who gives most a chance to better themselves in the work place. My co workers and I get along and we work as a team. They have people willing to show you the way. No questions asked.
good,"I started in fall on 2017, as a loader.  Started in a old hub, hand scanners, manual rollers into the trailers, and memorizing addresses to pick off and sort boxes.  Loved working hard and sweating everyday, more of who I am.  Summer of 2018, moved to brand new huge hub in Salt lake City.  Automated Sorters, Easily accessible conveyors for the iregs over 70lbs, no scanning anything.  Same thing, loved it.  I memorized all the ""hot"" addresses for packages and would sort the extras at the end of the day.  When you make a effort to learn above and beyond there, my immediate supervisor and full time both recognized this and trusted me to load good and take care of stuff if they were busy.  If your not lazy, and are willing to have pride in where you work, I 100% recommend this job.  I left only for opportunities elsewhere."
good,"Great benefits  , I loved  everyday of work I would  recommend this ups to anyone.  The income is great  and you meet good people  everyday . Great experience"
good,Grey if you want a career or just a job. The work is nothing to write home about but it's not the end of the world. They are one of the better large corporations to work for
good,"UPS can help you grow financially, mentally, career wise, that will help you gain more opportunities that will better your life and build up your resume."
good,"Part-time employment works good with my other activities, excellent work atmosphere, great co-workers, schedule is tailored to my needs, weekends off."
good,I took the packages from the truck to the house. It was pretty cool just riding shotgun all day. It was also interesting being the person delivering all of those packages instead of the one ordering them.
good,"I get along with my co workers and we all are team players"
good,"UPS has taught me alot, I started out as an administrator and currently a supervisor. There is something different every day, an amazing work group. I load up jets, small feeder aircrafts, and trucks."
good,They expect high levels of professionalism. Help multiple customers while producing fast high quality designs. Amazing management that wants the most from their stores.
good,Very productive and active workplace. Keeps employees in shape and always on their feet. They make sure all employees are safe and taken care of. Good way of learning your way around the area
good,"UPS offers tuition reimbursement,  rewards hardwork and prefer to promote from within. Though most jobs are truly part time jobs, they offer full time health benefits and a pension plan."
good,"Great place to work. Company has great pay and excellent benefits . Import department transferred to another city and I could not pack up and leave due to marriage, family"
good,Very fast paced and attention to detail is a MUST and must be abme to lift up 70lbs or more.  Willing to invest your time.. unionized job is a plus ...
good,A typical day at work was coming in at 4am and being prepared to come in with a positive attitude and up beat vibe. Started the day off by getting the job site ready to go for the employees and seeing what other tasks needed to be taken care of before the morning announcement. Always greeted the employees with a morning meeting that summarized how our performance the day before was and who preformed well and those who needed to do better. Read our safety tips for the day and sent our employees on their way. What I learned most was really what type of manager I was. I learned more and more about how I could become a better leader each day. The hardest part of the job was by far getting up everyday at 3am to start work by 430am. I think the fast pace energy that was needed everyday was something that I enjoyed most. Keeping myself on my toes everyday was something that I really got used to. UPS was a great experience and the people there were also an awesome part of the job.
good,Enjoyed my years as unloaded driving airs to airport. Picking up at drop boxes finishing my college in business management. Then my years as a deliver driver in Most of the Arlington Routes and the landmark Mall route at the end. Just grateful to work for the company.
good,I love my job there and the people are awesome that I work with and the job is for people that actually work so if your lazy please stay home !!hard work for those that know what hard work really is now a days :)
good,"I worked there 25 years, as a package car driver / delivery driver.  They paid well, and had good benefits. Benefits included paid vacation time, medical & dental insurance, and 401k. I would highly recommend this company to someone looking for a job in the field of Package Delivery."
good,"UPS was very good to me , it was just time for to move on !! My wife had some health issues and being on job almost 12 hours per day was preventing me from helping her when needed ! Things are much better now, looking to grow with. some company that would like me to have a strong influence on the employees!"
good,Really great group of people very friendly. Everyone is very helpful and the best job I ever had. If had the opportunity I would definitely go back for full time!
good,It was a good work place but the supervisors are incompetent to do there job an accident occured with my check and when i asked my supervisor she has gotten aggressive towards me after speaking to HR it was not handled
good,"It's a easy job but the repetition kind makes the time drag. If you can stay highly motivated the shifts go by quick, a 10 minute break is given but it should be more depending on the work volume."
good,the position was seasonal. typical day started out with getting on the truck and going to various locations to deliver packages. packages varied in size and weight. hardest part of the job is that you have to be quick and safe when delivering packages. Your there to help the driver deliver packages. and have fun while doing it.
good,"I love working for UPS, and if I did not move I would still be working there now. I had many opportunities while working for UPS, had much support from my mentors to succeed there."
good,its a good seasonal job to have. Its fast pase but good pay to get from the company and alot of discoun ts and other things u can get from the company
good,"If you like a corporate environment with a rigorous structure, set hours, and a detailed and specific job assignment, then this is the job for you. Every aspect of this company has been carefully reviewed and implemented with reachable goals and standards in mind. As an unloader and sorter, be prepared to constantly lift heavy parcels and work at a fast pace. As a supervisor, be prepared to host meetings, file extensive paperwork on each employee, and ensure the safety of all of your coworkers. A rewarding job for anyone who likes to work."
good,Very tight knit family environment. Everyone always looks out for each other. Drivers were always looking to help each other and be there for other drivers when they needed to be.
good,Ups often gets a bad representation but it beats not having a job at all...only worked part time for 4 months and it can give you a good workout for the fact the job is very physically demanding
good,"I enjoyed my time there, while the work was faster pace than what i was expecting, it was more enjoyable cause the drivers knew their duties, knew where to go. I was there to help speed along the process during the busy holiday schedule. "
good,It okay if your looking for a work out experience and getting paid at the same time its a dream job but most people join fir the benefits or seniority for truck driving
good,Overall I really enjoyed working seasonally for UPS. The routes were easy to pick up on along with the work. Very active job which I also enjoyed. Have to be up and moving all day.
good,This job was great to work for extra cash over the holiday season. Got to choose the days I wanted to work. The drivers were always great to ride along with.
good,UPS is a great company to work for even though it was a temporary job just for the holidays I would recommend others to apply for UPS. It was a good experience.
good,I loved working for UPS  I had good benefits and the pay was very good  I would always recommend this company to young people who want to save for a car or even college

good,Amazing company with great management and benefits to their employees. Working with UPS was like having a dream job. I only wish I had been able to continue driving for them because truly it was a wonderful gig.
good,"Really enjoyed working here, the employees were really nice and worked together. The staff and management were incredible and really took their time to make sure everything ran as smooth as it could get. I'll never forget this job and I do miss at times. Pay could be better for what you do, but thats about all they really need improvement on. I would most definitely work here again if I had to! 5 for 5 star rating!"
good,Working there was a good experience. I learned a lot on how to manage a company and to run a business. I have successfully transformed those skills into every day settings.
good,this job was very educational and also organized but unfortunately it was just an experience for my resilient and  dynamic personally . i truly admire professionalism and i got it there
good,"typical work day was annoying"
good,"Only work 4 hours a day. "
good,"Nice place and people. Very physical, hands on job. My coordinator wasn’t professional or the nicest person, besides that I enjoyed working there and would for sure work there again"
good,I enjoyed providing customers with the best customer service. I delivered packages safely and on time. And it is a good place to work. I learned it is a fast-paced environment and the people are nice.
good,Very friendly store friendly staff and a friendly  atmosphere that is warm inviting and welcoming to anyone that comes in and the staff are always super helpful and is very proficient in what they do
good,"UPS offers a comprehensive opportunity to exercise HR Responsibilities for providing consultive/tactical support to business unit management in areas of Organizational Training, Performance Management, Career Development, Employee Services, Compliance, Compensation, Benefits, Talent Acquisition, Employee Relations, Labor Relations, Workforce Planning, Data Integrity and Implementation of Human Resource Initiatives.

good,"Its a fast paced job, riding in the trucks and delivering packages to businesses and residential homes. Have to stay on your toes and be fast, and know how to layer as it can get pretty chilly in the winter!"
good,very hectice..the people i hated.. im glad that i left .. i found a bter job with reaasonable hours .. i dont care about thst job it sucks alot.  dont have free time
good,This job seemed so fun an something to experience but I was only a on call person for the busy season so I did not get the chance to experience any of this beside orientation
good,I was a driver helper for seasonal package delivery over Christmas.  It was a great job.  The driver was awesome.  Wish I could have stayed on.  I did not have benefits or advancement opportunity so I cant speak to that.

good,"Really great place to go for seasonal work. I was a driver helper and made about $1000 a week. The work was fast paced and fun, and I was able to spend lots of time outside working out."
good,"Well, helping the driver was interesting when I was riding along side. I got to see new parts of the area that I never seen before and had the chance to know my way around as I delivered the packages to the front door."
good,"I was pleased to work at UPS.  My Managers were great.  Once I was able to get the computer training out of the way, I moved to the shift of that was preferred to begin with."
good,Ups is very teamwork orientated. If you do not help each other you accomplish nothing. Moving up in the company is very difficult and work life balance is not there
good,"I was a seasonal PVD driver and I was so grateful for everything I learned on this job. "
good,I was able to be promoted within a year here and was able to develop  skills that I use on a regular bases. UPS teaches people to work hard and you will be awarded for it

good,The job is fast paced and requires attention to physical labor for the duration of the shift.  The company provides respectable benefits for all employees.
good,"UPS is a great place to work, especially during the holiday seasons. They provide employees with benefits and a safe work environment. I would recommend this job to anyone in desperate need for one."
good,I worked as a casual driver for the 2018 holiday season. My route was commercial and easy. I could finish it in 2 hours and then I had 2-3 hours to kill before making my pick ups. I would have liked more work to keep me busy and show how productive I could be
good,It was good. People there were great. I enjoyed my time there due to me working with a friend. I was lucky enough to be able to do my school work on the job when it was slow.
good,UPS is a good company overall to work for. There are problems with the Union. You may be bumped by someone with more seniority and not be able to work. The benefits are great.
good,You get out exactly what you put in. If you’re seasonal don’t quit your main job. It’s only for a couple extra 100/200 a week and If you don’t have a job and get hired through the seasonal (peak) season call your manager and he’ll keep putting you on different trucks were you can get about 8/9 hours a day.

good,It was great while i was working and the aditude of the driver I was helping was excellent. It was a great experience I learned a lot from the driver.
good,UPS is a good stable job but it is very unorganized. We are not aloud to bring cellphones in so I wasn’t able to get the supervisors number Incase anything happened. There was not a consistent schedule.
good,Great pay and benefits. Hard work but you get paid for it. The insurance ia the best around. Most management is very top notch and works with you. A few are some of the most horriable people you will ever meet.
good,I worked in the warehouse at UPS I thought the training process was fairly quick and understanding and the actual work when you’re on the floor is not really difficult easy to do can be tiring and exhausting however and you’re required to be able to life more then 70 pounds
good,"I really enjoyed working on the morning preload team. Upon promotion to the dispatch supervisor position, things changed. As the only dispatcher in the center, I was unable to take any days off for any reason"
good,"I was a contractor working at UPS. I was not a UPS employee, but they made me feel as tho I was. I worked their in multiple positions. Each one had its own challenges. I enjoyed myself and looked forward to coming to work everyday."

good,I enjoyed working here being on my own and driving my own truck. I started at the busiest time of year. It became stressful at times but the more you get used to it the easier it becomes.
good,"It was a really relaxed job but also fast paced. Was always busy and kept on moving. Even though it's a seasonal job, it's still real fun. But really bad pay...the pay they provide you isn't enough for all the hard work you do."
good,Working for ups is a great experience. Some days can be tough but it is a good work out for your body and a good learning experience. Can be hot some days working in the trucks.
good,I learned to just get my work done and ask questions later. i learned to prioritize my time very well in there. I learned how to not go to sleep for days because i had work and school back to back.
good,Most of your time is occupied with work. Very fast paced environment. Short breaks with strenuous work. Good chance of raises in pay after probationary period.
good,"I highly recommend working here because of the vast amount of benefits. UPS has a great benefits package, it is the best among other local companies. Also, they pay really well also."

good,"Good job , yearly raises, fun coworkers, good pay for work done,"
good,"The hardest part of the job was making sure everything went to the right place and nothing was in the wrong spot. If a package was in a wrong bag or sent to the wrong area, we would get in trouble. That was the hardest part of the job besides maybe the heat within the summer months. There was no air movement in most the building, but water was given to us every hour to make sure we were hydrated. Supervisors cared for the most part how we were doing and would check up regularly. It was a good job for the most part, and easy enough to go through the day without thinking too hard."

good,UPS was a great part time job. It provide a set work schedule as well as benefits after your first year. The only downside is that it takes a long time to move up in the company.
good,the company provides good compensation package and benefits to all employees. the number of calls we receive each day is high but the job is easy once you get used to it

good,"Great place to work. If your franchise owner is cool, you got it made. Very good place to learn on the job because it 's usually very busy and co workers are friendly.   Customers ask a lot of questions and are inexperienced so if you are friendly and helpful, they appreciate it."

It allowed me to gain an learn new experience in logistics & manufacturing, needs better management and warehouse workers , management did not support us as far as job performance.Fast pace work place the hardest part of the job getting the job done by yourself because your partners not keeping up & you cant leave until your job is done and partners are done. the most enjoyable part of the job passing out food on fridays"

A typical day of work was meeting the driver at a specific location and time each day and delivered packages until the truck was empty.

Disgusts me that the person deserving of the permenant part time position there was let go because the manager was hiring based off the wrong intentions.

The only downside to working UPS is that in the summer there are no hours to go around.

But I not only got paid well for part-time, I received some of the best benefits someone in my position in life could ask for. I had to have all 4 of my wisdom teeth pulled, and didn't pay a cent thanks to the coverage. Plus, the area I was working in allowed me to work with others without having to interact with them. Everyone was spaced out, the building was super loud, so conversation was pointless and everyone was too tired to talk anyway. It made keeping to myself very easy, and I really enjoyed that.

Teamwork was not so evident as in my current job but great bunch to work with. The hardest thing was the shift I had but waited for 4 years to change but to no avail. I most enjoyed the type of work we where part of and to see the final product roll out the shop.

I like this because keeping busy helps me feel much more productive when the day is finished.  Whether I am addressing customer concerns, dispatching drivers to the work, or completing the regular tasks like employee time cards, I am able to keep busy.  My superiors are always helpful when I need something from them which is excellent.  As far as the hardest part of my job, I would have to say its during the holidays of course!  Finding the time to complete all of my daily tasks while addressing customer and driver needs can be challenging at times.  This definitely helps to keep the job interesting.  My favorite part of this position is the opportunity to experience what happens closer to the actual delivery of the packages.  Up until I started this position I only experienced the package handling operations.  This experience has been very rewarding in developing better customer service skills."

good,"Packages were delivered to the door of both residential homes and businesses, sometimes requiring a signature. Management was clear about what was expected for the position. Co-workers were knowledgeable and helpful. Being on the move the entire day was the hardest part of the job but it was also one of the most enjoyable parts."
good,"It was always very noisy and busy when first coming to work no matter what time of day. I'd load thousands of parcels daily. I learned that somebody has to do it. Just like somebody has to deliver the pizza or somebody has to fix your car; somebody must load these packages unto those trailers, thus, my job was essential. Management was always cool and understanding. Very straightforward. My coworkers were always busy working just like me, not very much time to socialize there but when I did it was always cordial. The hardest part of the job is when it's really cold out and there's no heat in the building and I still have to maintain the same pace or I'll back up the conveyor belt which in turn backs up everyone else's work (which seldom happened). The best part of the job was that I worked nights so had my entire day available to me."

Which can be a challenge but I always try to help them an any way I can."

Before we leave the driver organize the boxes to make sure they are in order. Once that is complete we start our route. i have learned how to use the scanner for the boxes and they way to exit the truck when delivering a box. The hardest part of the job was walking up very big hills if the truck couldnt fit or delivering a box at night to a house with no street lights. I enjoyed being a helper because i had a cool driver and we got to listen to music as we worked so work flew by on some days.
good,Hard working job no time for play. Management wasn't scared to get there hands dirty and help you work.

good,"I've worked for UPS the past 3 peak seasons, as a seasonal driver helper.

There's a lot of great opportunity working for UPS, if you have the drive and work ethic they are looking for..Just 2 months into my year round employment (beginning of August) the center manager of the location I work at offered me a opportunity to be a cover driver. While it's unknown at this time when I'll start driving, it just goes to show that if you give the company 100%, they will give back to you in return. The work is very hard and fast paced but I feel extremely accomplished at the end of my 3 1/2- 4 hour shift every morning that I leave, & I'm very much looking forward to working what will be my 4th consecutive peak season working for UPS outta Rome, NY! :)"

good,I loved working for UPS cause it was a great learning experience. They take time out to show you the proper way of stacking and packing a delivery truck. Management came and checked to see how I was coming alone with the job. UPS treat there employees like family and care about one another.

good,UPS has provided many opportunities for personal growth. I have been able to participate and gain experience in multiple areas of management. Most positions are part time positions and going full time is lengthy in some areas.
good,A tipical day at work at this location would start from opening the store. Making the money count everymorning making sure that each register has 200$ and enough change. Prepare the weighing machine. Then open the gates and assit customers who need help. An if there isnt any customer finish packing items we have in the back. I will also sort out our mail box holders mail everyday.

good,"Although people who don't even work at UPS know that it can be a demanding job, it was quite an experience I will never forget and I regret that I had to move and leave my job there. I was a sorter as well as an unloader for all of the packages that came in. It could be intense; some nights you come in and the trailers could be 100 degrees, and you have an hour to unload an extra long trailer, but it felt good to be accomplishing something and being part of a team that helped people in need everywhere, not just in the Mesquite area. If I had the chance, I would love to go back or at least work at another UPS facility in the area."
good,productive great place to work.only draw back was part time
good,I worked two shifts when I was employed with ups.

good,"I’m looking for a career instead of a job, it seems like I work really hard but I don’t see the money I work for. The hours are good, but I’m not full time, and that’s my goal is to be full time"
good,I did not like this job the work was too overloading for most employees especially during holiday hours. Your break was not enough time for you to recuperate and get yourself back together. I would not recommend this job to many people
good,It's hard work. A lot of people dont wish to do the work without fulltime benefits and pay. It is a good part time job with great benefits (after 9 months) & flexable hours (4 shifts). But they dont give enough hours in my opinion.
good,It’s been excellent working for the company I’ve learned that it doesn’t just take the machine work but also real people with the same class working individual would have i for one have grown inside the company and it’s pretty cool to know your the one who made sure everyone’s delivery’s make there destination
good,"UPS salaries are the highest of the major delivery services.  During busy delivery times, delivery drivers can easily work 12 hours per day.  One must ""play it by ear"" during the peak season."
good,"Well to start I like the idea of working for ups so this position was my first step into ups as a driver helper so overall I have no idea what the actual work culture is like I only hear about what goes on through my driver. The interview process was straight forward I was the first to arrive and was dressed business casual vs my peers I got my paper work sorted and was offered 16.80 an hour which was awesome. I finished the interview, and he offered me the job on the spot. Now this is where things got confusing I applied specifically for the Lakeville driver helper position however after about 1 1/2 weeks they still did not contact me with my position or where I was to go, so I asked for some work from the person who interviewed me, and he gave me an Apple Valley position instead they overall have bad communication and I'm working the Apple Valley position till the end because my driver likes me and does not want to have it changed. I could go on about the website being unreliable or glitchy the training is helpful but not comprehensive etc but overall I love delivering joy for my job. I cannot stress enough the power of delivering gifts at Christmas time. The work is very hard up here in Minnesota we have glare ice everywhere had to put screws in my boots to stop myself from eating sh1t which I have done 4 times so far. I hope to move up in the company and continue my employment past peak. On average, I move 15miles (ca. 24 km) a day through snow in winter boots my thighs are on fire i was told by my driver you lose on average 20-30 pounds doing this job and im a beliver lol."
good,"Ups is good fair place to work nice people , good hours , no really hard task they have good benefits, discounts ,and pay for your school it a nice place"
good,Working at UPS was a an amazing experience. The company realized my handwork and dedication and I quickly worked my way up into management. The center manager was a tremendous help and if I had any questions I felt comfortable to ask. Great overall experience.
good,"Benefits, abnormal hours, great pay, benefits paid by company. great people, work outside, rain snow blizzard, heat and humidity. fun job great people"
good,Not enough balance between work and family. Too much responsibility on drivers to cover other workers mistakes. Management believes workers dont work fast enough.
good,The management is very unorganized and tacky. The people who work there are really nice and they offer wide options of transportation if you dont have your own.
good,Great opportunity at UPS unfortunately scheduled hours conflicted with being a single parent and daily activities. Enjoyed meeting deadlines for on time packages deliveries and quotas.
good,"Working here was fun, it kept me busy at times it got draining just doing the same things over and over. Put this box there, put that box here, all day and it’s dusty in there."
good,"Strenuous job that requires a lot of conditioning to do comfortably. A lot of heavy lifting. To prepare yourself, you should stretch and take in a lot of fluids"
good,I had a heat stroke have been since that day I'm good worker very positive trying to move to North Carolina I'm getting tired of Indianapolis trying something different but but too do that I need this job
good,"a typical day at work was the same except for they would change up you work for the day every so often and they would put you where ever you were really needed the most in the hub. I learned how to load a truck correctly, and also how to unload and sort a truck when it is being unloaded and also I learned how to load heavy items into the truck and also how to work at a faster pace. Management was ok not the best well not my full time supervisor wasn't the greatest or the nicest but my part time supervisor was really nice and he helped me when I really needed the extra help or he would have someone else come help me in my trailer when I really needed the help. The workplace culture was good but I mean it was to hot or to cold in the trailers with the weather change and we had to dress for the weather each day. The hardest part of the job was when you had to work at a fast pace to get your truck loaded at times because packages are coming down so fast and you are usually the only one in the truck so you have to load fast to get the truck loaded and to keep your light off. The most enjoyable part of the job was it was only four hours each night and I worked over night so that I was off of work in time for me to get my kids up for school but we were working four hours to do eight hours of work each night and you couldn't go home usually till your truck was done."
good,"A typical work day as a service provider at UPS 9.5 10 hour day. That management make the job harder and stressful, good work culture but a hostile work environment. The pay is great."
good,"I don’t get lunches breaks vacation any kind of benefits And no sick time and no family time, I’m Working for them just to get by. I love the people that I work with but I am literally working just to not even survive it feels like I love working there but I need a future for my family and my son"
good,Very good experience and work environment. A lot of good employees very friendly hard-working and also able to work together. Got some understanding supervisors
good,I had a great experience at this job it taught me a lot of great qualities as well as helped me grow as a management person and has definitely prepared me for any other job that i go to next.
good,I would definitely give it a other shot . If the opportunity was there I would take it. I would definitely recommend a friend or a relative. Just be ready to work during peak season.
good,I had to just deliever heavy boxes sort boxes out go to big buildings collect packages . but it was great I loved working at ups it was easy money. The best part was lunch time and meeting celebrities
good,Being a package Handlers at ups is a very tricky Tritons and hard job the boxes are some times heavy and some are light you never know. They paid 15$ a hour but you only worked 3-4 hours a day so the pay wasn’t good
good,Very physically demanding and management responsibilities are vast. Overall a good company. Benefits are amazing for union employees. And pay is competitive.
good,"I got lucky and worked with a driver that went to the mall, so I had a blast working with him."
good,I was a driver helper at UPS for the holiday season of 2018. It was a good job and I enjoyed working there. I liked the driver I worked with. I'd definitely work there again as a seasonal worker.
good,"Working at UPS was a fun and very fast paced place, it was not a climate control place but the employees were very friendly and helpful...so I would recommend UPS to others"
good,A typical day is loading 600- 700 packages a hour and moving from different truck to get that done.I learned how to work with other. Management are always put in a position to over work the handlers.
good,"Working for UPS Freight was a great experience! They train every employee and provide more than enough information before they set you free on your own. If for any reason you do not feel confident, there are plenty of team leaders and mangers on the floor to help answer any question. The mangers will have one on one evaluations to coach you on things you may need to work on. Overall a great company to work for!"
good,Good place to work if you are looking to further your career. They hire from within and will teach you skill to take away even if you leave that will always benefit you.
good,busy fast pace job the job teaches one to be more responsible in the fact that we deal with a lot of personal information. the hardest part of the job was barely having time to eat lunch
good,"Management needs to take classes. Not all are bad, the job is fun and easy; it also help you stay fit. One Supervisor was very rude, she didn't have any management skills All she did were lie or the employee."
good,I absolutely love my job. I have learned a lot from the experience. The management jumps back and forth on expectations. Will not back their part-time supervisors over their hourly employees. (at the particular center that I have been assigned.) This is a growing issue with past part-time supervisors and why they have walked out of the job.
good,Ups was a great job. It brought our a lot of character and traits of myself that I didn’t have. Working at ups forces you to be disciplined and also reliable. Although it is hard work I saw it as a workout everyday.
good,The job is high manual labor which is not for everyone but I didn't mind to bad. Pay was good and there were chances to move up depending on what your looking for. I just couldn't manage this job with my school.
good,"Sometimes no matter how much you with discipline, most of the time is more about how much phisicaly you are capable to achieve the results. The management needs more tools to encourage the labor."
good,This was a seasonal job. The pay was very low. you had to work a year before receiving benefits. A typical day was handling packages for a few hours a day.
good,"i realy liked working there my co workers were nice but could not get "
good,I enjoyed working with this company. The job was just seasonal .I was told that I would have an opportunity to stay full time .but when it came to the end of the season management became very messy as far as knowing who was staying or not.
good,"Tipico degli ambienti che vivono di logistica. Sempre nuove sfide: poco riguardo per la vita al di fuori dell’ambiente lavorativo."
good,"I really enjoyed my job at UPS.  The hours of a loader are not great if you have kids at home that you have to take to school, unless you have someone to help you.  Other than that if you are looking for a manual labor type of job, this is for you."
good,UPS was a very busy and hectic place to work. The managers were awesome! I would have stayed but it was a temp position. The day's work always varied but there is a lot of support from the teams!
good,"Waiting for them to call me. Start times are different. They lie about where I would be driving and how many miles I would put on my car."
good,Working at ups was different from the jobs I normally worked I liked it because I was able to work with out having to really speak to anyone also unloading or loading helps working a person out because you have to lift and squat in order to move the boxes
good,I was a temporary seasonal driver helper helped the driver deliver and organize packages for the upcoming stops my driver was very helpful and was very hands-on with instructions
good,"UPS was awesome. I worked with a great team starting off as an inbound part time Supervisor with the sunrise team, and ending as a training Supervisor"
good,Working for UPS was a fun first job. The experience I got from it definitely helped me build my confidence and customer service skills. I felt like it was really laid back and easy as well.
good,I would show up to work at 4 and immediately start working on whatever task I was given and i would work until that was finished. management is amazing
good,Job was temporary didn’t really get to know the job was only part time when I was going thru welding school don’t have much to say about the job but seems like it wouldn’t be to bad to start a career
good,"In short, the people are great, management is just fine, and I had no problem with the overall job culture. A lot of the time though, my coworkers and myself were held well past hours and that fact made no contribution to our opportunities for advancement or increase in pay."
good,Ups is a good company to work for as a career  the benefits are excellent and the pay is great it is a very fast pace environment and the hours are long
good,I like the job I wish I can work at any ups but I just don’t know to apply  I wish somebody can help me cuz I really loved my job I didn’t have any problems there
good,Working at the UPS Store is a lot of fun and a fantastic learning experience.  This is a fast pace working environment. You work with a very interesting public.
good,Seasonal position left because work slowed down. Good place to work at. Typical day of work was busy loaded and unloaded trucks. Handled all packages for company.
good,High production expectations. Great customer service. Great benefits. Changing technology and advancement and retirement. Opportunity for advancement and growth with company.
good,Delivered packages to UPS customers and assisted driver with deliveries. Worked in the the Florence Ky. area and had a full time schedule while looking for full time employment.
good,UPS is a fast pace working company. it is too stressful if you have children. start at your normal time but leaves later than the time you suppose to.
good,If you are looking for a place for long term employment then UPS is where you should go. My short time working there everyone was great and I could not have asked for a better working experience.
good,I loved working at UPS the ladies I worked with were caring and sweet. The job was very demanding and required lots of extra time and attention to complete tasks.
good,"I loved the fast paced of the job. Meeting new people each day from all over the place. The hardest part of working at The UPS Store was coming in everyday and knowing you would be reprimanded for something the you had no control over. I loved designed and creating one of a kind banners, business cards, and other print jobs for personal and business use. I have loved working for The UPS Store off and on since 2006."
good,"The job was great for me since I am a student and needing quick hours with a decent pay ($10). Management wasn't helpful to me getting hours or working on my schooling, however, my driver was very accommodating. He would give me extra hours so I can get money to do things. "
good,"Loaded product into freezers. Helped driver with directions. Planned, organized and effectively used space in trucks. Pads, stacks, and secures items in position on truck to prevent damage during shipment.Ensured all package are accounted for and also signature received. Work in conjunction with the driver to expedite delivery. All package are organized within the vehicle and the quickly walks the package to the customer. Ensure three point contact are being fallowed as required by safety guideline."
good,My first day working there kinda gave me a little scared because I thought the job was going to be hard or the co workers were not friendly but after working there I enjoyed it very much the coworkers and leaders were really nice and the job was really easy.
good,UPS freight is a very good company to work for. This provide a very valuable service to the community. They have very dedicated employee that work very had to man the company successful.
good,"I actually worked for The UPS Store, not UPS.  The UPS Store is a franchise that works very closely with UPS and USPS.  I learned a lot about shipping, printing, postal service regulations, cross-selling, up-selling, money management, etc.  I was promoted to assistant manager within 1 year of employment."
good,Working at  UPS I found myself in an environment where I can stay focused on my work and didn’t have to do too much running around. I did a lot of work on a short amount of time because of that atmosphere .
good,Good place to learn and see how courier shipments are handled and controlled through this fast paced transit hub. Time management is key in ensuring KPI's are met.
good,Great place for long term job. Work for your money. Good opportunity to move up in the management side and as a driver. Great benefits for employees as well.
good,The average day was to wait on the call from your driver for your start time. We would then run packages from the truck until it was empty. It was a lot of work however it was good pay.
good,"Being a Driver Helper was a great seasonal job. It was great working with the drivers. It is hard work though, hard on the body. But it was worth the money and fun work environment. I wouldn't mind working for UPS again."
good,Working at UPS is fun and rewarding. The challenging part is the part time to full time hiring process. A typical day would be driving around to different locations and delivering packages.
good,"Typical day is based on what is available to process."
good,This was a very stressful and demanding a lot of physical labor. You worked the early morning hours to unload and load trucks for the day. you had usually 2 to 4 trucks you had to load in 4-5 hours.
good,"I must say that had I had a choice in the matter I would have stayed on at UPS until I retired. This company really took care of the employees who took care of the company. I loved the camaraderie of everyone working together as team members, and not Drivers up here, and warehouse employees down there. No, everyone was an equally important part of the team andt required team work in order to keep the process running smoothly. Safety is a big issue and I believe that's  got to be a number 1 priority in dealing with this type of work environment.  Keeping the public,and employees safe through proper training and proper equipment like trucks and warehouse machinery is vitally important in providing quality, and professionalism to our customers.. I  really enjoyed the experience and took a lot of pride wearing the UPS uniform and I desire to find full time, permanent employment with a comparable company, if not with UPS."
good,Management dedicated to meeting quotas. Training was adequate and company meets the needs of the employees by satisfying break needs and listening to requests.
good,"I worked for the store under two different owners. the second owner was terrible. very money hungry and greedy. if anything went wrong with a shipped order, even if it was driver error, they were quick to take it out of our paychecks without telling us."
good,"A typical day at work consist of counting the money in the draws, opening the gate, unlocking door. Then helping costumers with packages getting sent, or copying things, making things on Microsoft office for costumers, and helping them in anyway we could."
good,The overall consistency of working at the UPS Store 6416 was great. The clients were great but the overall work environment was not very great. I would come in and have great anxiety because the assistant manager did not like me and he made sure it was known. I was told not to be very friendly and make sure you get the sales and the sale is all that mattered. I like the company but didn't like the overall environment that the franchisee created
good,Had to load packages at a very quick rate to achieve goals and meet deadlines. Had to focus on thousands of packages per day to ensure they were sent to the correct location
good,Working here isn't for the faint of heart its fast paced and you must always be on your game. Management use re-verse physiology towards its employees to generate speed in the warehouse. on the upside employees are apart of the union so you do have protection from Upper Management.
good,Great Job to get you through college. Excellent benefits and college tuition reimbursement. Room for career opportunities as well. Hard Hard work so bring your A game!
good,"Other then a lack of benefits and advancement, this was a very good job for the fact that your days flew by. Constantly busy and always able to make a customers day."
good,"Everyone was friendly and safety was a must I like that. They made sure everyone had what they need they always came to made sure everyone was on its the best job ever. I really enjoyed the experience I received at UPS, my co workers was willing and able to help out. Awesome supervisors and I really like how they show you how things are done and expected."
good,Its a fast pace job that keeps you moving and busy. I learned good safety habits and lifting techniques and how to stay hydrated and healthy doing my job. Management is good it could be better. Its a good place to work good people good motivators and decent supervisor. The hardest part of the job Is working with employees who are not efficient as you are and having to pick up the next person slack. The easiest part of the job is the job itself.
good,It was very physically and mentally demanding.  I learned how to deal with and take the good and bad of a job in a positive manor.  Management made the job harder and more stressful than it had to be.  The employees really made it easy on each other with team work a family environment encouraging each other motivating each other and making the best of it making it fun.  The pressure of getting as much work done in a short window of time.  The benefits success of the company and job security!!!
good,"Managed 3 to 4 persons daily"
good,"This company has a lot of positions but while I  was working here the women received unfair treatment as far as advancement. the union did for not fight for us. At this time of employment no women could be a driver, or participate in Sports Activities or betting. I alone fought to make sure women were treated equal. As expected my position there became to stressful to continue. it became racist battle between the Men in charge and myself. The New Manager hired was a racist toward my color and gender. and I refused to go back."
good,"This was a great temporary job, my driver was really great and everyone had a good attitude throughout. The only thing i would say is they were unorganized and didnt pay a lot. I cannot speak for fulltime employees because i was seasonal."
good,"Working for a franchise owner of the UPS company, I was able to receive good raises, and fairly quickly. Worked great around my schedule and very personable company."
good,"Lots of hard work, your mileage may vary as these are private franchises. I learned a lot there but to be honest I think I wasted 6 years of my life there. I should have moved on early after learning what I could there."
good,"A typical day at work here can be hard on the body, but is easy to get used to over time. Loading trucks for usually five hours a day is nice if you want to stay in shape, and this company helped me get through college, but I need full time opportunities at this point in my career."
good,I enjoyed ups although they cut yours hours. And sometimes all over the place due to New building ..which made evrything new to co workers and the mangers just kinda of try an see what happens
good,I really loved UPS Teleservices because while I was working there I was in my desired element. (Technical Support) This is something I absolutely love to do.
good,i enjoyed working for UPS. Its a great work environment every ones very nice.  management wasn't very nice at first. the hardest part of the job was not having a stable work time.
good,"I loved working there, great coworkers, worked well with the hectic life of a mother of two kids. Pay was great, hours were perfect. Very easy to work with."
good,I am open to new experience jobs I also have multi jobs experience am also a hard worker on a typical day am also a hard worker willing to learn management position
good,"Working for ups was very pleasant work environment, however after the seasonal hire the ending process is not so easy of an transition. But working for the company is great"
good,Very fast paced work environment. No time to slow down. And be prepared for management to be on you at all times. Pay is good after probationary period and benefits are astounding.
good,"Very friendly people, you learn a lot about measuring and weighing items and also you learn how to work at a fast pace, Co workers are very nice you enjoy going to work everyday."
good,my work day would be of helping organize the truck an deliver packages off at door steps also got to keep a good pace so you can finish your job I time
good,"I became a Notary here. this job was a great! I also became a certified livescan here too. This job gave me lots of opportunities, the only downside i had with this job was at the time there was NO room for growth"
good,constant work place. That keeps you very busy the employees were the best including the employers. it had great benefits .
good,"Typical day at UPS requires a lot of moving around. It is very fast pace and once you get behind you'll be behind all day. The management there is alright, it could be better"
good,"I was a Seasonal employee. So, I was not there too long. Overall, my fellow co-workers were pleasant to work with. I would return if the option was given to me."
good,"low pay and everything else is ok, i have learned a lot about customer service by working there and how the post office system works"
good,The work was very easy and all the coworkers and boss' were fun and everyone got along. I unloaded and loaded packages in the trucks. Only a peak season job.
good,"Customer Service, cashier, great team players, no hard part to the day, enjoyed serving customers. Management is great at this company."
good,"Its a very fast job to work.. The hardest part of working for UPS is in and out the truck nonstop.  You really have to be fit for this job. I enjoy working for UPS Because you get to meet alot of people. "
good,"It had a very friendly atmosphere and the supervision was very understanding, and very patient. Each employee was friendly to the next. I definitely wish to work here again once i'm able. I don't wish to pass up another opportunity to work for them. The hardest part of the job was keeping track of the packages. It got overwhelming for myself."
good,Drivers are great to work with. but very little hours. and i reapplied for a job opening and they never responed. i did learn how to use the scanners on the job
good,"Managing and implementing team oriented operational goals."
good,the driver was a very happy patient worker and trained me well that is why I worked with him for 5 years. the job was fun because my coworker worked hard right along side of me. I liked learning a new job because my coworker was a good teacher. liked working outside even if it got cold.
good,"UPS was a great company that I worked for, great benefits, great people, it had its ups and downs. if you wanted to be a driver, you would have to wait almost 10-15 years just to be able to be approved,  if you wanted to leave for school you had tell that you were leaving for school and wanted to come back to for company or they would put you down as you quit and then cant be rehired to the company. but I just wanted to better my career and my life. the management was good , met a lot of my closest friends there, great environment."
good,"Crazy non stop work. It was ok but the paid was weak, but great benefits. You have to have a second main job to work there, the most enjoyable part was leaving"
good,"All through this was an over night position, there was always a very busy work atmosphere. This position  kept me on my toes and opened my eyes to the inside details of operations management. This was a fast pace position and gave a great experience in critical thinking skills."
good,"Working third shift loading and unloading trucks, Riding with driver; making sure that the packages were delivered correctly."
good,"Greeting customers in a friendly, helpful atmosphere, the Owner was very appreciative and caring towards her Employees."
good,"We supplied easy to use routing and logistics software and training, I loved the travel and helping companies achieve better business operations. Great support team and management."
good,"Assist Camp members with everyday activities such as registration, watch kids at night, assist with packing and unpacking."
good,"goes by fast, co workers are friendly, talking to customers, nothing is fun its all enjoyable, manager is super nice. I learn something new everyday."
good,"I would go in and basically go to my work area, make sure it was clean, wait for my packages to come down the belt, I would at that point grab them put them in the desired truck and continue this while engaging with fellow co-workers. The hardest part of my job I would have to say was dealing with the belittling talk of the management. It was rough mentally. But the most enjoyable part I would have to say was the interaction with coworkers."
good,"very productive and organized work space. I learned allot about loading and unloading packages and the importants of filling quota. my coworkers were cool to work with and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job mainly was working in hard weather conditions, like snow, sleet, and rain. The most enjoyable part was getting a check for doing something important."
good,"You lift boxes, a lot of boxes, really fast. dark, same temperature as the outside year round. Everyone is helpful and a hard worker, that does not mean they are friendly optimistic people, just hard workers. Seems to be a disconnect between upper and lower management, or at least lack of communication. There is a reason they hire 9 people a week. Also people are just promoted to managerial positions without any type management training which is full on potato."
good,I would meet a driver at a specific location and then spend the day helping them deliver packages. I did alot of up and down for the truck and work during the cold and snow.
good,"I spend my shifts sorting packages of varying sizes and weights onto color coded conveyor belts in order to ensure they go to the proper loading docks. Sometimes I unload trucks, sending their contents to the sorters. I am often shifted off my primary sort aisle to others, depending on where I'm needed most. The managers push us hard, but it is in our best interest. The faster we move, the less overwhelmed we are when we get blasted at the end of the night. Co-workers don't really have time to talk to one another. The hardest part of the job is the lifting. Some of the packages we handle weigh close to seventy pounds. Anything heavier is classified as bulk and doesn't come to us. The most enjoyable part of the job is socializing with my coworkers during the building wide break. Everything shuts down at the same time."
good,"Worked there during christmas season. Quite hectic, but very rewarding in experience. Nice people, decent environment."
good,"love to multi task at work and I like to always stay busy, I had my area to work and it was based on my timing which is fast, then the more your learn the area you are able to cross train and help co workers in different areas, the hardest part of the job was that I had the largest part of Texas mail for all Dallas that means I always had mail to sort"
good,UPS is a great company to work for if you are looking for any extra income. You can work for this employer in between your other jobs and earn some extra cash. I will recommend this place of employment to all my friends
good,"Work between 2 to 5 hours a day.  Management was ok if they know what they are doing. The driver I help is a great dude to work with. The hardest part of the job is dogs that are loose and running around the house and or the neighborhoods. Great work for college students, part-time jobs."
good,"This was a temporary position.  "
good,"•	Managed 5,000 to 10,000 shipping accounts at a time."
good,"great place to work for seasonal position"
good,"I handled shipping of packages, receiving payments, helping out with sorting mail, providing services such as printing jobs (large or small) to customers, and doing whatever job my boss asked to me do regardless if that meant I had to learn a new technique or not."
good,"A typical day of work as a technical editor has the individual carrying out a variety of tasks that includes coordinating with personnel from other departments within UPS Airlines to secure approval to compose and edit company manuals.  It is the responsibility of the employee to edit and audit manuals as directed on a tight schedule.  In this role, the editor will use various software such as Microsoft Office, Adobe Creative Suite, Acrobat and an XML editor.  The work group is relatively small so the work environment is fairly intimate.  The most difficult part of the job is being able to prioritize tasks and balance a workload in order of importance.  The best part about the job is the schedule."
good,"Good training programs, safety first, and stable company."
good,I was able to get my certification in forklift. Good work environment.
good,working is an experience of life because it keeps you motivated and it builds you up to any kind of job and to be on time is necessary of responsibility..
good,"I recomened working at UPS for the experience. They give you the opportunity to be come a part time supervisor with no experience, with an exceptional  pay in crease where it then becomes a dead end  job. There are so many cases of part time supervisors staying part time for as long as 10 years before becoming full time."
good,This has always been a great job. especially when you have the system down and when you and your driver make a good system to work by. walk every package to the recipients house. my co work was great and was a good person to talk to..
good,"Busy workplace, dealing with various customer needs and requests. heavy lifting, standing for long periods."
good,"UPS has great benefits, great pay, and job security that surpasses most. On an average day you'd come in move the packages in a timely manner with minimal mistakes. Within UPS I learned communications with employees, business logistics, and training. I would say the co-workers that where around me needed a little more push to do the job though over all was above average. The hardest part of the day was the wrap-up to get out in a timely fashion."
good,"You start on the drivers time and you end on the drivers time. you can be up early or out late depending on how many packages. I learned that its not an easy job your always on your feet and you need to be quick, gentle, and safe. My mentor worked responsibly and respectfully. Sometimes their un organized but at least the drivers get the job done. I wouldn't mind doing another seasonal job for them or let alone working for them as a part/full timer."
good,"Started this position as a part time opportunity. Benefits are great for me and my family so I continued employment. The only drawback is the shift hours are early morning, 3:00 am to about 8:00 am, which makes it difficult to find a full time position."
good,"Was a great job, fun and upbeat job, and was always great greeting the customers and seeing their happy faces and the familiarity of the same neighborhoods especially around that season, because it was closing in on Christmas time."
good,I enjoyed working for this company. I'm energetic and working at physically fast-pace that involves continual lifting works well with me.
good,You get up early and get started by 9 am and then you started shipping the packages on your truck until your finish. Everything has to done in a timely fashion.
good,"My typical work day was good. I was able to choose my own work schedule, work hours. Therefore I was kind of in charge. I learned about the U.S Census Bureau, as well as the people around the world and how they lived. Management was great we meet a few times a week. co-worker were great too, we all the discuss what happen as we went on our journeys. The hardest part of the job, was have citizens reject our questionnaire when it benefits the U.S"
good,If you apply yourself the work can be fun. Being rewarded with advancement is hard to come by.
good,A typical day at work is just unload trailers. I learn how to drive a forklift. Management was alright. Coworkers were alright. The hardest part of the job was working during the night. The most enjoyable part of the job was seen all the cool stuff that came through.
good,Excellent place to work and everyone gets a  long and works together to get the products shipped to the customer in an efficient and timely manner.  Management is there to assist you to perform your job more efficiently.
good,"Most likely 3-5 hours depending on volume"
good,"Short time to comment any further.  As far as my observation goes, everything is routine work.  Certainly I was not treated with reason and respect even though I was a temp."
good,Come in get assigned your door and unload the trailer in a timely manor.
good,"I managed all aspects of starting up, operating and promoting the store."
good,1. Delivered packages around the city. 2. Learned how to use a Scanner Dia pad for the packages that need to be scanned. 3. Management was good they let me work every day thru the week. 4. I meet new co-workers everyday they all where very nice. 5. Hardest part was finding the bar code numbers for the right area codes and houses. 6. The pay by the hour and driving around the city all day.
good,"I started out as a loader/unloader and because I was to quick they placed me in sorting. It was a great opportunity. I learned other skills, like sorting and the other employees at that location and time were great. We all got along great too."
good,"it was a good place to work,just loading containers i got along with everyone"
good,this job felt more like a trip to the gym with all the constant movement.
good,i learned a lot about customer service from this job as we are normally the face of ups and with that the hardships of people not recognizing that we are not a distribution place for their packages. Management was great most of the time.
good,"• Send, receive and verify inbound and outbound freight"
good,deliver packages from all overr the world during the Christmas holiday season
good,"UPS is a great company to work for, hands down. I found that the work did not challenge me enough. I found myself bored and unfuliflled daily. In the brokerage side, there didn't seem to be alot of room to advance and it seemed impossible to score a position at the corporate location. Alot of people are there just to have a job. If you are looking to make decisions and do different tasks this isn't the place for you. It's like and advanced version of an assembly line. However, there is a great deal that can be learned here about the business of brokerage...getting the opportunity to apply it-not so much."
good,I learned a lot on this job also but the job ended. I liked the overtime that I could work on this job and on all of the jobs that I have had very most importantly I was and am a team player who take the job very serious.
good,you work hard but only for a short period of time loading and unloading trailer with parcel and bulk mail
good,"Open the store. Assist customers with questions, shipping and packing, notary, mail services. I've learned how to pack and ship propertly. Mangement was friendly and helpful. Co-workers were dependable. Packing odd sized objects heavy lifting and dealing with irate customers were the hardest part of the job. Most enjoyable part of the day was having a very comprehensive boss."
good,"It's a lot of fun, few hours a day, and my co-workers are awesome supporters"
good,It is a day to day crisis center. That is what we do. Great people. The process of address concerns and the work life balance needs work. The salary is average for the industry. The greatest thing is the stablity of the company.
good,A typical day at work for me is different everyday. Everyday I have different customer concerns in which I have to answer to and handle within the hour of them calling them in. While working for UPS I have learned to be more dedicated to time management as well as the quality of my work. The hardest part of my position is trying to satisfy all my drivers while keeping the company's policy satisfied. In contrast the most enjoyable part of my job is dealing with customers on a daily basis knowing that I am potentially helping them with important and meaningful packages.
good,"It was not what I wanted, but the first thing I could get. $8/hr wasn't enough to live on."
good,the work enviroment is very fast paced so the days go by quickly

good,"I haven’t been working at UPS for a year yet, but it was one of the best jobs I’ve had. Respectful people, great work ethic, etc. My only problem is that I work outside by the airplanes. The weather sometimes its too cold or too hot but we can’t control the weather."
good,Must be energized and eat well. Was a cool job only prob while moving boxes the trailers are the same temperatures as outside. If it's cold out you bfreeze
good,"The work is easy, there's alway something to do. There's opportunity to grow and branch out into career positions. Scanning,"
good,"If work ups you can start with holiday peak season. This year pay 14.00 per hr."
good,Best organization but Karachi managment not perfect this is my personal experience  best service on time salary and bonuses and medical compensate all staff thorow any insurance company
good,I enjoyed working at UPS. I just wish they had more hours available for part time employees outside of peak season. It’s not a job meant to be your only source of income.
good,UPS is good place to work. great benefits to help take care of your family. strong union keeps wages up and benefits strong. The dentist could not believe how good.
good,great place to work if you are in process of getting a degree. Have a sense of purpose there. Late plane departure depends on you. Management is helpful and respectful
good,"Everyday at work was typically a fast pace day. Working at UPS, I learned how to move quickly and multitask.The managers there at the job were there to train you every step of the way. The hardest part of the job was making sure every truck that I was assigned to were loaded with every single package in time before the truckers departed from the facility."
good,Sorted and loaded packages to put on the trucks for the drivers. Fast pace and hard work great pay. Love working here with my wife good hours and nights go by quickly
good,We get paid well & the benefits are fantastic! I have learned multiple jobs on my shift so I can get more hours. It is very physically demanding but a good job if you stick with it.
good,"Their faults could be management doesn’t  know what they are doing they get moved around to much and don’t no their Jobs, but however it is fast paced room for advancement and great benefits!!"
good,I have been working as a seasonal helper so I would need to be full time for more rating asked for above but I have enjoyed working here and would continue if ever offered more than Seasonal helper
good,I didn’t have a bad experience at UPS. I will admit it is fast paced The supervisors were very helpful and co workers were also helpful. If you don’t like lifting and standing or working at a fast pace it’s not for you
good,"It’s cool being a Teamster (great health benefits) but the Union doesn’t really help anyone but the people who don’t deserve it. "
good,"Good training processes, security helper, beneficial, clean working gears, associate management, heating conditions air supply, lunch break, jeans, hard boots and hard hat in working area"
good,This job was a difficult job I wasn’t getting enough sleep after work I never had a regular schedule and I didn’t like my job there the job I had there was made for men I handled packages 50 lbs and more.
good,"The environment we work in daily evening and night is easy and shifts are adjustable to the schedule.Outdoors work experience is exciting and averages good training through school and industrial, residential,plus commercial management offers the best salary etc."
good,It was a Great job. I really appreciate how organized the job was when I worked there. The communication skills were very awesome with the supervisors
good,"Overall it was a good company "
good,"UPS was a great company to work for with many benefits. I enjoyed my time with the company, but it was time to move on. My typical duties would involve customer pick ups and deliveries, following all safety procedures, also ability to load/unload trucks in a timely manner. Overall, the environment was a positive experience."
good,"A very good company to work for."
good,"I was a package handler and it was a good job but just need more hours . I would say its a job for first time students, and it can be a good second job for people who can deal with two jobs ."
good,Ups is a really good job sometimes it may not be organized but the pay is great. I work from 10:30pm-3:30am so it makes me tired for school sometimes.
good,Working at the store is extremely easy and fun as the job itself isn't that tough but at the same time is very engaging. A good overall learning experience.
good,"My last job , I liked this job but the work you’re doing doesn’t match to what they pay you .. and they were messing with my checks so I had to go .. great job for a beginner though"
good,"I enjoyed working on part of a team, and being a vital part of the company during the busiest time of the year. I had task and job responsibilities I had to complete alone along with reports I had to fill in and send to upper management. I had to establish how many hours each person could be used for and make sure they got paid correctly."
good,productive place to work lots of friendly people and customers always made me feel welcome management was fantastic great culture didnt care about your race sexual orientation received great training from supervisors drivers and management work place culture  was fantastic would highly recommend this to anyone hardest part of the job was the different shipping options such as express Am standard and everything had to be delivered in a quick and timely fashion which was thrilling and exciting
good,"I have learned from my health and safety committee how to protect yourself and your fellow employees, how to develop a safe workplace,"
good,"Flexible scheduling is provided to the employees. Although the private owned stores do not provide benefits, there’s no where to move up in the company"
good,"UPS is a great job because of the Union and the benefits. Being apart of a good Union makes being an employee enjoyable. It feels good knowing that you have people in position to ""speak up'"" or ""go the extra mile' for you as an employee in order to make sure things are fair and that your needs are being met and respected."
good,It was intense you have to keep moving nonstop drive-in most of the time help  Move in  Packages for one place to another.. Time is at the essence you have to be on time
good,I was an assistant to the original UPS driver. I helped him deliver packages to people who order packages to be delivered to their door step. You had to adapt to whatever the weather dished out for that day and you felt every element
good,"Worked with hand tools and loading equipment. "
good,"Working at the store level can be stressful around Christmas time but mostly slow with waves of business. Pay is above min wage with no paid vacation or sick days. Very flexible weekly schedule and great coworkers along with the best boss I've ever had, can be tough on you at times but for the best."
good,"Il y a un quota de livraison a respecter et le but est de vider le camion de UPS a la fin de la journee. Travail sous pression et physique. Rapidite d'execution. Il ne faut pas ""faire l'amour"" avec les colis."
good,Need working fans in building. The overall experience was good. Managers and staff are helpful and very experienced. The training experience needs adjustments and but the pay is amazing and the ability to move forward in the company is even better.
good,"I had the opportunity to deliver packages to different cities that I had never visit, seen beautiful big homes and the atmosphere was gorgeous. The driver was a good teacher who taught me a lot."
good,After nine months medical benefits kick in. Tuition reimbursement is excellent. Part timers are union protected. Steady work through the year and peak season at the year end holidays are good for income.
good,It begins every day very early with a box truck packed to the gills. Looks very hard so early in the morning but the one thing then have with there employees is everyone has great working attitudes and when it looks like impossible were done I've been with them ever since my mod 20s now I'm in my late 40s I work holiday time but every year I always head back there I love it!!!
good,Lots of excellent customer service encounters...loved learning the area in much more detail due to customers living in areas I never been to around here
good,"You get stuck because you find real relationship at work , you built friendship here it great and the pay is okay we just got a raise but than the job isnt hard it easy"
good,"The benefits are awesome. Rats of pay sucks should be more because you only get PT hours as a part timer, 20 or less."
good,"I had a lot of fun in this environment. You mainly work by yourself in a trailer, but often times people come help you out or you help them when there are a lot of large boxes or packages. Management wasn't the greatest, but this may be due to UPS being part of the Union. Fast paced, great pay for part-time, and they have a lot of amenities you can use in there facility"
good,We’ll working at ups is a good job to start off with I mean work wit the drivers there cool people & also Delivering Packages is fun to && being a driver helper helps out a lot maybe when one of the supervisors come out see u doing a great job maybe someone will get the job Permanent that’s what I’m looking well may when I apply again this I prolly get the job
good,"hardest part of the job, traffic..lol. Most enjoyable, my customers, the people you meet . The pay of course and the benefits. A Typical day starts at 8:30 am and on average you're  pulling back to the building at 8:30 pm. I enjoyed the confidence of knowing after my hard work came great pay"
good,"I worked out on the rank for wing E, loading the p sections of planes. I worked there to pay off college, after I dropped out I still worked there for about a year until I needed more money and they didn’t offer full time. I was paid 10.10 per hour. I moved to a job 13 per hour but had UPS offered full time I would have happily taken the pay cut to stay. I suggest working out on the ramp it’s very relaxxed, the hubbbis kit so much."
good,"The only reason I left is because the pay wasn't enough for my lifestyle, The owners were great the hours were midday so that wasn't a problem there wasn't that many staff members so that helped it be more relaxed"
good,"Get to work on a designated route get to see new and old  customers, get to drive a company vehicle, don't have management looking over your shoulder all day sometimes get to work with other drivers. Everyone is really nice and helpful"
good,I have enjoyed working at UPS. It is a great company to work for and the work culture is really good. The management team at UPS is not effective as far as training and managing it's associates and the advancement of employees.
good,"Its an alright place to work, the pay is good but the work itself is very hard."
good,Assisted the driver and helped with daily routes during the peak season. Working anywhere between 4 and 10 hours. Made for good work and life balances.
good,"I worked part time in a UPS store which was a franchise. Learned a lot and had great  teamwork. Enjoyed the customers, many of which were box holders. The pay was minimum wage and would be hard to live on a full time employment basis."
good,fast paced work environment with lots of tasks to complete and you must be a good multitasker in order to be successful in this company. good management
good,"Drink lots of water, stay hydrated, don’t come to work on an empty stomach unless you have a snack to eat during break. WEAR LIGHT CLOTHING during summer and the RIGHT CLOTHING during winter, closed toed shoes/boots (not breathable). "
good,"Plenty of room for advancement, with UPS being union you’ll be protected by the union. After you put in sometime you’ll move up on the seniority list also."
good,"Great work environment and kind employees. The pay was great, and I wish I could have worked more hours. Luckily while I worked the weather was nice so conditions on the truck were not bad."
good,"It was a good job, good benefits and the staffing was very nice.also the pay was good because it was every week and the shift was very short and simple."
good,Helpful staff good work team available hours and great overtime and I'm looking forward in continuing to work the seasonal position again each year until I can get a permanent position
good,"Working as a seasonal package handler at the United Parcel Services was a interesting experience. I learned an abundance of life skills while on the job,it was still a good opportunity because it paid $15 per hour with a $150 bonus."
good,"I loved being my own boss basically and doing my own thing. I could go to work, throw in my headphones and just start unloading the box trucks. It was so easy to do and the night passed quickly."
good,I enjoyed my time working for ups... all of the team members were friendly and nice to work with on all shifts... I still go out and help the driver every yr as a xmas helper
good,You go to college this is a really good job. The work is easy and you get discounts. And they help pay for college. They give you tuition reimbursement for all your book amd for every class passing with a c average or better.
good,My day at UPS was stressful and very fast-paced to say the least. I handled packages that were considered high valued and had to put a lot of truck driver's information in the system.
good,Everyone is friendly. Some departments are more strict than others. Great place to work. Works recommend to everyone I know who is qualified to work there.
good,A typical day at work was usually fast-paced.  I learned how to deliver and sort packages out.  The management was rough sometimes.  Workplace culture was acceptable.  The hardest part of the job were when there were a lot of packages.  The most enjoyable part of the job was always having someone to talk to.
good,"It was a parttime job but very fun to work for ups,"
good,Great company to work for amazing benefits.  Not too many young people work in my particular area of UPS and with all the constant changes it makes life even more stressful when you are in an area not knowing anyone. Not the right fit for me And my personality.
good,"If you like to do cardio a lot , this is the place to be, fast pace , timing is the key to be a good employee, hard work everyday , love it , there's always something to do while you at in the facility"
good,My experience being a worker at ups wasn't too bad for me . Doing small sort was more easy. The unloading & loading trucks was difficult. Packages were to heavy for a person like me
good,"In delivery, your day is fast paced, physical and must mentally map out your day always dealing with intangibles that make a long day longer. In feeders, four out of five senses are in constant use and mentally you have to stay sharp."
good,"Overall, I would love to work with UPS again. The assignment was a temporary one but a very good one none the less. I am eligible for rehire, but the company is not hiring at the time."
good,This is a real company and doesn’t sugarcoat. Best company to start to get real world experience. Work hard and look for internal opertunities coz that’s the only way.
good,Excellent. freedom of working independently and setting my own hours. Assisting hr hiring and do orientations. Everyone was very helpful and friendly.
good,"I only worked st ups for a short time but I really enjoyed it. I would highly recommended working for this company.  They have amazing management st the "
good,it's a fine place to work that is fun with people your age. The hours are ideal if you're a student or if you have another job. they have education reimbursement as well which is awesome.
good,"fairly good job for the most part for seasonal work. Only about about a solid month but the pay is pretty good so"
good,Fast pace physically demanding job. I enjoy most my free benefits.  Work independently  and the Ability to multi tasks. Must work as a part if a team to accomplish a common goal.
good,"I enjoyed my temporary driver helper job at UPS.  It was both physical and fast-paced.  Two things that I enjoy tremendously.  My driver taught me many things concerning safety and time efficiency.  He also taught me how to organize the truck which helped deliveries go more smoothly.  My only regret is that I did not get hired on as a permanent worker.   Due to the time spent applying for the job, it would have been nice to have an ""exit interview"" in order to state my desire for a permanent position.  I would love to have the opportunity to work with UPS again in the future."
good,"Working in a 3rd Party Logistics within UPS, allows me to understand the importance of ensuring all shipment are moved in a timely manner to the customer.  Especially in the Medical field it is important that goods are delivered daily."
good,"For the brief time I was working for UPS, they treated me fairly and honestly. On the whole one of the better companies I have worked for. Given the opportunity I would work for them again."
good,"I loved the job. To me it was very easy quick in and out kind of job just wish I had got more hours because the pay was good but we only worked 3.5 to 4 hrs a day. Management wasn't a issue because it doesn't affect my work or stop me from doing my job. Every day was the same you never wanted to be there it was just a good company brand to work for with being said I just left for better opportunity and I want to go back to school as well instead of settling for a 9-5, to me there's more to life and I have been reborn through Christ Jesus and now I and ready to concur life and everything that comes my way as a blessing"
good,"This was an extraordinary job. Not because of the extremely poor management, or the lack of communication between the supervisors, but mostly because if you felt like you were being wronged, you were. From stifled pay to ignorant and arrogant supervisors, you are likely going to face problems regardless of who you were. Other than that, this is not the type of place to work if you're afraid of working hard. This job makes coming home and sitting on the couch a wonderful achievement for the end of the day and will likely leave you sweating buckets, especially during the summer. You'll find that the people here come from all aspects of life, culture, and personalities. When the sort isle wasn't undergoing constant changes in the sort order, it was an enjoyable place to joke with friends and have a good time. The union is a very good friend in this business and will help you face obstacles that will come, and will come frequently."
good,Overall review for starting out is poor with the pay and the coast of living and also rhey have you on call therefore you won't ever know what time your going too work.
good,Great experience people are awesome only chose to work a seasonal position due to relocating could pay better but can’t complain other than that......
good,Working for ups has taught me so much about mail services as well business services. This is a job best for upcoming self made business men and women.
good,"Managing in-bound and out-bound inventory."
good,My day started at 11:00am till 8 or 9pm and I really enjoyed helping my driver and getting my checks. The job required strength and stamina and I enjoyed that. I love working out and it seemed more like working out than a boring job. I wore work out clothes and my vest everyday and it was comfortable. The driver treated me with respect. It was difficult to obtain a social life during the season but worth it in the end.
good,"Some days seemed to be longer than they actually were, while other days flew by. It just depended on the volume of work that day."
good,"Being a driver's help was alot of fun. Stayed busy.  Develop a systematic pattern on making all delivery's safe and quickly as possible. "
good,No tengo que dar algún  consejo respeto cada regla.
good,"I overall liked my job there but the hours they provided were no good.never had a problem with any workers,but supervisors couldnt get hours right during week."
good,"Fast paced, no nonsense atmosphere. Very intense but enjoyable if you can handle the physical demands. Supervisor Mason was very understanding and actually cared about his employees."
good,"Loved my job, management was horrible the night supervisor was racist and he didn’t care who knew it. Several grievances were to be filed against this supervisor however he was never disciplined for his actions or behavior"
good,"The small sort goes through 3 different cycles, and each cycle is a very straight forward easy task. During the season time the volume of packages is very high and that is when it gets crazy. It is very doable though. It was a seasonal position, so the hours are very low to begin with until black friday comes around."
good,"UPS if worth it if you want to graduate debt free. You will make great friends at this location, but will also be pushed physically. The job is harder than you think, but do-able."
good,Hired us during Christmas season. Our boss told us on December. 31st we would be on call. But never called. I reapplied and they turned me down. Applied again and let me go through orientation and then sent a letter telling me they have a no rehire policy.
good,"I loved working for UPS. Love the physical paced working environment.  Had to leave to relocate but never was hired at another UPS.  Loved the hour's I worked, love the people and Supervisor.  Loved sorting packages and making the labels to put on the bags to go out.  Scanning and unloading trucks."
good,"Depending on where you work the nightly shift varied. I worked outbound in the hub. That consisted of loading containers that varied in size that went out to the airplanes to be shipped across the United States. "
good,Overall UPS is a good place to work. I believe every company has its pros and cons. The best part for me is the opportunity I was afforded to learn multiple areas within my site.
good,"Hired part time as package handler. 3 hours a day not enough to pay bills. Had I stayed I would have gone for manager or something. Do your job and no problem. There are extras, you need to know to ask."
good,I had good times at Ups i actually wouldn't mind going back. I had to leave because they didn't have any day time hours and I couldn't no longer work over night.
good,"The package handler position was worth more than the minimum wage offered for a few reasons. namely the pace and workload in the alotted time. I was loading 3 trucks to the brim with everything imaginable ,from letters and packages , to an entire Barnes and Noble store shipment daily. The people working these jobs deserve more money, but I think that's a common song"
good,"Cold in the winter. can lose some weight and stay in shape. I quit because i got sick and they gave me a do not rehire status. so, long story short.. no more UPS."
good,it was a good work place and they kept us supplied with ice and water which we needed to do our job correct and to stay in good health. I would recommend the job for others that like physical work.
good,UPS is a good company for experience with working with others in a team afford to accomplish a common goal. I learned a lot working for UPS and have really gained better communication skills.
good,Very physical job. And very hot warehouse. No A/C The hardest part was staying hydrated and the best part was the people. Very flexible when needed a day off or have an Appt. but also don't get paid for it.
good,If you are a strong person. Mentally and physically UPS is for you. I worked running the customer counter and worked in the warehouse. Very cold in the winter. The standing all the time was what got to me.
good,As a part time supervisor I got the opportunity to learn and train on job methods. Working with new employees was a good learning opportunity for me to get better at people skills as well as being able to motivate people. The job is fast pace and the environment is loud but you have a lot of fun if you’re with the right people
good,"I didn’t mind working there it’s just early mornings and not enough pay for me, and they expect you to work fast and hard you have to sort pieces of mail into the right zip codes and sometimes the managers will move you to different parts of the warehouse to do different things."
good,"Great company to work for, draw backs is the interference with Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday.  Most departments work a lot of overtime during these months."
good,"No matter if you were sick you had to come, it was really a team effort with you and your driver. Around the holidays there would be 800 to 1,000 boxes to unload everyday and when those boxes were off the truck and returns was made your day would be over. So depending on how fast you move is when you go home. Especially if you're working in a city area. All in all very fun and energizing don't the snow scare you when you put that pep in your walk you'll start to feel the heat!"
good,It is a place where you can get busy and not as busy since the rush hours are on and off. You learn to do a lot of things like packing correctly and also learning to manage different softwares
good,"I worked in a UPS Store, it was fast paced and fun. I enjoyed who I worked with. It provided basic skills in the office setting. I was able to start part time and move up to a managerial position."
good,"This is a great job if you can handle physical labor, and hard work, if you’re lazy don’t apply. It’s fast pace because everything is scheduled. But it have a wide range of great opportunities."
good,"Great working environment inside a beautiful corporate setting."
good,"My employment with UPS was seasonal. I really enjoyed my employment there. I worked with a gentlemen named Al, who taught me a lot about delivering packages to customers and how to interact with them when necessary."
good,seasonal but was a really good job good pay just Crazy Heavy Manual Labor Intensive almost thought i couldnt manage it in the first 3 hours and im 6'2 230lb
good,When you go into work and clock in the shift managers let you know what you will be doing...you take your position and unless you have to go to the restroom you work until you’re finished and if you’re not done at scheduled time you have to stay until it’s done...we have a supervisor that’s over the whole plant and he’s an amazing supervisor but we have these small managers that talk to their employees how ever they feel and does not care if you quit...I personally think that’s why the company has a big turnover...the smaller supervisors have their picks when it comes to employees which is totally unfair.
good,"Ambiance agréable, équipe dynamique, environnement correct et conditions de travail agréables."
good,UPS has a great reputation for providing jobs to young people that are working through college or otherwise want to work hard on a regular schedule.  There is a great opportunity to grow as person with a position at UPS.
good,fun place to work. no room for advancement. low pay. very detailed oriented job. lots of little things to remember. great co workers. learned a lot working there.
good,"Great pay and benefits. Very hard work however, and be prepared to work up to 12 hours. You are compensated well for your time but this company makes it hard to have any sort of social life."
good,Easy to get into an everyday flow because most hours were consistent. Steady pace and regular routing also helped with time management and getting the job job quickly and efficiently.
good,It was just a seasonal job it was a great experience excellent co-workers they really care about there employees and there safety it was a great experience and would recommend it to anyone
good,"My normal work day 3:30am - 7:45am.   However, during peak season the start times can be anywhere from 12:30am - 9:30am. Peak season begins at the 3rd week of November and continues until February.  I have learned working in an open warehouse is a big difference from working in an office environment.  The hardest part was dealing with the cold during the winter months.  The  most enjoyable part of the job is working early in the morning and getting off in time to enjoy the whole day and night."
good,I enjoyed this place. I learned a great deal. I would work there again.
good,I wish it was not seasonal only. I would have loved to have it be longer or permanent work. Enjoyable experience and loved learning the new area I just relocated to
good,"If you want to go to school and work at the WorldPort hwre in Louisville, then UPS is the place to be. But, you've gotta make sure that you can work in an extremely fast paced enviroment."
good,"A typical day at work was, on average, slow moving. There was a lot of information about the job aspects that I had to learn, however I learned them quick and completed them with efficiency. The hardest part of the job was the downtime where there was no work to be done. Similar to my current employer(CRUNCH) the best aspect of this job was the people I came into contact with."
good,I enjoyed working at UPS. Unfortunately this job was seasonal position but loved the work environment. The job was different from any delivery job I had done in the past.
good,"Once the work day began, there was always work to be done till the day was over. I've learned efficient ways to achieve production, and how to run a team."
good,Great pay long hours. Very stressful but the pay was plenty worth it. Only reason I left is to move my family. I actually loved working for UPS. I would go back if I could.
good,"UPS is an all around excellent employer. I am unable to find even one negative about this employer. My position was only seasonal. However, I have worked with them for the last 3 holiday seasons, in multiple positions and everyone is very kind and helpful."
good,"it was pretty fast paced in the center and very busy. I had good training. the management was really good at this job. I enjoyed working for brown and would go back to that job anytime,"
good,I took a job as a temp for the holidays. I was nice to learn the roads in the county in which I live. The driver I had worked with was well informed and familiar with procedure and routes.
good,"I really liked my job but unfortunately they let my assignment go, i wish they did, management was well, little unfair at time but thats everywhere. i learned how to pack things very well and it help me be more organized as a person"
good,"UPS is a good, solid company to work for. They offer great benefits especially for part time work. The environment is very fast paced and decisions have to be made on the fly in order to keep the business moving and productive as the nature of the business is very often open to significant changes throughout a given day due to a myriad of factors and variables. There is room for growth, although full time positions are hard to come by and since the operation of a package delivery company is 24-7, sometimes the hours are less than desirable in certain roles."
good,"supervisors were prompt with and trucks and workloads. pleasant working environment, great team to work with. fastpased  environment and heavy lifting involved."
good,I loved working for UPS as a Driver Helper.  You get paid to exercise.  It is a fast-paced job with great opportunities to interact with customers.  UPS is a great company to work for.
good,"Good company. Tough to get into. "
good,A great place to work but i was only hired for seasonal work.  I really would like to stay on full time or part time.  Being a good team player is really important as a employer at UPS.
good,Was too physically demanding for my health and there hours conflicted with my schedule. Being a single mom of three boys I have my hands full and need to manage my time carefully.
good,UPS Is a great company to work for. they have a good work life balance as well as a great structure to move up in the company. They are slowly warming up to the idea of changing the culture
good,Typical day includes inhaling a lot of dust and dirt. Heavy lifting and millions of packages. You get to learn that things get thrown very often. Great workout with great benefits
good,"Nice place to work I thought for the time I was there. Fun, goal oriented place. Nice bosses. Great location for anyone traveling from Chesterton, IN, Valparaiso IN, Westville, IN, Laporte, IN. "
good,I had a great time meeting new people and working with all the planes. It was really amazing to be so close to the jets and  being inside the back of the planes.
good,UPS is a great company. UPS offers great benefits and  tuition assistance. There are good opportunities to advance within the company. UPS is a fast paced job that will keep you physically active.
good,It was only temporary but it was productive and worked out with my schedule while I was going to school. Got to experience different areas in the warehouse.
good,I earned $10 an hour doing different duties.  It was better working the night shift as opposed to the morning shift because the morning supervisor was not very helpful or friendly she just complained if you were moving too slowly.
good,"UPS was and is a great place to work. The management weren't as organized as need be,but other than that I would refer  someone willing to work to UPS!"
good,the company was fun they were all nice and the staff helped you out when you needed help i did not really like the hours they made you feel at home and good friends
good,"The management will try to make your check at little least, they always try to take some hours off . Always keep in mind of your hours and tell them.."
good,UPS is an agressive place to work in an active environment. The pay is great but the hours are subpar. It's not recommended to stay employed over 4 years.
good,Ups taught me how to work under pressure. The company made me achieve things in my life that I couldn't have done without them. For the blood sweat and tears that u put into it makes u have loyalty to a company that u can't think about another life outside of it.'
good,Work on line scanning and placing items for shipping very fast paced. Everyone is scanning product or going to get right product to ship. Everyone is very friendly
good,"Had free health insurance, union covered, paid every week, part time job either pre load or re load shifts. Most every one got along, some managers ok others not."
good,"how to stock, how to read a label, the hardest part of the job was the amount of scans I had to get per minute/hour. I enjoyed working at ups its a very stable career job for anybody trying to be something"
good,I worked as a driver assistant helper for the holidays.  I would meet the driver at one location and went with him to deliver packages to customers.  I enjoyed the fast pace of the job as it made the time go by.
good,Working at UPS was very rewarding.  The staff was always helpful and concerning.  My typical day was delivering packages to residential homes driving a golf cart in the community.  The most enjoyable part of the day was meeting new people on my route.
good,It is a decent job that is very body stressing and very awkward hours.  The job self is easy and great the only thing is you work in all conditions except lighting and snow and you are supposed to stack boxes on a plan in a timely manner in a cramped space and that is were the hard part starts
good,"I worked a seasonal shift and it was great. I wish it was more than seasonal because I loved working there, but you just have to reapply each year, until invited on as a permanent employee. Miss this place."
good,Great steadability. Love how you can leave work and come back later if something comes up. Ex: family emergency or you get sick.  Hours are great. Over all this is a great company to work for. I'm looking to advance my career and expand my horizon.
good,Management a la carte selon les compatibilites des salaries
good,Extremely hard work. Overall worth it eventually once you can become a driver. UPS takes good care of their employees and is a great company to work for.
good,"nice people work is hard if u lazy don't apply!!!"
good,"Very busy job great pay and benefits great place for a hard dedicated worker."
good,Very challenging but at the sametime a workout the employees are okay some of the supporvisors are nasty with  their attitude but if you doing your work you wont notice
good,"This company is well orientated. My experience was very clean and organized, the work flow is consistent, and the people are professional. I enjoyed working for this company."
good,"Long days, lots of work. Time went by fast. People, driving skills. For the most part did good job with employees. That could use some improvement. That's mainly directed at hourly employees. Amount of work required to do each day. Saying that i'm UPS employee."
good,"Hard work at first learning zip codes, next day air to secondary being tested for zip zoning . Learning hazardous materials and unloading and loading truck . Learning proper way to pick up packages . Enjoying short shift ,"
good,"This company recognizes good work and reward it with great benefits, along with room for advancement. The people are nice, lacking in the equipment even at employee request to fix required things."
good,"I enjoyed my job but not Management.  They were not very knowledgeable.  There was a lot of favoritism shown to certain employees.  So, I went to work, did my job and went home."
good,Work in a warehouse loading trucks and unloading. Sorting the packages to their appropriate destinations. Hard on the back if you force yourself too much.
good,I loved working here. My co-workers where nice. The supervisors were also nice and wonderful people also. The hours weren't that bad. It wasn't too much work it was perfect and the breaks it was what helped me get through my nights.
good,"i would get out an meet witrh a driver close to my house , get on truck deliver packages all different sizes , we did that at a nice pace. It was some times an 8 hour day an the job its self was a workout ."
good,"Work life balance is usually pretty great. The perfect position for flexibility (most of the time). If you don't mind working the occasional holiday or staying a little late there are great rewards to be had."
good,"I was part of a crew to unload and reload large jets(e.g. 757, 767, A-300, MD-11)daily.  I was given a printout of the containers on the jets I was working on.  I would see which of the planned containers I was given and where I was expected to deliver them."
good,I enjoyed working at this company. I work five hours a day I enjoyed working but would have appreciated longer working hours.

good,"Delivering Packages to customers in Beverly Hills, Koreatown and Culver City unloading and loading up trucks. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was being outdoors all day delivering and getting to talk to many different people"
good,"Work starts at 9:00 am, making sure all the overnight air is ready for early delivery by 10:30am. Focus helps memory and organization helps time. Management is fun and friendly, co-workers are great most employees inside the center work as a team. Hardest part of working at UPS was having to be outside in wet/cold or bad weather. But being outside has its trade off, such as meeting new people and seeing new places."

Then doing our regular routes , as express mail first and locations that require more of an out of the way route , so from far to near.

Boxes range from small to very large up to 150lbs all of which are stacked neatly into walls.

good,There is no typical or hard part of a job. It is what you as an individual makes of it
good,"i absolutely loved it,there was a steady workflow that made time fly"
good,"If you go into managment expect getting paid once a month.  Paid for 5 1/2 hours a day but spent 10 hours a day there.  Tried to give you a little bit at the holidays to make up but didn't really do much.  Higher ups are slave drivers, constantly getting yelled at even for getting the job done right.  Never happy."

good,"UPS is a great company to work for. It is a very physical job but fun. The main objective of the job is teamwork. You do not want to lift packages and stock merchandise alone. Teamwork is key and that was advised daily by the supervisors. There was so much to learn. I got to learn about different air crafts that carry containers, tractor trailors and their sizes, what hazardous materials are and how to be careful with them. Just like any other job, multiple duties had to be done, which is the best part of the job. Sadly, I was going to school at the time taking morning classes and the work shift took place in the early morning."
good,"So far my favorite job, working on something new everyday. Management was also cool as long as you show up and do your job"
good,A typical work day at UPS is walking in and jumping in your truck to make your deliveries. The hardesst part of the job is your customers and the enjoyable part of the job is also your customers. If you ever had a bad day at work it's because of your perspective. Dealing with people are never easy but with the right attitude your day will pass by quickly.

good,ups instilled hard work into my routine very early. i learn that i enjoy hard work. managment was disrepsectful at times. the hardest part was comiong in to work. the most enjoyable part was weekly paychecks.
good,"The UPS Store i worked at consisted of the owner the ctr. mgr. and 2-3 co-workers, it was an all woman staff and i know that may seem like we would have so much drama but we didnt. we had our everyday customers and began to think of them as family. I was given a chance right out of prison and went from just an everyday associate to the person that knew everything and everyone that came to the store. the hardest part of my job is the customer who doesnt know what they want but shoots down everything you suggest. and in the same part I JUST LOVED MY CUSTOMERS!!!"
good,"Good paying company, most customers were very nice. THere were some issues on the management side of the house but that is normal for most big companies."
good,"A typical day at work would be answering the phones, keeping truck inventory, inbounding and outbounding trucks. I learned a variety of different area codes. The management for the most part were awesome. I did not have alot of co workers that work in the same department as i but they were a great source of help when neeeded. The hardest Part of the job was actually trying to memorize the entire zip code database for the united states of america. The most enjoyable part of my job was actually learning how mail from different states actually got shipped in."
good,"I when id get there i sort packages, then the driver and i would go on the road and deliver them. I like my coworker and management. The hardest part of the job was carrying some of the packages and the weather conditions. I enjoyed it because we`d be out on the road delivery boxes to new places and new people everyday."

My co-workers were wonderful. The hardest part was leaving. The most enjoyable was meeting new people from all walks of life."
good,Face Past work makes your day go by fast.And very humidy place. armed security gurads.

good,I come in to work early I get to eat and stretch. I learned a lot about the company as far as shipping and receving packages. My co-workers were helpful when I felt overloaded. Hardest part was letting heavy boxes everyday. Most enjoyable was being being able to network with other college students.
good,Loved working in Baytown in the office great people all around
good,I learned about shipping and packaging. Dealing with customers that were happy and very unhappy.
good,"The great thing about this job is allowed me time to grow and boost my confidence for my next step. College taught me a lot of things, but how to handle angry customers, irresponsible vendors, and even confront my co-workers in a productive manner is something I had to learn here. Also I learned so much more about printing it helps my design work, Knowing what will work and won't work."
good,"Working for The UPS Stores was a Great experience. I enjoy working for small companies, I find it pleasurable to have the opportunity to know your staff well. However it left little room for growth and development as each store is individually owned."
good,This position was conveinant for me because Ohio University was on it's six week break. This job paid well and kept me occupied through the winter break.
good,Poor management. But working with the drivers was great. Easy to understand what to do. Learned to separate package to insure delivery are met by end of day.
good,"N/a I really don't have no comments im somewhat not pleased, not getting enough hours, having problem getting paid on time these are two serious issues"
good,"I was a Casual Feeder, the company pays very well for the type of job that it is.  The job it's self was easy, just drop and hook. The company allowed me to work as many hours as I wanted with in DOT regulations."
good,good job friendly people costa t moving of upper body learned more of what ups prossesors do work with boxes envelopes    not to noisy greaat enviorment
good,"Jobs good if you land a full time position. Good benefit, good money. Alot of long hours and stress. Management and communication definitely lacks for new emoloyees"
good,"Good job good benefits and supporting staff, right now it's on call but if I stay working I will get to stay with the company, looking forward to seeing what the job leads to"
good,"I started in the Hub as pt employee and after a year I was FT.  From day one I learned to adapt and pay attention. Although there were times I was completely exhausted I was afforded opportunities of a life time. I learned team work, how to lead, sacrifice, balance, service before self and grew a family"
good,"I worked 60 hrs a week or close to it, and I loved every part of the job  I felt like I got paid to work out, I got to serve people all day long and at the end of the day I felt very accomplished."
good,It's hard work you will lose weight. Management is really good very friendly. I really like working here. The shift is at odd hours but that's fine with me
good,"I really like working for UPS: great team of employees and they are all very helpful . I wish they had drivers helpers year around ."
good,"Friendly Coworkers, Fun and very flexible. Tho it’s only Seasonal it’s still a really good place to work. Can be tedious and heavy. Sitting on the passenger side is something I don’t look forward to, very uncomfortable. And being a season helper pays good but since it’s only season you get no benefits."
good,"i loved my job at ups sadly i screwed it up or i would still be there today,supervisors were great well most of them were definately favouritism.   people there helped everyone who needed help, supervisors helped everyone .  my day at worked involved scanning packages that come off the trailers sent them down conveyor belt to be repacked in another trailer"
good,Good enviroment before leaving building to do the hard work in the street like driving and long walks.Too many hours one shift. Other than that good benefits.
good,put your time in as part-time physical work getting yelled at by management demanding job you get promoted doing a harder job making a lot of money benefits job security it depends if you have the mental stability to keep working hard even though the harder you work the more work they give you so you work longer hours but you work harder to get off earlier but management gives you more stuff to do but then if you are one of those people that don't work that hard and always try to slack around none of the other employees will give you any respect so it's a toss-up it's all it's a physical job and a mental job depending on what side you want to be on management or Union
good,"The communication between supervisor and driver was always excellent. The drivers took there time to plan there route with the operations supervisor. The driver and sup communicated throughout the whole day. If another driver was having issues on route, there was always someone willing to help to achieve customer satisfaction."
good,Great opportunity to make extra money and a good way into the company if you're looking for a long term job. The Driver's really appreciate the help and it's  great experience.
good,"very nice company,just need to work on the mangement It was a blessing working there.the employee was fine.I worked there for a short amount of  time."
good,They have  flexible hours decent pay but no benefits because is a franchise and it's only a part time job. The owner is a wonderful employer that understands family emergencies.

good,"Working at ups was a great experience for me .I learned to move at a steady pace , while also completing my task successfully. It also helped me stay in shape ."
good,This job is nice. The benefits are really good. They don’t seem to know how to let employees have a work life balance. Management seems to have a big turn over on part time employees.
good,"The company expects a lot but it will support you. Training was always good, supervisors always interacted with you on a daily basis. UPS always had a customer first way of thinking."
good,Great place to work and stay in shape. Very fast paced job that runs by seniority so the longer you work there the better chance of promotion you will have.
good,"Working at UPS has been and will continue to be a challenging job and work environment. With that said, their policies are solid and the work is there. If you are lazy or addicted to your phone, you may not be cut for the demand."
good,Working with the drivers were cool they were not the problem. When it was time to get paid it took days to get my paycheck and every time I would call or go to the office they would take me in circles.
good,"Great place to work if you're a hard worker, and like new, daily challenges. Pay frequency is ideal, weekly. Great training opportunities to perfect your job performance, and knowledge of company standards."
good,"Upper management needs to communicate with the ranks a lot better than what they do.  I mean communicate, not yell.  Be professional.  There is no shame in saying ""I don't know the answer.  Let me find out."" or ""I am not at liberty to share that information at that time.""  This way we feel we are being heard and not blown off."
good,"Loved working at UPS great Co-workers and awesome environment to work inn. Learned a lot in a short amount of time. Had a wonderful Lead, Supervisor and Building Manager."
good,I really liked working there even though I had personal difficulties that I had to quit over. It was my favorite job. It was fast paced never a dull moment. It was very loud & long hours I had more bruises from boxes than I can count & all my jeans got ruined but it was fun.
good,I was a loader in it was fast pace only problem was that the pay is only 10.50 and some supervisors use there authority and the wrong way in some try to talked to you disrespectful
good,"UPS recently made a manager change as a result we have experience a new dress code, and we have revamped our sitting arrangement. We removed all cubes and allowed us a open environment where we can engage one another to resolve current or future issues. UPS managers currently allows you to shadow other departments when you show interest in other departments. I really enjoy my day to day task in my current role. As a company that has been striving with success since 1907, UPS continues to be innovative with new technologies to help prepare ourselves with success in the near future."
good,UPS is a lot of hard work but great benefits. It takes a toll on your body but if you’re into heavy lifting and want great medical insurance. This is the place for you.
good,"Although grueling at times during holidays and other peak periods, I enjoyed the challenges of working for UPS.  My career was physically and mentally demanding. I enjoyed customer service and problem solving."
good,"I Worked as a drivers helper for the peak season (November through December) this was a fun, kind of like ""Santa's Helper"" a fast pace job with great people! Work day consisted of working 3-4 hours 4-5 days per week. I would meet a driver at a route location which changes due to the schedule. Towards the end my pick-ups became in the area where I live. This worked rather well because sometimes 20+ miles is far to meet the assigned driver for a few hours of work. Highly recommend this job as a helper because this is probably the fist step towards a career with UPS. All drivers were very nice respectful and professional to include the supervisors! Good company to work for, they offer great benefits for their employees!"
good,This job is very fast paced work with lots of pressure to complete things quickly. Supervisors will push you to work harder and faster to complete tasks. Lots of bending and lifting.
good,Management varies from site to site.  It all depends on your work ethic.  If you work hard there is room for plenty of growt within Unite Parcel Service
good,Working for ups was a good experience.  However room for growth is stagnant due to seniority  and sex. I have never saw a female driver and that's concering.
good,"UPS, as a company, is very disciplined and structured.  They treat their employees right and expect a lot in return.  The work/life balance is somewhat challenging."
good,Worked as a Temporary from a Agency for the Xmas Holiday and New Year turn around. Was trained on the World Ship Software to help inbound callers with their shipping.
good,Never can be sure what time you get off.  Very stressful environment most of the year.  Very fast paced.  Watch management they will get you in trouble if it saves them.    CYA and you’ll do great.
good,Ups is a fast moving ..professional package delivering servive..i really wnjoyed riding with the driver..meeting new people ..we hadggood daysbad day but wemade it
good,"You will never find better benefits anywhere! The hours and the physical toll on your body are the trade-off though. Management works pretty well for time off, as long as it doesn't interfere with an employee with higher seniority..."
good,UPS Is A great company if you are willing to put in the time and work for advancement. For beginners you start in the warehouse which can be very stressful at times the work isn’t built for everyone. There are great benefits in the company also.
good,"Driving feeder for Ups is a not what I thought it would be! Ups is a great union company, management is easy to get along with when it’s busy, but is very hard with to get along with when it becomes slow"
good,"Pay is good but need more consistent working hours. If you have a family, the pay check is not enough. If you are a kid staying at home with family then it is OK i guess!"
good,made some good friends and learned a lot of what goes on behind the scenes when shipping packages. Great place to work. I hope to become a permanent employee one day
good,Coming into work logging into your computer and several different programs. Pulling invoices and backup documents. Different cultures and there really isn't anything about the job once you know how to do it.
good,"The days were good, wonderful manager understanding and caring . Staff helpful and very sociable.  Patience I looked forward to each day ready to work"
good,ups was a good place to work they just dont pay much for the work  you do there loading trucks.i enjoyed working there they just need to pay more for that kind of work.
good,"Delivering packages for UPS was a great experience. The customers are always happy to see you. My driver was very friendly and helpful, always made sure that I was being cautious and safe."
good,"It was very fast paced, a lot of friendly people and friendly managers that I worked with. Got a good workout in too during my work hours. A good workout and getting paid is always nice"
good,"very quick paced job a good way to stay in shape if your look too is fit, organized but can get a little stressful during peak season just because their so much demand and the hours have come long but worth the money. I still need to go talk with the union about a couple of issues I should have brought up in the past but didn't recognize till a year or two ago don't know if anything can be done but overall UPS was a great company to work for hope I will be able to figure out what needs to be done to maybe one day be employed again."
good,"This is a good job in terms of benefits and job security. This job is very fast paced and hard to handle at times, but worth it if you are willing to stay there.The difficulty of the job depends on many variables but overall it is a very good job with a great work environment."
good,"I was suppose to come in as customer service but, only placed in a loader position. Was able to learn bout the conveyor belts and safety tips for working there, but when I called no one would answer the phone and I barely got a response by email as well. Poor communication."
good,"Overall a great company to work for. In general, the people are very nice. The healthcare benefits are some of the best. Drivers can be paid very well."
good,The most enjoyable part about working there was the co workers and how welcoming they were.  Also loved the position and getting to do the type of work with so many different types of people.
good,Can be long and hard hours but the experience and benefits you get from it is well worth it. The people there are always there to answer any of your questions and make starting off really easy.
good,"I enjoyed my time working for UPS, however my job title was only for seasonal work. Unfortunately seasonal work is now over and I am looking for a new job."
good,"When I went in for the group interview, they told us upfront that they could not guarantee hours. If a driver needed help for the day, I would get a phone call or a text to tell me to meet with the driver on the road. After the interview, I only set foot in the building once, when I was having tech issues with viewing my paycheck online. It was a low-stress position, you just have to make sure that you walk quickly so that you don't slow down the driver. You help with sorting the packages on the truck a little bit, but mostly it's walking packages to doors. I wish I could have had more hours, but they weren't as busy as they expected to be this season. All of the drivers said that it's a great company, with great health benefits."
good,Full benefits if you last a year. Union so its a great job but its cut throat and hard especially in peak season (Nov-Feb). If you can hack it they offer tuition assistance and have free insurance for the family.
good,"The work experience at UPS was of hard work at a fast speed, with little opportunity for relaxation.The management has been very supportive. When you don't meet people in the house it not pleasant, but when you deliver to the owner you are very glad."
good,"For those who are looking for a job at ups.ups is not a job it is a career for example if your looking for a little pocket change or spending money on the side while you do ur own stuff ups is for you. I believe that it’s only worth it if your looking to become a supervisor, a driver or waiting till peak season other than that not worth it "
good,Work at UPS was not that significant because of its nature. Short term employment only 3 weeks working with them with different drivers.My first and second week was in the premium outlet where we unload packages from the truck and deliver them to the outlets.Then in the afternoon we collect packages from the outlets and load them to the truck.My last week was with the truck driver deliver and unload packages to the customers.very fast pace and a lot of movements.
good,"The job was great. Just wish it would of went permanent."
good,"Everyone is fighting for seniority and a full time spot as a full time driver. Very competitive work environment. Drivers aren’t to thrilled about seasonal workers, tends to cause issues between seasoned union drivers and superiors."
good,enjoyable environment very fast passed work very challenging the best part of the day was walking up to the door and the customer waiting for his or hers package on the front door
good,Great company with excellent job security. Hard work life balance for management employees. Great benefits for hourly employees. Vacation schedule is hard to work with on holidays.
good,the people in the community are very well respected and they take care of one another . Some will even take the time and ask if your okay and see whats wrong
good,"for five years i couldn't get a full time job  .its a great place to work if you are a student or if you just want a side kick. "
good,"great place to work the hours arent really that long. maybe between 5 and 8 hours which is nice, and the overtime is time and a half which always makes the worker feel like they are getting paid their worth"
good,"Job is very competitive and demanding. The hourly pay is poor when starting out as a temp, however there is great room for growth within the company. The work load is very fast paced and demanding. Management is helpful and provides clear direction in order to compete your daily tasks. Only con is that the hourly wage starting out is not sufficient to support oneself."
good,"Great and amazing environment, the manager and her assistant are very nice. They help with any questions you will have once you begin to work. Great experience for next job."
good,"Good coworkers,fast pace ,very active,stress because of pressure by management to do more in less time. Teamsters union member. They make sure your not being targeted for speaking up.if you like tomoney instaef of family.this a good job."
good,"this was a great place to work with excellent benefits, scheduling, and enormous flexibility for people who have other commitments like school or another job as well.  They're also great for giving tuition reimbursements and honoring holidays!"
good,"I would go back here in a heart beat if the advancement or benefits where there, my owner was amazing and worked with me through my battle with breast cancer"
good,UPS provides amazing benefits and chances for advancement. The hours are 3:30-7:30 Monday through Friday. The work is intense and physical but it is rewarding.
good,Do your best and finish your tasks with a sense of urgency and you’ll go far. Managment needs work and better organization. There are times when people have no tasks to do and stand around waiting for management.
good,I enjoyed working the just being around every body and meeting people and learning a lot of new stuff and just being apart of the team and unloading and just being at work
good,"A typical day with UPS Freight is from 7:30 AM to 5:30 pm.  7:30 to 8:30 is for planning an preparing for the day.  Sales Call are made from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM.  4:00 to 5:30 is for travel to office or home."
good,It's a good place to work your actively moving a lot of walking back and forth great pay fair breaks overall a good company to work for  good flexible hours and good pay
good,When It comes to working I love to do more than one thing. I worked for a while at UPS and now I feel like it’s time for something different where I could arrive much faster.
good,"This job could be made into a career depending on your actions in the field. If you further your education you have opportunity for advancement. UPS also officers help for you to further your education. This job is good to help young workers build a strong work ethic and patients, because sometimes your goals don't come right away."
good,Supervisor have gotten really bad over the last couple years most are good but there’s a few that have no respect for the employee to demeaning I the way they speak to people
good,"UPS is all about working hard beforeyou come in the building make sure you are well hydrated, because at UPS you will be up moving all day until you clock out. The building is very hot itself so always come prepared to work."
good,Fast paced environment. Everyone is motivated and is looking out for each other. The environment pushes you to strive through any obstacle and provides you with back up so success is gauranteed.
good,Great! My experience with UPS has been positive. One thing I could suggest is that they make transfers easier as many people move to other cities/counties in the state.
good,"From the loading techniques to the delivery procedure, I learned how the UPS delivery system worked. Until you become familiar with the procedures, loading can be very overwhelming."
good,"You have to be able to move quickly, yet swiftly. Clumsiness cannot be accepted because it will not work for you. It's not so much the difficult tasks that is asked of you, more of a challenge to get the work done on time."
good,a day at UPS is not a easy job being a supervisor its a lot of work and frustration. running my own area is too much making sure your employees work hard and safe is not easy some employees don't listen and don't care about the work place.
good,"Working here is definitely something I’d recommend to a friend. I never encountered a problem with management, not with a coworker. The work is fairly simple after repeated days of loading and unloading boxes."
good,"The pay isn't sufficient for San Francisco living but it's a good job to have to put on a resume. After 5 hours of working, you get double time pay which was nice. You were always moving around delivering packages. I worked from 10am to 10pm Monday through Friday. I was always walking down a block to deliver packages. Very walking intensive. I was whipped at the end of the day but I like being able to move around like that."
good,"Great company to work for, for a college student. However there's no advancements. The hours worked per week can be a little overwhelming, but the fast pace let's your day go by a lot faster."
good,A typical work day consist of loading and loading packages on trucks. The best I think about the job is working indecently while you are forced to learn because of the high demand of work to be done. Management can sometimes be unfair but every job I feel has its pros and cons as far as management. The warehouse or facility can be very hot in the summer because lack of circulation. But freezing cold in the winter because of over head doors being opened and closed constantly.
good,"I like UPS..its pretty bare bones. Do your job well you will do well. However it is not for every personality. "
good,"Great pay/ incentives for seasonal employment. Great team collaboration and HR team. That being said, they encourage you to work harder and faster simply to benefit they're productivity be during peak season you get worked like a dog."
good,"Seasonal hire. Hours varied. Great hiring managers and co workers. Fun, but quick paced. Must be ready and willing to work. Collaborative environment, one job affects the others."
good,"I liked this job because it was outside and I was always getting out of the truck and moving, always kept me busy and doing something.  I was always with someone else who was the driver so, i liked having some company."
good,The work is extremely fast paced with a great way to stay in shape. Whether you are on the sort or delivery driving you have the ability to manage your own work appropriately.
good,good place help you learn a lot. when you in need theres is always some one there to help you. good people who always take care of you. good communication .
good,Son sueldos bajos y el trabajo es duro pero estable
good,"Its a good company, but Somehow I have found myself restricted or saturated interms of growth, So would  prefer to switch the job and get my skills work more somewhere else.."
good,"Ambiente lavorativo stimolante, rapporto con i colleghi e i responsabili della filiale molto alla mano."
good,"Great team to work with - great drivers that were consistently there to work with a nice attitude. They only want to see you do well as well as management. Great place to work, however, you must be willing to work and work hard and efficiently with a quick mind ;)"
good,It was hard to work at The UPS Store because i worked a lot by myself.Being along a lot and all responsible was left on me.So that was a bad idea never will i buy into another company.
good,Working at UPS was an eye opener for me. I really liked working there. The work was easy and fast pace. If I got an opportunity to work there again I would in a heart beat.
good,"Quick paced and very easy; Get package, take to door, ring the bell / knock, and go onto the next one. Constant moving is not a problem and it actually makes the days go by a lot faster, started at 7-8 am and usually ended around the same time if not sooner, it all depended on the day."
good,It is hard to compare the jobs I had early on as a part time hourly employee to a full time driver and then as a supervisor.  All the jobs at UPS are demanding and stressful as well as physically taxing.  There is always a time element for each job to be completed.  UPS is a company that has perfected the industrial engineering principle s that are a part of the company culture.  I is a little different in the managerial roles that I had.  There I was responsible for the success of my work force.  The hardest part of the job was trying to get union employees to do things that they felt violated the terms of the bargaining agreement between UPS and the Teamsters Union. The most satisfying part of my job was seeing the successful outcomes of projects that I had a part in.  Especially during my involvement with the USOC and the Olympic games.
good,Just be ready for some fast pace work. I learned a lot about how to load a delivery truck for it's route. My supervisor is one great guy a long my mananger
good,It’s a nice Work out for the day. you’ll meet friends along the way . They treat  you like your family. They have nice stuff you can get owned from ups
good,This was a fun seasonal job. I got to meet a lot of people and I loved the work. I would highly recommend working for UPS especially if you need an additional part time job.
good,Package delivery was fast paced and good exercise. Pay was low but not a priority for the type of work. I enjoyed my manager and was glad to have done it.
good,"i loved everything about it."
good,"I started part time working in the mornings I caught on quickly, and was given 2 packages cars after a week, very little amount of people had more than one package car to load. I moved to the evening shift becuase the hours were better, and I advanced, yet the pay was not sufficient explaining me leaving."
good,During peak season you can get some good hours in.  The only draw back is its only for a month.  The work was fast paced. Helpers had to be on their feet for 8-12 hours walking back and forth and up stairs.  It isn't hard work if you are somewhat in shape.
good,"The typical day was meeting up with the assigned driver at a designated pickup point, then working together delivering packages to business and residential area."
good,"It's a great opportunity to work at UPS. Most of all, you will get a free work out. It's a great way to stay in shape. I learned how to work at a fast pace while being focused on your task. The most enjoyable part of the job is you get to work around friendly people. Most in deed, one get to advance on the job quickly. I highly recommend UPS job to anybody looking for part-time work."
good,UPS provided the tools I needed to move on to better positions. I am grateful I was given the opportunity. I would recommend working at UPS to my friends
good,Excellcent Company to work for.Benefits are good .Stressfull at times. Hours are long both for management and hourly. Work /life balance unacceptable especially if you work on the dayside.
good,UPS Supply Chain Solutions was an outgoing setting with positive work and a fun work setting. Distribution Supervisor conducted daily meetings to ensure work was done in an efficient manner.
good,"Every work day went fast, always busy. Learned more about my hometown by doing this job. The hardest part is getting your body used to the in and out the truck, average 100 times."
good,Worked there as a seasonal driver knowing that it was going to end after the holiday.  Loved the organized chaos.  It is all about the customer at UPS and you see the passion in the drivers.  They joke about normal company BS but they mean business and take it personal.
good,"In UPS You can either be a driver, the person who drives the big ups truck and delivers packages or you can he the assistant who helps out the driver. It’s great for interacting and learning how to scan packages, return, pick up and send out packages as well. Requires a lot of moving around. Sort of like a daily exercise only that everyday it’s a different location. Very good if your looking for a part time job."
good,Working at UPS was great. I really enjoyed being able to interact with all the customers. I also really enjoyed my boss. He was a great manager. This is a great place to work.
good,Working for UPS is not for everyone. Physically laborious especially during holiday season. Loading/unloading packages into various vehicles and delivery of packages to customers. Union job with multiple benefits once an employee reaches seniority. 
good,"Mail is always coming and going , doesn't matter time of month, season, or year. when the sort starts the packages will come slow or it will come fast . "
good,"good place to work for student  and such but not for family man or someone looking to make more of themselves and have a career driven attitude, and drive to make more of them self"
good,"The fun part was meeting new customers and knowing that. the cu"
good,I was at UPS for 20 years it was a very good job. The pay and the benefits were very good. It was great especially during the time I was raising 2 girls. It really came in handy for baby visits and hospital care for my family.
good,"The UPS is a great place to work at, there is room to advance and learn everything you need to know about this job. It's a fun and flexible work environment."
good,"I worked at the Hartford, CT location for about 6 years and I must say that this was my first job out of college and I loved it.  The people were amazing and the benefits were superb."
good,"Quick pace, attention to detail, and being alert are the most important parts of the job. Making myself be in great mood helps things go smooth. It also helps your driver stay calm in stressful situations"
good,"My job is sorting just followed the zip numbers, careful to look the right number then put it in the bag , and stand longer more than 8 hours til. The supervisor always there and strict some rules."
good,"I worked as a part time  Package handler at U.P.S. on 6th and Rawson Ave in Milwaukee Wisconsin. My Career at ups was excellent as a union member and package handler,I have to Admit once I promoted myself to a higher level in the business  the tensions of the job surfaced. Due to the massive amount of packages and business needs during the peak season it caused upper management to come down on lower management to meet and excel at performance goals for daily operation .Well eventually the constant pressure from the Upper management staff forced me to quit because it went from a professionally atmosphere to a Screaming fest. I was injured on the job as a manger I have to admit U.P.S. did take care of me ,I ultimately wished we could've still been producing business."
good,i worked there as a loader/unloader. the job was only part time 3 or 4 hours a night the pay was good but only working part time did not help. i left because i needed to work full time.
good,"Everyday I would come into smiling faces that greet you every where you go. I always was learning something new, the employees had each others back when ever things got bad. The hadrest thing was when large loads came in it took for ever to get it done but I always had a good feeling when it was done."
good,I enjoyed working at ups because it gave me the opportunity to challenge myself and the chance to learn new things. If I had the option to continue to work for this company I would.
good,"This was a seasonal position that was fast-paced and involved continual lifting, lowering and sliding packages up to 70lbs from the belt to loading truck"
good,Very organized and well managed. Lack of work.  But great part time job.  I would recommend this job.  You can earn a lot of money during peak season.
good,"A typical work day for me would start by the UPS center calling around 6 am. They would call every morning to see if you were available. If you were, at the beginning of the season, they would call you back a few hours later telling you the time and location for you to meet your driver.The center tries to match you up with drivers who deliver near where you live.I had 3 different drivers in two different locations. When you met with your driver they would give you a brown UPS vest to wear after that you would sit in your seat, put your seat belt on, then you'd be on your way to the first delivery stop and that would start your day. Before Christmas, a typical work day would be around 6 to 7 hours long. You would work a total of about 30 hours. The week before Christmas I ended up working 8 and 9 hours a day and I worked a total of 40 hours. The drivers are super nice and chill. They're totally easy to get a long with and they answer any questions you may have. Working at UPS I learned that not everything you read on the package label is true. The management was very nice. They had cut me short 6 hours on my first paycheck,I called and talked to a center manager and she confirmed the hours on my time sheet and added the pay for those 6 hours to my next paycheck. You don't have to be physically fit to do this job. But the first week you work, your feet will surely be hurting. Your arms may hurt a tiny bit but its fun. The most enjoyable part of this job for me is delivering packages to parents and their children and seeing the smiles on the child's face."
good,"As a seasonal temp role, the ups driver helper job was great. Well payed and if you put the work in the driver will appreciate it, and your more likely to get more hours. Overtime is great"
good,I worked the graveyard shift for seventeen years. Very fast paced job. Good co-workers for the most part. Part of the Teamsters Union which was very supportive.
good,Not a bad place to work. Lots of room for advancement. Very busy during the holidays during peak season. Work with a diverse workforce. Flexible schedules.
good,My job there as a supervisor was pretty hectic but once you learned what had to be done it was pretty easy. A typical day at UPS would consist of my crew taking cargo to planes. The hardest part was weather. It didn't matter what the weather was the work had to get done
good,Im a hard worker who takes pride in the jobs I do to make sure that whatever needs to be done is done correctly and accurately. I have experienced many diversity's and works well with all to help and to understand things.
good,I had a great experience working at UPS would definitely recommend to a friend or family member enjoy the relationship with the staff and co-workers that I had
good,"High volume, fast paced environment. "
good,"Big and successful company. Nothing else to say.  This part is very annoying and I was kind enough to do this but am bothered that whoever it is wants so much information about this job. That said, I am out of here."
good,"Job was great. People are great, owners and coworkers. Just needed benefits to stay. "
good,Very physical job. must be able to handle large work loads and deliver on time. You have to start out as a package handler in order to be considered for the driving position.
good,"busy place but good people, treat you well go out of there way to insure you are properly trained and have any help you need. only complaint was only would allow us to work 35 hours a week"
good,I liked my co-works but what I hate it was I had to call every single day to ask if I'm working or not. I worked once or twice a week for 5 hours or 3 hours and that wasn't enough for my bills..
good,"you come into work and you unload trucks Monday - Friday,  the tempo is fast paced and you have to finish unloading the trucks  at a certain amount of time. The hardest part about the job is dealing with some of the lazy workers."
good,"The pay and benefits are great. It is a very fast paced environment and can be hard to balance your life. This was working full time at UPS Supply chain solutions. When you are a hard worker, you get taken advantage of and they push you work harder. It gets frustrating because they let the lazy workers get away with being lazy and push the hard workers."
good,"Within this company I learned the business of Logistics from the bottom to the top. Starting as a loader, I was able to see first hand the movement of packages and the goals to keep UPS as one of the top logistical companies. I was able to learned how to work with individuals in a high paced environment and still get the best out of them."
good,.muito boa pra trabalha q pena q acabou o terceiro turno si nao eu taria la ate hj
good,"As collector I contacted the biggest companies in Brazil such as JBS, Oderbrecht and many others to help with plan of payment of due titles."
good,Supermooi bedrijf naar Amerikaanse standaard goed geregeld ik zat hier in een Nachtritme waarbij er 5 verschillende Van A naar B en retour ritten mogelijk waren.
good,It was an absolute blast working for a company as good as UPS. They provided fairly easy work of just carrying packages from a truck to a customer's front door or workplace while still making the schedule just short enough for me to have an easy time going from high school to the pickup point and then to the bus stop after my shift to go home. I really have nothing bad to say about UPS because they're excellent with flexibility.
good,"We stretch before our shift to help  our muscles, then  it is very coordinated as we sort and stack packages in the desired location depending on where they are going/coming from. Great benefits, fast paced and routine"
good,UPS was very fun and very fast paced company. They do offer training for every position available in the warehouse and you do get compensated for Whatever new job you learn to do.
good,"This was a great job, due to previous job security I quit. Possibly the worst mistake ever. Union job great pay, great benefits. /terrible hours that was just temporary"
good,"Its a decent job...the supervisor's are decent people.  The pay was wack, but its called saving or something.  Overall,  ups is a great company and if all else fails, I might have to go back..."
good,ups was most definitely a great stepping stone for me. i was able to find myself while making great money. ups has some of the best benefits in the USA . in addition to the great work environment i was able to learn about and how to work and navigate ups world ship program which later help me in t=other jobs that use world ship as a providers for its company
good,"Was a fun and productive work enviroment with good hours,pay and co workers. Good organized warehouse, overall good and fun job. Just wish it was permenant"
good,"Busy and no room for errors."
good,I loved the job. Is good people to be around a nice Union to back you up so get ready for a good time and UPS good people to work with me good friends
good,Its a good job but you hardly have time for the family. Especially during the Nov. and Dec months. On the other hand its a great way to support your family because the pay and benefits.
good,"Good place for a work out, but advancement and wages are low. Union work keeps the jobs in full time positions at prevailing wages, but at the cost of the part time positions."
good,"This Job Had Long Hours And I Was Constantly Busy So I Did Not Have To Wait For The Next Task. , Everybody At This Job Was Very Helpful And Respectful"
good,the management sucks there its alot of favoritism there. You will always stay a part timer. You do have a chance to go out and drive. The benefits are amazing
good,The culture at UPS from fellow employees is great. They all support one and other whenever possibly. The customer experience is always paramount at UPS.
good,"UPS is an exceptional organization, focused on its customers and its employees.   Its compensation program is not market competitive, but it does not suffer the vagaries of market shifts, and so lifetime employment is a high likelihood for those who seek stability."
good,"I really enjoyed working for this company, but I most definitely recommend someone to look for a secured position, not a seasonal one. If you choose a seasonal position, they will often not give you the hours you need."
good,Would Recommend to a friend. Starting salary is low but there is room for advancement. Good job if you're willing to learn. The people are great My coworkers made this job worthwhile. Consistent hours
good,"Overall- a well balanced life style with a excellent work environment.  The interaction with the customer base has been extremely rewarding, educational and fun."
good,A typical day at UPS you get there and you set up your stuff and then you wait for the packages. When packages come you have to scan the package and then place it in the wall
good,"It's an experience working at ups, the different personalities, the way the work flows and the pace you must work at to keep up. The drivers leave on time every day and do what it takes to make every customer happy. Rain or shine. hot or cold. It's very impresive."
good,This was a great place to work at the only downfall was it was part time. And very hard to get to full time hours. The people are great to work with and you meet and supervise all kinds of workers here. Management was great to work with.
good,"Due in part to the great recession and the lack of cross training in the assembly line process of shipment clearance at that time, I was laid off. I would have had to be aggressive and demanded that I be cross trained on more job duties within the department and prove myself to be indispensable to have had them see any value in retaining me."
good,"Even though it was a temporary part time job (during busiest season) we stayed super busy and I loved it. I wish I was able to stay on permanently. The hours were great, my coworkers were awesome,, and it was a great learning experience."
good,"A typical day at UPS is usually a great day to play with logistics. As a supervisor, each day would be a new task at leading my employees and co workers to work safe and efficiently."
good,"It was a easy job to do nothing stressful, my partner was very easy to work with and he was a very respectful  guy, it was a day to day thing nothing changed and we did all we had to do in good timing"
good,"I love working here at the United Parcel Service, but trying to get a promotion is very difficult.People who are employed there are very helpful, and always willing to lend a helping hand."
good,"My short lived seasonal rush with UPS was truly an amazing one. To be hired as a driver assistant during the 2015/2016 holiday rush is easy since all you need to do is prove you're human, can meet the driver enroute, and pick up packages above 70 pounds. "
good,"Attendance Was An A Plus at all working enviroments, I would get complimented while others where getting to work barely on time. I would recommend this job workout to a friend who is in highschool or wether they are building their working experience."
good,It's good first job nice people & the work environment it's pays very well & it's a very busy place to work at. It's go way to go if your in school. :)
good,Always look forward into meeting and going on new adventures . Easy tasks through out the day and easy thinking to get any job done . Always leaves the consumer happy !
good,"Good benefits, Good work Culture, Great work teams Just a overall friendly and enjoyable workplace , free launches, makes you want to go to work everyday."
good,"UPS is a solid job if you're looking for a part time job with great benefits.. It can be a fun fast paced job if you have the mindset that it's a workout and not work. I would tell anyone to be leery of trusting management, as they can sometimes be unlikable people!"
good,Ups offers a lot of great benifits. The opportunity for advancement is always there. They are nationwide and I would work for them anywhere. Part time or full time for anyone.
good,high quality customer service is definitely awesome here and I would work here again. co owner is very sweet and flexible with schedules. I recommend anyone to work here.
good,"Working for UPS made me realize what it was like to work in a face paced environment, and helped my multitasking skills tremendously. Hours are not preferred but they worked."
good,"First off, I work for The UPS Store, which are franchise owned businesses. It's a fast pace environment, but one that allows you to create friendly relationships with returning customers. You learn something new everyday, whether it's international shipping, to opening a mailbox, to printing out a wide format blue print. Practicing ""world class customer service"" begins to change who you are as a person outside of work, but of course, for the better."
good,"Remove package from truck....removal of packages from turnbelt...werehouse worker under supervision..."
good,"ups is a good company to work, I have learn lots of thing, friendly environment. all dept are working sencirely. lots of things to learn"
good,"A typical day includes opening up the store and unlocking all security cages and gates. Once you're prepared to be open, customers come in and the day goes on. Helping people ship and track packages. You will also receive deliveries that need to be scanned and stocked. The hardest part of the job is standing all day. I really have no complaints."
good,"It has been a good 20 plus years overall, the people are like any where else some good and some bad. i think if you work hard an keep your head on right you can go fat UPS."
good,"This is a great place to start jumping into graphic design, and get experience with printing products and customer relationships."
good,"My typical day of work with this company consist of placing mail into P.O. Boxes paid for by the customer , shipping & receiving products desired by customers while fixing any errors in the UPS system with lost packages.Management assisted in multiple ways in technique  and elevation in promotions , took the job seriously while not allowing no employee to fail. There is no hard part to this occupation. The best part of this job is networking and introduction to multiple personalities."
good,"Fast paced package handling, there's not much to tell about it all I do is unload the trucks, there's boxes that weights up to 149 pounds but most are below 80. Normal mid weight boxes would be purina dog food, 20 to 63 pnds"
good,"UPS is over het algemeen een leuk bedrijf, alleen heeft het management te veel te zeggen en daardoor gaan er nogal wat dingen  mis gaan in het warehouse."
good,"Working for the UPS warehouse was a prospering experience for me, its like I was getting paid to work out."
good,"At beginning it was a difficult job since we had not much time to get a proper training since it was pick seasonal time but once you learn how everything works it gets easier, it was a fun job!"

good,"this type of job is not for everyone it is a fast pace  , go get'em, hustle everyday, but still need to keep your commen sense as far as what task are in front of you that need to be done"
good,Pays well and they pay for all of my healthcare benefits. I have plenty of job security with my job being union. The biggest down fall is the management. They have people running the place and telling you how to do your job that have never actually done your job.
good,"Good company to work for. I'm learning a lot and I have good coworkers.  Though it's seasonal,  I've gained some valuable skills which will be useful."
good,A typical day at work consisted of me helping the driver deliver packages to the different addresses we had. I learned that every customer had a different amount of packages. The management was very poor. You never knew when you were going to work the next day.
good,"Busy from start to finish. This job taught me organization is key to being productive, i also learned how to read a map and plan the best route. Management is cool, but don't ever expect a pat on the back, ever.  My co-workers are insightful. Hardest part of the job is not having much of a balance with life outside of work.  Most enjoyable part is the pay and benefits."

good,Overall pleasant place to work in.Learned valuable skills.Working with interesting people.Good salary.Unsociable working hours.The job is easy and pleasant yet responsible.
good,"Processed domestic and international packages"
good,I was an hourly employee who got tired of loading and unloading trucks so I applied for Management. once in management I could no longer be in the union and this made it difficult for full time employment so I left.
good,The benefits of working for a company like UPS are amazing. Working at UPS is also a great job for any college student who is in need of some extra money.

good,Helps to learn more about different people and how to handle different situation. Also has a nice superior who helps us in every situation when needed.
good,"I think UPS is the best package distribution service in the world. I think that they have made great innovations in the way that people purchase online such as Amazon hubs being strategically placed as well as companies like Toshiba located inside UPS' Louisville, Kentucky. The thing about UPS is that it is an excellent job if you can get in, and once you are in it takes time to move up because people don't leave. They have benefits second to none and higher up they have stock options as part of your advancement. The down part is that you are geographically locked in the state where you start almost always. If you live in Chattanooga, Tennessee right on the Georgia border and want to move to Atlanta, Georgia it is near impossible, but they can move you to the other side of the state to Memphis, Tennessee. In my case I was working in the small town of Athens, Tennessee and moved to Knoxville, Tennessee and was commuting an hour to and from work every day. I knew they had plenty of openings in Knoxville but I was told because it is a different region I could only move in one of three conditions: 1)Medical where I had to be close to the doctor or facility was being treated. 2)Educational where I would have to enroll in a college in Knoxville. 3)Marital where my spouse was accepting a position requiring her to move and because I am not married that automatically eliminated the third option. I worked at UPS over seven years as part time management. I had passed all of the tests for advancement the first year I was there. I never saw anyone getting promoted and saw quite a few center"
good,The best part about working at UPS is the fact that the job requires you to be active one of the main reasons why I applied. I dislike working in an environment that requires me to sit and surrounded by four walls.
good,most employees only work 3-4 hours a day and make minimum wage so it is nice as a second job. Physical job and need to pay attention to details. It is a warehouse job and there doesn't seem to be a janitor that actually cleans the place. Very dusty!
good,driving around delivering packages at commercial and residential locations.I learned how to use a diad pad to enter in codes for packages.the hardest part of the job was working in a rain storm.
good,"opens and closes facility, daily balancing of charges and payments and prepares bank deposits. Designs and prints business cards, flyers, post cards, etc. Packs, ships and receives parcels. Sorts mail and packages for mail box holders. Assists customers with faxing both domestic and international, making copies and notary services while offering excellent customer servic"
good,"i drove to a pod in the neighborhood i was assigned to. i had to unload golf cart and trailer from the pod. after that a ups truck comes and drops off all the packages to me that have to be delivered in the neighborhood. then after i receive the package i load them up in golf cart in order by the package number. then i delivered them to the customer. i also used a scanner to scan package. i've learned how to use a ups scanner. i worked alone so really didn't have any co-workers. there was no real hard part about this job,everything was pretty easy. the most i enjoyed about working for ups was being able to work on my own."
good,Fun and fast paced. good hours and good pay. I had a great time working with new people. very..interesting i must say. i may come back next year .
good,It is never a boring day working with UPS with the different types of drivers and customers I interacted with. I learned through delivering packages that UPS can still touch peoples' lives. I worked with a great driver and he taught me how to do additional things on the job so i could probably apply for a more permanent position. The most difficult part of the job is delivering to new places in the dark and the most enjoyable part of the day is meeting the people we deliver to. It's great to make someone's day by handing them something they've been waiting for.
good,"Always show up on time be ready to work and be safe dont risk hurting yourself, the managers will help with accommodations if needed."
good,"It's a great company (as anyone will tell you).  Great benefits, great pay and one of the few companies that still offer a pension.  It's also incredibly demanding and fast paced.  The friendly front UPS drivers is a facade.  UPS (FedEx too) package drivers dig in for an average of 52 hours a week, walking, jogging, running and lifting the entire time."
good,Productive workplace where teamwork is appreciated.  I get along well with co-workers and management and strive to accomplish daily goals
good,Working at Ups was my best co op experience. because i got to learn about packaging an item according to the dimensions when a customer brought it in. made shipping documents for the packages. and also got to interact and share my ideas with customers.
good,"UPS was a great learning opportunity for me. Starting as a dock clerk/ adminstrative assistant, I learned quickly the details about how a freight dock operates, and was able to work on almost any assignment requested of me. I learned the dock operation, road dispatch, and city dispatch. My coworkers were friendly, and it was actually a joy coming into work, and getting to know a lot of people. The hardest part of my job was working in the elements on the dock. It was definetely a struggle working in the winter months. The most enjoyable part of my job was learning so many different tasks on the job, and being able to help in many different departments when needed."
good,west elm was a great job.until management switched. I personally loved working here until the change of supervisors and management. Once this took place they people of hire power cared more about you caring for them and not the job i was release do to me not smiling at a manager with i feel was wrong but hey what can you do if you are only a stock boy.
good,"UPS has great opportunities, but the culture is geared towards 40+. The building is always quiet like you are walking on eggshells, but definitely diverse and good place to settle for the long haul."
good,"Co-workers are the backbone of UPS, while management is more focused on production, vice the livelihood of the truck drivers, while package car managers are more interested in the worker vice the work, which makes the workplace a great place to be."
good,"I was a clerk at The UPS Store. My job ranged from answering phones, cash handling, mail sorting, copying and faxing to  packaging & shipping items brought in."
good,UPS Brazil/ SP - Great place with great atmosphere...providing all sources for an excellent logistics/transport and allocation.
good,"At first the hours weren't so great. It lasted all through november and probably a week of december with only 4 to 5 hours of work when i was told I would be working 7 to 8 hours the whole time. But it only gets heavy around mid December towards January. Even though the job is suppose to end after new years, they kept me for another 2 weeks because the volume of shipments were still high."
good,"training employees and loading trucks to get the drivers out on time."
good,"A typical day at UPS involves unloading packages from at least 4-5 trucks a day for 4-6 hrs out of the day, 5 days a week ,Sunday through Thursday. Ive learned while at UPS that safety is a very important factor for everything to run productively and successfully . Its more like a workout than a real hassle and you still have time to yourself to handle any personal affairs after work"
good,shift started at 4am and ended at 8am... you work from the time you walk in to the time you walk out. if you are late for your shift you will not work

good,There is a sense of urgency to complete the requirements for the job assigned to you. Everyone is a pleasure to be around.
good,A typical day required employees to begin work at the earliest hours of the day. I learned organizational skills and how to use scanners. MGMT was not really helpful. Team work was a must in order to complete task. The hardest part of the job was the repetition and no rest. The most enjoyable was the hours passing quickly
good,"Typical day at work, depending on the weather its twice as worse inside. I learned to work at a faster pace. The management was cool they were very encouraging. My co workers were very friendly and helpful. the hardest part of the job is the last load of trucks at the end  of the night. The most enjoying is working there period."
good,The days can be long while working seasonally. Once you get into the union then you have a steady job with great pay. Then are very strict about driving rules but the union can and will protect your job after the 30 day probation.
good,"on a typical day, I clock in at 11pm work non-stop till break, 15 min break, then back to it. Sometimes my nights can be long, sometimes there short. I Always was the last man to finish."

good,"Interacting with varies of people, and being able to provide them with anything they may need"
good,It is not as easy as it looks but I loved the challenge. Meeting new faces everyday and satisfying the customer was always a plus and well worth it.
good,A very routine work shift. Management seemed quiet and interaction with was kept at a minimum. Coworkers were great and a majority pulled their weight in work. The hardest part of the job was the physical demand. It is definitely a job for a 18 - 26 year old. Ideal for a person attending college. Most enjoyable is the work team; highly motivated and gets the task at hand done.
good,"•	Supervisor of approximately 45 employees, managing operations, directing information as well as relaying information to managers."
good,"If you were open to a fast and efficient work ethic this was a perfect position. I enjoyed the driver I was paired with. He treated me with lots of respect, even being a seasonal employee for Christmas time. I would recommend this position any time it comes up. It pays well and if you are willing to work hard and fast delivering packages to the doors then this could be a good position."
good,"A typical day centers around the unloading and loading of UPS aircrafts, as well as UPS ground vehicles. I learned how a large logistics company works and how package volume is moved. I learned how to supervise employees as well as other aspects of a job in management such as professionalism and decision making. I had good relations with my co-workers before and after I was promoted to management. The hardest part of the job was having to discipline employees who I had previously worked with before becoming management. The most enjoyable part of the job was the sense of accomplishment after a successful night of work."
good,"UPS is great if you have time to invest for a great paying job in the future. You start off low in pay, but there is the hope of becoming a driver in a year. "
good,"i also enjoyed the opportunity to advance so quickly, however i had a horrible floor manager"
good,"Unload freight from customers picked up from the day locally, and out of state, and deliver to next trailer for customer delivery the next day or next available day determined by mileage, repack if nessary"
good,The job I accepted with this company is only for seasonal work so there aren't many benefits. But I do enjoy working outside and the flexibility the work offers. I enjoy my co-workers company and assistance very much and the human resources and corporate department seem to be very fair. From what I am told by the human resources department a full-time driver is compensated quite well for the work given to them. If the opportunity arose I would enjoy working full-time for this company.
good,Good management and customer service. Very friendly place.
good,"hard work, some think its not worth the pay. part time employee and i would go back in a heart beat"
good,"Each day we have to expect the unexpected.  Although there is a normal routine we follow here there is always something that can go wrong.  We have to be able to think on our feet and make correct judgment calls.  There are times that the decisions we make are not correct so we always analyze the previous day.   "
good,"Great management, friendly work environment. Nice co-workers."
good,"Day to day routines are very repetitive but with different daily scenarios that require smart business ethics to effectively resolve problem situations. Although all company's may have hard times, there isn't a better group of people that I would choose to work with. Hard working, dependable and respectable (it's a two way street)"
good,"This is a great company to work for. Typical work days last about 4 hours, the pay is better now that the new contract has been revised."
good,"The best part of this job is the benefits. There is School tuition reimbursement, full benefits, and decent pay for part time work."
good,"consistent non stop hard work, cool place to work, always busy."
good,"hot in the summer cold in the winter.  the benefits are great, but like most corporate work places, management required too much for too little"

good,"Aprendi diversas formas de resolver problemas, ser dinâmica e responsável. Um ambiente muito bom e as pessoas agradáveis."
good,"The company gave me lots of exposure to the foreign clients."

good,"A typical day at work includes helping customers with shipping and packaging, or any print jobs they may have. I learned a lot about shipping throughout the US and internationally, and also learned a lot about different types of print jobs and papers, etc. My co workers are some of the most motivated people I met, it's a small group of us and we all get along. The hardest part of my job is probably just having to lift heavy boxes that are over 100 pounds."
good,"Usually start at 4:00 a.m.,  go to my assigned trucks.  My co-workers would start unloading packages from trucks and packages would run down a belt.  My co-workers were always helpful in helping me get my packages off the belt, as well as I was for them.  The management was also always there to help.  I learned that helping another co-worker will come back to help you.  The hardest part when packages weighed over 50lbs.  I enjoyed most, being busy for the time I was there."
good,"A typical day of work for me includes helping about a dozen customers, my co-workers prefer the local interaction while i prefer center tasks, sorting 3-5 buckets of mail and parcels for customers that pay for a box in a box-holder system, packing orders as they come in, and processing drop-off (incoming) packages as well as shipments (outgoing). "

good,Every day was different.  We were like a big family and the customers were part of that family as well.

good,The associates and management made the work day relaxing and enjoyable.  Stress free.
good,"I currently work on the evening shift or the re-load. This is where we unload the packages that were picked up from customers during the day and loaded back on trucks to be sent to other buildings throughout the southeast. Part of the time I help with the unloading process and the other half of my work day is moving empty trucks to the holding lot so other trucks can be unloaded. In my time at UPS I have learned a lot about logistics and how a huge company operates. The management is under a lot of stress there and every move they make is being watched. But they are very good at what they do, and I have always gotten along with them. The hardest part of the job is trying to get all the packages where they are supposed to go within the time frame UPS gives us. I enjoy my job but I enjoy working with my coworkers most, building the relationship and friendship with most of them."
good,"Lots Of fun great company to work for"

good,started work at 3am and worked until the last plane came in and was unloaded
good,"If your able to tough it out for the first year working part time yet having another job on the side then you can obtain generous benefits and work your career level up to gain more salary and hours. This company is based on seniority but if you can bite your tongue and work your way up smart, then the possibilities are in your control."
good,I loved working at UPS because everything was at your comfortable speed. You had to get comfortable working fast in order to do so. No one pressured you about moving slow or anything. I also loved sorting it was sort of a stress reliever. Throwing those big boxes around relieved me of anger when i had some. I learned about the diffrent machines and things of that nature.
good,The UPS is a great place to work if you have a solid work ethic and understand how to be a team player.  I was able to move up the management ranks in a relatively short amount of time because I proved myself and was rewarded with the trust of upper management.  
good,"• Supervised areas of Inbound/Outbound Loads, Distribution Sort Operations,"
good,"First job out of college. Supervised unload shift in the early A.M. Everything with UPS is judged in seconds and minutes, not hours or shifts.

good,A typical day at work at Blue Planet Accounting was very good. I always learned new and faster way to do my job and how to be more organized. The management was also very good. Everything was managed well. The hardest part of the job was being able to keep up with the clients but when your fast and well organized its no problem. The most enjoyable part of the day was knowing that you have helped someone in need and I did my job well.
good,"I worked Monday thru Friday earned 20 hours per week. This was my 1st job with benefits and I was dedicated and hard working. This job showed me how to responsible and work in a timely fashion. Management hounded us to meet company expected numbers and we did most times, I felt that pushed me to excel at my simple job of loading packages. To this day I have many friends still there and appreicate their dedication to their jobs. The hardest part of loading at UPS was around the holidays, pace was quicker, packages were bigger and more plentiful but our team handled it. I enjoyed my time at UPS since the job was a definite workout, + +, but this company had a definite plan in place and executed it daily. Something that was sorely missing at Hostess Brands."
good,In my almost 12 years at UPS I enjoyed most of my work. I had a great working relationship with my management team. It is a fast paced and goal oriented work environment. Advancement is available but it can take years to go full time without the proper credentials. If you plan on staying there for a long time then remaining hourly is the route to take. You may have to work more than one job for years but the full time compensation and benefits are top notch. They also provide tuition re-embursement for college students. The hardest part of the job was managing employees with more seniority and experience than me. The most enjoyable part was being able to meet goals and provide service to our customers.
good,"If you can stick with it do it. laid back environment. great co-workers, good management, good pay."
good,With hard work and dedication... the sky is the limit with UPS. I enjoyed our employee relations committee the most. Working with a team to help make our work environment the very best it could be. Planning and providing Microsoft training for co-workers; planning and facilitating team building exercises. I discovered a personal passion while working for UPS. While helping to create a positive working environment I learned firsthand that happy employees are employees who are happy to work. That is something I intend to carry with me throughout my life. UPS is a great place to work.

good,"I worked there for 2 years and was moved from 3 different position starting on the lower end and moving from general warehouse worker, to inventory control, to overall office manager. everyday i came in early to set up work for the workers managed calls and logs. I was a self starter and didn't have anyone to motivate me but myself. my co-workers were great people and were amazing to work with. my job was hard enough, but it was a retail based job so peak seasons and time frames made the work load increasingly harder but I persevered."
good,Meet and greet customers. Help them with any questions they might have. Interact with new people daily. Everybody at work was close.
good,While my on and off stint ant UPS Store Inc. I learned a lot about customer service and how to deal with customers that were displeased with certain services. I dealt directly with customers on the phone and acted as a liaison between customers and actual UPS employees to make sure that every customer needs were met.
good,"UPS Drivers are the hardest working employees we have out on the roadways. They struggle on a daily basis, through good weather and bad, through heat and cold temperatures, through snow and thunderstorms, with no heat or a/c in those big brown trucks. These men and women put package and freight deliveries above and beyond there own health and well-being for the benefits of their customers. They are some of the hardest working persons I have ever been in contact with. Therefore, over the Winter Holiday Season, I signed up to be a Driver's Helper."

good,"In office early every morning, meeting with management, talking to drivers to learn about, customer satisfaction and challenges. The learning experience was, how important logistic service is. The company is global, and continues to grow in products and services. Management, has to be extremely regimented, no exceptions are exceptable. Some co-workers were very kind and team oriented. The most difficult part of the job, were extremely early hours, and extremely late hours the day after Thanksgiving until New Years Eve. Major sacrifice regarding family. The most enjoyable part of the position, was being able to manage the accounts, and grow the business."
good,"alot has changed from the beginning to the present. Full of life employees and great service. from a working prospective it is ran just how a great business should be ran, its a mom and pops shop, no benefits, but nothing other than happy employees everyone works as a team and gets done what is needed to get done. they are very busy and always have something going on. i may not have liked working there all the time, but in the end i loved it. new friends and great people. i would suggest this job to anybody who wants to be treated fairly, with respect, and a non stop on your feet job. its definitley different and a great starter job and for anyone who is looking to work an out of the ordinary job.

good,"Be ready to work hard, be on time and have a positive attitude about your position. Being Brown is have s sense of pride and make sure your customer gets their package on time"
good,"Enjoyed it! Wish there was an option to stay on after holidays. The pay was good and hours not.bad. The assembly line needs worked  on."

Try me, I've been there 19yrs ;)  Management anywhere is going to possibly have their flaws, but I'm not in management so I don't know what it's like to have that constant stress.  Seriously, the benefits are amAzing for part-time work."
good,Very good company to work for and grow with nothing but nice people that work hard everyday to make customers happy. I have been a seasonal driver helper twice now and the pay is good and the job motivates you when you make a customer happy.
good,UPS is a energizing company when your are working in ups you always gonna feel the capacity and courage to do your work everybody in ups is awake 24/7
good,"I liked working here but the hours sometimes are too long, and inconvenient. But it’s fast paced and have nobody telling you what to do. You do meet people here and there at are completely rude or illogical. Overall not a bad place to work at"
good,The good thing about this job was you get to meet new people and make new friends. the bad thing was u don’t get paid enough. I wish you could also take a longer break.
good,"Love the job , just time for change.i moved to manager position but it feels like im stuck and there is no where else to go from there. I'm ready for a new challenge."
good,Physically challenging fast paced work environment. Interest  insight into the delivery business. Good interaction with co-workers and management. Disappointed that full time employment not realized.
good,"If you're looking to work hard long days, shed a few pounds and earn great pay during the holiday season look no further!!! I wish the season lasted a bit longer, but I am grateful for the opportunity to work for the company. My second season with the company. I plan to do it again next season."
good,"I loved working with my driver. I got to meet lots of people and most were more than happy to see me.  Many stated they liked seeing the same helper with the same driver. Although the hours can be long you expect it. Each day is a different schedule depending on stop/box volume.  In the beginning of peak only 2 to 3 hours per day, couple weeks before Christmas I was working almost 12 hours each day M-F.  Management sends help when it can if more help can be found. Overall I had a great experience. I worked Peak Season 2018 and 2019. I worked out of Belleville, IL.  The drivers there are a fun group to work with."
good,Fun place to learn tones of new skills they have so many differet things to learn and teach yu to excell great place to learn your home town even better
good,Good company and manager to work for. The owner has been wonderful to work for the past 10 years on and off. I have never had any problems with my manager.
good,"If you're looking to solidify your career and quick advancement ,UPS is for you.! The weather wasn't an issue it was mainly the volume of boxes and the shipping process. Peak season will make or break you! the checks are swollen and the benefits are excellent but the overall culture and the environment posed as an issue when you try to make friends or extend an olive branch. If you stay to yourself, be prompt and respectable you'll go far within this company."
good,"Customers are usually great, but dogs need to be on leashes and locked up."
good,UPS is a great company to work for and extremely reputable and well known. They take care of their employees and ensure that the best working conditions as possible are provided. Working for UPS helped me learn a lot and the management was always respectful and encouraging.
good,"I loved the hours that worked around my kids, the ability to make enough on a pay check to keep up rent\bills & not work my days away.  Often opportunities arise to gain experience in other areas such as as delivery driver helper where you can get farther ahead in possibility for advancement in the future & show how muvh you want to work & be learn."
good,Had a great time as a seasonal PVD. Great people to work for. Supervisor was awesome guy. Helped make the experience enjoyable. Looking forward to helping out again next year.
good,UPS is a good company to start working for if Hired full time the benifets are great and the hours are good and the people are very helpful in anything that you have questions about
good,"I started during the busy season, and I got welcomed by the team, throughout the next couple of weeks , I had the routine down, and fellow employees were very helpful...good place to work.."
good,The only problem i had was not knowing if I was working that day. Otherwise it was a fun rewarding Job. Taking package form the truck and back again. Great workout and fun to do.
good,"My time at UPS was good and beneficial for me in learning what I want out of a company. However, during my time there I felt underutilized and did not have much to do."
good,"Finally the job, pay and benefits fit for the employee. It is hard to find a place that treats its employees so fair. I love working for this employer."
good,"I'm a seasonal driver here, but I'm well paid and get a lot of help from other drivers and management. There's room for better communication from dispatch to the drivers. It's hard being on call and having to work every weekend, but it's a great place to work."
good,"This is a wonderful place to work! You get paid weekly, and they'll help you with school and there are really good supervisors here. The only issue is if you're working part time, your check for the week will be less than $200.. but if you're just looking for a part time job with benefits, this is the place!"
good,Even Though I am a seasonal helper I have been paired with a very amazing driver! We get along and we have fun delivering packages all day long which makes the day pass by quickly. We have other drivers at the depot that are great to work with as well! I enjoy the morning sorting then when we head out we are on fire and get all of the packages delivered!
good,UPS is a very rewarding company to work for. The pay and benefits are excellent. Coworkers are friendly and helpful. The biggest downside is that it is fast paced and stressful.
good,Enjoyed the job. Wish they had a permanent position. Commute 5 minutes from my home. Very Busy work atmosphere during the holiday season. A number of locations which allows for transferring.
good,Hard part of the job is heavy lifting and walking up and Down stairs and the heat is crazy hot in the truck. We also have to memorize various street names and addresses and
good,This company has many opportunities and great benefits  They care for their people  Training is thorough and easy  They have a get the job done safely attitude  I feel this company would be a great career opportunity
good,UPS is a great and progressive company which focusing heavily on their customers. Really great team of people although openings are hard to come by sometimes.
good,I like that I got to meet people from all over the world. Working for the UPS store in Washington was a fun experience. I enjoyed being busy and that responsibility of mail sorting for P.O. boxes was fun.
good,Great place to work when you run out of other options. Union jobs are compensated based on seniority and you can make a great living once full time just no work life balance.
good,I had a very good supervisor he would give us incentives when we got the job completed. Communicated with each other respectfully and worked as a team.
good,"Management is very nice , pay is good for seasonal personal vehicle driver $21.00 per hour plus .58 a mile. I will definitely like to return next season."
good,"Definitely, hard physical job with multiple moving parts. Could often be very stressful. The job could make the drivers day smooth and efficient or could make the day really stressful for them so being efficient fast and dependable was critical."
good,"I have enjoyed working at ups it has provided an opportunity to excell and advance my career"
good,"1.) Driving around delivering packages from business to business and homes to homes. "
good,I enjoy working at the THE UPS STORE. It is a very comfortable workplace. It is fast-paced and I get to meet new people everyday. It is a perfect job for family-oriented people.
good,UPS is a great company to work for. Unfortunately I work on the non union side of UPS so there isn't much room for growth in position or pay. The benefits are great and the people are great.
good,"Very great job for those who enjoy physical work.  I actually had the best supervisor I think I could have ever wanted.  While I was working I did have some troubling times, but I was able to pull through.  I actually enjoyed most of my time there."
good,"Typical day at work was fast pasted , hot in the summer , stressful at times . Learn that teamwork is very important . The hardest part of the job would be the hotness and the stress of not trying to overflow your shoots ."
good,Although they have plenty of benefits it does take a while for someone to get livable working hours. Seniority is priority so you must be there for years to actually get good hours.
good,I would rate my work experience a 10/10. Have no complaints other than seniority and how high they hold it above new comers. Kinda hard to make a name for yourself especially with a big group of new faces. Other than that I loved it.
good,Very friendly work colleagues and they work around your schedule. They always asked the night before or in the morning if you could come in. Learned a lot about the logistics of delivering packages.
good,Good job. Pretty good pay . Great benefits. Room for advancement. Helps you stay in good physical shape. Friendly employees. Free company merchandise. Company BBQs from time to time.
good,a days work was always busy and challenging answered phones a lot of dispatching complete orders of proper delivery conference calls are the best always updates training classes lots and lots of paperwork always a very beautiful day always learning new things and setting more and improved ways to better our company
good,I didn't know why i was laid off i wanted to be hired permanently i got to know most of the employees and the drivers the building is really huge i wish i could get hired there as a start
good,Fast paced delivery during peak season. Safety is the first priority and professionalism is a must. Must be self motivated and willing to go the extra mile at times to get the job done.
good,"Working at UPS is difficult not because of the long hours or heavy lifting, when you would have to work this hours without end sometimes is when it got hard, having to work harder than the person next to you was what made it get hard. Management was good because they showed they cared but they were tired themselves. The job was straightforward and easy to understand but it was hard to get used to"
good,Great company to work for. The most appealing thing about working at this hub in Nashua is the people. You cannot get a better group of employees together in one building I don’t think anywhere else. I would not change these people for anything we seriously literally are a team
good,"Good job but salary is not good. "
good,It was a great job. I was working here through a temporary service during a peak Season so after peak season the main assignment was done and they let a lot of workers go.
good,great place to work along with great benefits. yes it is hard manual labor at a very fast pace. I left everyday like I had accomplished something I could be proud of.
good,"I was excited to go to work everyday to put forth my 100 percent knowing I did the best of my ability to make sure all packages got to their destinations."
good,"This is a great company to work for but is very competitive,fast-paced and chellenging in consumers satisfaction,Room for advancement,Skilled,and overall a great and rewarding position"
good,"Tough and long hours that gave workers a good feeling of completion. I enjoyed every minute on the truck, and building a bond with my leader. Great work attitude needed for this role."
good,I like working for UPS  the benefits are excellent. It's a really good company to work for . The people are nice and respectful. They will help you if you need anything. All you have to do is ask for help .
good,"I was a package handler at ups and it was by far one of the most difficult jobs I have done just bekause it was the night shift and there is always so much lifting and dodging heavy objects inside the truck, the management is great they help there employees succeed and push you to work harder and help give confidence to those who are having a hard time during work."
good,"This is a very fast paced and physical job.  It’s an excellent part-time job to supplement income, but you will have to be physically fit to be successful."
good,"coworkers are competitive"
good,Wish they would see how good you are & raise you not just one coworker. Really recommend this job it’s good learning customer service experience & also you learn how to multitask in this job.
good,"Working as a seasonal driver helper was a great experience. I had fun seeing different neighborhoods, and being outside. I'm a very active person who has a hard time being still, and I got to move every minute. Only flaw is that I worked during the winter, and my hands were frostbitten often."
good,UPS is a fast pace work environment heavy lifting of boxes and other items. Had to work in many different type of weather conditions. The management was very helpful and good leaders.
good,I have no stress with this job. I have excellent benefits as a part time ramp supervisor at O’Hare Airport. We work in teams and we are responsible for the safety of our team members. We have regular meetings to discuss open issues and other job related criteria.
good,"I like working for ups. The work is hard and it's hot/cold, so if u have a problem with that then don't bother working the loader positions. Anyways, if you wanna work hard get paid for it and get in shape and get paid work the loader position. Management is pretty good at responding to concerns and plus the company seems to care a lot about their employees. It's competitive. They expect you to scan about 1000 box's in four hours so get ready to work hard."
good,"I worked for United parcel service for thirty years, i retired back in August 2015. My career was long and very stressed but it was a good company to work for, the benefits was great 👍. the work was on a quick pace."
good,Running your own operation is extremely challenging and rewarding at times but also being vested with your employees life's can be tiring at times. Strong minded individuals thrive in these environments.
good,Um lugar ótimo para trabalhar pena que fechou no interior
good,i enjoyed working there. the people were great and the supervisors were too. i didn't like that input wasn't considered in a lot of decisions that affected our group.
good,"Long hours but compensated very well, UPS promotes from within and offers lots of opportunity for advancement. Work / Life balance needs to be better."
good,"Usually 5 hrs a day 25 hrs a week"
good,"I have worked at this UPS Call Center a few times in a number of Capacities, and some Contracts have been extended to lend my skills in other Departments."
good,Ups was a very nice place to work. The management was very professional and the followed the protocol very well. The was was hard but it didn’t take long to adjust to.
good,it was fast pace you hade to move a lot and lift heavy bags rapidly they had a nice break room and when it was break time every thing shut down so every one hade break at the same time
good,Good pay and benefits great environmental to work with good employees but managers could use some more training. But overall great job and its room for moving up to other positions and you will be compensated.
good,"Job doesnt come home with you, but the hours can get long, especially during the christmas season."
good,I work at UPS daily making sure that we are in compliance with all safety laws.  We make sure that all employees are current in their CDL’s and their DOT physicals.  We work with OSHA to insure we are meeting all standards. We make sure we are keeping up our records for internal and external audits.
good,"I received excellent training and mentoring during my time working at UPS. Tuition reimbursement  and 401k matching are excellent benefits available to all, part time and full time alike. The insurance is the same for new hires to the CEO."
good,"it was an okay job, for a college student i mean, not for a person who has kids though. not a good pay. I had to work really early in the morning and had to go to school all day. Not enough sleep."
good,"Working at UPS is about what you would expect. The environment is often chaotic and hectic, with a lot of heavy physical labor, depending on the area you work. The pay is competitive and the benefits were great, but it was a very high burnout environment."
good,"The job was nice, fast/slow paced at the same time. It kept people going, ive learned some team work. The hardest part of the job was having lazy teammates but the most enjoyable part was also working as a team with a competent teammate."
good,"It's a easy job but since ur in a factory type setting  the weather affect inside so hot but it's a easy job to do, lifting and lowering packages so it's a workout"
good,"You must start out as on hourly employee"
good,Make sure to where are steel toed boots lift properly and ask for help when you need it.  This job could be very dangerous potential.  Be sure to know what all of the sides mean on the box’s.
good,"fast pace work environment "
good,"I liked the job, it was active, and involved a lot of communication with other employees. The skills required are quickly learned, and the other employees are generally helpful in the learning process. The only bad days I had were the extreme weather days due to the workspace being primarily outside."
good,Picking the boxes in the truck all the way to the top fromt to back in 30 mins u need to have 5 trucks done a day u have to move in a fast peast work hard two 30 mins lunch break we can only drink water and Gatorade do we don't past out cause it was very very hot
good,Work duties were driving to destinations route scheduled on a timely matter. Some airport arrands delivery and pick ups. Light air runs and deliveries and sorting packages were envolved as well. CODs customer service as well as helping customers set up packages sent out.
good,Hard labor and little pay and might be going on strike..we worked as a team on the strong side and always done our best..we made it through every storm...
good,"It was a not bad paying job, just know you gonna work for every dollar. The job place I worked the guy that they had to run the new guys an control there schedule , he would play favorites an let the person he like run more hours an an whoever he wasn’t to fond of cut there hours for those he did like . But that was jus how things were ran where I worked at ."
good,"Ups is a great opportunity for anyone. Their benefits i think are the best. You must be willing to think long term, thats why i say its not a job its a career."
good,"If you can make sense from clutter, work fast and hard. Great job, great benefits, paid vacation, pension, 401k. More walking than driving, but it is a very fun excited fast paced job!"
good,"enjoyed working in san bruno, ca. Training was available and the time went by so fast the day just went by. During seasonal time overtime is great and make double time on sixth day,"
good,Although I only worked there on and off for a few months it was a good workplace they just didn't have enough hours available for me to be able to continue to work there and pay my bills.
good,"Each store is franchised, so it will all depend on the owner you work with. The owner I work with is amazing however during slow periods of work, hours need to be cut back."
good,get a phone call early in the morning as to where to meet your driver. get in the truck and youre off and rolling. learned how packages are tracked and how to use a computer system to scan the packages to show they are delivered. learn how to organize the truck for efficiency.
good,It was a great job I learned a lot about people skills I had a environment that I like but because it was seasonal I was a little upset because I didn’t ms not one day of work I loved what I did
good,As a pre loader you are going to work your butt off especially during the peak season which starts after Halloween and goes through new years.  If you do your job the right way then you will be rewarded for that
good,stressful and fast paced people dont believe in team work or helping each other as they claim its not the easy as people may think work load is heavy and very hot in the summer and very cold in the winter
good,they help everyone to grow and to achiever their primary goals. They get you ready for the future. They have drink machines and snack machines that are there for your convience
good,You may be fooled by the fact that this company is paying almost £12 an hour to unskilled workers. But my friend do not be fooled as these are the worst hours you will ever work. Super anti-social hours.
good,good place but no advancement.....you will never go further than what you are at UPS/SCS......advancement is not allowed for some odd reason...otherwise good
good,"As a seasonal driver you have to make sure that you are on time, don't hit anything and be flexible. You will get a lot of hours of driving time. If you expect to be a full time driver once you finish the season please don't think that. "
good,"Great atmosphere. Ownership of The UPS Store is a fulfilling experience. However, it is most profitable if you are a multiple store owner which is strongly suggested."
good,Work was the same routine everyday. Nice easy environment. Basically preformed all the tasks of a driver except the actual job. Customers and supervisor were always friendly
good,"Greatly compensated company, with great benefits, however management is very pressuring. A lot of disputes between corporate and union languages.  But overall a good place for advancement."
good,Working for UPS was a challenging job for me in a good way. I loved the fast past action. My supervisor was extremely nice and the call girls were amazing and on point always if a problem existed. Loved being on the Team !
good,"It’s a good experience just too long working and no increment at hourly"
good,"Loading and Unloading package trucks, High paced delivery and driving in changing conditions.  Drivers training was helpful in everyday driving.  The management staff was subpar.  Lots of packages and the flow never stopped."
good,UPS is one of the few companies where its employees still take pride in longevity. I worked at UPS 33 years and developed some lifelong friends. I recommend this company for young energetic job seekers
good,"Hectic pace during the peak season followed by a slow time with little to no work.  No two days are the same, you can go from having a truck that is blown out the doors to the next day having no work."
good,"Working with this company helped me to build and better my communication skills, character, and humbled me greatly. I learned a great deal about teamwork and working together to work safe and reach our intended goals and provide the best service to our customers. Typical workdays were long and strenuous but were only stressful if you allowed them to be as with any job. Hardest part of the day was dealing with parking and traffic. The most enjoyable moments on the job was the interaction with all the wonderful people."
good,I loved it. I wish it lasted longer. I keep triing to apply again and again. It won't let me. It still says I am an employee. When the job ended. I've done this for 4 years seasonal.
good,"A good place to work ona long term,  a work with a lot of advancements and with a full benefits  , as long as you can stay after the season, other wise it’s inky a seasonal"
good,"This job is not for everyone. It is very physical and takes a lot out of you, especially at first in most positions. Other tan that, there seems to be a lot of opportunity for advancement and they have a weekly bonus if youre on time all week."
good,be ready to work as soon as you walk through the door customer service is a must management is there to guide you if you need help great environment to work in
good,"I say it was hard an fun place to work at due to the fast pace and the hard work and the body pain,but fun because you can seething you've never seen before and see how ups works and who is the real Santa lol."
good,Assignment was short but room to apply for a permanent position. Managers did not micro manage. You can not be easily offended mostly guys so vulgar language takes place.
good,"I was able to pass the training and obtain employment, but my experience was unusual at best, it's a tough place to work if you are military minded you will fit in just fine."
good,"Hard work, honest pay and the management is great. It is however, hard to get full time hours which leaves some to need an additional job in order to get the pay one desires."
good,I been working their for 4 seasons as a seasonal employee. If  want extra money to get by it's a good company to work for a couple of months. If you want full time you have to work a year to get in the union and receive benefits. They will move you up to a driver in a certain grace period.
good,Very fast paced and demanding as is the nature of package delivery.  Not a job for everyone.  A strong team culture where everyone shares in the responsibility.
good,"I love my work but any large company has communication pipeline issues, I wish we could get past that, but its simple economics. If everyone pulled their weight, we would be successful, and we are."
good,The benefits are great hours are reasonable and you will always grow with in the company from sorting to unloading driving and more like supervisor or safety rep ups has many opportunities perfect if your a student of just need some extra cash
good,10 minute break then you are back deep inside the truck alone.  200$ bonus given to people but not those who has been working there so people come in and get the check that I get for free plus there hours per week.
good,Good fast pace can be stressful. Always seems to be one or to stos more the the route can handle..never time to stop for luch thirty minute break without missing a pick up for an early closing costomer
good,Working at United Parcel Service provided an outstanding sense of teamwork and fellowship.  The company has a razor sharp focus and vison and this helps to provide a very stable work environment.
good,Very busy they train u on everything u work long hours it a very fast paste it kind of lackey with the training when you get your CDL they also train you with Forklift
good,Tremendous amount of work load put on individual drivers daily. Great pay and benefits package although I wasn’t employed there long enough to receive and benefits.
good,I worked for 9 years with UPS and was able to move up within the company. I was active and didn't ever have a day where there was not enough work to do. Not a bad place to work while I was in school.
good,Great place to work and was awesome co-workers.  Different management team and cause the job to be more stressful than it should have been.  They just wanted the best performance out of everyone.  Grateful to have had the opportunity to work there.
good,"i liked working at ups. fast moving, you have to go in ready to work. I got the hang of scanning packages and labeling them. when i switched to the loading the ups van, it was kind of hard but i actually managed it well. i never gave up at all."
good,"UPS is a great place to work as a student or person looking for part time work with excellent benefits.  I worked in the package handling side and not the corporate side.  I enjoyed the daily challenge and the pace.  As a woman, it was important that I felt my chances for advancement were fair compared to men.  "
good,I enjoyed this job highly and its benefits are more than i could have asked for. the only thing i could criticize them on would be the management which seemed immature compared to their standards they held themselves up to.
good,As you may know UPS is one of the best companies out there to work for especially where I worked at NY . It’s all union work shop . Pay is excellent benefits are excellent over all work is good but gotta start from the bottom as package handlers to make trailer .
good,The work is hard but the pay is worth it. Family is left to the wayside while the pay makes up for it. During peak season NOV to JAN work becomes even more difficult.
good,UPS is a fast pace challenging competitive workplace.UPS has the best benefits and it is a company you can build in...they have the best discounts health and dental insurance......
good,"Seasonal Work, worked over 12 hours a day,  was fully aware that I would be let go once the holiday season was over.  I had no issues with the management at the location."
good,Poca organizzata in quanto agli orari ma per il resto ottima azienda mi piacerebbe lavorare ancora nella sicurezza poiché ho fatto soltanto sostituzioni grazie
good,Its a very physical job and wonderful employees to work with. The management was very respectful and nice. Allow good breaks. Had a chance to experience different cultures.
good,"I loved working at UPS, the only thing is that they shorted me on my pay. It was a bit rude in my opinion because I needed that paycheck to pay rent and bills."
good,"Working for The UPS store requires constant movement , heavy lifting and computer skill programming. Its the right place to have fun , be energetic and socialize. Everyone's friendly, hard working and loves to help the community ."
good,"During my time at UPS I am allowed to work independently and run my territory utilizing my own entrepreneurial spirit. I am given the opportunity to manage customer visits and office time as needed, as well as target new accounts in my assigned geography and customer segment as it relates to revenue potential. With the support of my Area Manager I create business proposals combining value offered by UPS with a competitive price. My ability to develop relationships with Key Decision Makers has greatly contributed to my success in my various positions."
good,I really still love to work in u.p.s company again
good,Since the store is considered retail the hours the is store is open is what need to be covered by at least 2 employees.  With a staff of only 4 sometimes overtime would be mandatory but overall extremely flexible when necessary.  The store owner lives out of state so the store was primarily run by the manager and myself with all decisions from ordering supplies to staffing changes left up to us.  Made for a stressful situation at times but an overall good place to work.
good,"They give the people a chance to grow , management is top notch.  It is hard work but it is worth it , the pay is weekly and the hours are nice you get to meet a lot of folks."
good,Overall UPS was a ok company . I loved the work I did on a daily basis however there wasn't much room to grown within the company. I feel I wasn't paid at the grade level I should have been . It is a very relaxed environment but I want to see myself grown within in company .
good,"Friendly and hardworking coworkers, cleanly work environment, management promotes well integrity. Customers are friendly, fast pace during rush times and lunch break for 30minutes"
good,Ups is a very physically demanding job I have been employed by UPS for a little over a year it does become mind numbing at some points but its a fast paced place its not easy.
good,"I like it so far, especially the fact you can work in peace without any customers besides management distracting you while your working. Breaks are reasonable & other workers  are great."
good,"Just stick through the hard work and make it to the top of the list. "
good,it can be stressful but its a good job as long as you unload but loading the cars can be crazy if you make management mad theyll give you more cars to load thats how they get rid of people saw some grown men cry because of it
good,"Great place to work and great people to work with, co-workers treat you like family,  and when needing help, my co-workers is always there to give a helping hand"
good,"Very large IT organization with many different departments and cultures. Some good, some not so much. As expected, management skills run from excellent to sub-par."
good,I am currently employed at UPS as a Sorter/Bagger. The job is very exciting assorting and bagging various packages for distribution to customers all over the country!
good,Working part time at the store was stressful but a good learning experience. Be prepared for the long lines of customers especially around Christmas. Also be prepared for unhappy customers whose package/mail were lost.
good,"UPS puts their employees first and treats them well.  I enjoyed working with all of my managers and was trained to do all sorts of new things.  For somebody that enjoys learning new things, UPS is excellent."
good,"My mother owned this store and I worked there primarily while I was attending school.  I enjoyed all of the customers.  It was a friendly, family type work environment."
good,"Go on line, load truck as quickly, neatly, and carefully as possible, if i finished my truck with enough time, "
good,"I did have very harsh managers but overall it was still enjoyable, There were many stressful times, the most stressful ones were close to holidays. This is the kind of job that you get used to the flow within a short period of time."
good,Great place to work for part time. Full time if you are a very good driver as well. They offer help with schooling which is a big plus when it comes to people who are still in school or wanting to return to school.
good,"UPS was a great place to work, met great people at work and on the route. 33 yrs later I am still in contact with people I met as a UPS driver. I learned a lot about Athens Ga and surrounding towns."
good,A typical day at ups is fun but also very productive. The co- workers and managers always have a positive attitude and we help eachother out. The hardest part about working here is loading the trucks once they get full.
good,The job was seasonal during Christmas. It was not that difficult and the pay was decent. There was no work schedule. They expected you to call in to try and work or they will tell you the day before.
good,"Typically a day starts with preparing your body physically, then sorting through the packages. Team work is needed in order to expedite this process. The most enjoyable part of the job is the benefits and working along side great people."
good,"With a good manager, it was the best job I've had. Temporarily "
good,Ups is a nice place to work but be prepared to work out! That’s a good thing about it if you are trying to lose weight or gain muscle. But overall it is a great atmosphere to be in.
good,Very easy work. Never a dull moment in UPS. Everyone is nice and friendly. Managers were a little uptight but other than that i enjoyed the job. I learned that you have to keep up pace when working in this kind of enviornment.
good,The employer as a whole is excellent.  I just happened to have a bad experience with my immediate manager and the station manager at my location which resulted in my employment termination.
good,UPS was a nice place to work ...but I did not see job advancement at the time...it was so many years ago...but i knew in the airline industry I could advance and be promoted for my hard work and skills...therefore I left UPS and joined what was USairways at the time ( we merged with AA airlines Oct. 2015)
good,Good Benefits and flexibility
good,"Demanding and fast-paced.  Very meticulous.  During the holiday season, it was imperative that people received their packages on time.  We made sure that the packages were promptly delivered so that people could have a very merry Christmas."
good,This was a great seasonal job.. Very fast paced & enjoyable. Great pay & able to put in extra overtime. It takes a few days to get the routine down but then it is fairly easy to understand.
good,"Fast paced environment of hard work. You will earn every cent they pay you. But it is fair, and there is a strong labor union to back you up. It can get hectic, and you go home sore some days. But for an unskilled part time position, it pays pretty well, and its steady work. Lift with your knees, not your back"
good,"I believe the culture has improved and there for moving in the right direction. During the time of my employment the Mesquite facility was the only operating system for the greater Dallas areas which made the culture that much harder to work within, with various changes, tragic deaths and more Dallas has sprung up many different hubs to accommodate this issue."
good,Overall my favorite job i had. It was paid weekend and at the position i was working it was fairly simple.my manager was a good guy and loved hard workers. I was always able to get on the schedule because i always was there.
good,"At least during peak season loading packages for 4-6 hours during the overnight crew was either slow or incredibly busy depending on the time of night, and it progressing got worse as time went on til Christmas. Get ready to be assailed by an obtuse amount of cardboard if you land this job!"
good,the experience of being able to greet your customers and see the satisfaction of them being pleased is a great and honest fun way too learn new people and make new friends...
good,Being a driver helper was temporary so learning fast and being punctual were required in order to excel. It is a very physically demanding position. Work boots are a must for safety. Communication with your driver is the most important factor in order to complete all stops and deliver all packages in a timely manner.
good,"I enjoyed my experience at The UPS Store very much. I have earned very much and hope to use what i have gained in my future jobs. The manager was super friendly and very understanding. The workplace was always kept clean. The part of the job that i enjoyed the most was talking to the customers, getting to know them and building a relationship with them."
good,i worked at airport over the holidays... and i loved it...fun and fast paced environment....launched and loaded planes during twilight hours...cold but very kool...lol
good,Ups was a job that I could just come in and go right to where i was unloading in a way i could relieve my stress. It was like a work out but where i could find a peace of mind
good,Nice place to earn extra money. That's all. You will need a 2nd job!!! It gets demanding during the Christmas season.  You have to handle alot of freight. Those hours are great!!!
good,We would only work for about 5 or 4 hours a day but during the holidays we would work longer hours. That was really the only thing i liked about the job besides my co workers. The management was very rude for no reasons sometimes i felt like they didnt know how to talk to people with respect it was just always a smart remark coming from them on a daily basis. I aslo worked ther for a year and was told i would get a raise every year i was there i never recived it i asked about it plenty times and never got a striaght answer
good,I love working here simply because everyday was different. The environment was constantly changing allowing me to adapt and make the necessary changes to be successful.
good,This is a job that you can do great in but at the time I didn't enjoy the work I was doing.  The job was very stressful and not that enjoyable.  This is a great company. But it wasn't for me.
good,I did enjoy ups and the driver I worked with. I did learn a lot about areas in the same town I live in. I wanted to stay on with ups; but that is on a different level.
good,Tough job compared to most but excellent company with great culture. Great coworkers and great work environment. Fair pay and excellent benefits. Would definitely recommend.
good,I handled packages in small sorts. I learned about working in a warehouse. All of the managers and supervisors were leaders they answered questions and were not disrespectful. I enjoyed my coworkers who were diverse in ethnicity. We all worked well as a team which made my nights go smoothly.
good,in order to excel at UPS you must be able to manage your own time and resources. UPS does allow its employee to work there designated patch of land how they choose. almost like owning your own business.
good,"UPS is a very rewarding job but it is very stressful and physically and mentally demanding. It is nice to be in a self-led environment all day but with constant deadlines, high expectations and truck full of deliveries you are forced to make the best decisions all day to safely and quickly deliver your packages. Management is very demanding."
good,"I was only a seasonal helper but it was a great time. My driver was the best guy ever (Miss you Bob)! The hours were great, the work load was great, and the pay was good for a seasonal job. I also got to meet new people and see new places as I had to driver far to get to my route. It was overall a great seasonal job that showed me the ins and outs of the package delivery process."
good,Work is fast I am continuously moving. I learned a lot about logistics and how UPS runs. Management pushes you and keeps you motivated. The hardest part of the job is the physical labor.
good,"A typical day with UPS was comprised of the operation of delivery trucks and the delivery of however many pieces of mail where assigned to your route. I learned the basics and some abstract theory of mail delivery. Management was great, they had high expectations and consistent performance is very important. Work place culture is relaxed and very high paced. The hardest part of the job is adaptation to weather variation. This job has a generous amount of customer appreciation which reinforces personal satisfaction."
good,Very informative and very intense job checking bags constantly for threats.there is about 80 hours of both online and in class training.you started with testing the machine and going over about 200 bags in a 4 hours day and everyweek you had to clean the machine
good,It was fast paced and had to drive to a certain point to meet driver at his first stop to start working for him.   Some times very late nights.  It was during the Christmas period when we walked up to a customers door they were happy that they got their packages.  The businesses we went to every day
good,"Loved working there. The staff and employers were awesome. The hours I worked, fit in my busy life with a toddler. I couldn't say anything negative about it. Thumbs up"
good,Job is not for the weak at heart if you cannot make it at other fast paced places this is not the place for you. The management will definitely help you become great but you have to seriously want it. I can honestly say because the job is so challenging the best part about the job is actually getting better because it becomes easy
good,I have enjoyed working at UPS the benefits are wonderful it is very fast paced and I would work for this company for several years and I would recommend this job to anyone that shows interest in the company
good,Eat before work. Good  sleep. Great attitude. I learned a lot and how to work and make NY own money. The pay is great even the hours. One day maybe I can be a driver and show them what they've showed me.
good,A fun place to work energetic the first driver that I had was awesome just a great place to work in general. I enjoyed working for this company if they offered another job I would definitely hop on it within a day.
good,"I loved working for ups,but I would've been to my 9 year but I never went back as much as I wanna go back to ups they won't let me back cuz of my pregnancy and not going back"
good,Ups iki sene çalıştım çok iyi bir şirket elinden geldiği kadar elemanlarina yardım ediyor
good,"seasonal  peak job "
good,"You will work, and work hard. Very physically rewarding and can turn into the best career move a person can make. I learned a lot about my ability to keep it moving and maintain a level head under stress."
good,I really like working for UPS! It's fun and exciting. Get people work there. I'd love to stay after the season. They take care of you and make sure you have what you need. They also really car about the customer.
good,UPS although was a seasonal job taught me a lot when it comes to packaging and the process it takes to make sure packages are given to its rightful owner in the correct manner.
good,Worked 10 hours a day with overtime after my first 5 hours. Definitely kept you busy. The environment when delivering was laid back. I worked with a driver who solely delivered to retail stores. Was fun to interact with the stores employees when delivering their stock.
good,"Great place to work"
good,A typical day at work is great. The benefits are good also and my co workers are nice. I would return working at UPS if they was to accept me back UPS is a great company.
good,"UPS has been a great place to help get me on my feet, I wish I would've gotten paid more but I was in control of my own check because you are given the opportunity to make overtime pay whenever you want"
good,this is a great seasonal job for a person looking to make extra cash for the holiday season. Flexible hours. fast paced. decent pay grade for helpers. the hardest part of the job is the amount of hours worked in one day
good,"This was the hardest job I've ever had. After 2 weeks of exerting myself, the job became easier and more rewarding. If you have the ""want to"" and drive, you can move up quickly into supervision. The best thing about this company is that they promote to better jobs and management from within which means everyone puts in the same hard work."
good,"show up sign in and do your route then i would ask if they need help anywhere then help as long as they needed me. to drive a semi  with doubles. management was really good, until after a strike and certain people went after strikers, to get even. There was nothing really hard you just had a good pace. I enjoyed it all"
good,Great company to work for just need to hire some better management team a lot of favoritism goes on there a lot of nick picking passing out bad loads to certain people
good,We are truely a family. Everyone cares about our customers and each other. I could actually say i enjoyed my job. My manager truely cared about employees.
good,Start time between 1300- 2300 and drive single or double trailers. Work time between 10-12 Hours per day. Supervisor excellent to work with at all locations Dispatchers excellent at all Locations. Co workers most very helpful. Wish could have a permanent position. This was seasonal.
good,Typical day at UPS is being on time. Working from start to finish. Very physical work. Must be fast paced unloading trucks and sorting. Four to six hours daily of hard work. Work load very heavy and time consuming. Must be physically fit to perform duties.
good,This job was similar to Roadway packaging.  However much harder and faster paced as it is a big company.  Did the save job sorting and loading on the pm shift.  Leadership was harsh and military style.  Hardest part of the job dealing with leadership and the heat. I did enjoy the work and fellow employees.
good,The job was fun and very fast pasted some say it was less fast past when they are full staffed they just but other then that I loved it. It was maybe the easiest job I've had so far
good,"Job was very fast paced, it was a great work out! The team I working with got the job done in a timely fashion and the supervisor was very hands on if ever there was an issue."
good,Learned a lot of the things learned to be face paced and worked under pressue when there was a high volume of packages during November and the Cristmas Holidays.
good,Very relaxed quick  pace of work. Employees are very nice and the customers. When working in the Winter you have to be warm yet comfortable to work. The job is cool if you don't mind moving and staying on your feet.
good,I started as a temp worker than quickly advanced to full time. The hub was going to be moved to the east coast. Thats the reason why I left UPS. Other than that I would have still been working there.
good,"There are a lot of opportunities within UPS. They usually promote from within, so if you work hard and express a desire for advancement, there are many options that can open up."
good,"I really liked working at UPS store, the manager and co workers were great to work with. They were always teaching me news way to do things. I learned the ways of packing and shipping items across the country. Even when I made a mistake the manager was still very pleasant with me."
good,UPS is a GREAT place for not only getting in shape but building CONTACTS and REFERENCES! I have made good friends with many amazing people who've been working at UPS for more than 30 years! I also love how they care about you like family. My family has worked with UPS for more than 40 years.
good,"Working at the UPS store was probably one of the best things ever. If you are a college student and need a job that's going to help you with your schedule the ups store is the best job. "
good,"A typical work day does not exist at ups. Everyday that you come in for the job, you will not know what to expect. Some days are smooth and some days are HARDCORE. Working here I learned that it is not all about muscles and strength. The strongest people here are the ones who are strong mentally. The management  is not too strict unless the have to be on a specific person. the hardest part of this job is having the determination to finish a word day. the best part is when the day is done and you can say you just accomplished a hard day of work and."
good,"it was a good job , their was always something to do while at work, i learned how to load and unload a truck really quick in about 15 min ,everyone being so friendly, getting the next shift work and getting no help"
good,"Working there is great for the benfits, just not for the hours they give you. The management is great and so are the people and the work is very fast paced and you will get hot and sweaty"
good,"Relaxed workplace. Little room for advancement. Good first job to have, especially in school. Flexible work hours, cool management. Good about letting employees take time off even though it is unpaid."
good,"I enjoyed this job because of the challenge i was faced with.  It  is very fast pace, As well as exuasting work.  This job is definetly is not for everyone.  Usually the start of the day is the most labor intensive.  The reason for this is the overnight loaders more cases then not load the truck incorrectly.  So when  we first get to the truck we have to organize the truck to one make it safe for us to walk by and two so that we can fly through our deliveries."
good,The job was extremely fast paced. Hard work with low pay and you only work 5 hours per day. There are no full time positions to start. The benefits were fantastic though.
good,It Was a Seasonal Position . I Had a Great Experience ! Also Loved The Job . Another Great Position and Experience Held At UPS . Very Willing To Work There Again
good,UPS is a parcel service that i enjoyed working at even if it was seasonal.The people were nice an i learned a lot.They would do things like feed us that's always good for moral.
good,This company pays very well but you have to work really long hours at it. I was in management and as hourly. But the pay is worth it. The only thing is work life balance is difficult to have children
good,"The UPS Stores are independently owned. I was lucky enough to work at 2 different locations. One in Florida and Texas. Both of the owners are amazing people, and my co workers became like family! It is a great part time job. The workload depends on the day. As long as your willing to learn and have a great work ethic, I would recommend finding a position at your local UPS Store!"
good,Good to have a union in place  some good people who have been there for years  everybody knows there place and position and organized  more men than women so youll have to stay focused if youre a women
good,It’s a very good place to work. It has great health benefits and if your in college they will also give you grant money to help pay your way through a semester or two.
good,"UPS is definitely a workout for sure, but it is a paid workout. The benefits do not come until a year from seniority date (about a year and 3 months depending on whether you are a seasonal hire or permanent hire) The benefits are the best I have ever seen, free everything. It is dangerous as I did have to leave because of injury. UPS has a great union and will be there for you whenever you need them. A typical day is very sweaty and a lot of work, the management can be tough and going into management is a terrible idea. Management doesn't really have a union and managers are easily replaceable. They don't have good benefits either. Most people just keep to themselves and it's usually no more than 4 hours a shift. I enjoyed the workout but a lot of people don't. Must be able to life at least 70 pounds by yourself."
good,I learned how to treat other peoples property with care and respect. I made sure their items got packed and shipped properly and correctly. There was always something to do and I learned a lot about myself working here.
good,It's always a different amount of boxes each day so that determine what time you get to go home. if your part time you don't get a brake your going for 5 hours straight.
good,I loved working here. My coworkers were very helpful to me and knowledgeable about the job. I felt that I could grow with this company and had plans to before I moved.
good,"While working for UPS I worked my way up from a part time loader in college, to a full-time driver in 3 years. I made UPS my home and I was dedicated to my career. I was so dedicated I quit college and devoted myself to my growth within the company. I learned to be a well rounded professional. As a driver, I was the eyes, ears, and face of my company. I was trained by the elites in their field. I built strong relationships with my customers. I learned to self-manage and make quick decisions based on the companies best interest. The position I held as a driver was a very physically demanding one, I hired a personal trainer to help myself get into the best shape possible to adequately perform my job. If I was going to work for one of the best, I had to be as fit as one of the best. "
good,It was very fun interacting with different business customers and making sure that they received their merchandise when they were supposed to overall great company it is a company that you can grow in and retire from
good,Work in IE for UPS provides one with a many opportunities to gain experience in almost every area of the company. They do a pretty good job of rotating people into different positions to give to expose them to those opportunities
good,"This job is nasty and dirty and extremely hard on the body. However. If you enjoy working out and getting sweaty... Perfect job. If you have a stressful living situation, this job is the perfect one for you."
good,Seasonal driver. Excellent training. Excellent driving program. Must be able to drive a manual truck. Long hours during the holiday season.  Kind supportive manager. Very friendly staff.
good,"A typical day at work for me is sort all the packages from about 3,000to 4,000 between eight different trucks while loading two myself. I handle heavy packages that weight 75lbs and up"
good,I had just moved to MN and I wanted a job where I could have that job work/life balance. UPS was a perfect fit for me because I could have that balance. I learned a lot from working there and made forever friends.
good,"Most franchise stores are a very small company, when I first started, after the person who trained me left for college, it was just me and the owner who worked there and I would work open to close ten hours a day and it was the perfect amount of work if there had been two people it would've been sort of slow paced but with just one person it was the fast pace work environment that I enjoy. Later I reccomended my friend to work there and we start splitting the days where I would work morning and he would work affernoons since he was in school. And this gave me more time in the afternoons to enjoy for a while until I got another job. Working at ups in the morning ms is the perfect way to wake up and get your day started I love it so much."
good,"It was cool,because I had a great and understanding manager. The hours were bright and early,but the job is very easy and quick. I left during the time I was in school,because of my scheduke."
good,"Wonderful fun work environment, I was the ramp supervisor at the airport for UPS air sunrise shift. The work was demanding and very labor intensive but was also exciting. I was able to really improve my management skill in this fast paced time sensitive work setting. Minutes count and efficiency is a must when dealing with airplanes arrivals and turnarounds. The people I worked with were driven by their want to succeed as a team through great leadership. The hardest part of my job was the hours, 2 A.M to 8 A.M. before my full-time daily school schedule was tough but rewarding at the same time."
good,"If you want a place to develope a career, UPS may be your place.  While the work is not always to most cutting edge, the work is challenging and you will definately see the value in your work in the final product."
good,"Was responsible for everything that the store needed in its typical day at work. In charge of inventory, sales and keeping the store clean at all times."
good,"Like the job and co workers and management."
good,The work day is planned out everyday and the daily jobs are repetitive. It is very difficult to move up in management because one must wait for an opening. Openings rarely opens up.
good,I worked as a helper . It was a temporary job so i didn't work a whole lot but i got paid fairly. For a young person with no car it's a great way to build experience
good,The day consisted of me del parcels to customers of whom I grew to know and like. I learned logistics and customer service. Management some good some not so good. The culture was great. Working in the heat at a high pace. My customers were the most enjoyable.
good,"I absolutely loved working for UPS but want to pursue a career I love in the medical field with my degree. atypical day I would come in Open the store greet customers, answer telephones, pack items and ship"
good,"different work schedule for but I made the adjustment quickly,4am-9am learn new skills, Management was ok ,work culture was fun, not hard , the people"
good,Provided training that improved the skills I already had. Provided direction in order to accomplish assigned task. Everyone that was met was helpful and shared a positive attitude.
good,"This was a easy , laid back job. Management was well organized and very friendly. Professional environment to work in. I would definitely recommend to a friend to work for this company."
good,"Overall good place to work, best thing the company follows its policies and procedure. It promotes from within so you get great chances to get promoted."
good,Nothing much to say. Very formal and not very flexible. Your manager can be very caring or very strict. Formal dress code and no facial hair. Work life is manageable depending on position.
good,"This job typically requires a lot of lifting and physical labor. While the work is strenuous, the pay is fair and the benefits are exceptional. The environment is a warehouse, and therefore can be a bit hectic. Overall, it is a good job, especially for students."
good,"I worked for around 2 months as a seasonal driver helper during the peak holiday season. It was fun and i enjoyed every minute of it. It is physical, fast paced work."
good,driver would pick me up at 12pm and would ride with him running packages to the door while he got the next stop ready. you have to be really fast running everything because there is a lot to deliver.
good,"productive and cool place to work"
good,it was a good job with good benefits they would not let me change my hours i worked the 4-9 am shift so it didnt work well with my school schudle. Everything else was good though good benfits
good,"Working for UPS  was a great experience especially for being a young teen having the chance to work in such a known company. "
good,"Day of work for me was basically just coming in around 11pm and working my butt off for 8 hours a night packing away boxes. It was a relatively straight forward job that taught you how to properly multitask between taking boxes off the belt and packing them away into one of your trucks.Management was pretty cool. job was pretty much just a good all round work style for me, didnt have to talk to anybody just put away your boxes and your good."
good,I wish I had never left! I thoroughly enjoyed my 10 years at UPS and I miss being a UPSer. They need to work on how to handle displaced employees better but other than that I loved it everyday.
good,Good people they take care if there employees and help you anyway they can they take safety very seriously and if you ever have any questions or need water they're always there to help you
good,I enjoyed everything about this job the workers were laid back the job itself was laid back. My manager rocked. The drive was my only issue with the job because it was in Nashville.
good,"My experience was essentially with one employee, the driver that I assisted.  He was encouraging, helpful, and hard-working and expected the same out of me.  I enjoyed the position as it was physically active and didn't become monotonous.  Unfortunately it was only a seasonally available position."
good,"first the drivers helpers would have to go through orientation, after that we'd get there uniforms and find routes for them to go out on. Hardest part the job was actually getting the helpers too meet the up with the drivers at certain locations."
good,UPS Is a great company to work for. There are numerous opportunities for advancement. The work environment is based on a team effort and productivity. They offer a awesome benefit package.
good,"I clocked into work at 11pm and worked until 5am. We worked in stations, collecting packages and distributing them to the correct places. I was asked to work two others areas aside from my own. There wasn't anything I disliked about the job and I felt that all of it was enjoyable."
good,"Great place to work for, lots of customer interaction. Physically challenging with some of the larger orders like refrigerators. Great compensation for an entry level job."
good,"UPS is a very stable, professional organization.  They are one of the few organizations that you can work for and actually retire from. Their management is very professional and well-trained.  They don't offer the best compensation, but they are stable"
good,"I love working with the public as I am a people oriented person.  This job can be everything you make of it.  Great management, high paced, fun.  I learn something new each day.  We Provide United Postal Service (UPS) and United States Postal Service as well as DHL packaging and handling."
good,Great place to work for a little money. Not very organized especially management. If your willing to work and keep to yourself then it's a great place to work.
good,"Great people, atmosphere and recognition. Great benefits and pay. Management is supportive and hard work is noticed. Days can be long but are rewarding."
good,"Honestly a fun job environment, the pay isn't  great, but it is a franchise. There are no benefits, this is more of a job for a high schooler, or a freshmen in college. Also to be clear I was at the UPS store not the franchise."
good,"Pros:"
good,In management you could be moved at anytime from department to department.  After 25 years I just wanted some type of permanency.  That is not what they want with their management people.
good,"I have worked at ups for 27 years  and nothing bad to say about the company , awesome company to work for but I must say you have to be a hard worker ."
good,"It is a good company,  just have to have a lot of energy & strength to get going. But overall, I like it I've stayed in shape a lot far as muscles since working there."
good,You'll have a good time at UPS if you have a good manager. Some of them treat you bad tho.  I was fortunate to have a really good supervisor that was friendly and good at his job
good,I love the people I work with. The benefits are excellent. Need to advance qualified people sooner. This is the only problem causing an issue with employee retention.
good,"Opportunity to complete print projects and pack all sorts of items. Always an interesting experience when people bring in odd object to ship to all over the world. It is difficult at first but once you get a hang of it, it  is extremely easy."
good,UPS is undoubtedly one of the best places that I've ever worked at. Its taught me so much about professionalism and also punctuality. Their management staff has a great deal of compassion. This company is very family oriented.
good,Working at UPS was the hardest thing I did but the most satisfying job cause you really have to put your all into it it's slot going on so keeping up with the program is a must
good,"Heavy lifting , you have to be Punctual , have a great  attitude   "
good,"A typical day was opening the store and organizing oneself for the days needs. "
good,"good job, started as a clerk and was able to move up to a supervisor, local ups terminal is small not alot of positions, only issue was part time work for all supervisors no full time. hourly basis so you make 27-30 hours on a weekly basis."
good,Very high tempo work environment. If you thrive on competition and self improvement you will thrive here. Management is  very professional.
good,UPS has great people and great integrity they have always put our development as a high priority and if available they offer overtime opportunities. I really enjoy working for them. I would recommend this job to people wanting a work out and who are reliable. UPS has attainable standards and will work hard for punctual and committed people.
good,Ups is a place I plan on working for until I retire in my work career. The job I do is easy fun fast paced. The job is never the same on a daily bases. Great teamwork is key to working in a place like ups.
good,"Is you dont know the system, training is recommended, Its alot of pressure for one person and a newly hired unless your a fast learner and learn the UPS system."
good,"Every day was a struggle with time management, knowing how long a drive could be or the trials and errors of learning priorities was the first lesson learned while working with this company. The amount and pay that was given was defiantly a drive to deliver your best every day. The only down side of being a seasonal driver was even a weeks after training, we had to wait to be used for a month and a half. I wished they would have used us immediately after training, so we seasonal drivers could increase the amount of time worked."
good,"I was working seasonal work and I thought the driver I was with was phenomenal and hard working. I really enjoyed working for UPS, they are a great company and was very intrigued to find out how a major company like them conduct their day to day operations."
good,"driving, delivering, planing routes, recovering parcels, packing new sent parcels, keeping clear the van and have a good and presentable attitude to the costumer"
good,"Seasonal work at UPS is a rewarding experience that makes you feel like one of Santa's elves.  The strict timeline of the job can lead to some headaches, but generally you leave at night feeling like you accomplished something"
good,Hard work and expressing the culture at UPS is thrilling. The work is easy and provides a healthy environment. Each day brought something new. Awesome
good,Really enjoyed the experience in a warehouse setting learning new skill. I could picture myself at a company like this long term
good,The launch of this new service back in 2014 has led to a nationwide expansion of the service and has created a better package delivery experience.  I have been part of the initial launch team and continue to contribute to the ongoing maintenance of active accounts and the continuous recruiting efforts to grow the network.  I have been afforded the opportunity to be a leader among my peers and have led by example on many fronts.  UPS has provided a solid platform to allow for contribution of new ideas that have led to best practices for the team as well as define a more effective workflow.  The only pitfall is working as a contractor and not being a full time UPS employee with the stability and other benefits granted to the full time UPS'ers.  Always opportunity to take on additional responsibilities.
good,"Loved having my own store. Worked with my wife. "
good,"Quality company to work for,you can advance and succeed if you put the work in."
good,"get the the warehouse meet with the driver head to our route and deliver parcels. "
good,Always worked with great people.  The environment was competitive and intense.  Depending on your level you were responsible for at least 150 elements that you would have to answer to daily.  You were required to track each of these elements and implement plans to improve the one that we not at goal.  Learned to deal with many different personalities and sometime had to discipline certain employees for corrective action.
good,"The workplace is fastpaced , hectic on occasion but well worth signing on. Work quickly safely expect no issues truly great workplace."
good,"I enjoyed working there a lot, I loved the fast pace and meeting different ppl that I would drop deliveries off at. My co-workers were very nice, helpful, and polite. Only thing I didn't like was not knowing when I would get off because I have children also wish the seasonal position lasted longer"
good,"Kind of like being in the service its not about the I, it's about the team, it's about the people next to you on the left and right side and being a part of something bigger then yourself to make it. A typical day at work was a fast paced just as they said weather heavy or light. I learned a lot about proper lifting and utilizing power zone and working smarter and faster, the co-workers were the glue that held the whole operation together with out a good set to work by the job would never get done, hardest part is pulling a little more then expected from time to time to get the task at hand done and serve our in house customers and out of house customers, I liked the environment and the team that I had the opportunity to work with, very fun and enthusiastic people and wouldn't hesitate to go back if I had the chance. Thanks UPS. Hooay!!"
good,It was the best jobs that I ever had! I just wish that I took better care of my back. When you are young you aren't thinking about when you get older how your back is going to feel!
good,"There was never a dull moment, I loved being able to solve situations and help the drivers and the customers.  The hours were long but never seemed to be because I was constantly busy."
good,"The corporation use to be a great place to work. Too many union leaders basically objected to every thing when it comes to working for and with any management teams. The employees who belonged to the union; hardly every came to work on time, lied to save their jobs, never showed up to work or called in; Shop union stewards could easily get their employees jobs back with no questions during the local hearings. Management staff had no control over the shop union stewards. Union employees dictated all the working conditions when their environment was very easy-going and fair with pay. Supervisors are friends with many union employees and could not hold their employees accountable."
good,I was going to school and working two jobs while working at UPS. They had tuition reimbursement which was a great incentive for me to go back to school/.
good,"Organize 4 trucks for shipping, pack each truck by each specific item UPC number as they come off the Belt, pack over 200-300 items each truck correctly in designated areas."

good,Good time management skills and learning how to use the technology used to keep records on the packages. The hours was good and my co-workers were very good to me and made me feel very comfortable
good,"It’s a fast paced environment that involved continual lifting, moving, shelving, lowering and sliding packages that weighed anywhere between 5-50 lbs."
good,A typical day at work was hectic and physically demanding. I must've lost 15lbs. that summer alone working there. This job isn't for a 9-5 office employee.
good,I enjoyed meeting new people and working together as a team. Everyone helped each other and met the deadlines that needed to be met.
good,the only thing I can say about this job is safety was number one on there list benefits were great ups really takes care of its workers
good,"Management was not trained and changed often, but the work was easy to pick up. Often packages being shipped were heavy and required help when loading or unloading items from delivery truck."
good,"Its a fun place to work, staff are lovely and we all work great as a team!"
good,"UPS was a very fun and efficient place to work. However, I worked on third shift and I was not getting in 40 hours every week. We were lucky to end the week with 32 hours as a full time employees."
good,I unload trucks which doesn't bother me but it pays well and short shifts which is very nice. but a hot place in the summer.
good,A lot of hard physical work. What I've learned is that hard work paid off. Management was good as long as you did what you were supposed to do.
good,"UPS was a very fun place to work at. Basically you get paid to excercise. Management is bad, they can be very over bearing at times and there is a ton of micro managing all the time.  The best part and most enjoyable part of the job was belonging to the Teamsters Union Local 79."
good,this job  was very repetitive but i did not mind because the compensation was worth it. it helped me stay focus because there was not really much else to worry about except the task at hand.
good,Good Job! great learning experience i have worked here for a while and it has been a great starter job. Would recomend to college students
good,"fun place to work , everyone Is very professional and friendly at the same time . I totally recommend to friends and family."
good,Ups is a good warehouse offers great benefits but raises are ok. Lunches are on schedule and Fridays catered food. Co-workers are great and easy to work with. Repetitive work but you have weekends off.
good,"Working at the ups store has been great, the hours work around your schedule , love all of our customers , my co workers are the best."
good,"My job was organize, it was really a persistent on going position."
good,heavy lifting work fast pace work also im a hazmat responder the company great place to work still work here been there 13 years the manager people there are very friendly
good,Only issue i had was in the first couple of weeks my pay wasn't paid in but the issue was soon resolved other than that it was a great company to work for
good,"Great company with great benefits, including school reimbursement and healthcare.  This job offers early morning hours, evening hours, as well as overnight hours."
good,Its not a bad job you just got to know how to focus and keep up. The brakes may be short but the more you do the quicker you finish its more of team work then anything very simple and you get star employee if you are the fastest.
good,I like and appreciate the job that driver helpers have to do. It can be hard work but for the most part its fun and simple to get the job done. Feels good when customers thank you for delivering their packages safely and on-time.
good,"The driver that I was paired with during this seasonal driver helper positions was very helpful and understanding that I was new to his routine and I was not very familiar with the area we were delivering in. The times the I did make mistakes in the beginning he did not become overly frustrated with me, but of course was disappointed. My driver took big risks with me when he let me deliver things independently while operating the DIAD soley by myself. This position forced me out of my comfort zone and had me interacting and communicating with many people right away. The most enjoyable part of this job for me was that the days flew by because of how fast paced it was. It was  obviously physically strained but Its nice to have a workout outside of the gym."
good,I helped load the trucks for the delivery drivers to take out on their route. I learned how the stacking system is in the trucks as well as for the distribution trucks. The management staff is a great staff and I enjoyed working with them as well as my co-workers. The hardest part of the job I would say is making sure that you get all of your packages in the right bay in such a fast time while watching the belt and getting your next package. I did enjoy the fast pace and also the fact that we started very early in the morning and got off at a decent time.
good,"Driving a tug is basically what I do, but there are other duties and responsibilities as well.  I get dirty and damage my clothes; I also come home with scars.  My co-workers are the best. The hardest part about the job is coping with the weather; I work outside on an air ramp (it gets cold).  The most enjoyable part of the job is that it is only three hours a day!"
good,"This job was very consistent and for myself seasonal, the employers were very much concerned with accuracy and even offered very helpful advice in making sure that packages were accurate. "
good,"i had to lifts boxes over 70 pound. you had work fast, or the boxes would fall on you. mostly, i was sorting boxes and putting them in right containers."
good,"A typical work day for me is keeping myself busy at all times,Learning as I get familiar with my job as well as my co-workers.Working as a manager I learned too cope as well as do my job to the best of my knowledge and give my all."
good,It is difficult to review The UPS Store since I owned the franchise. I enjoyed being my own boss and the ability to make decisions that I felt would be best for my customers. I learned how important great customer service is when patrons have a choice of where to do business.
good,A typical day working as a driver's helper at UPS was mainly physical in and out of a UPS truck. Working at UPS i had learn how to organize things in a way where they can be delivered in a timely manner. The hardest part of the job was working in all types of weather conditions. There were enjoyable moments as well like working as a team and seeing the smiles on each costumers's face when they received their packages.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the client interaction.Learned how to work with many people of different regions and expanded my area knowledge.Good team work co workers.The hardest part of the job was being exposed to extreme heat during the summer months in Florida for 10-12 hous a day.
good,Enjoyed working for UPS.  Day to day operations was closely monitored by 3 levels of management (Manager/Director/Regional Director).
good,"How how to work with a team.  Learned a quicker and more proficient way of unloading trucks."
good,"Working in the UPS warehouse, for part-time, is great for benefits, especially while going to school and/or working at another job. If looking to climb the ladder, it takes a few years to become a package car driver, only because its based on seniority. Working into management is a little easier. Pay is minimum wage at start, but benefits are worth it."
good,good for the benefits but the work is hard supervisers ask way too much benefits are good but cant support your self if you just start takes a wile to advance
good,"UPS goes above and beyond in delivering great customer service to clients.  Learned to be proactive and flexible while working with the public and my codrivers.  "
good,"Enjoyed working here, the managers were very nice and helpful.  The managers were very helpful and the benefits for only part time were really good."
good,very demanding and little room for work life balance. Excellent benefits and great incentives. room for advancement.
good,"I learned how to be a team Player. I also learned a lot about time management and efficiency. Ensuring that my trucks were organized, packed correctly and ready on time played a major part in my success with the company."
good,Its a great company to work for they just out source a lot of their positions to Temp agencies which doesn't secure you with the same benefits as UPS employee. what i have learned is that persistence and willingness in the work place is a great thing to have.
good,"it was  great work place to work ,really decent hours everyday sometimes weekend work only problem is trying to advance in the company people pick favorites"
good,Um óimo ambiente de trabalho e equipe.Me dediquei bastante ao cargo e funções que exerci;
good,My department works really hard.  We have a fast paced environment with really tight deadlines that switch directions on the fly.  Our team works great together and we always get the job done.
good,"unloading trucks"
good,"The pay starts out minimum wage but you get a .50 raise after 90 days as an employee. Then you're guaranteed the same raise once a year. The health benefits were amazing, the work is consistent, and it keeps you in really good shape."
good,"UPS-SCS is a good company to work for, I thoroughly enjoyed my time working there. "
good,Great service for the University students.  Past relations and experience with university staff went a long way with my time there.  Above average ownership.
good,"I loved working here, i learned how to handle any customer type/temper. My coworkers and management were great but hard to get hours. Hardest part of the job were the angry customers"
good,Great place to work. Need a better balance of work and personal life. It has great benefits and a great place to work. Allows you to relocate any good growth possibilities. Salaries are competive and well paid.
good,Unload truck to scanned packages and be delivered.You have to be fast and accurate.Management was ok. Co-workers was Nice.The hardest part was working in bad weather.The most enjoyable part was meeting people.
good,I loaded and unloaded airplanes for UPS. I also drove tugs to take different packages to their destination. The co-workers are nice and respectful but supervisors are sometimes unprofessional.
good,Load package cars at a rapid pace for daily deliveries. Part time average 4 hour shifts beginning at 4:30 am. The rapid pace makes the job more difficult.
good,"UPS is a company that everyone loves, until you actually start working for them at the bottom of the totem pole, which is either loading or unloading. Even though i rated Job security/advancement as excellent, i only meant that for job security because it is a union job. Advancement in this company takes years and uses a bid sheet that you put your name on and what job you may want and uses a seniority system. Getting a decent paying job in UPS takes years of pain from loading and mental stress from how loud it is inside the UPS hub. Aside from all the negative, i actually enjoyed loading not only because it kept me in shape but also because i made a lot of friends and memories at UPS. Let me just explain that when you enter UPS as a new hire, you will get bruises from the packages even if you are careful. Those bruises that i got created some of the best memories so far. That dirty warehouse really brings coworkers together and makes a strong team. So my review of UPS is that it is a great company to work for because it builds mental strength through the piles of packages that floods the truck you are in and it builds physical strength through the 50 pound printer paper boxes that staples gets all the time."
good,I have very productive days at work helping customers with whatever they need. My co-workers are very helpful and great to work with. There really is not a hard part about the job im a fast learner so ive learned almost everything there is to do at work.
good,a good company with a great manager where we picked up our loads and delivered on time mydriving skills were sharpened by the areas we had to deliver
good,Its a good job. The hours conflicts with my personal life. So  I would like to work a job like this one but with hours that will work for me.
good,"Deliver and pick up packages on time in a large area. Great communication skills were needed to succeed in the job. Meeting deadlines at times was challenging, but nothing I couldn't overcome. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers. I was able to build great relationships with my clients."
good,"A normal day is comprised of balancing the work needed to get documentation completed along with maintaining the customers needs. I've learned to be more patient with others  that demand my attention, which in turn has allowed others to be more open with their concerns to me. The focus of UPS is our customers, that philosophy has taught me to appreciate the willingness to help resolve concerns and issues in a respectful manner."
good,"I absolutely loved everything about UPS except the management. I don't know about every shipping center across the country but the one I worked at had managers hired off the street. A degree looks nice on the wall but in a physical job like that you can't have someone that has never done the work, try to organize the workers. Not all management was poor, a select few, but they resulted in making the job much harder than needed and helped contribute to many injuries and my eventual departure from the company."
good,"Hardworking stable company."
good,"Organized and maintained strict attendance record."
good,The UPS store made sure that my tenure there for the summer was the best it could be. In a typical day of work I learned various skills from operating the cashier to organizing packages of all shapes and sizes.
good,"A typical day was riding around in a big delivery truck and dropping off packages."
good,I learned how the seasonal workload leading up to Christmas can improve time management and organizational skills to ensure timely deliveries.
good,"a Typical day starting off at work, would be setting up your work section, talking with co-workers, having fun but hardworking along with it."
good,"during my work with ups i learned a few new software that were very interesting to work with"
good,"A long successful company with many great benefits.  however, the work life balance is not very good.  expected to work long hours."
good,The work day has many challenges from start to finish.  Dealing with various clients from shipping to shredding.  The staff here is incredible always going the extra mile to make sure every customer is taken care of.
good,Any department you work in will make sure you are working your hardest. If you plan on joining the UPS team make sure you have the mindset that your coming to work HARD. If you are looking for a laid back job go else where.
good,work was work it was different every day delivering packages talking to people weather was good and bad depend on certain days
good,Worked with a great group of people who consistently helped our center be ranked #1 in our district.  Great opportunity for advancement and to learn new skills.
good,working for this company is a hit and miss. You have 30 stops per day and it can be a good thing or bad thing. I love working physical jobs but when you have a helper that doesn't feel the same way it can be rough.
good,"I loved working there. I had a great boss, great co-workers and the location of the company was extremely convenient. I learned how to multitask effectively, work in a busy environment and learn a lot of key tools that will allow me to become a successful individual."
good,"Each day consisted of it's own tasks such as; Billing, shipping packages, mailbox renewals, claim status, It also starts with a small list of issues to handle such as; Damaged/late packages, shipping quotes and returning calls/emails.  The staff is always on top of their tasks.  The only trouble I found as manager was handily schedules.  The school schedules make it difficult but quite rewarding when everyone shows their appretiation for a well put together schedule."
good,This was the perfect job for a college student who was just looking for a little income to keep you going through college. Management was great. The job just didn't last long enough
good,"A nice place to work. Friendly management and working environment. The hardest part is definitely managing the 4+ things i have to take care of at all times on shift. The most enjoyable part of the job is socialization on breaks along with occasional snacks."
good,The company is effective in developing its employees with the necessary tools they need that will make them successful in any industry. The atmosphere is very diverse. This is important to and beneficial to all as people from various backgrounds come together as one to accomplish one common goal - to provide exceptional service to our customers. It is not  a walk in the park. The job is very demanding and requires careful planning and execution. The most rewarding part of the job is making the customers happy.
good,basic day was eight to nine hours. management was flexible.
good,"Everything was pretty chill, I didn't want to leave. I really wanted to stay and become a driver, but you have to know how to drive standard and be at least 21 years old. By the way, I only left this place because of a car accident that prevented me from getting there."
good,"Great seasonal employment opportunity. Friendly fast paced environment. The right kind of work atmosphere, anyone would be happy working here. The hardest part of this job was realizing it was seasonal I didn't want it to end. Typical Day I would meet the driver at a predetermined location then we would cover his usual route. Me being there lightened his work load and made deliveries and pick ups a lot easier."
good,"Fun and easy. Pays well. Must be in good physical condition. Office confusion sometimes made it difficult. Not guaranteed hours, some weeks 20+ hrs, some weeks only 10. Have to stay home or near area in case they need"

good,You can not put a price on the business knowledge and experience received at UPS in the management ranks.

good,I learned a lot from this company such as how to operate a laminating coping and fax machine. Managment is family.. its a family owned company which is amazing any problem and it was fixed asap. My coworkers were awesome i loved coming to work and seeing everyone very helpful! The most enjoyable part of this job was seeing our regular customers everyday!

good,"It's a good company to work with.  All I can say is the company is worth recommended to other applicants. I am proud to work for more than 10 years in this company.  The hardest part, well everybody should know working in courier company is tough job."
good,Day to Day operations at UPS are ever changing and the ability to adapt is crucial. The work load never ceases and all employees operate in a positive product manner. The supervisory role their helps to increase efficiency and safety as well as dispatching service providers with an even amount of work daily.

good,"A typical work day includes loading, sorting, and unloading packages. The management could be better nut I guess that's everyone view when you're on the outside looking in. The work environment  is some what ok the co-workers aren't the best."

good,"Meet different characters and personalities. Everyday is a learning experience with UPS.

Most enjoyable part of the job is the people I am surrounded with."
good,"A typical day at work would be all the employees showing up to work job is getting down without having to help them everything running smoothly. I've learned a lot from UPS especially how to talk and communicate with people."
good,You work yourself hard everyday and are always doing something. It isn't easy work but you have to try your hardest. Some people are a little lazy but you can get to know some pretty decent people and also have some good conversations. You load packages up to 70lbs into trucks that you set rollers up in. Sometimes you have to load bulk which can weight up to 160lbs but you can ask for assistance. This was the hardest part time job I've had so far but its fun and a good work out.
good,"package handling "
good,It was a  great learning experience and a to grow. There are many ways to hone and grow your skills to become a asset to the company.
good,"A typical day at work for me, was exciting, even though we did the same thing and had the same route everyday, it was fun."
good,It was fun while it lasted management could be a little harder on their management team because all the do is watch people load trucks and trailers and then yell faster that got old very quick and as far as co-worker's they are all good people well everyone was in the long run it would work a lot better if they were  more understanding for their worker's needs and the hardest point of the job was the end as of any job and the most enjoyable part was leaving going home.
good,"I was the manager of a warehouse that had several computer clients. I did all of the parts integrity for all clients, including cycle counts. I did all the receiving and shipping of parts, which every client had their own account and procedures."
good,It was a good job just needed more rest and I wasn't going to be able to work there and finish school
good,"I want to start talking about my co- workers coz they are really good people, they were like my second family. At work I've never had a difficult time maybe coz I'm good in approaching and make people understand in the easiest way. The management is perfect. And one of my enjoyable moments  is when we gather once a month or twice a month for a coffee ceremony and discuses all the problems, things that need to be done and changes at work like families do. I've learned so many thing but what I learn the most is, by doing our job in the perfect way we can do, it can really make us happy."
good,I love working for UPS it is the best seasonal job I have had and if offered a full time position i would take it
good,"This has been a very fun job, but is unfortunately the company is shutting down in my current area. I've learned so much about people in general, I can nearly determine what they will say upon entry. It has allowed me to become familiar with the public and their concerns. I must be very trustworthy because most days customers open up to me and tell me extremely personal stories of triumph and strife. The hardest part is dealing with unruly, upset customers. It is best to be calm and try to understand their position while figuring out the best way to solve their issue. What I find most enjoyable is the relationships that have formed between myself and regular visitors. At the store, I am not just a worker to them, I am a person they learn to trust with their most valuable and precious items."
good,"hardest part of the job is getting home late, typical workday starts around 9am and ends about 9pm."
good,"Tägliche neue Herrausforderung die externen und internen Kunden zufriedenzustellen. "
good,With UPS as a driver you have long hard working days that bring you a lot of satisfaction delivering the packages to all of your customers.

I learned how packages get from one place to the customers. Management is okay. Some supervisors are not people friendly. all in all they are okay to work for. My coworkers are great.

good,"I became insecure in my position when UPS purchased two companies.  I was the last person to be in the airfreight department that was of the company purchased of which I worked.  My hours were changed many times; more than anyone else in my department.  I was able to perform my job functions and those of everyone in my department and therefore, was performing my job duties at the same time of being back up to other personnel. The hardest part of my job was that the management in charge was from the other company that was purchased and showed blatant favoritism to the employees from that company.  "

If you put the time in and give it your best, it will get easier as you get stronger. The heat will not feel as hot, the parcel will not feel as heavy and the shift goes faster. There are lots of advancement opportunities for management or just other positions within the company as a driver, or sorter. This job teaches you to think ahead and plan for work. You can work smarter and make your work load seem easier. Co-workers are fun and add to the experience. Can make some long lasting friendships. Management can be a bad experience. No matter how hard you work, they expect harder. "
good,Work at UPS was hard work. Very fast paced and stressful environment but nothing i could not handle. 
good,"Really laid back atmosphere."
good,A typical day at UPS would start with setting up your work area since different shifts use the same work area. I learned to work as a team to accomplish goals and other tasks. Management works with employees to ensure safety and other responsibilities. I work with fun individuals in groups of 2. The hardest part of the job is during extreme hot days since the facility is NOT air conditioned. The best part of the job is when we get rewarded for accomplishing goals ahead of schedule by receiving food and prizes.
good,"I unload semi trailers. I do alot of heavy lifting team lifting if anything is over 70#, I love the people I work with a great group."
good,"Ups is a good company to work for, there is job stability and extra work hours if needed and a flexible work schedule. You will learn the brokerage process, clearance dealing with FDA, F/W, how shipments are cleared through customs. I have learned even more so how to provide great customer service, patience, and how to organize my time  wisely. The best part of the job is the people, the relationships that you build over the years."
good,"ups is a great company to work for, great benefits and good pay. would be better if they had more full time openings. "
good,"UPS was an amazing job in the beginning but it is very fast paced and you must keep up to stay on. It is truly one of those jobs where you have to make decisions for yourself based on the current task or time of day. The unsatisfying thing about this job is the co-workers. When it comes to working with others there is a ""watch-your-back"" policy because everyone is not on the same accord. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that you are one person that is apart of a very large system of networking and logistics."
good,"Everything was great, I had a great experience working there, everyone there was kind, I was treated equally, and I learned a lot working there, if it was not for schol id still be there. Working at UPS you have to work Monday - Friday at a specific time, and I was not able to juggle UPS and school at the same time and we all know school comes first."
good,I enjoyed the fast pace environment. There were hardly any down times to it.
good,"A typical day working for UPS via delivering packages from house to house was rather tiresome and hard, but was quite rewarding in the end. It had great pay, a very efficient planning system , and management was good too. My co-worker was this wonderful guy, who was by far the nicest most courteous person I've ever had the pleasure of working with. The most tedious part of the job was either having surprise pick-ups, or having to run packages up and down multiple flights of stairs at apartment complex's."
good,Never a dull day in the packing and shipping industry.
good,"Straight to business from start to finish. At UPS I learned to deal with a super strict schedule and to manage lessor motivated employees while doing so. The hardest part of this position was keeping the job staffed. I enjoyed this position because the work kept everyone busy until time to leave, and the benefits were free."
good,Good place to work great co workers good trucks
good,- Absolutely all labor
good,"Great place to work. The pay is outstanding, you meet a lot of people . You're very well respected."
good,A day At UPS can start off well and get very busy due to the over load of packages and delivering them to various locations. I learned how to have patients. Co-workers were ok wasnt to much interactions with them because everyone did their own thing. Driving in the snow.
good,Working at UPS is great if you are a college student. They have wonderful tution assistance programs.
good,I really enjoyed my job at UPS. It is a fun place to work and being such a fast paced environment you feel really rewarded at the end of the day!
good,"My days at work were very busy, always running around, always a lot of work. I've learned how to work fast, how to communicate with others, to be patient, and be more responsible. I had a very friendly co-workers from different countries and cultures, which I really liked. The hardest part of the job was, when your supervisors don't really care about you and make you do work more than you can. For ex, sometimes they would give me a bunch of work to do by myself, like I was a robot, or something .... but thank God, I could handle everything perfectly! The most enjoyable part of the job was, when people do appreciate your work and tells you THANK YOU!"
good,"I was a driver helper and UPS advances from within the company. work there once and you have the chance of being rehired (if only worked a seasonal position) for other job opportunities. A typical day at work for me as a driver helper was fun for me running up and down stairs, ridding in elevators, running up and down driveways and seeing the smile on someone's face when they you you have a packaged just for them. You have to be quick to learn how to use the dipad used for scanning each package. I learned how to work the dipad in 2 days. i learned interesting things like if a dog tries to attack you that they can be knocked out with the dipad but that is only if you have no other option and running is out of the question. i learned how to be quick on my feet delivering packages . My co-worker driver made the time pass by with a fun work atmosphere. The hardest part of the job was learning how to work the dipad and being let go because the season was finished. and the most enjoyable part of my job was making some one smile and watching the faces of the elderly light up when they opened the door and you offered to bring the package in for them because not all of them could pick up and carry a package weighting 75 pounds and knowing that bending over is hard for them as well."
good,I was taught by some very experienced works the daily operations and was taught in a way that I feel any one would understand..Good opportunity for growth
good,"UPS, is a very cautious based job. You are tending to people and their products as well as ensuring they leave the store satisfied. Things i have learned from this previous job would be that i have learned the proper steps to taking care of peoples belongings, finalizing sales, and checking inventory. The hardest part of the job would be to ensure that the packing suggested to the customer is the proper one for shipment."
good,"conveyor belt loading, quick pace, learn quickly, physical work"
good,i love to work..esoecially when it is fun work and at times when its not i try to find a way to make it that way..i have many goals set up for my life and i feel every job that i recieve shows at least 1 things or value i can add to my life
good,fast paced environment
good,Constantly lifting heavy boxes from containers and trucks. Warehouse duties was something i enjoy doing.
good,"Every day at work their is some thing different, i learnt loads of new skills e.g flt,driving, strength. the management at UPS are the best i couldn't ask for better.All of my co-workers are all nice to work with.the hardest part of my job was to clear 150 rooms for BBC at the end of the Olympics, i most enjoyed meeting new people and doing something different every day ."
good,I'm pretty much a hands on person
good,"An extemely fast paced environemnt. Tasks with deadlines, time management, training and delegation. Working a UPS, I have learned how to address conflicts with solutions. I work in a very diverse operation, therefore I was taught to get to know your people first and gain their respect. We had several direct Supervisors/Managers to report to, we were never allowed to give excuses, we needed to demonstrate results. Learned to take fault in any and all things that were not met for example, training, tasks and safety renewals as well as discipline. UPS is union, so I also had to learn to talk to and handle any and all situations that arose for any employee. My co-workers, well most were only there for the paycheck, not interested in changing or making things more productive and efficient. The hardest part of my job was the most successful thing, being a woman in an industry where you supervise men and women older and younger, I have grown as a leader and I always lead by example. The most enjoyable part of my job were the relationships that I was able to develop."
good,Very structured company that taught me more about logistics than college ever did
good,"This is a great company to work for ,if you are willing to put in the time ."
good,it is a very great experience and i meet alot of new people and very great benefits
good,I worked for UPS for 3 winter seasons as a driver helper. My responsibilities were to deliver packages along with the regular route driver. At times I would be dropped off with a load of packages at the mall to complete the deliveries on my own. After the 3 seasons i worked for them i was offered a job as a regular full time driver but i had to turn t down so that I could finish school.
good,Your eyes have to be bigger than your stomach lol great potential for loyal an ambitious people
good,4-5 hours part-time

good,"I had a great time learning about windows and screens and how to assemble and load them on to carts ,pallets ,semis etc."
good,the hardest part of the job is loading the semi trucks at a certain paste...
good,"The job is simple, make sure the package goes where the truck is going, the stack it into walls of boxes. Now do that for 500 packages in an hour. repeat for 5 hours. It is a great workout and it will keep your mind sharp. Always remember the safety rules and you can do this job. The major down side of this job is that you will always have a bosses change .They either get fired( most of the time) or they get promoted."
good,"drove forklift,loading and unloading trucks,and also a supervisor...."
good,Come in manage your area the best way you can and then leave. Alot of communication and motivation.
good,A typical work day would be unload the truck.
good,Love my position; am knowledgeable of all operations. Have advanced in the company but not into full time as needed.
good,I wanted to go into full time management with UPS but did not have a degree at the time. I am currently in school studying to become a Paralegal.
good,UPS hub is a great employer for young individuals who are only seeking part time work. If you are trying to advance it takes a lot of time and patients to get there. So if you are needing a full time income it is a bit difficult. They give you amazing benefits though!
good,"The UPS Store was a fun and learning experience for me, there I learned a lot about faxing, making copies, laminating, binding making orders for business cards, Packaging and processing packages, and I learned that Customer Service was high priority!"
good,"I had a great time working for UPS. They are great at developing employees and providing on the job training, as well as providing opportunites for advancement"

good,The package handler position is a fast paced job that includes alot of detail.
good,To this day one of my favorite jobs. Great pay and job culture was the best. Always a planned event for employees. I did not feel I had room for advancement but I did enjoy staying busy and over all atmosphere was not stressful.
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, con sus excepciones de personal que te hacen pesada la estancia y tu trabajo, mucha envidia, y hay jefes que de verdad son muy humanos y otros que son totalmente lo opuesto, lo que si es que hay que tener mucha integridad para poder ser contratado con planta por parte de la empresa ya que se toman muy en serio el tema de las perdidas."
good,Nice job for seasonal plus a chance to stay on. Nice supervisor. Others help you when needed for 1st time starters. Ask if want to stay for second part of the job and Saturdays but not required.
good,"I loved ups. They were friendly, taught me everything I needed to know and didn’t get mad if I needed extra help. I liked working alone for the most part and that’s what I did loaded."
good,it was a good overall experience. The job wasn't hard at all it was just a lot of manual work. the work was tiring somedays but I enjoyed the physical work because it kept me active.
good,"Seasonal position with very little management overview, good pay and schedule. Helps to have a truck or suv too haul packages. Must be able to work with little or no supervision."

good,"Overall it was great place to work at, just the hours may be bad in all, but just a great place to work at everyone is great , it can sometimes be overwhelming but its fun."
good,It's a good place to work hard getting home as ups want to keep you out 6 days overall good place to work nice vehicles good pay management are good office staff have the experience in the work that you are given
good,"Good benefits not enough time with family , it's a good company, lots of attention required,  lots of stress is put on you from the beginning and one seems to get overwhelmed as well with all the packages to be delivered in places you are unaware of...."
good,Heb leuke tijd gehad met collega en veel geleerd en was leuke sfeer

good,It’s a great job . I just wish we had better trainers with motivation and inspiration . Other than that it’s a great job and I wish nothing but the best for people that choose to work at UPS over time.
good,"Training is provided, be prepared to be drill on safety and driving methods. The management team is very supportive and communicate well with the employee's. Would do this fulltime if given the chance too."
good,Didn't like the short contracts. Everyone seemed to really like me but the size of the company could not accommodate that fact!!!! Didn't like that!!!!
good,"I loved it there."
good,You have to be focus on the task when working with UPS. You will be working in a fast pace work environment and there is no room for errors. The supervisors and managers promote team work.
good,"Easy advancement for being a supervisor or Manager . You have to work your way up the ladder. Start from the ground up"
good,"Good seasonal work experience. worked with a great driver. good team work. keep an eye on your hours worked, sometimes its missed on your check, but fixed on next check."
good,I love my job it’s a great job to have we make sure our customers are getting there packages on time and in great shape. Every morning we Exercise and then we get started on our task.
good,Driver helper position I was always on my feet and I had to histle there it was fine though had decent checks and it gave me money in my pocket and I had a job

good,"Good people to work with, good pay. Flexible work hours and work with people that care. When you need help they find you help to get the job done faster."
good,"When starting - staff was helpful in getting me in the right direction. Management was rushed in the morning and we had technical issues. But, after working through - the job itself is rewarding and nice to be in control."
good,I was seasonal worker when volume was really high. Would love opportunity to work there full time.  Good company. I got hurt delivering packages and received payment for time I was scheduled to work anyway.
good,Good work environment. Pay good with great benefits and room to move up in company. Enjoyed working for ups. All in all a great company especially for young adults
good,I was a driver helper and loved it. I would meet the driver and then we would deliver packages all over the beach til around 7 each night.Customers are very friendly and like seeing you.
good,"Good"
good,I enjoyed my managers and my coworkers but I have had occassional issues with other employees and lack of support of some franchise owners. However all employees are decent people and will attempt to help you if they can although their work ethic might be lacking.
good,"I had fun delivering packages, seeing the smiling faces when we would bring people the stuff they been waiting for. However having to run to the doors was a pain at times, i love running but having asthma doesn't help."
good,I would love to go back. Working here it keeps you busy. You will never not have any thing to do. When they say you get paid to lose weight it's the honest truth and I'd love the opportunity to go back. I do feel that giving certain reasons they should allow people a chance to come back with the proper documentation.
good,"I like the people ,management is often rotated a lot, more training would be needed for all when things are changed in progress of operations things should be consistent"
good,"Always moving from one work place to another. Very up beat and no slack on the work flow. Fun people to work with, and always stay busy. Hours vary depend on the flow of packages that come through."
good,I have really enjoyed my time with The UPS Store. The owner of the location I worked at was an amazing person. Compensation is reasonable. I have a need to work outdoors and perhaps have a bit more room for growth.
good,A typical day involved brilliant work environment. The best part of working in UPS is that it has a mixed work force bringing a lot of harmony and togetherness amongst teams.
good,They are a great group of people to work with and are very helpful. I would recommend people to work here but if you don’t like sweating on the job then I can tell you this is not the job for you because you are at work but you are also working out.
good,The job is very fast pace very labor oriented if you want to lose weight the perfect job for you is always heavy lifting and stocking unless just doing the small sorting which are the smaller packages but like I said everything is time efficiency that is key
good,Great company to work for. Friendly environment great benefits. The required tasks that need to be completed are reasonable and achievable I would recommend working there.
good,It's a good company to work for has very good benefits overtime very fast moving company friendly co-workers Union work very good salary very tight working environment
good,I worked for United Parcel Service for 32 years 18 as a drive and 14 in management and I would recommend ups as a place where you can learn valuable skills for advancement into management. My typical day started with gathering the results for previous days activities as well as gathering information of least best service providers in my group while establishing a plan to achieve performance goals. the hardest part of the job was the resistance from the Service Provider to change old habits. the most rewarding part was when the service provider realized the change helped better the service providers performance even with a slight increase in the work load.
good,"I enjoyed working for UPS. The hours during peak season are a little rough, but great for making extra cash. The job security is good and there is plenty of room to grow."
good,"UPS is a great place to work, I just recommend no call centers because the environment of a call center is rough. However, the people at the call center are very nice I miss some of them."
good,"▪	Developed, managed, and maintained a high performing team: hired, supported, led and managed the team, individually and collectively; provided training and guidance to team to develop market expertise in negotiating optimal profit margins."
good,UPS was a temporary position to assist with the high volume of packages that arrive during the holidays. the work was tedious and strenuous. I worked long hours standing and reaching.
good,I enjoyed working at ups but couldn’t handle only getting part time and the wait list for full time is ridiculous!! But If u can live off part time for a couple years to make full time it is well worth it.. driver position is the best place if u have a clean driving record they make dam good money
good,"If you want competitive pay then this is the job for you. I didn't work very long there but i got my job at a bad time. I would recommend anyone willing to lift heavy objects and be fast, to this job."
good,"Good work, good pay.  UPS uses Teamster Union to ensure good culture and workplace experience.  In the weeks before Christmas, you can expect to work late (bring a flashlight that can shine on house numbers from your trucking"
good,"I began a frontline supervisor at UPS Distribution Ctr. in Raleigh, NC. At the time I was a student in the Business Administration Program in Global Logistics at Wake Tech Community College and gained the attention of the school work-study advocate who sent me a job offer at UPS to earn credits involved with my Principles of Management course I was currently enrolled in. i received three weeks of training, classroom and actual work environment, and started off in charge of the most productive section of distributing goods to addressed locations in the southeast U.S. region with accuracy. I was in charge of at least ten employees daily and often sometimes up to 15 to assist with the demand to load and fill trucks, label and seal, and coordinate trailers to continue productivity and organization within my department."
good,"A typical day at work was fast paced and sometimes brutal, because we were lifting up to 70-80 lbs for four hours with water and bathroom breaks. Management was good, workplace culture was good also. The hardest part of the job was because we do alot of heavy lifting our bodies would be sore like a mother. the most enjoyable  part of the job was looking forward to getting off work and going home to sleep and starting over the next day."
good,"UPS is not a bad company, they actually have great benefits all around the board. A very good work environment depending on how you go about yourselves."
good,"UPS overall is a great company to work for. It's dependable, reliable and the pay and benefits are better than most places. It's a physically demanding job. Heavy lifting, fast paced, extreme cold and hot temperatures make the job hard as well."
good,i would recommend this jobs to others because its a benitficial job for anyone.the experence you learn you can take anywhere and learning how to perform things thats new to you is the fun part about the job.
good,"I loved working at ups and i learned on the job about a lot of things. One being, learning how to stay calm in a stressful day paced environment. Another being how to use a scanner."
good,I Enjoyed My Time There And It Was A Good Experience. It Was Hard To Do The Work At First But I Adapted And It Was Not As Difficult As When I First Stared.
good,"Real cool people to work there with, really easy, awsome work benedits and when your done with work the people there are very neat so not much is needed to do"
good,"A typical day at UPS would consist of 12-13 hours. The culture is that of a professional team, the goal is to win. The people you will work with are few and far between in the world, great partners and all hard working. The only down side to this seems to be that our corporate leadership has slowly moved too far away from the ideals that made this company what it was."
good,Loved working there and was an outstanding employee but upon one trying circumstance I was given a non rehire status. Pretty lame seemings I was a dedicated employee with four years of loyalty.
good,It’s was cool everybody would meet up in the morning we had time to get breakfast be on the road was cool . Some of the packages are heavy but after we get the heavy packages off everything runs smooth.
good,Making the customers  feel Good while delivering .The most enjoyable thing was getting to work every day on-time . Also it was a good feeling good to work for ups company
good,The career advancement possibilities here are amazing. I can see why they keep people for so long. The pay is great for full-time employees. Especially for the drivers.
good,Just maintain calm and you will excel in the company. You will meet a lot of different people and make a lot of friends. The pay is pretty good for what you have to do.
good,"the workplace was great learned alot "
good,"Typical day was stressful because of changes in management and outsourcing of some job"
good,"As an unloader at ups the job was fast paced, and the supervisors did what they could to make the day fun, and go by faster, I never had any issues with any other employees, or a supervisor."
good,It was busy season. It was busy thete was alot overtime. We didnt have enough workers. It is union base company. Managers try with little people.i work them again.
good,I enjoyed a couple of my College years working part time overnights.  Also Local Union 120 is one of the best unions around to be a part of.  Also they have an amazing safety program.
good,"I just started my job at UPS and love the physical work, but the hours are not conducive to my life. The work environment is very friendly and positive."
good,in the summer time it is really hot and stressful when you have to deliver so many packages in a timely matter. trying not to drop the packages or break your back.
good,I had A Great experience at UPS But I'm Upset because u Guys will not Rehire Me Because Of felonies I've already Had While I was Working with you guys for almost 2 years
good,Easy job for a driver helper. received a nice bonus for working at minimum of 5 days a week which made the job worth it. I worked with great drivers that made the job easy and fun.
good,UPS is a great place to get extra hours during the winter slow season for other jobs. The culture is great and and it was never a hassle to go to work even though the hours were long due to the holidays.
good,You could make a decent career for yourself.  If you're family focused then you'll run into problems.  You get what you put in.  Everyday has different challenges and obstacles so its not a mundane job.
good,I’m a hard worker and willing till get things done . Willing to work soon as possible if need be. I feel like I’m more experienced in the working files just for working at ups for 2 years .
good,"A typical day at ups it is boiling hot and tiring but it is worth it, I've also learned that being on time is very important. Ups management is good because they also make sure your in a safe position when working. The hardest part of the job is getting up moving boxes in a timely manner. I enjoy the people working at ups."
good,"there are two choice of work stations. you can work outside on the ramp loading and unloading aircraft, or you can work inside the hub. if you work inside the hub, you are picking packages off of a conveyor belt and sorting them to load onto trucks or planes. "
good,"Safety Management, Information and Security Compliance, Labor Relations, Management Job"
good,"Loved working here too bad it was only seasonal, made new friends, had the same route each day that made delivery even easier. Hardest part of the day was when I got done too early and had to pick up more shift time helping others that seemed to ,milk the clock."
good,The pay and schedule is beneficial enough to not complain about shift start time. Peak season can be hectic but not something I would refuse to repeat.
good,It was a nice environment. I worked hard and needed more trading for this job. I would definitely try to find a place to be able to work efficient and be able to get the routine down.
good,They aren't the easiest people to work for they are very hard on you and stress you out a lot. consistent pressure from them on a day to day bases. if you can take all that stress they its the job for you.
good,Was employed with company for almost 20 years. advanced within. worked different shifts. Great benefits and would recommend others to work for company.
good,I was a seasonal assistant for the driver. Being in a truck all day fast paced working it really gets you working together. For me at least. I was pretty cool with my driver.
good,Ups is a great place to work they have great benefits and a great team there. There always willing to help you out if needed. A typical day at work consist of fast paced loading of 3 to 4 trucks at a time. You have to be very quick at getting the package of the belt and into the correct truck before your next package comes.
good,"I enjoyed working at UPS in Hagerstown & Frederick locations. I worked early a.m., loading trucks which HAVE to leave at a certain time in a.m. You are trained how to load trucks, what items are needed to be placed on floor (hazardous, liquid, etc.) & special items placed where driver will be able to grab. easily."
good,Unloading packages with my earbuds on. Very fast paced and demanding but excellent benefits and usually work only 4 hr a day except during Christmas you will work from 12am-9am.
good,So after i did my job. i did everyone else's job .then there was nothing to do in outbound and i cant not be doing something at work so i insisted that i should go work in the unload to speed up the process they denied it to me and told me if i didnt want to work where they wanted me to i could just quit ..... So i did i walked away . Half way out the door i ran into head honch and he told me to stay and put me in unload i worked for another hour and then they decided to let me go to
good,"Offers tuition reimbursement at most facilities and decent benefits! Is a great company to work for. Although, the contacts are changing rapidly which is good in some cases (pay and benefits), and bad in others (retirement age and pensions)."
good,"I wouk say it's a very place to work, I recommend this company to work its a company for a long-term job anf once you get a route and make a good work, you'll fell ok."
good,"I worked for UPS years ago before they had computers the track everything. The work pace is always tight fast lean and mean. Hand to surface, for all that touch a package. I started as a helper, moved into being a loader, then driver. Package cars of all "
good,"It was a great place to work, great atmosphere. Pay was good, company advancement was good as were the benefits. I only left because my daughter became very ill and she lives elsewhere"
good,Great company to work for. This one only lacks two things. 1. Communication in training. (Policy’s) so you can better help customers. 2. Friendly customer service.

good,"UPS is an excellent place to work based on pay and benefits and 401k and retirement"
good,"Ups is a job to love and strive at, or hate. Great morning job on preload, with a good mix of coworkers.theres opportunity if you want to work hard, and the rest of the day is free."
good,"the work environment is as expected- busy,high stress, but not intolerable. the training is thorough as long as you take full advantage of your trainer- asking as many questions as you can so that you know that you will perform at your best. Advancement is available to anyone who seeks it and works hard to achieve what is expected of them."
good,Offers part time to start and it’s really hard to get full time unless u have a degree. I have been trying to b on the full time staff for awhile. I love what I do and hope to stay there. I really hope to b either a full time sup or driver.
good,"Enjoyed my time there, good management and cool coworkers. Have the chance to become a Notary Public which looks good on Resumes. Good part-time work for college students or high school students."
good,"I really enjoyed working there wonderful environment and pleasant clients overall it was a wonderful and productive place, I was able to offer my knowledge and skills to the fullest of my ability"
good,"For the past year, I have worked at UPS. I have met a lot of great people along the way but the one thing is Management needs a set of guidelines or structure."
good,I really loved working at ups the people and just the atmosphere around you was so great and fun. Although it is a tough job it’s a great workout and you will definitely be sweating and moving at a fast pace. I also loved how we could wear whatever we wanted
good,"Depending on the UPS Store, most days are typically very busy which I enjoy. There are lots of different packaging options available and most are utilized as well as notary services and printing services. A typical day for me would involve jumping from one project to another as efficiently as possible while maintaining a positive welcoming environment that customers feel happy and comfortable waiting for their turn to be serviced. Seeing everyone happy with my service was the most enjoyable part of all. The most challenging part of the job would have to be learning about all the different printers and how to use them. The UPS Store prints a wide variety of things from blueprints to canvases which we wrap ourselves in the store. I learned so much in the many years I have worked for different UPS stores and enjoy each and every one of them!"
good,"ups is a good company to work for!"
good,"UPS was a Fast Paced, at times stressful position when it came to loading and unloading the 18 wheelers but I would be lying if I said that I didn't Like the Job just at that time in my life I needed something Full Time."
good,"Working at UPS is perfect if you just need it as a side job to earn the free healthcare. Normally, you aren't going to get a lot of hours per sort so I wouldn't recommend it if you are looking for full time money. However, employees qualify for amazing free benefits after nine months of employment. Plus, working over five hours a sort is considered time and a half which is awesome. Overall, as long as you come to work willing to do a physical job then this is a great position. Yes, you are working in a non-climate controlled environment so it gets hot or cold and yes you do have a physical job but that's what you get with a warehouse job. You get stronger overtime and basically just get paid to workout."
good,assisting with deliveries was a plus and coworkers were great to work with. management was very good to work with. sometimes the days were longer than others due to amount of deliveries but it compensated for the days of no work.
good,"a tipycal day at work it's relax "
good,"Very face paced but laid back work, employer's provide seasonal premium catering and seasonal work also pays $25.00 hr. After 12 hours. Plenty of friendly Sr. Employee's more than willing to help you understand what ever new task or station you would like to work over-time. Career opportunities and 401k available"
good,"While working at UPS i was able to achieve skills such as being quick and methodical, participate as a team-player, be hyperconscious of surroundings. There is lots of room for advancement."
good,"A typical day can be stressful. The most enjoyable part of this job was making customers happy. Alos, getting positive feedback from my manager and team leaders."
good,"Early days, filled with cold, dirty climate"
good,I loaded and unloaded trucks for ups for 3 years! I love the job I just had to relocate wish I have it back! The managers there or so nice! I miss working at ups!
good,"UPS can be hard for some people But if you stick it out it will be worth it ,  benefits are after nine months so at least reach that goal 7days of working is 2x pay , 6days of work is all overtime that 6th day."
good,"Great Job, worked as operation assistant."
good,Would love to work full time but they wouldn't offer it. I even signed up for it but I couldn't get in. Loved working at a airport and working as a package handler.
good,I worked during holidays for a little extra money and it worked out great. Good hours and very fast paced made the days go by quick. They always offered overtime and that was a big plus!
good,Good seasonal work for a college student. The only downside is in the Fall semesters during Christmas makes it hard to also work and provide adequate time for Finals!
good,I rate this company a strong because this company has so many pros and very little cons as far as i can tell. I have been here for roughly 8 months and they have given me room to grow under proper training. The structure of training supervisors should probably be cleaner.
good,"packages arrive down conveyor belt, pick and pull correct packages to load into corresponding trucks loading anywhere from light to heavy freight into UPS trucks for delivery."
good,"Working for UPS as a shifter was GREAT! I got to drive😄 . I began my shift with a safety check of of my vehicle. Making sure that all safety guidelines were met for the vehicles to be driven. Log into the net work and control room. This UPS location had 101 baydoors plus short trailers parked inside the HUB. I would get a trailer number and location for pick-up. I had to contact airlines and break lines form shifter to trailers. Inform control room the trail number and location I'm picking up. On small computer that I pick up and the trail is no longer at that location. I receive the location for trailer. Pull trail8to that location or baydoors. Back up to the HUB and drop trail.  On Computer' log in trailer number and new location. Wait for next pick-up location,"
good,"A typical day is intense and immersive. From the get go one is wired into the system and reviewing performance data and client based issues from the day before and planning the day ahead. Its from this that one learns the value of time management when the margins are so small."
good,"Hardworking and up pace environment, Competitive and is a great consistent job that has plenty of opportunities to work overtime. Perfect job for college kids"
good,"UPS is a tremendous place to learn and grow both professionally and personally. The company has a culture that supports longevity and performance. "
good,Would have loved to continue to work at UPS. Unfortunately it was seasonal and I was dismissed after holiday season. Great training program and benefits.
good,i typical day at ups is to show up on time get to get to stretch then get where you will normal be at. the management will tell you whats next to you will know ahead of time.The hardest part is keep moving because   someone that is next to you might not show up to work that day  so you would have to do their work until someone else fills their spot..With that being said the most enjoyable part is when you connect with works and  and management because everyone their  wants to see you succeed.
good,"It's a fun and challenging job I loved working there, but be prepared to be sore the first two weeks. You have to be a quick learner there's no room for slackers. Figure out what your job for the day is ,how to do it and get to it. If you don't currently go to a gym then brace yourself because it feels like your working out all day. Everyone there is very friendly and helpful all my co-workers were awesome and they all knew my name without ever meeting them .great place to work and I recommend it to anyone who is up for a challenge."
good,"None there’s nothing really to explain about Work. The Company is really good. Some people like to work , but others dont. We have to make sure we read labels correctly and all."
good,Typical factory loading job. Large emphasis on safety and physical well-being on and off the job. Supportive management. Easy career progression and promotion.
good,"I enjoy working at UPS. Having started as a seasonal employee and being retained and given a regular position,was really exciting and encouraging. It is a job I can see myself doing for at least another 6-8 years."
good,"Well, it was a seasonal job during the peak season. If you worked hard and you were needed then you'd have the opportunity of being offered a permanent position. I was satisfied with the work environment, you get your work done fast and efficiently and there aren't any issues. Was offered a permanent position after the seasonal period, but declined since I had been planning on moving."
good,Es una empresa en donde el esfuerzo de uno mismo se hace notar
good,"Love the experience and learning new positions and learning how to load and unload ,sort , scanning and processing different packages . understanding the different size packages and lables and putting them or there right convertor belt"
good,"good work environment."
good,"Very knowledgeable, producpigs. Lifted & loaded & unloaded 20-30 pkgs.daily, properly and accurately to various companies,buildings, etc. Offered another job and I accepted it."
good,Very fast paced pay is great . I drove to Peoria airport every morning to pick up next day air Stressful during unload after unload i drove a route and did pick ups
good,It helps build up strength  and character  but it also shows how serious you should take the job. Also why you should want to do the job right the first time
good,U.P.S. was indeed a good place to work. With this factory style of work you will learn to bond as a team from all types of places and people. I recommend working for this company again.
good,busy and stressful. but also very fast paced and have to be diligent to the work force in order to keep up with everyone. also have to wear the correct clothes and shoes to show up to work.
good,"i have worked at ups for quite a few seasons. and its been great."
good,"Avery long time ago and a very young age. not sure what more i can say. Awesome job to have and very flexible and multi cultural. Starter with sorting and hoped to have made it to delivery, was not there for that long."
good,Get to the hub around 745 made sure the truck was properly loaded then went out to deliver all day. Then came back to hub unloaded whatever was extra on the truck and went home
good,A productive and fun workplace.  Co-workers were friendly and fun to work with.  It is very fast paced work environment.  It can be physically exhausting.
good,"Excellent Place to work. Friendly, hardworking & professional place to work.  Was hired for Personal Vehicle Driver for Holiday Season.  Wished for continued employment."
good,It will get easy over time ones you get use to the pace of the job but they offer a lot of job opportunities there and you can easy make  supervisor after your first few months
good,"I was hired as a seasonal worker during the holidays. The pay was great. No benefits were offered, but we did get the option to rake up lots of OT. Overall I have no complaints."
good,It's a pretty good place to work. Everyone is friendly. You get one break. You work up a good sweat. I like to listen to music while I work. Bring plenty of water.
good,"It was an seasonal job, but im willing and looking for an permanent and useful position. This job is an very helpful source to all the in the workforce. Most workers and managers there suggest to everyone to either be in school while working or apply for a life-long postitions. I would be more than happy to continue working with the UPS company!"
good,Manage and plan when each driver would be in and see if they were on their designated time schedule for the day. The culture at times was very difficult due to the strength of the union. The most enjoyable was seeing the service providers provide services for their customers in a timely manner.
good,"I have done the seasonal driver helper job four times now and its always great. Depending on what area you are working in your days can be either short or very long. I worked in Brattleboro so I was doing between 6 to 8 hours a day (Monday-Friday) and it was great. I wouldnt recommend this job to someone who cant move fast, is lazy, doesnt pay attention or overall a poor worker. You dont need to be a work out guru but be prepared to walk fast, climb stairs and sometimes walk far if you are on a Main street of a city or town with many businesses and apartments. This job usually lasts a month, the end of November until Christmas Eve usually but if you are interested in being a full time UPSer you can get in as a driver or even a package handler."
good,"UPS is a great career choice for your warehouse worker, as it applies many benefits and full medical coverage. It also pays 75-200k annually for those who move up into upper management. Its a great place to retire."
good,I loved working at UPS. I was working through a temp service and my time was up when I left. I would recommend UPS to anyone. it is definitely a great place to work and everyone is so friendly and they appreciate their employees.
good,"A good company with good pay and respect for it's employees who put in a good days work..  I was always happy, for the most part, with working for UPS. I would have worked my full thirty years, but family difficulties made me have to resign.."
good,UPS is all about the employees. They are the ones who gets the job done. Maintaining constant flow and output is the mission of UPS. Management does their job well and effectively. Easiest part of the job is just learning what you don't know
good,I wish I could my foot in part time I would love to advance with ups as a career . they need to bring back seasonal bonuses or raise pay . more acknowledgment of seasonal help
good,"I was a UPS store owner, I didn't work directly with UPS, but my experience with their employees was a good one. Good communication with their sales reps and management."
good,this company is a pretty much straight and narrow company that expects you to come in do your job and go home its very fast pased and wants nothing but production
good,The job I do is great and  relaxing. Do go out in the hub to drop off packages at the trucks..also have to pick up things and go to the air belt and do work there
good,"This teaches how to do, lamination,binding,notary skills, word documents, packing skills,  hazardous packaging worries, small business help, how to's for business cards, banners, etc"
good,"If you need a temporary job UPS is an easy place to get one as all you have to do is apply and pick an appointment day to go in for the position. This is only during their seasonal work time in Oct. through Dec. where they hire a load of people to work as temporary helpers, loaders and even seasonal drivers. It’s a physically demanding job, so be prepared to do a lot of lifting and walking."
good,typically work day starts with a meeting with the supervisor. then we get the tools we need daily to perform our job tasks. and start our day with little to no supervision.
good,"Great place for growth, great benefits in terms of retirement and healthcare. Management didn't seem to be dynamic meaning more moves lateral than a promotion."
good,"Ups is nice self paste, nice environment, they feed us for our progress, and feed us Wednesday's.  I love it here. I love it here I love it here honestly"
good,"It was just a great job experience. It fit my school schedule and other thing that I have to take care of but after the semester end new semester start, everything just change."

good,"load boxes inside the truck"
good,"Able to instill vision to achieve company goals, Surpass production expectations while maintaining quality, safety and customer service integrity through total quality management."
good,Great place to work for anyone. Everyone is able to move up in the company too. The pay is great for how long you work there but that's mainly because it requires a lot of heavy lifting.
good,Amazing company to work for. Would highly recommend to anybody because of the amazing benefits and the atmosphere. Yeah the hours suck but it is all worth it
good,I loved working for UPS and the fast paced environment. The only thing I hated was when they went on strike and it pushed back my availability to advance to full time.
good,"I was a sorter at UPS. My day consisted of as soon as I would get there, I would go into my section of sorters and start sorting out mail and packages. We would have a giant conveyor belt and eight different other ones that we would place and have them shipped out to their desired area codes. Work place was relaxed but very quick based. You had to pay attention and actually work. The drop required to stand for a long periods of time and only twisting your body to move and pick up the packages. Other employees and employers were well trained and respectful to others such as myself."
good,Overall working for UPS was fun and enjoyable. The people made it the best to work for. My employees would treat me well as I did back to them. They offer really good pay and benefits.
good,"Great company to work for, great benefits and compensation, Variety of schedules to choose from. Must pass assessment testing to move forward after training is completed."

good,"A typical day will have a few paced moments but not too overwelming"
good,My time at UPS was the experience that I needed because it's a fast pace job & everyone there is willing to always lend a hand & go out there truck while they wait for another to come someone will come help you get the job done it's all about communication
good,Se aprenden muchas cosas nuevas en empresas como esta.
good,"My day would consist of opening and closing the store, working on claims , mail , packaging, and customer service.. What i learned from Ups  was how to handle insurance claims on customers lost or damaged packages also handling customers mail making sure they received it. Plus i also was Notiorary for the public which was great job. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping people solve problems"
good,It's a very good job has very good benefits and have good managers depends on where they put you very fast pace and intense good so you have to be ready for it but they don't give alot of hours just 4 or 5 a day
good,Started out working dock back in 1986 when it was Overnite. Started driving in 2003 the pay took care of a lot of thing. Great jobs and benefits. Was all I knew for as work for a long time. Didn't get a chance to work the union side. I drove for UPS freight non-union. Had to take early retirement company was doing away with pension plan soon going to different retirement plan pension not included.
good,"I have to say that UPS is not United Parcel Service, it is United Protective Service, sorry if there is any confusion."
good,"My career encompassed 35+ years of service.  Service made UPS a great place to make a career."
good,"UPS expects that you work hard and teaches discipline. They're not intellectually stimulating, but you can learn a lot about yourself and other people by pushing yourselves physically to load/unload together."
good,"I really enjoyed working for Ups, I meant some really interesting people and personalities won't ever forget. I loved the fast pace work environment.I honestly loved the fact they Ups will work with you if you car stop working. Sometimes drivers would come to pick you up at your house if you have unreadable transportation."
good,"Enjoyed working  for UPS. Very demanding job always in a rush to finish on time as a driver."
good,the job was very hands on and quick paced. i really enjoyed the hours the people i worked with as well as the pay. I was only a seasonal worker i could have continued working with the company but i chose another carrier.
good,I enjoyed my time working for UPS. I definitely gained life skills that I will use forever working for UPS. They gave me an awesome opportunity to get my feet wet in logistics.
good,I come in and get straight to work. working for UPS is a good company and offer alot. Its away to start a good career. If someone asked me about UPS I would tell them that UPS is a great career job to have.
good,It was just part time work but it was a great job they had lots of benefits they had Dental they had full coverage insurance only problem it was just part time
good,You get to meet all kinds of people day after day. enjoy the outdoors. weather it's  residential or business  they look forward to seeing your truck pull up. The feeling is rewarding
good,"ups is a great company to work for, but it can be stressful. Its a work friendly place with good management. The hardest part of the job is learning it."
good,I loaded trailers and was in the best shape of my life because of it. I was promoted fairly quickly but was released from UPS because I moved to many times to them.
good,UPS was a great place to work I would recommend it to anyone whom would like to make it a career decision. A typical day inter-acting with my manager based in Cleveland Ohio. I  enjoyed the team work environment. Had  good management team. The most enjoyable part of the job was the experience I gain from my years of working at UPS.
good,Changing managers constantly and some are bad. Always has problems and actually doesn’t do back ground check like supposed to. Also no drug test or anything
good,"I enjoyed working at UPS. It was a fasted paced culture. You can work individually or as a team. Getting used to the sunrise hours was little difficult at first, but once you did it was great. Your day started at 2am and ended at 10am. Allowed for daily life."
good,"I See It as its An flexible job and very fast going , have to get the boxes down and off the line in a timely manner and get the job done and help others"
good,It was a good job to have while being a full time student in college. I was part time and didn't get a lot of hours. I mainly worked from 4 am to 9 am and worked roughly 20 hours a week.
good,"Overall nice place to work. Flexible schedule and easy to do homework while waiting for customers. It is also easy to find projects within the store to keep yourself occupied,"
good,"On a day to day basis, we moved roughly 60,000 to 95,000 packages. I learned how to operate and manage multiple areas throughout the building. The workplace was very diverse and mostly everyone was cooperative. the hardest part of the job was meeting a certain time to be finished every day because many problems can arise in the warehouse such as belts breaking down or boxes getting jammed up on the belts. The most enjoyable part of the job was feeling accomplished just about every night and creating better relationships with my employees because of it."
good,"Great workplace, I learned a lot about packaging and shipping of merchandise. I worked with a great team and we usually got things done within a day of work. Anytime we went over our allotted time, we got paid time and a half which was very nice around Christmas time."
good,"Global Opportunities to grow into and excellent management incentive. The company is transforming and moving creating multiple opportunities."
good,"A typical day at UPS involved a morning meeting. Next I reviewed the performance of my territory, paying attention to the areas that needed it and made calls accordingly. I would also prioritize and follow up on the contracts that needed to be returned.  At the end of my shift, I would send out emails as needed and put action plans together for the next day. I was put through intensive training with UPS all following the S.M.A.R.T Program.I learned a lot about different sales cycles, elements of a sales call and how to use commodities to close the sale.The work place culture is amazing. The amount of time that goes into it's employees is unbelievable. It is obvious the goal is your success. The management team keeps things positive and upbeat. The hardest part of the job is building up a territory that consistently performs under the others. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with."

good,my time at ups was Great .. the 12 hours a day was great . the culture was comforting & welcoming . there wasn't nothing hard because I was good at the job .
good,"I Enjoy the job, no complaints so far. Good starter up job to advance into other areas. Good experience to have. Staff is great. Hours are awesome. Holidays off"
good,"Go through my emails and address the ones that need immediate attention and action and always find something to learn everyday, whether for my job function or something relating or can enhance my job.  Management is present, but does not interfere with the day to day running of the office, only when necessary. Everyone tries to adhere to the workplace culture as best as possible.  Now we are a casual work environment where our dress code includes the wearing of jean with no cutouts whatsoever. However, when meeting customers it is business attire.  The hardest part of the job is getting the global regions (APAC, Europe, Latin America, USA and Emerging Market) to adhere to the rules and regulations that governs our healthcare shipments.  The most enjoyable of the job is the people that I come in contact with on a daily basis, learning from them and getting to know them"

good,I loved working as a seasonal walker. I helped the driver. My most enjoyable part of the day was meeting new people when I delivered packages. Hardest part of the job was clients that were unhappy with your services- if we missed a package and came back with it later in the day or clients expecting us to wait while they got their packages to send.
good,"checking emails, replying to emails in a timely manner. keep customer updated with status and progress of their product. "
good,I have worked for this company for 31 years and it is the only company that gives top benefits after you retire. I use to drive nights and it was very strategic with skill. You must know your job and do it well with safety first. I earned 20 years of safe driving in my career with UPS.
good,"well, when its time to get to work you got to be prepared to work and put in 100 percent effort to getting the work placed in front of you sorted. when you are not scanning a box you are moving at a steady pace to make sure the packages get where they need to go."
good,UPS is a great company to work for long term. They have repetitive manual labor jobs that wear you out. Most hubs are very dusty environments and they strictly enforce safety procedures when handling packages.
good,good work experience. It was seasonal job that i worked for and it was a ups store. good store owner and it was a fun place to work for. Fun group of people.
good,"UPS is a great place to work. Benefits are currently not available until after a year, but with that being said, UPS has one of the best benefit packages available."
good,UPS is a very fast paced work place that allows you to have fun and enjoy yourself.  The benefits are good and the turnover rate for drivers is unheard of.

good,"Was a good place to work, if you enjoy fast paced work, that has you constantly on the move. A good work atmosphere and good people to work with. Nice break rooms with vendi g machines if you didnt bring a lunch with you"
good,"The finance & accounting internship was a great introduction to the world of corporate finance. My main project was auditing a specific operation in the business. Throughout this project I partnered with different professionals in the company to assist with my audit. Everyone I worked with was eager to help. Managers were very flexible and allowed me the time to manage my own schedule. Basically my direct manager gave me the project outline, gave me the resources I needed, provided me with the project deadline, and let me get to work. I never felt micro-managed but always felt that I had the help I needed."
good,"Come to work on time, always, don't call off until your probation is over; after 90 days. Be prepared to lift heavy packages, 70 pounds and up because not always will you have a partner to help you."
good,"No gray areas with UPS, you knew exactly what the rules were and what was expected of you. Too much paperwork, much could have been done with scanning and imaging"
good,"This was a seasonal position, but all round a good company. Pay was always accurate and on time, and they made it easy to get the job also. Once I was hired, everyone treated me with respect. I will apply next holiday season as well."
good,"A typical day at work for me is greeting customers and helping them with what ever they need help with. Also, customer service is very important to me. My customer attitude leaving should contain a smile and see you again soon. At my workplace I learned how to proper pack boxes, open mailboxes, and ship packages off."
good,"This job was good, everybody was nice. I was the only female working there at the time loading trucks. I just hate that the job was only temporary which was only for seasonal work."
good,"Arrive early in the mornings and brief meetings about the daily task at hand. I've learn how to be proficient with excel, and logistics and how to organized workload as far as deliveries coming in and deliveries going out, working with superiors and others through professional emails. Low stress work environment, team- oriented workplace. The hardest part of job is going home, and the most enjoyable part is the relationship building with the team-members and technicians and drivers."
good,management was cool and nice and was always around if help was needed. hardest part of the job was lifting the heavy boxes and bags filled with packages in them. the most enjoyable was all the co-workers were nice and we had fun.
good,"The work is hard and can be stressful physically and mentally but only lasted about 4-5 hours. "
good,"this is a company that you can start at the  lowest entry level position, and work into a high level position within the corporate ranks, even with just a high school education.  The work is very demanding, both physically and mentally.  extreme accountability.  Well paid, and highly rewarded"
good,Always gotta be on the move and keep a face paced and bring lots of water! Training is offered and usually have two people when new hire. After a year you receive benefits.
good,Its a good place to work. Granted you might have to start out on the dock but you can always work your way up get your CDL's and become a driver. At first you may have to take the quick runs and it takes time to get an actual route but well worth the wait.
good,"Wish I could work for them again starting tomorrow hate I had to relocate to east Texas for family issues, but I hope to soon work there again in the near future"
good,"UPS is the kind of job you retire from.  pay is great as are benefits, and the company takes care of its people.  only draw back is that you may have to spend time working warehouse part time to get on full time"
good,"A typical day at UPS involves thousands of packages being moved to your area which you must quickly and effectively move them to their proper belts and chutes. Management is there to make sure things move at a timely pace, not to help with the workload. The hardest part of the job is getting the people to work on all their loads and not socialize, causing an inefficient work space. The most enjoyable part of the job is the pay is weekly and the various benefits."
good,I met some of the best people at ups. I experienced things I've never got to before. O learned things I never knew. I accomplished things I never thought possible for being a woman and being the size that I am. People doubted me at times but I loved my job it was the best job I ever had an I'm thankful I got the opportunity to experience working their.
good,"The entire job revolves around being as efficient as possible to maintain on-time deliveries for customers, while maintaining a safe work environment and minimizing or eliminating job-related injuries for the employees."
good,"Ups is a perfect part time job. Its 4-5 hours per night and weekly pay. The benefits are great, including medical and educational.  For students or as a second job Ups is a great choice"

good,"Ups is a great place to work,  it's rewarding and stressful but always room to advance. Customer interaction is crucile and challenging but it's a new experience everyday."
good,Great job you can move up and if you part time they pay for your school. They have different shifts and different positions that you can try for . Only downfall the supervisors have no pension
good,"Excellent company to work with and for. So friendly, respectful and professional. I loved working for UPS. Great experiences and fast-paced learning. Best company hands down!"
good,A great company to work for. it is a demanding job with a lot of perks if you can become a permanent employee. The truck drivers were very nice and friendly.
good,The UPS Store is a privately owned franchise and is not associated with UPS. My experience with TUPSS is subject only to the locations with the same owner.
good,I enjoy working there. I have a lot of time off and learn something everyday. I have a great supervisor. I enjoy trouble shooting to locate faulty part or system.
good,The amount of money we are receiving is not enough to live by. It's not even a fair amount for all of the work we do. It's actually insulting and is why I would not recommend this job. On the other hand the experience that i picked up there was some what worth it.
good,"It usually fast paced, we work with bulk pieces they weigh about 50-150 pounds  . We scan about 1300 packages on a average day. We use a GGS scanner to audit the packages as they come down the belt for additonal handling."
good,"UPS Freight is a high energy, fast paced work place and long hours are required. The physical demand requires at least 75 pounds. You load and unload trailers by both forklift and by hand. You have to verify shipments and properly load shipments so they can travel across country in a safe and secure manner."
good,"A typical day begins very fast paced and continues throughout the day.  Depending on the amount of freight needed to be delivered and picked up throughout the day, the pace can vary.  Overall a great place to work if you can multitask and organized and efficient."
good,UPS is a great place to work because of the benefits that they provide for you. An everyday work day at UPS is just like every other day there when you see packages that you need to get onto a plane you need to be careful with what you are loading. I learned with working at UPS to always listen to what I am being told to do because if you do not do it the correct way the first time then you have to go back and redo everything for that process.
good,"The overall job was easy yet fast paced, everybody was like a family and provide good team work...I learned a lot within my first month there, and management was always available to answer your questions."
good,"UPS is a great place to work part time, especially if you are a college student, as they have some outstanding benefits. Depending on your position, it can be a very demanding job, but also very rewarding. You will get much stronger, make good connections, and help with the logistics that help UPS get everything from point A to point B. It can be stressful at times, but the environment is safe, and everyone is pretty friendly with one another."
good,"Early mornings, I learned how to sort packages fast and accurate. Management was helpful with making sure all packages got to the right truck. My workplace was ok."
good,You have to look at it as a workout. Keep up with the flow of packages. I like to say it's fast paced but it really isn't. You just have to be consistent.
good,Been at UPS in the air hub for almost 10 years. It’s my second job. Benefits are amazing. Way to good to ever leave. Pretty easy job also. So if you are looking Defoe an easy part time job with Excellent benefits. UPS is the place for you!
good,"My department is very laid back, I have learned proficiency in my area, therefore, I require very little supervision. However, the job is repetitive which is not very challenging."
good,Great to get you ready for the real world. Helped me learn how to be a great communicator and to multi task under great deal of pressure. I was part of the management teamand I feel like we always did a good job preparing for the day. As a supervisor the hardest part of the day was relying on other people to show up and do the job properly. As a package drive the hardest part for me are the hours.
good,"all works were very kind and had no problems working there i spent my days cleaning, organizing, printing, faxing and laminating. i was working a summer job program so my salary was paid my another company."
good,Take the job good place to work. very competitive and strict workplace. Good people. Work days can be long. have to deal with the weather often an issue.
good,"Great company to work for. Challenging, productive,demanding. There has been many changes in transportation UPS strives to be the best. I work with the owner operator group, I enjoy talking with the drivers. UPS offers great benefit package to employees."
good,"I greatly enjoyed working for United Parcel Service. People who work there are typically straight-forward and to the point with directions, and as long as you do your job well and at a good pace, you will be successful."
good,"This was the first year UPS tried having seasonal drivers deliver from their own vehicles. They typically send you to more remote areas to meet up with a driver and take some of their stops. Pretty easy work, great pay (18/hr + $0.35/mile + $5/day for using your own mobile phone). "
good,Great place to work career wise and advance long-term careers great benefits health insurance union organized local 25 people friendly perfect work experiences.
good,Assisted the driver with delivering packages-scanned products-I enjoyed delivering to different companies and meeting new people.  A lot of walking is required and you have to work in different weather conditions.
good,a typical day was very fast paced and a little stressful i learned that team work and safety are key and play a huge part in any large business or corperation
good,"UPS has an a great culture in most aspects. Management culture is some of the best I've found. The outside sales job role is for people who want to truly be independent. It is for those who are driven individually to perform, and those who can accept that the role extends far beyond just sales. It is incredibly demanding, and somewhat rewarding. The upper limit on performance-based compensation will drive away those who feel they should be paid more incrementally for each additional win. The base salary is very healthy. "
good,"1.) Started as a package car driver."
good,I worked in a temporary position soI was not at UPS very long but I enjoyed working there and the hours were great.  The management was very helpful.  Each co-worked that I encountered was very helpful if I had questions.  The hardest part of the job was the cold weather when delivering packages.  Working at UPS gave me a sense of accomplishment at the end of the day.
good,"Day at work answering phones , cleaning , send out mail , packaging package. doing bank deposit , faxing , printing , team work, fun , work long hours"
good,"It was an environment where the new hire was needed to learn quick and efficient, as well as working safely in an environments where hazards would emerge as the day evolved.  The veteran drivers were helpful as well as efficient as we needed to complete our scheduled stops on time."
good,"This is an amazing job! You show up when they call you. Use the specified equipment, do your run and coem home. There really isnt much more than that to be explained!"
good,"UPS is a very good company, I can say that not too many days were the same as there were many challenges to overcome. In management, there were many nights that when I was getting ready to leave work, I had to help do audits of delivery centers."
good,Overall I like working for UPS. The people and the culture are great. The hours could be better but you have to start somewhere. The management team is very good and they know how to bring out the best in an employee. A typical day consist of walking and at the same time staying alert.
good,A typical work day included me meeting a driver at a location close to the root. Then together we would unload the truck one stop at a time. The driver would scan the packages and I would run them to the front door of homes or businesses. UPS was a good place to work for me I liked the fast pace atmosphere.
good,"A typical day would include meeting driver at a designated location, unloading and delivering packages to various customers, especially during peak season."
good,Working at the UPS Store was a great job to have while attending college. The work is very busy and actually requires analytical thinking skills.  It helped to develop professional skills that are necessary for future careers.
good,"I really enjoyed this job simply because it was fast paced, you would always meet new people and I enjoyed helping people get their packages safely. It was a great experience and I wish it was not just a seasonal job."
good,"A day of work consisted of scanning all boxes being loaded into a trailer, checking each box belonged in each terminal. Made sure every box was sealed properly."
good,The UPS Call center experience for me showed me that they have found the perfect balance of a relaxed stress free environment while maintaining the integrity that is expected from a company of that size.
good,"Hard work for five hours a day.  The people were great to be around.  Plenty of laughs and great conversation as the day passes by quickly.  The supervisors were very good, but the over all boss had little idea who we were."
good,"I enjoy working at UPS everyone there is very friendly and easy going but when its time to get the job done everyone buckles down and gets to work.The benefits are fantastic and you can make a career out of this job, the managers are very flexible  and very understanding."
good,UPS was the most secure job I ever had.  They pay on time and their union is one of the strongest in the US.  They demanded their drivers to follow rules and regulations.  The job can get awful boring as you are required to do the same thing every day.
good,Loved working here. It was nice meeting new people every day.  I had the nicest driver and he made my job a whole lot easier. UPS is a fast paced company.
good,This was just a temp job i got for over the holiday season while i was still looking for work. Even though it was only temporary id give it a very good review. it was a very fast paced job but not overly demanding The management and people i worked for were all very good.
good,My experience working with UPS Canada was really amazing and fulfilling one. A typical day at UPS would begin in the morning around ten with sorting of the shipments for the same neighborhood and in the sector. It was fun and amazing work when we delivered at the sorted addresses all together in a fast paced environment.
good,I started as a driver helper but that is all I did but what I have heard is that this place is a great place to start a career.  You get very good benefits and the pay is good.
good,I loved working for the UPS Store in Hudson and in Highland Park. The managers and owners were amazing to work for and truly care about their employees. It was a lot of long hours in Hudson WI but I enjoyed being there helping my team meet our customer needs on time. There was a lot of team effort and room to expand your knowledge. The days were never boring! I enjoyed working with my teams.
good,Only reason I got plenty of hours is because I was working seasonal during the peak season. Normally you will get less than 5 hours a day. Work is fast paced and the management and co-workers are very cool and easy to get along with.
good,"Pros:UPS is a great company to work for providing awesome benefits and career advancement opportunities. Teamsters union is a +. "
good,"Great company, great people, great opportunity. Having spent almost my entire adult life at UPS it's hard to summarize all that the Company has given me."
good,"A typical day involved me meeting up with my driver i was assigned with every morning Monday to Friday. We immediately headed to out routes and destined buildings for deliveries or scheduled pick ups. Once i got the hang out the system, the driver would trust me with my own buildings i was responsible for. He would drop me off with my assigned packages and later return to pick me up when i was complete."
good,its quick makes your time goes by fast people are very friendly and cooperative there. I enjoy my time working with a diversity of people. The hardest par is lifting something very heavy and straining yourself. Mostly the job is fun and gives you a rush of excitement.
good,Everyday was usually the same unless there was a lot more volume. While i was a shifter i would move cans into lanes as they came in throughout the night and sometimes if it was really busy i would help unload or the load. I learned about planes while i was there and how to use the tugs. The workplace culture was very friendly and hard working. hardest part of the job was making the cut time for the packages to be on the plane if we were busy. Most enjoyable part for me was the people that i met there.
good,"Liked the job very much. Learned driver safety, organization skills, time management. Would recommend this job to anyone wanting to learn a variety of skills."
good,UPS take care of their employees on all levels. UPS high on safety on the job and off job. It was fun to go work. But you had to work hard for the pay
good,"deliver packages"
good,Overall UPS is a great place to kick start your career. Great management to learn from. Everyday will bring something new. Great workplacde culture with nice people to interact with.
good,working as a driver assistant you are hired during the most chaotic point of the year (christmas time). the days are very fast paced with little to no downtime but the drivers are paid very well so it is to be expected.
good,"great work place, different working field in the arears of los Angeles and just know how work in the postal services and how hid the packages to where only customer can find it"
good,"I believe that UPS is a great company to work for. There are tons of opportunities with the company and UPS allows you to speak highly of their brand. UPS has been around for over 100 years, so the job security seems as if it is there."
good,UPS store has been a great place to work. I am looking into the Dentistry field to further my career and would recommend anyone to work for UPS just changing my field of career.
good,"Its really very exciting in daily basic as you were directly dealing with customers so I learnt a lot also learnt to deal with difficult customers .Also learnt packaging skills , fax , notary , manage copy machines etc."
good,It's really a fast Place environment you work hard stack boxes Little Boxes unload boxes forklifting mail sorting in you have a good pay in overtime. 401K holiday pay sick leaves dental vision insurance and weekends off.
good,"I have just started working at UPS as a morning package handler. I would say that in my experience thus far the UPS is a great business to work for. At my location we have a team of people that are very friendly and goal oriented. They have a job that needs to get done and they make sure they do the best they can while also taking care of their employees. I am not sure what my future plans are but it seems like there is plenty of opprotunity to advance if that's what you are looking for. The hardest part of the job currently is the volume of packages needing to be handled. We want to make sure we are moving at quick pace while making sure the cars are organized properly and efficiently. The best part of the job is the simplicity and staff and hours. I enjoy the time that i work in the morning, the people i work with, and that they job isnt too demanding while still being engaging."
good,"I worked as a Driver's Helper during the holiday season.  I enjoyed the driver that I worked with and had the opportunity to work as ""a team player.""  "

good,"typically would meet up with the driver work together on a schedule"
good,ups is a fast paste job that requires lots of physical labor. The hub shift is a short shift with one small break that is paid. Hardest part about the job is being able to keep up with the belt.
good,"Great job, give it Time. It takes awhile to get hours. But if you make it you will be fine. The job is not easy, but it will be worth it. Take it all in know the materials they give you. Take the job seriously."
good,"A typical day I would get picked up by the driver and then dropped off with a cart and packages to delivery to homes and businesses."
good,"My work day consisted of package handling."
good,this is a place where you can stay till retirement or you can make use of the higher education that they will pay for and move on to something better if you wish. This is a job that truly is what you make it.
good,"I basically took this job, because I do not sleep at night.  This job, was at 3am in the morning for just Four Hours.  This job helped in a time of need!"
good,"Fast paced work enviroment & physical labor. Had to make certain packages were placed on the correct truck, in a safe & organized manner - all while being time efficient. Worked Small Sort as well, more detailed organization - Scanned, Labelled & Bagged Smaller Packages to be loaded into the correct trucks. I'm glad I had the opportunity to work there & experience just what a Peak Season was like."
good,"A typical day was making calls to collect of COD's. Many people were not honest and did what they could to get out of paying their bills. Management was good, culture was great. Hardest part was dealing with disgruntle customers. Most enjoyable was learning new things."
good,"UPS was a very productive job to have. this job has indeed gave me a lot of knowledge and experience. working with Ups gave me more interpersonal skills. this job helped me with my communication, my diligence and my patience."
good,My role at UPS SCS was 7 x 24 x 365. It was a demanding yet very rewarding company to work for. I enjoyed grooming our future leaders. The training I received over my career was excellent and I continue to use the many practices I learned through this training today.
good,Bei ups ist die Arbeit für die Studenten sehr geeignet und man ist auch mit den Chefs zufrieden
good,"working at ups was great for me at the time because i was going to college and they helped pay for some classes, i also was able to get my body in great shape."
good,Ups is a great career but any other job it doesn't start that away. If you can hang in there until your chance come for advancment which may depend on who you know there.
good,employees are nice. always giving advice to new team members. the hardest part of the job is when it rains packages tend to get wet and packages need to be delivered.
good,"A typical day at UPS is get my packages on time. You learned that a lot of companies don't be a change to the small details. The management staff are usually in their own world."
good,"Come prepared to give everything, and then some!!!  Being a very production based company, as hard as you work one day, they will increase the next day so that their numbers look good!!!"
good,This was just a Temp Job and only during the Christmas Holiday season's. It was long hours cold weather/ hot weather or Rain sometimes dangerous driving conditions. Like any Job it had its up's and down's. Overall a good company to work for once you learned the routine excellent benefits it takes awhile to become full time more that 1 to 2 years in some area's.
good,I jad alot of fun working with fellow employees amd just comunicating with the managers. Everyone there were very nice and i enjoyed every minute of it.
good,"fastpace ,stressful but well paid with extremely great benefits plus paid vacations.you will earn your pay or they will weed you out ........................"
good,"I only worked for a UPS Store, which means it was not directly connected to UPS Corporate. It was a privately owned store, managed by someone who was not a direct UPS Employee. Saying that, I loved working there. My coworkers were very easy to get along with and the manager was amazing. Because we were a privately owned store, with less than 10 employees, there were no benefits or compensations. However, I loved working there."
good,"while working with the ups most of my time was spent on the road jumping on and off the truck delivering packages. It was only during the holiday period, but was a lot of fun."
good,Un empleo estable y con buen horario. Jornadas de 5 horas con ocasionales horas extra. Trabajo de carga y descarga y clasificación rotativos. Buen ambiente laboral y compañerismo. Me sirvió para adquirir experiencia en las labores de carga y ubicación de mercancía. Me gustaba el horario porque permitía disponer de tiempo libre tanto por la  mañana como por la tarde ya que se desarrolaba normalmente de 13:30 a 18:30
good,"cool place to work for 4 to 5 hours. Help to maintain strength and shape. Good way to make money and exercise at the same time. "
good,"Dispatching includes much more than dispatching."
good,UPS is an amazing place to work for. They pay for your schooling and much more. It's also a part time job so that you are able to go to school full time. The pay did suck though. It was hard being a college student and just bringing home maybe $300 a week if you were lucky.
good,"Although working in a warehouse is often dangerous, we are able to dress to our own comfort level. Every one is friendly and willing to help when asked."
good,"Mostly Filing, sending mail out to receivers in the building, input invoices daily, etc. I did a lot of assistant work for the manager so it was more a temp job to get experience in the office environment."
good,Did a six-month contract here. The environment was pleasant and management very accessible. The only critique I would have is on the lack of feedback on my work. I thrive on feedback (good and bad).
good,"I worked at UPS for 9 years the pay was reasonable for the hours and the work load was consistent, depending on the day things got a little hectic but the supervisors made sure that we were not overwhelmed."
good,"learned many safe driving techniques,learned how to use the diad delivery board.met many new people.long days but you get paid well."
good,"Very fast pace, intense work environment. Overseeing union employees which can tend to be difficult. Early morning hours which were easy to navigate and gaurenteed work."
good,I was only a Seasonal employee 3 tours (10 weeks each).  The Brothers are really professional and expect you to do well and be safe. The culture is tense when management is hovering directing actions to happen when the job constraints are not being considered.  It was almost like being in the military.  I am not a Vet but sensed a real tension.
good,"Enjoy working with my customers, and being of help to people. My work atmosphere is fun and friendly. I enjoy working with the public, You never know who or what you will come across."
good,"This is a very hard-working group of five workers who all aim to grow the store, including myself.  There are no strictly defined roles for each individual, although there is a Center Manager and a franchise owner.  Rather, all five workers step into any role as needed throughout the day.  The most exciting experience is that we not only saved the store from closure when it was purchased in 2015, but we have grown the store's volume of business and services making the store No. 1 in its ""competitive region"" in several aspects.  I learned a lot about workplace cultures and environments, the military and its personnel, as well as the affects and effects of various management styles in small business.  "
good,"I would start on the twilight shift at 5pm-9pm pst and if the night shift needed work i would again from 11pm-2am then if not enough people showed up for preload i would go again until 3am-until 9am "
good,UPS has been very good to me. Hard working job and I have filled many positions there over the years. I am retiring after 38 years and looking forward to doing something part time that I enjoy.Good place to work.
good,Very high paced job.  It will help you to get into shape physically and train you to work at a fast pace at all times.  They preach safety first daily as well as quizzing you monthly.
good,"You can start as an entry data employee, and move up. "
good,A typical day at UPS is always crazy. I learned more about team work. The management was okay.The hardest part of the job was dealing with attitudes and boxes falling on you.
good,I met some great people and learned a lot. I miss the people and the culture. I loved what I did but I also felt strung along at a certain point. I would go back if the opportunity presented itself
good,Learned a whole lot UPS was my first job dealing with forklift I  got on my first forklift and ever since then I fell in love with fork bill they taught me a whole lot when driving a forklift sit down stand up and clamps
good,Good place to work. Most everyone starts on the preload. If you don't have mental toughness and are scared to sweat UPS is not for you. The trucks don't load themselves. It's a challenging and rewarding job. When you complete your shift you feel like you have really accomplished something.
good,UPS was a very great employer.  I enjoyed my time working there over my holiday breaks during my college years.  Very fast paced job that made you think on your feet.
good,"so far ups is a great company to work for, its a fairly easy job.... pay is reasonable. they will make sure you understand and can do your job correctly"
good,"meet with the driver "
good,"UPS is a fun place to work. It is very fast paced job, and extremely physical. You work long hours almost every day but they do compensate you very well for it!"
good,While i enjoyed my time at UPS it was not run very effectively and was an incredibly hostile work environment. It was a fun fast paced job but I don't think I've ever been yelled at so much in my life.
good,"I Enjoyed working with  ups as a seasonal driver helper, due to the ease of work and simple yet challenging task. I got the chance to work with two different Drivers who both were older and had interesting stories to tell about work, the days were tedious but worth the trouble and management did what i expected, with great effectiveness."
good,"The supervisor are great and I love the crew I work with. We move quickly and efficiently and get our jobs done as fast as we can. Unload trucks, package smalls into bags, or reload trucks. It's a good job overall"
good,"is a good corporation to work for"
good,I thoroughly enjoyed my time working for ups. Both stores had awesome co workers and management. UPS takes care of its drivers and the owners are awesome to their employees.
good,"I loved working for UPS, very fast paced environment. If you fell behind on work someone is always there to help. Competitive environment when it came to loading. Who moved the fastest & had no miss loads."
good,Working at UPS was great because it was a very safe place to work and good benefits. My job for the day was very clear and understanding and I knew exactly what needed to be done.
good,I enjoyed my work and the people I surrounded myself with but the conditions proved tough on my lungs. I learned more about management and had a pleasant time working alone for the most part to see the job through. I learned to never take an opportunity for granted because it can and will come back to haunt you.
good,I really love work here all of the staff was very respectful to me open me up with open hands very understanding I love how they do team work togather.
good,"You are basically getting paid to work out. Since UPS have contracts with just about every company, there are many discounts. It is a pretty simple job, but takes a little to get use to just because lifting boxes for hours take a lot of effort that many people aren't use to."
good,The UPS Store is a very calm and nice place to work. Similar to a post office but with not as much customer traffic. Loved working with amazing coworkers and a very nice boss
good,"A typical day at work, i usually meet my driver at a walmart centre. Then we drive dropping off packages. I learnt how to be very organized and punctual and work at a fast pace environment. Good working environment but no specific schedule, the latter being the hardest part of the job. You have no idea when you are going to be called in. The most enjoyable part was the drive to drop of packages."
good,This job is very physical and and can be a pain with the elements outside which is why I love it. I would love to find another physical job like this one
good,"Advanced from package handler to trainer and outbound supervisor. Supervise package handling, loading operations, provide new employee orientation and training, ensure workforce engagement and motivation."
good,"UPS was a very fun job to me, loading the trucks was not hard to me at all. Unloading trucks was also one of my favorite ones to do only because it was a smoother pace."
good,"This was a great opportunity to get introduced to UPS. The pay was great and the job was interesting. It is a fast-paced job with responsibility, especially during the Peak Season, but recommended to anyone that can work at this job with the understanding that you are a temporary hire."
good,Your job is permanent but u have to work on their schedule. College outside of the city of the job won't be accepted although u do not have to worry about getting fired or hour cuts unless u slack off. excellent benefits for part time and full time
good,"A typical work day can be easy depending on how many workers show up, also how much information is given to me by management at it the beginning of the day. The workplace culture is a wonderful thing because the are so many different cultures that work at UPS and everyone is easy to talk to. The hardest part of this job is that there is no set schedule the start time change day to day and from week to week, but the part that can't be beat is the people hands down."
good,The Hardest part is showing up at 3 am its early and its tiring but it is necessary. The job needs to be done people need to be supplied their products in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part was building some of the life long friendships Ive held on to great friends from there even since Ive been gone almost 9 years ago
good,The manager was so great to work with and he was very nice and taught me well. the CEO as well was nice and provided good training and came over to check on the store often. I learned a lot of new skills pretty easily and would recommend the job to anyone
good,"Earned very good experience working with UPS."
good,A very tough job. If you push yourself you will lose a lot of weight. I had a great time joking around with my co-workers everyday. Not a job you can be lazy at.
good,It was a great job that i will give me an opportunity. To move forward. Team working together  company. Was fun job gave u an opportunity to learn your co-worker  &city
good,"Everyday brings challenges that must be overcame and the pressure is always on. We always look to improve the aspects of Safety, Productivity, Quality, and Performance"
good,"UPS is a successful, competitive business in  package handling and freight. They demand the highest standards and work ethic from their employees. Route work is physically and mentally challenging. Hours can be long at times particularly around the Christmas season."
good,"Ups was very fast paced, and enjoyable. Ups has great benefits and salary. Ups is a company where you can have the opportunity to grow with the company."
good,UPS is all work and no play.  I learned to keep the pace with making sure packages were loaded into specific places.  People helped one another.  The hardest part of the job was lifting heavy packages over my head.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the benefits offered to full time employees.
good,UPS offers great benefits for health however you dont get much time with your family and you work 45 to 55 hours a week. your personal life will suffer but in the end it will be worth it
good,Pay and benefits are exceptionally good. Work environment is not family oriented and a balanced life is very tough. Advancement possibilities are there especially if able to move
good,"I've been with ups for 4 years now and i love it. I like the opportunities I have to move up in the company. The benefits at ups are really good. The work we do is easy for anybody that is in decent shape, it doesn't ask for much but your time."
good,Long and rewarding career with many great and hard working individuals. Long hours and 11-12 per day with some actually overnight. Very physical work both inside and as a Delivery Service package driver. The challenges and comradery were self rewarding and many employees of UPS are some of the greatest workers in the world.
good,"I worked from base level up to middle management before leaving, only left due to personal circumstances changing and unable to work otherwise I would still be there. Great opportunities for those to progress and company very keen at promotion from within, regular feedback and chances to develop additional skills within other departments. Great training module. Big commitment to giving back to community with volunteer days and fund raising activities really encouraged. Big family feel and very much a team effort as a company"
good,"Early meetings for safety and job duties"
good,"UPS is a very good company to work for. It is fast paced environment, the money is ok but the benefits are awesome. For part time employees you pay absolutely nothing and have dental and vision."
good,"I worked in Colorado City for the holiday, so I got paid to go with the driver everyday to drive up there and come back. The houses were split so far apart I wasn't constantly outside in the cold."
good,I prefer labor and isolation in my work so this job was really good for me. Even when i was around other people or in another trailer everyone was really nice. There was just a mutual respect between people to get the job done.
good,"started out on the low end but worked my way up to manager.  Found out at early age the harder you work, the bigger the payoff.  Felt that customer service was essential and helped me today when working with sales."
good,"UPS Canada is a very interesting and intriguing place to work. At work, it's mostly loading trailers and it's very fast-paced. I've adapted really well and can work in an extremely fast-paced environment. The people at UPS are very welcoming and the supervisors are extremely kind. The hardest part of the job is when heavy flow comes and there are hotshots when trailers are bombarded with boxes. The most enjoyable part of the job are the people and how fun and entertaining the environment is."
good,"Started in Cerritos then transferred to Lakewood hub where there was a lot of stoners and I lost some hearing because of the airplanes, I came to work clocked in clocked out only 3 hours a day"

good,"While working in management at UPS, there is always a lot of work to be done, it doesn't present for a good work/life balance.  Entry level positions such as package handler offers much more flexibility.  UPS also gives a lot of opportunities for advancement."
good,"what i wanted to do. Learned alot ,and left with alot of experience. staff had great energy . Nice work place. Good people. Fun place to work and learn."
good,Was great to start work around 3 or 4 am and be off by 10 am. Made it easier for me to be very productive with the rest of my day. Management wasn't very great although.
good,The best part of this job was that even though I was doing the same thing every day I was allowed to do something physical and I enjoyed the people I worked with.
good,This was a very fast paced job. I was just seasonal but it was quick paced and a lot of hours. We worked rain or shine. The customers were wonderful. The man I worked with helped me learn quickly. The only bad thing about it is that I fell numerous times in the ice and snow. But all in all it was so much fun.
good,"Working for UPS the past three I have managed to learn a lot about managing areas on outbound loads, inbound loads, and even managing buildings flows and the amount of volume that comes through the building to keep it running. I have gained great management skills and know how to manage large areas with a lot of employees under me. There are many great sides to UPS especially since I learned how to be a great supervisor there but the job itself is just too much stress for not enough pay and the hours are really bad."
good,"Typical day:"
good,"I went to work like always trying to do better than yesterday no matter what."
good,"I had an amazing opportunity Working for Ups. Staff and management were friendly, knowledgeable and helpfull through the threem months inworked there."
good,Very hard work good place to work good salary only thing that's bad is the split shift early starts at 5am till 915 am then back in at 530 pm till 745 pm 35 hours per week
good,Company is very organized and have training programs ready to all employees and is very efficient in making its people grow. UPS is the 9th largest airline in the world.
good,This is a face to face customer service job. No experience needed. The staff and management will teach you ins and outs of basic packaging and shipping needs. Print and copy projects along with other office type projects.
good,"If you like to work hard and move fast this is made for you and the benefits are great second to none, is fun at same time and they let take your lunch brake when you can."
good,A typical day is a very high paced environment.  The greatest portion of my responsibilities include moving inventory from the trucks to the conveyor belt.  I must be constantly aware of the timeframe and also be efficient to maintain a pace that allows for the products to move very aggressively and accurately.
good,"Easy , fast pace and quick hours you can move up quick in easy if you put the time and work in to the company good benefits, only con is the hours and pay."
good,The job was an excellent line of work and taught things I didn't even know I can do if I keep on moving forward. I was capable to work the pace the company expected me to take.
good,"The hardest part of the job was when it was very busy, which was always on Fridays, because people wouldnt move out of the way."
good,It is hard labor and fast paced environment. I enjoy my supervisor and some of the other management team that they have there
good,"Great career . Excellent if you wanna have a long lasting career. Plenty of opportunities to advance in the workplace. Great people, great enviorment."
good,"Lots of friendly people, everyone has there own cubical, heavy focus on work. Management is friendly and nice. Learned how to troubleshoot UPS software and hardware. Hardest part was dealing with rude customers. Most enjoyable part was that they are willing to work with school schedules."
good,"From morning to night its nonstop work, but for the pay definitely worth it. Heavy lifting required but nothing to serious. Hardest part would be heavy lifting in buildings with no elevators."
good,Work starts at around 4:00 am and goes until around 9:00am. Usually I load 2-3 trucks for deliveries for the day; Each truck usually holds anywhere from 150 packages to 400 packages. Some of the managers are hard working and others are lazy and don't do anything. Most co-workers are friendly and helpful.
good,"Well secured company, everyone is so active and having good team with goal oriented collegues. I worked as CS agent and had great experience working with UPS"
good,One of the best run companies in the world bar none. Great management compensation and benefits are second to none. Hard work but it pays off.
good,Got to pack and ship boxes at work and really enjoyed it.  I felt appreciated by my boss and took the time to meet customers.  I recommend this part time job for students who need retail experience.
good,UPS was a job that anyone would fall in love with. The job was laid back very professional and management was awesome! Managers cared for the well being of all the employees. Great job opportunities to advance.
good,The job was exactly what it advertised and the driver was very friendly and supportive.  The hardest part of the job was the speed expected.  The easiest part of the job was time required and pay.
good,"I likes that work was fast paced , especially because there were a lot o packages to be delivered. A typical day at work was going to meet up with your truck driver wherever the meet up spot was and then you would just stick with them until your truck was empty. The hardest part of the job was shipping to businesses as far as car garages and etc. The pay was great starting I made 12.50 a hour and 5 hours after work you get overtime which was 18.25 I believe."
good,Ups was a good experience. Very productive and alot of work. Breaks were short so we had to show up to work and not just to socialize. Pay was good overall.
good,"Working in a fast paced package delivery environment is not for everyone. The workloads are sometimes overwhelming and the hours are based upon the volume of product which arrives daily. "
good,I enjoyed my time with UPS. I received good benefits and pay. The work was not difficult and the days went by quickly. I would highly recommend working for this company.
good,"I really enjoyed working for UPS here in Farmington, NM.  The managers and employees were incredible.  It is an extremely physical job so be prepared."
good,This company provided me the means to be able learn different techniques in the sorting of packages.  It also enabled me to build on my leadership skills.
good,"The work is fast paced but everyone is so polite and helpful, it was a good experience.  Any given day I may start at one position and by the end of the day I have worked at three different positions.  I've met many positive people from supervisors to coworkers."
good,"*Everyone is very friendly"
good,"Created time schedules and communicated directly with each employee on a daily basis to give them their driver work assignments. Created time cards and distributed uniforms and safety trainings to new hires. Was responsible for daily center reports as well as frequently using multiple company specific computer programs to log all daily information, work assignments, and delivery estimation projections for each day. Worked closely with coworkers and supervisors to make needed changes to increase productivity and efficiency of the center through the high volume holiday season. Office could have been more organized. Management could have been more involved."
good,"I have been with UPS  for a little over a year. Early mornings are challenging, but leaves room to have a daytime job as well. Insurance for family is definitely worth the time."
good,"I had a very good experience at UPS and wish it was more than seasonal.  I've worked for them during two holiday seasons now, both 2014 and 2016."
good,"The boss was great to work for,  the other employees were like family. It was good and busy during holiday seasons. Thinking of the future and wanting kids, I needed to find something that was opposite schedule to my husband."
good,"Was seasonal part time, but the hours were early. The management was awesome, and very easy to work with the rest of the crew. Unfortunately this is a part time position."
good,"Great company great coworker,  you get to meet all kinds of people and you're not stuck in an office all day. You start off by sword in all the boxes to which sides of town they need to go. You could have lived in the town for 20 years and found new places when working at UPS. The management was awesome they were always there to lend a helping hand. All of the co-workers seem to get along really well helping each other when they could. The hardest part of the job would have been the speed walking all day long with boxes and boxes and boxes. meeting new people was probably most the most enjoyable part of every day!"
good,"Although only temping, job is a nice physical position, everyone I've met are professional and nice to be around, opportunities  are available for part-timers especially"
good,"A typical day as a Seasonal Driver Helper in the winter time is enjoyable and helpful for people that want to be outside the house. You learn how to use a diad which helps you scan packages and the correct way to enter and leave the vehicles of trucks for when delivering a package. For example when entering and exiting the truck you hold on the the rails. If a house is on the opposite side of the road then you must go to the back of the truck because it helps you see the oncoming traffic from behind and limits possible injuries. The hardest part about the job is remembering to always bring a snack to eat. Bring second pair of clothes,socks,etc,"
good,Great place to work and has excellent benefits if you can stay there past 90 days. After several years of working there you can move up to management or to be a UPS Driver and make really good money.
good,"I loved my time at UPSSCS.  Unfortunately I had to resign to take care of my mom who was terminally ill."
good,"typical day at work is tough running packages out to houses "
good,"Great company and free workout while doing the job, lots of overtime, several shifts offered- preload, daytime, twilight, and midnight."
good,"if u want a work out this the job for u, I promise u will get in shape an its the perfect partime job if u don't wanna work a lot of hours"
good,"ups was no different from FedEx the only thing different from ups and FedEx is the work load, at ups the work load was way harder and at was nonstop work."
good,great company temp to hire positions for all types of work groups.  great staff and great supervisors who are committed to ensure you achieve your best.
good,Worked here for the past 10 years and have always been one of the top employees.  Only reason I'm leaving is because I'm trying to move because of personal reasons.
good,The best season job I had since I've been working. Pretty easy job just follow the rules and make sure you make all your stops. Getting paid every week is nice to.
good,"I have learnt several different skills, from computers, R.O.A.D trained,  management skills."
good,"Working at UPS is tough. That being said it keeps you in shape and mentally sharp! They have awesome benefits that range from 401K match to reimbursement for school and so on. Great place to make a first job at, but be prepared to work hard."
good,"Working at UPS as a Supervisor requires a vast knowledge and understanding of the business in order to provide great service and maximum profits for the company.  In my 21 years of service I have learned many traits.  I've learned how to manage people, control hours, good customer relations, and time management.  The hardest part of the job is taking on too much work at one time rather than delegating some to others.  The most enjoyable part of the jobs is the wonderful people I work with.  They care about each other as well as getting the job done right."
good,"Through out my day working at the ups wear house, my job is to unload each box in a safe and timely manner on to the conveyor belt for it to be shipped out to the sort station."
good,"I very much enjoy working here. There are numerous opportunities within the company. The most difficult part would be employee turnover in the part time positions, due to its rigorous physical demands. The best part is the overall support I have felt from management above me. The company is dedicated to being efficient to be the best shipping company."
good,"Every day was a different challenge because no day is ever the same. Working for UPS means your able to adapt, adjust, and overcome."
good,some days are slow others are just non-stop busy. non-stop movement and lots of physical labor. stay hydrated is what i learned management is okay though they will push your limits
good,"help deliver packets "
good,"We scan, copy, fax, email,and pack and process packages, I'm a notary.  Computer skills are a must. Customer service and sales skill are necessary."
good,"Its a great company to work for and offers great benefits.  They truly understand the work life balance and have a policy of taking as much time off as needed so long as they feel you are not taking advantage of the system which I do believe keeps most people honest.  Also carry the mentality that work is going to take up the time that is allotted for it - so if you can finish your day in 5 hours great!"
good,"hardwork, safety and awareness was a big must, management kind of two sided. Great co-workers and some not so great. the hardest part of the job was trying to stay on time while practicing a safe work method. the best part of the day was meeting new people and making it home safe."
good,"super"
good,"Enjoyed working there, liked being kept busy most of the time. Most of the work was very easy for the most part, just mainly had to work hard and stay focused. that way the cycle keeps going and everything keeps up to paste.Too bad it was only seasonal, UPS was a great experience."
good,"UPS has been a wonderful place to work, with opportunities to grow my knowledge of accounting. My only reason for leaving is that there are no positions available in Asheville NC that match my current position of Billing Auditor. If not for that I would retire from UPS."
good,"Very professional environment and opportunity to grow. "
good,"A good company to work for.  The money and benefits are great.  Without a doubt, you could maintain a great lifestyle here."

good,I learned that people in the nursing home doesn't really have family that cares for them or even goes to see them.Its so awesome to be able to fill in what they don't get is a family and the TLC they need.T o this day the same people I took care of still remember me.You have to be sweet and kind because these people have a heart and feelings to.Some of them can't help what they do but they still have a heart..
good,"Overall, it's a nice place to work. It's benefits and doors opened for advancing within the company is a big plus. Atypical work day would be staying focus, sorting and zoning small and large parcels, working as a team player wit my coworkers to get the job done professionally and sufficiently."
good,"UPS is a great company. I enjoyed all the positions I worked, I truly like being busy and accomplishing all the goals that I needed to meet daily.  Having the responsibilities that I had made me feel valuable, it was a great feeling."
good,UPS Small sort is a very productive job. you are always busy during the 4 hours you work. there is never a down time there is always something for you to be doing. the management there is very organized.
good,"I would not recommend the job to anyone who is lazy due to the physical requirements necessary. Weather changes effect how fast/slow you move. Due to the cold, you move a bit slower, heat makes you work faster. If you know how to talk to people and enjoy talking to the same people every day, you will enjoy coming to work. You also have to work together to get some things done."
good,"début et fin de travail dans les délai prévu"
good,"A physically demanding job during the coldest time of the year made bearable through fast paced work ethic, efficient management, and friendly coworkers."

good,"i there for a short amount of time but it was fun. i just wasnt good with the overnight. Its a very good job for people that dont want to join a gym, but want a workout and get paid. i would recommend the job to young men looking for a good paycheck."
good,Room for advancement and great benefits. Overall a good place to work if you are willing to put in the time to advance. everyone is extremely motivated and has your best interest in mind.
good,"Great place to work!  Totally enjoyed my experience working at UPS Corporate Office.  I had an opportunity to assist Engineers, using database methods which were new to me."
good,this is a very good company to work for.  benefits were awesome hours were terrible but the pay was great.  I must admit that I did have to work hard for every penny.
good,This is a Union Company so advancement would be a long process. The set schedule was great. The other employees and management were great. Only downfall for me was the position was overnight and I had a baby. Otherwise I loved the job!
good,"A typical day at work is fast place environment, work with hands,and mind, lifting and pulling. I learned how to work as a team. my co workers works good as a team. the hardest part of the job making sure customer get package on time.  most enjoyable part of the job is everything i do."
good,"I enjoyed myself . Kept me busy, always on my feet. The majority of the drivers were nice and accepting. This job is time conscious. The faster you go the better "
good,"loading and unloading package trucks. Coworkers were fun to work with. It was a tiring job, and at the end of the day, all I wanted to do was go to bed, but I enjoyed the time i worked there, and was thankful for the job."

good,"Sorting hundreds of packages per hour based on the color coordinated zip code."
good,"A typical work day at UPS is long, you get tired sometimes, but get an hour break. I learned how to move effectively delivering packages and carrying heavy loads. Management was good, they did not tolerate unprofessional behavior. My co- workers are fun and easy going, but the also get the job done. The hardest part of the job is walking in terrible weather conditions carrying heavy loads. The most enjoyable part of the job is moving on to the next delivery spot."
good,"Very different atmosphere, hard working people all around. Would load and unload packages everyday at a very fast pace."
good,"• Responsible for delivering packages to residents and businesses."
good,"This is a top company.  No games, professionalism is the standard.  Know what is needed and do it.  No excuses work hard and you will do well.  Not a place to do personal expression, The work is mostly achieving the company goals in time proven methods.  Expression and creativity can be part of an upper managers day but only a part.  This company knows what it is doing and will communicate its goals.  If you want to help them the job can be rewarding."
good,busy during holiday season. management know how to place workers in correct area. enjoy the college program. co workers work as a team.
good,"UPS was one of the best jobs ive worked for, the hardest part of the job was unloading the packages and loading them back up to another truck. everyone got along and worked as a team thats why i loved working there."

And if you can handle a lot of physical endurance, able to lift a lot of weight up to 150 lbs., and walk about 10 miles per day to be fully pushed to your limits, mentally, emotionally, and physically, this is a job for you. A bonus is that time flies on this job. I never experienced a dull moment in the 35 years I was there."
good,The Package Preloaded position is an amazing job if you're a student as you're hours range from 4:30 am to 10:00 am. After your shift you have an entire day to go about your business (such as school). UPS also offers 80% off of your tuition which is a great incentive. There is also lots of room to grow in this company and it is awesome to see how many employee's have worked for the company for 10+ years!!
good,"I work early early mornings, I work in part of the company that helps make our packages get delivered on time. When the packages get unloaded from the trucks delivering the packages, they are scanned. They are scanned so we (and the customers) know where the package is at all times, some of the packages, will not scan, for various reasons, the label is torn, the label is missing, the person moved,etc... The work I do is to make sure we find the information on the computer and type up a new label, so the package will be delivered on time !"
good,"loading and unloding trucks, delivering merchandise to business and residents in a timely manner. I enjoyed working for this company I learned a lot and got to meet a lot of great people."

good,"Love UPS, they treat u like a team player, always thankin you for your work and realizing everyone counts! Loved the job responsibility and help available for questions."
good,"I learned that delivering was more complicated than anticipated.  It was hard, fast paced work but it was worth it.  I really enjoyed being out doors in the fresh air, it was just hard being in a car most of the time."
good,"The people/workers were all very helpful to me as a temporary employee. They showed understanding if I didn't quite get procedure as quickly as some thought I should have.  Upper management was wonderful to work for and with.  They get their hands/minds into the daily routine.  Even though this was a very busy time for UPS, I again stress how helpful everyone was to help me do my part."
good,"Hardest job I ever had. Very rewarding, great potential for advancement, physically demanding. "

good,Good place to work the management team is very strong a lot of room for growth. The company offers a lot of benefits. would like to stay with the company and see how far I can go. Needs more fulltime positions
good,"I spent roughly 4 hours every night (10pm-4am) sorting through international packages. I was taught the rules and regulations of international shipping (imports and exports), and I was given the task of determining if a package was addressed correctly or in violation of any rules (ie, knives were not allowed to be shipped to Australia)."
good,"Accurately picked orders from a list and prepared them for delivery in a timely manner, Package handler, sorting and scanning packages for shipment"
good,"usually started working at 10:00, and worked about 4 hours a day.  Every body was great to work with, and had a fun time doing it.  Only thing that wasn't too fun was avoiding being bitten by a dog, and enduring the weather.  Other than that it was the best Job I ever had."

good,A typical day at work. The hardest part about the job was moving some of the packages. The most enjoyable part of the Job was going house to house
good,"A typical day at UPS was not typical. There were hurdles everyday in the operation. Never a dull moment thats for sure. Managment was not all that bright, mainly because some of them had never done the job and the felt like they knew better. Employees could do better when it came to their work ethics. Some didnt care if they showed up to work or at all. Often resulting in no disciplinary action due to managements poor job of maintaining employee records."
good,"This job was a great job, some good people. I learned all different vast of tasks . Always was busy mailed runs everyday. I was an hard worker where this job had no room for advancement."

good,it is a fast paced place to work time can seem to go slow but fast  you are constantly working and moving throughout the day you are there work along side regular people with same knowledge you have the chance to show others how to succeed and get through the night by lifting and lowering up 70+ pounds . you can take advantage of ups by furthering your career by school to work or earn to learn so you can go to college and it will be paid for or have half paid either way ups is a great company to work for.
good,"Hard work not for the light of heart, Short breaks, schedual only differs by a matter of 30 minutes week to week. Managers have good sense of humor, No strict dress code, 5 day work week never differs except for national holidays. 2 weeks paid vacation after a year of employment (increases 1 week per year),"
good,"scan in packages while they also go out "
good,"The typical day at work changed the longer that I was with UPS. The beginning days were spent stacking the boxes within the bellies of the aircraft going from plane to plane to plane with very few breaks due to me starting close to December. The last couples of months at UPS were spent loading and unloading the top of the aircraft or the p-section of the aircraft, which is similar to the top but holds smaller and fewer loaded cans. Towards the end of my days with UPS I was mostly using the equipment which assisted us in loading the aircraft. I was one of the only two people on my crew who were adequately experienced in operating the heaviest equipment on the airport as well as being trusted to drive such equipment up to the aircraft. The time I didn't spend operating the equipment was spent helping to load cans loaded with packages that varied from weighing anywhere from 2000lbs to up to 5000lbs. The hardest part of the job was being at the mercy of mother nature during the winter time where some nights it reached 0 degrees with a windchill of -20 degrees. The most enjoyable part of the job was the fact that management was typically around the same age as the workers so it was easier to connect with them on more than just a subordinate level."
good,I enjoyed having the interaction with the coaches and players. The crew had a team mentality. I never felt that I was alone during any segment.
good,you work 3.30 hours at the least a day. fast paced work environment. steel toe boots required. friendly co-workers. work is easy
good,Job is based mostly on productivity. There is plenty of room to be promoted from within to either driver or management position.
good,"UPS is one of the greatest companies I've worked for. I have acquired many skills that make me better suited for the workforce in and out of the company. My position as a supervisor has taught me how to think critically and make decisions even under pressure, the importance of being a team player, and how to manage employees."
good,go to work meet with my driver talk about the day a head go out deliver packages at a rapid pace to saticefie the customer and to make the company proud
good,Subway was my first job and it was an exciting start for me. I really enjoyed making customer's happy with there unique sandwiches they'd want. It was such a wonderful and fun environment. We were always busy and managed our time effectively.
good,"A typical day at work at UPS as a package handler is very fast pace and physical job. We are constantly loading, unloading, and scanning boxes. The boxes weigh 20lbs to 180lbs. I have learned that UPS is a good company to work for long term. The people that I work with are very friendly, hardworking people, and they give me good advise at work."
good,"good company to work for enjoyable atmosphere enjoyed the hard work and co workers. clean safe work environment,  management was very professional and good working conditions"
good,"great pay and great benefits with long working hours."
good,"UPS is what it is, a delivering service, you mostly use physicality to do your job and you work through your entire day. Safety is the number one concern."
good,"Clock in at 10am and work until 8pm I would have to patrol Lake Murray, take money at the front gate, and stop any person that was violating the park rules and also give hourly reports on the activity in the park along side Lexington PD."
good,My job consist of having a team of 6 employees and I have to set up each employee in a manner that would be the best way to get the job done. I have to assign different areas to all my employees so all the work gets done at the time its suppose to get done. I have to meet a daily quota and I have to do everything I can to make it happen. I also grind out with my employees showing them that I care about them and that I am whiling to anything I can to help their jobs a little bit easier.
good,I manage over 1500 packages a day and I make sure the packages get to their proper locations safely. I learned that leadership is not neccessarily associated with only the job title; but everybody has to step up and take charge when something is out of order. I wotked with quality people that made going to work fun and interesting. The hardest part about this job is lifting the heavier packages and the most enjoyable part is working with the devices and equipment.

good,UPS is a great company with good management and my co-worker was great and made me happy to be working with him and ups the hardest part of the job was in the beginging adjusting to delivery and walking with packages but only lasted a few weeks. the most enjoyable part was satisfying customers and just being at work

good,All about safety and working proficiently. Organized and thorough training.
good,"The job I held within the company was only a temporary one, so I can't speak to job security very well, however, from what I've heard while employed there, if you get a permanent position, you can stay on for the rest of your life. The jobs can be very stressful (drivers spend much of their time rearranging the back of the package car), and the management, though nice, don't always know what's going on. "
good,"Overall a great place to work."
good,"In my 8 months at UPS (Stuart, FL), I learned much more than just the grueling and laborious work of sorting and preload, but camaraderie and structure. My co-workers were devoted to the job and the company as a whole and that showed in the service we provided to our many clients.  Sadly, I had to leave due to health reasons, but had I the opportunity to return, I would have in a heartbeat!"
good,"It was busy, but I learned a lot at this company.  enjoyed working with my co-workers, and I really did love my job with them."
good,"When I first started at UPS I unloaded all the incoming trucks, not long after i got moved up to what they call a loader/splitter. Doing this when a box would come down the belt I would have to scan and stack in the right feeder truck based on the city,state, and zip of the package. After working there for about 6 months they sent me to hazardous training, after I completed their training I was made the hazardous materials responder for Decatur. While working for UPS i learned the true meaning of hard manual labor. Co-workers were all great and easy to get along with, management was also extremely easy to work with. The hardest part of my job was just keeping up with the rigorous pace of the boxes and not falling behind. The most enjoyable part of my job for me was the hours and how easy management was to work with since I was still in school."
good,I would meet a driver a pre-determined place at the begining of my shift. Most of the day following that point was taken up by running packages to doors and riding along in the truck
good,"UPS as a package handle was a very flexible job. You have to learn how to be strong, and lift packages in the right positions for your body to move. I've learned alot about the company which was amazing. Learned where the packages go before they get shipped out. Management was on eyes and on the move. My co-coworkers were in and out. So i get different co-coworkers everyday but they were cool and chill. Talked while we work got the day faster. The hardest part is lifting over 70 lbs into the trailers. The most enjoyable part of the job was just working hard and finishing strong."
good,has fun working seasonal it was easy on hours had a great partner that help me and din't use me
good,"As a valuable driver I always had my hands full with a new route to learn or helping the milk men of the company. Ive learned a lot about customer service and time management.  it was hard to work in a union company, cause there were to many people taking advantage of the union based handbook. I feel the micro managing was the hardest part of my job. I really enjoy being outdoors and dealing with the public first hand."

good,"Exciting place to work "
good,"load and unload packages"
good,"A typical day at work is very intense. There is a lot of work to be done and needs to be done in a timely manner. I learned to keep one pace throughout the night to not tire myself out. With that being done my job becomes easier. My co-workers are very reliable and we definitely eye to eye when working together. The hardest part about the job, there was no hard part to me honestly. The most enjoyable part about the job is being able to compete with other parts of the building and being recognized for your work."
good,I am had a job with UPS as a sorter/unloader. i had two deaths in the family at the time. They sent me a letter stating if i don't come in within the next forty-eight hours i was terminated. Well I tried calling after i got back. NO answer.

good,United Parcel Service was an excellent place to work. There was opportunity for advancement.  Management was excellent always willing to assist you when you needed them the most.  The hardest part of the job was just being able to make sure the customers filled out the SRB forms.  The most enjoyable part of my job was just being able to work in an environment that was fun and full of life and new experiences.
good,"UPS is the best Company in the World to work for, however; they put way too much power into the Loss Prevention dept. The staff in the LP dept., abuse their position. If you're not on the ""list"", chances are; you'll be watched, and soon after.... FIRED! They have the right to terminate your employment without explanation, and no one in UPS Corporate questions their decisions or actions. From the 4 (four) Hubs that I have worked at, I've noticed that LP was terminating the employment of some very good, strong, hard, dedicated Workers. It would really benefit the moral of UPS if they would do an internal investigation of their Loss Prevention dept. Workers are more interested in trying to avoid, and please the members of Loss Prevention, rather than focus on the forwarding of parcel, and doing their job."
good,"The day started with the driver punching in for the work day on the DIAD board. Then a pre-work meeting was held by management regarding the previous day's stats and the current day's expected stats. Drivers proceeded to their assigned trucks to assess the package count for the day by the vehicle loader. Packages were then delivered according to the order of the planned route design. During the course of the day, packages were picked up from the assigned pickup customers in that area. After the last pickup or delivery was made, drivers returned to the building. All paperwork collected during the day was turned in for processing. Drivers punched out on the DIAD board and returned it to the docking station for recharge and for upload of the day's information. "

I appreciated working with my boss and other employees. They made me feel accepted and wanted. If i had the chance i would work there again. I even seen a picture with my boss and Bloomberg holding hands.
good,hard work pays off. literally.  good management but bad job culture.
good,"Getting an opportunity to work at UPS was one that I won't forget. I have great respect for these deliverymen and women that work hard especially during the busy seasons. While working there, I developed this system of ""planning my route"" to make the most efficient deliveries there were. I believe that helped contribute to the high compliments I received from both co-workers and those whom I served. If the chance came to work for UPS again during the busy Holiday Season, I would definitely take it up, and hopefully visit the friends that I made the last time."

good,"Start my day with checking my load in the truck and then doing the pre-trip inspection of the vehicle. Once on the road daily dealings with society in general as well as customers, I've learned many things during my time here one of the things used on a everyday basis was driving safely and bringing my awareness up to date. The hardest part of the job was the amount of hours one is out there working till, Management tried there every effort to get drivers in early unfortunately it didn't work out all the time. Supervisors were always being rotated throughout the district so to get comfortable with one person was difficult but for the most part the staff was very workable and caring. The most enjoyable part of the day was dealing with the everyday customers which treated the drivers as their family."

I became very assertive and with all the different personalities i was always surrounded with, I became a very great trainer. Which than got me promoted to Lead.  The hardest part of my job was being lead and separating myself from my associates. I took on a leadership role and i wanted to become a good example for the people around me.

good,"Load & unload trucks in a timely fashion while operating a forklift."
good,"Excellent place to work, best packaging company out of all to choose from! Very fast paced, when you are loading a trailer with boxes, they never shut the belt off for you to actually get caught up! Your fast pace is never fast enough to suit them. Crew leaders stand over you and tell you it's not fast enough, although you give it all you have!! It's long hot hours of lifting and stacking, then wash those filthy trucks afterwards. If you have to load in a trailer called ""piggyback"" they get mad at you because it costed more money in fuel to haul it to the air hub. Expect 10-15 years before a drivers job, because people can transfer with higher seniority and take those jobs away from you!!!"
good,"Love UPS a great place to work part time..."
good,"It was very fast paced and when working for a company such as UPS you have to be able to work in an environment such as that, people are expecting their packages on time. Especially during the holiday season. The best part about the job is when you deliver to the same stops every day, you get to know your customers really well and you bond sort of like a family.

good,"This was one of the most challenging jobs that I have had since I started working. I started as a sorter and in less than a year I was promoted to supervisor. The company gave all employees a fair opportunity at bettering themselves. The hours were rough and the commute was long, but when it was time to go home I always left with the feeling of a job well done.

good,I learned discipline on this job which is a very
good,Working there I had to be very vigulant and fast on my feet. also with the courtesy to deliver packages to customers in an professional manner.
good,long hours and a lot of thinking and planning
good,Working is for ups was a very valuable in a great experience I was fortunate to have.
good,"Great job as far as a brotherhood amungst other driver.Usually a typical day was 140 deliver's,and 12 to 20 p/u locacation's."
good,"If you are a hard working individual, physically fit, with a great sense of direction, and wish to move forward in this career field, then UPS is an excellent place to work. The benefits cannot be beat, and the pay is excellent. The hours are however, very long (9-11 hrs/day) for a full-time position. Management opportunities are available at most locations."
good,"It had amazing benefits, It paid good but because of the part time hours it was nothing that you could live on. It was a fun job with many tasks and great people but because of the small market and all the drivers being a younger generation there was a small turn-over rate for full time."
good,I enjoyed being able to wear the Ups uniform everyday and deliver packages to customers and see the smile on their faces when they received their shipments.
good,United Parcel Service is a fast pace demanding job which teaches you on time accountability and some valuable customer service accumine.It is a great enviroment with dedicated employees and management.
good,"Good work environment in a competitive field. Recurrent training and additional training for all skills readily available to assist or advance employees. Nice place to work, lots of great people."
good,"Great company to work for and the benefits are amazing.as a hourly employee you get treated well, but as you get in to management it gets much tougher."
good,"Fast paced job where you are on the go from the minute you walk in the door. I liked that! ""Hands on training"" regarding sorting/organizing route, packing your personal vehicle and driving part was excellent. Training on the DIAD scanner was lacking. I wasted a lot of work time trying to get from start to finish on some packages depending on circumstances.  My fellow PVD's and I struggled with that darn machine til the bitter end! Hope if I go back next season the Cass City hub has updated to the new hand held scanning devices like others I've seen that are the size of a cell phone and much more user friendly. Great pay for a seasonal job. If you are a punctual, hard working person able to lift 50-60 pounds, of any age, who enjoys driving and being out in the elements, this is an excellent way to make extra money and make a customers day by delivering their packages in a friendly and timely manner."
good,People are friendly and the workplace has a great atmosphere. Management was great.down side was when holiday season was over they let me go with little notice.
good,"UPS is a great company to work for. It’s hard work and very fast paced, but The pay is good and the benefits are amazing. If you are a union employee your benefits are free. The people are like family."
good,I loved the environment of this job the workers were so nice and it felt like a family environment they helped you when you needed help and treated you like one of their own.
good,Lavoro stimolante sempre a contatto con le persone
good,"I was excited about UPS because it fitted my schedule, it has pretty good benefits and the company is team oriented. I would recommend this job to any individual"
good,"UPS has come a long way in giving women opportunities .  Great diverse culture. Hours long, but pay exceptional during my time there. Community is a big part of the UPS legacy; giving all employees a chance to give back. My employees were absolutely the best."
good,"Great company that will help you financially, will give you great benefits with good an awesome experience working there. This job will teach you how to work together."
good,"Ups pays for college, along with good pay, health benefits, along with other benefits. The hours aren’t too bad, during peak season (Christmas time) there are a lot Of opportunities to double shift. Also its a great job for part time or full time employees"
good,"Seasonal helper with awesome drivers, hours varied depending on how many stops/packages. Rain or shine we delivered packages. Because of peak season we worked a couple of late nights up to 9pm."
good,"Different flexibility of hours available to work, definitely going to get a work out on every shift. TheFirst two weeks will be the hardest ever but if you can get through those then you will be OK. Peak season is a whole Nother animal and the work is crazy but you definitely make the money for the time spent there. Benefits are amazing after you qualify and you can advance and go through multiple routes in the company if you decide to go that way."
good,"- Deliver packages in both residential and commercial."
good,"Love the company. Very flexible and makes it interesting every day. Be prepared to be on your feet all day and getting dirty. When it came to school and doctor's appointments, they were willing to work with you and help work around that."
good,It was a good experience to work for UPS. I was able to maintain work and social life balance and the pay was good. And my co worker and supervisor was also very supportive and cooperative.
good,"Loved working independently and know what was expected daily. Had a great communication with my driver that brought my packages to pod location daily.  Do feel Pod location could have been more generalized but, other then that loved working for the company!"
good,Never in my life have I had a job with such a positive work environment as when I worked for UPS. Like all companies there are some good days and bad days but overall this is a great company to work for and I fully recommend it.
good,great hour. usually start about 9 or 10 and go out on the route until you have it completed. most of the time a day consists between 5 and 9 hours. Really good job.
good,"working as a seasonal helper for UPS was great, learned a lot of new things on the job whether it was about the job itself or everyday life. you meet many new people and can have a great time."
good,"If you are in good physical shape, enjoy very fast paced and demanding shifts, and can work with long hours and and type of weather conditions, this job is definitely for you because they compensate you very well for your work"
good,At ups you must learn to follow rules be on time for work and take pride in what you do. I have be there for 32 years it has good days and bad like any other company but it’s a company to work for.
good,"Great place to work on, they offer a lot of good things to their employees like life insurance, health insurance, 401 k, and the paid is good for a seasonal driver"
good,My favorite job to work I absolutely love the enviorment and the people that work there. I also love the labor and load of the job personally it keeps me active and keeps me in shape. Also the flexible hours they have
good,"I learned a lot working at The UPS Store,  especially small format.   The hours were flexible and staff always got along.  Christmas time was our busiest season but management still made the time enjoyable."
good,It was just a seasonal job but it was worth every second of the job. I would do it again. The pay is great and you’re on your own which is what I preferred.
good,It is a Great company to work for but my hire as a Temporary contract project was only limited time. Would recommend to look into more opportunities when available!
good,"Good work place, benefits are nice, but it is hard to get into outside of peak season. Management can be a bit out of wack at times but the end goal of the day is usually achieved."
good,Its a great place to work because you are always moving and staying busy. It is a fairly simple job but the holidays get very busy and can be overwhelming.
good,"Deliver packages to homes, learn the scanner, enjoy delivering packages to people. Management was there then needed, nothing hard that i can think of."
good,"A typical day of work would be very busy, due to the Christmas season. There were a ton of amazon returns. I have learned how to sort mail, how to make and ship packages, how to be extremely patient to the customers during a rush, I learned how to do an international on my second week. The management and culture there were amazing. The hardest part of my job would be dealing with rude customers, but the most enjoyable part of my job would be conversing with my coworkers."
good,They pay weekly and top dollar is paid. Training was excellent! Would love to work with them again! Flexible with hours and great team members who are there for you always. A typical day at work was busy but enjoyable and you would learn something new every day.
good,Always work hard go to work on time get your work done multi task learn new things at the job wonderful hours great people comfortable training lesson
good,"This is a great company to work for if you need some extra money for the holidays. It is only a month long, maybe a little more or less depending on location."
good,"Friendly coworkers, helpful managers, safe working conditions and a pleasant working environment. Making customers happy and delivering products on time to ensure a safe working day."
good,This job keeps you active and on the move. You will never have the same day as another which is a positive. I enjoy working at UPS as the advancement opportunities are there for the taking and are achievable.
good,"A typical day at work is a hustle, the work culture is awesome. Management is kind of a struggle but dealing with them is the hardest part of the job. The good part about working at ups are the people you meet."
good,I had a fun time working and UPS I would like to wait there again if I had the opportunity unfortunately it hasn't come to pass have great benefits and flexible work schedules
good,The supervisor was great to work with. Work load was manageable. My driver was great to work with aswell.  Uniforms were supplied to you. Great pay. Overtime available.  Just a great company to work for.
good,"I am only a temporary employee, but have enjoyed my time here very much! The other employees seem very dedicated and professional. I would like to explore more in this Company or a like field of work. A great way to stay in physical shape."
good,It's good experience working for UPS Evey one is supportive there. Company do take care of employee saifty. We get pay raise after Evey 6 months and we are allowed to grow either in management or union.
good,"Diverse culture, fast paced environment, non stop work. Has 3 shifts, I work from 3:00 am until 10:00 am during weekdays. Saturday and Sunday off. Interest in a position where I can have a full time."
good,It is a face paced environment working in HR or inside the HUB. Very diverse culture. Have to get used to constant changes throughout the company. UPS promotes from within.
good,"Good people to work with, easy once you get the hang of it. Good benefits. Paid time off. 2 weeks vacation. Will work with you on a lot of things. Good supervisors."
good,"Over my 3 years of working here I had been threw alot of challenges, with management staff changing twice, peak seasons and construction. But every one of us worked hard to make everything run smoothly. The whole sort was a group effort and everyone e was always friendly and worked well together."
good,It’s when you have nothing left you can go to ups. It’s a great community they’re very helpful and understanding. People should try it out if they need something immediately.
good,It was really well paid and easy straight forward but quite far away I learnt how to work with the public and how to problem solve and work with a lot of pressure quite easily
good,"i would walk in on a typical dasy geared up to work hard and try my best. so i arrive around 7;30am. for that morning shift . i was remembering that i was reallly full on doughnuts and bacon. i could barely move but strived ofrward. anyways u.p.s,. is a great place to work, with good honest people."
good,I totally love my job. Love the amazing hours and fantastic benefits. The Time goes by very fast and you get a workout the whole time while getting paid.
good,UPS has been very good to me.  I am paid well.  I have good benefits.  I love my job. I work predominately by myself.  I work until I am finished.  My job is to get all the packages in the back of the 5 ton truck to the proper business'.  Then I pick up all outgoing packages.  I work Monday to Friday. I start at 9 a.m. and finish at 4ish.
good,Ups is an fast paced environment that is easy going and can be alil heavy sometimes. Its a nice work place not to much hounding you to do your job just alot of rushing.
good,"This was just my first season as a driver's helper but I won't forget it.  If anything it has shown me that UPS is a company I would like to work for and retire with.  My driver was great and really taught me a lot in the short peak season.  I look forward to next year, but hopefully will be hired before then."
good,"Very fast paced, physically intense job. I loved it. Everyone helped each other out to get things done and where they have to be. Several different areas you could be at any given time."
good,"Its a physically demanding job but if you put in the time and effort, the supervisors really start to trust you which opens opportunities to moving up in the company."
good,"what a good job. A normal work day was 11 to 14 hours. Id go home to a cold dinner and straight to bed. I learned time management skills, they would give us 15 hours of work and want it done in under 13. management was fair to union members. Hard work was rewarded with even more work."
good,If you like labor work this is the job for you.  Ups is a pretty good job you have to work flexible hours the hours are not consistent. I loved this job when I was there most of the managers work with you and they care about their employees
good,"Do your job and keep a steady pace. "
good,"I have only started working here in October but I like it. It gets hectic sometimes but that's only because it around Christmas. I was seasonal but I'm staying after Christmas, so they let you know you are appreciated. The pay is good and the hours are reasonable."
good,great people great company. i enjoy meeting with the driver and getting straight to work. its not really hard so i really have fun while working. thank you
good,I learnt how to take care of packages and how to work better with others I became a great team leader trained others on how to work their job made sure packages was delivered on time
good,"Ups is a great part time job and gives you plenty of opportunities for management or full time driving positions. The benefits are unmatched and that is what I loved most about ups. My experience at ups has been great, they’ve been understanding and flexible when unexpected events happened in life."
good,Ups is a fun and exciting place to work. Upper management takes time to train all employees to the best of their ability. Ups is a great place to work.
good,"In UPS you know the time you start to work but you don't know the time you go home. Ups have just one door that you will use to enter and exit. Guard keeps your i.D and/or license and give you another one until you go home. Ups is frustrating at firts do to you have to do it ALL.. You will lost weight since you have to walk, be in movements all day long to much. There is no sign in or out with a card is by a computer.. Too much! But when you see your payment check you will forgot how frustrating was all week.card."
good,Great pay and fantastic benefits great company to work for pay holidays pay sick time pay personals days not much overtime the hours are not great but the money and benefits make it worth the sacrifice
good,"This is a great place to work if you value good benefits, job security, and fair pay. Representation by Teamsters means jobs are protected and pay is base on job and experience. Better jobs are won in a bidding process based on highest seniority. All jobs are hard working jobs. Most people get in the door via seasonal, then part time positions."
good,"Keep you working all night long. You will lose at least a pound the way we move in this place to get things done, it’s awesome and unbelievable to see how it’s done. I like working at ups, benefits are the best!! And so is the $$"
good,Ups is a good company to work for they are really into helping advance there employees. They allow you to work in a safe environment. They teach you the necessary skills to get the job done
good,The management and leadership type differs between groups. The work life balance depends on what group. I have been fortunate to have a great leadership team.
good,I didn’t do  enough hours  And I need a full time job they was telling me that they were going to work whit me whit more hr bud they didn’t gave me enough hours and I gave them a week  notice
good,"The hours that they gave was really bad I couldn’t pay my bills working there it’s always some five or six hours we working. It’s a nice working environment everyone is fun and active supervisor always looking out for you, it was a good job but the hours they give sucks."
good,"At first I was a little nervous , but once the interview was over I felt 10x better . I was ready to work! Once I started working  it all came to me.."
good,Ups has been the best it can be to me & a great working place so far even though it's only been a few days I feel like I can work in any work condition and I'm able to work things out or ask questions when it's needed.
good,At UPS there were ample opportunities to grow and develop. if one wanted to. The mentorship program was well developed for newer sales people to take advantage . Training for Sales Managers was on going every day. It was a self development atmosphere.
good,Ups is a good place to work and will also be good for anyone that wants to go back to school. They will help you pay for it and your books. They also have good health coverage.
good,"If your goal oriented, have a good attitude ( even when you don’t get exactly what you want) and if your a hard worker. You will be successful at UPS, the sky is the limit."
good,It's was very interesting. I got to meet and build some relationships wt the driver's and tenants of the businesses I delivered to. Great workmates made it a awesome
good,Taught me alot on how to be responsible paying attention and working safe. Stay on the look out for vital signs of other employees making sure everything is going ok in my area
good,"at first during peak season it was stressful, but once the supervisors and the senior staff implied their techniques i was able to adapt and learn progressively. it was a very diverse workplace and it was fun to work with different people on different belts across the warehouse. my manager but the assistant manager to the company took one on one time to work with me when he didn't have to. the supervisors were able to show me how to work at a faster pace and get my package per hour up to ups standards. there were no hard parts during the job, but getting home late was the only part well during peak season. i didn't have enough seniority but when a days shipment was low and i was asked if i wanted to go home i would gladly take it so i my salary met the requirements of my SSI. not that i didn't enjoy being there. i enjoyed every moment of that job the good and the bad which there was hardly any until i tried to apply this year for the seasonal driver assistant position that works perfectly with my school schedule, i was denied rehire. when i reached out to human resources they said my supervisors were the reason but i was superb not perfect but an exceptional employee. so i called the union representative and provided my information and the next day he had called me back to apologize because there was nothing that he can do to overturn the decision. it was not my supervisors that put me on the negative rehire but rather management, to be specific the manager of human resources .disappointed about this i plan on to pursue other career areas even though ups works with my school"
good,Good money Great people! Drivers helper seasonal!Its a great place to work if like like walking and making good money!Im a hard worker dependable and a quick learner
good,This place was a relaxing environment. Teamwork is expected in every department. They make sure everyday to go over safety regulations and make sure you know it by not only testing you but showing you around the warehouse. The management besides 1 were very helpful and nice. I would recommend this job to anyone. Becoming a driver is the biggest benefit.
good,If it wasn't for the manager I would still be there because I was hard working strong out going every thing he told me to do I did it. I was friends with a lot of people there I know almost every one
good,"As a driver helper, I met with the driver and went over to see pre loaded truck and determined the workload. I had a lot of fun running packages door to door or business to business.The pay was excellent for the time being."

good,I was injured when I was making a delivery and the elevator that I was riding in malfunctioned and dropped...UPS bought me after being out for 3 years..
good,Really love this job ! It was nice going in to work the customer made the job ! Very fast pace but that’s made it fun Team work was fun to work with there were good days and bad
good,My day begins with assisting customers from l open to close.  I have learned a lot working at the UPS store I have learned how to pack and ship packages also how not to ship hazardous materials.
good,Great company to work for if you want a career and a job to retire with. Hard to manage work life balance if you have a family. Loved the experience and gained a lot of knowledge.
good,"It is a good company to work , I get a better job so that is the reason I left, but I do recommend to work there , it is a.fast pase wich I do like to be busy at all time"
good,"Loaded trucks up for their daily runs and helped deliver when necessary"

good,"I would still be working there,if not for moving and not being able to transfer from the facility I was working at,to one here in Dallas. I lost my seniority, benefits and my pay rate.I will have to start all over."
good,"The environment at UPS is very friendly and lax, especially as a driver helper, however there is still a lot of physical work that keeps you involved and stimulated."
good,"The job overall was great, fast paced, organized, you had to keep the packages organized as well. Friendly environment. The management was great and pleasant"
good,it helped learn how to drive a fork lift that i can use any where loader. the most enjoyable part of the job is learning new things and how to work well with others.
good,Kind of hectic  but with the. Team I had we got the job done we assisted others on the belt I was moving really fast start time was 3am some mornings till 9am depending on the packages and staff
good,They let you wear headphones which that is a critical part for me they dont have a dress code and is a great place to work at in overall I had a lot of fun working there.
good,I was in supply chain solutions and enjoyed the environment.  Everyone was like family.  I enjoyed my time at UPS in both Iowa and Texas.  I also enjoyed the wonderful benefits.
good,UPS is an awesome company to work and they pay very well. The benefits they offer are great and you will always be presented an opportunity to work overtime if desired.
good,A great place to work. Colleagues and customers were easy to work with and relate to. Management and owner were always available and extremely helpful.
good,UPS is great for everyone with an open schedule. People can build a career off of UPS and live off of the benefits brought on by it. No education is required to work there so it can be long term.
good,"The support staff dose there job very well. the team mebers work as one big unit to get the trucks loaded and out the doors. one day could be unload to a line,later could be organizing back of trucks.They give you opportunity to get more Hours But you have have to a bit flexiable."
good,"I would have loved to have been able work harder and become a driver . However, that is when they found the mass in my head. I spent 2018 and part of 2019 healing from it.  Today I am fine . Mass is gone. I have no other issues."
good,My only complaint about Ups is management will flat out lie to you straight up.not sure why but they do and wlll often. Other than that it's a great job . You do work hard .but hard work never killed anyone
good,UPS is a great warehouse job. When you work at UPS make sure you are just going to leave for the cool weather in the hot weather  The managers are not very on your schedule the managers are kind of mean but the balls they are very nice UPS is a great warehouse to work at a great company
good,I live the job I'm doing right now. I go in get to work and get it done. Days over by 10 am. Benefits are great and they really help out my family and myself. The people are great too. Very helpful for me even tho I'm not new to the company. They are still willing to help out when some gets behind
good,Very good company to work for. The benefits are great and the folks are good to work with. The culture of UPS is fast paced but the training is very good.
good,I learned so much working at ups. Sometimes if we did good we got pizza or chicken for lunch and sometimes get more time for lunch. I learned how to talk to people and how to handle packages.
good,"What a great role and opportunity. People were very friendly and taught me well. I was my own boss really, but I work well like that. I kept pace and enjoyed the perks of working outside during the holidays."
good,"Very fast paced job and need to have strength to lift heavy objects. A good job to have when you aren’t busy throughout rest of day. Would recommend to anyone. Would have loved to stay if the hours worked out for me. Loved the job. Taught me many life skills to help with future jobs such as time management, neatness, and strategy skills."
good,"UPS is very labor intensive job...but the offer many options, tuition help, health benefits...I could go on but overall it is worth the time put in..."
good,Enjoyed fast pase enviroment. Pay was fair. Need to have a little more organized scheduling of seasonal workers schedule. Had to wait on a call when to work everyday and sometimes they would forget to call.
good,Delivering packages doesn’t sound fun until you get to experience the joy you bring to a customer. Pulling up to a customer who was waiting on their item they purchased and seeing how happy they are makes it all worth it.
good,Alot of trainng to under go must be willing to accept changed and ajust freqently to new things theres alot of audits . Salary based pay of 27.50 hours a week / weekly pay
good,"After 5 year in the company , I had my ups and down thru out my years here but always kept in mind that sticking here will be worth the wait , now about to drive after 5 years . Now the wait is worth it I can tell u , over all u work with great ppl , my main goal was to become a Ups Driver"
good,I live the people and the job wish I was still with them but it’s seasonal for driver helpers but I would love to come back and work for them again as a package handler
good,"It’s one off those places where u have to be a pusher and driven, you are working in any environment with regular people they do regularly stuff good and bad so always be cautious. Down side is if u get taken on permanently you go back to the start salary which is in the teens"
good,Start time depends on how many trailers have to be processed for the morning. Varies anywhere from 230am to 400am and the shift typically ends around 9am. Teamwork is a must to lighten the load on everyone. Everyone gets along well. I lost 20 lbs in Less than 2 months due the physical nature of the job. One of the few part time jobs that is unionized and 100% free health insurance after a year.
good,Its a cool job if your a student. It’s a good first job. Paid holidays week vacation and dental insurance after a year. Not climate controlled. Very physical.
good,"UPS has great benefits and I encourage any student to get help with their education. The work is tough hot, cold, several options once you get some time in. I was in the IT Department but still worked in the warehouse."

good,"Ups was very fast paced which I liked , kept me busy throughout out the entire shift"
good,To call it fast paced isn’t even a good start. Everything is always tome sensitive but they pay you competitively. Only left due to moved out of state for my kids.
good,Management really don’t like the employees because of the union and the pay but overall great place to work management sometime treat you like a child but it depends on the manager work is easy oay is great and benefits are amazing
good,"I enjoyed my time working there, it was only a seasonal job though. It was fast paced, which seemed to make the day go by fast. Nice people, good atmosphere."
good,I really miss working at this company. This is a great place to work. I made really good money. The hours were consistant and I had weekends off. They offer some awsome benefits packages and they pay for your benefits. The hardest part of the job was constantly stacking up heavy packages. The most enjoyable part of the job was my coworkers. I had some awsome team members.
good,"I enjoy my time at UPS. It is tough waking up early at first, but over time it gets easier, that is if you go to bed early. The work is honest and if you don't give it your full effort it shows."
good,"Fast paced job of high physical exercise"
good,Wish I could go back but no ones gotten back to me yet so I’m it’s time I stared looking elsewhere. Hopefully they’ll contact me in the future until then I’m looking to find a place that pays the same or more to help provide a home for myself.
good,everyday a pleasure to be working in such a fast paced enviroment and being able to work with so many helpful co-workers and managers luch breaks are a delight being able to stand 10 hours
good,Great management! Fast paced environment that keeps you busy. They are very flexible with hours. Colleagues are easy to get along with to help get you through the day.
good,"Fantastic company offering lots of support. Long shifts, hundreds of packages, never the exact same route. Wonderful compensation, plus paid in person every Friday."
good,Was a seasonal personal vehicle driver for the Christmas holiday season. I was always kept busy and on the move. If I get done early my supervisor would have me help out another driver in my area.
good,"It can be a busy environment with a lot going on, but it is a simple job. Generally the people there are great to work with and make the shift go by faster. As long as you come in ready to work with a good attitude you will have no problem at all working here."
good,A lot of overtime mostly in Christmas time. Good money. Super fast job good co worker's. Working from earli morning to late night. Always theres was work to do.
good,Miss it badly. Needed out of Cali.. Great place to work if you don't mind working. Just like anyplace there are whiners and people who don't realize how good they have it.
good,"Cut breaks"
good,UPS is an excellent company with a fast pace and a hard working team to sort and get packages to the right people. I enjoyed working for UPS because it was fast paced and no day was ever the same.
good,"If you want to work at the UPS store, you should have, of course, basic skills that all retails jobs need, like basic math, people skills, good customer service, and a friendly attitude."
good,Very organized business with great management and opportunity for climbing ranks in the office. very good communication in a hectic work environment. Can be very fast paced at points in time.
good,"too much lateral moving, not enough advancement, management seems to be centered on themselves and how can they enrich their stock holdings. too chiefs not enough braves so to speak."
good,UPS in Qatar is now under Gulf Warehousing Company and was use to be under Gulf Agency Company Qatar which is one of the Biggest Shipping and logistics company in the Region.
good,"I got the chance to interpret multiple different helpful job opportunities while working for the UPS company. For example, by being given the chance to become a driver’s assistant, I improved my organization skills including knowing how this company’s work system keeps on track in order for the company to continue to become successful."
good,It’s a lilttle fast paced at times but over all it’s very relaxed and you have plenty of time to do extra things to get your job done a little faster.
good,I appreciate the opportunity to work for UPS.  I have learned quite a few more job skills in my year working here.  I would like to advance in my position within the company.  I work part-time; but I am always anticipating the opportunity that I will be able to become full-time and advance to a Supervisory position.  I feel working as a team player is a major part of working at UPS.  I want to learn all aspects of my position and have the opportunity to learn other positions; in which I feel will assist me with career advancement.

good,"UPS hums right along through the holiday season by enhancing its workforce with seasonal additional staff.

good,"Inbound calls and outbound calls"
good,"I only worked there as a student not as a driver or anything, but it was a great environment and all of the people were very nice. We mostly packed boxes, shipped things for people, and printed things."
good,As a part timer you work 5.5 hours a day Monday through Friday. It is very fast paced and active so the shifts fly by. My manager is great. Very supportive and active in my learning new things. Hardest part ot the job is the hours. Adjusting to starting work at 3:30 am was difficult but manageable. Its nice getting out by 9 am so that I can have another job or the rest of the day to get personal things done.
good,The benefits for part timers at UPS are phenomenal. You get full time benefits as a part timer and that's pretty nice. The pay isn't too great and you'll often wonder why you're still there. But overall the benefits are worth the hard work.
good,UPSwas a very demanding company to work for but it was the only tubing I knew as I entered iIs culture directly out oF college.i am fortunate to have worked for a very promimemr company.
good,"There is no doubt that I worked harder at UPS than I did at any other job.  Management was mostly great, with a few exceptions.  The hardest part of the job was just the nature of the work as a loader.  Very fast paced.  The best part of the job was going home with the satisfaction that you've worked hard."
good,If you are looking for a Full Time Career this is it! you dont have to worry about hours because the work load is endless and you get the important holidays off

good,"I've been a Graphic Designer for the UPS Store and the UPS brand for the past 4 going on 5 years and have had ample opportunity to hone my skills in design, and customer relations. It has been a pleasure."

good,I wish that I was able to obtain permanent employment were available. I enjoyed the employee's that I worked along side and the satisfaction of the completed job at the end of the day.
good,"Job requires safe and timely transport of packages from hub to center. Fast-paced, safety-oriented work culture. Focus on safety and professional attitude required for success."
good,Only part time during peak season.  Loved the job.  Great drivers and bonus every week. It was the best job and loved the bonus weekly.  If you are looking for temp job Christmas this is the one.
good,Very good stable company with room for advancement. They primarily promote from within which is encouraging and gives you something to work for and look forward to.
good,"Heavy work, but I love my job. It is an amazing place to work if you enjoy hard work, & a heavy work out. Alsoust love all types of weather conditions."

good,Many opportunities for employees to advance or advance.  Best benefits in the job market.  Great place to work with many great fellow employees and managers.
good,"stressful, stressful This job cost me my peace of mind. I have no respect for this company on how they treat there employee's. No disrespect just being honest."

good,"Ups was great over. It had a great work life balance, and had a lot to offer it’s employees. Employees had a lot in the day of what they had and were able to do because of the union. I would recommend or work for ups again!"
good,"I worked as a UPS  Driver Helper during peak holiday season from December 2018 to early Jan 2019. This job may not be for everyone. However, my personal experience was great and I learned a lot in a short time. I worked hard each day and took pride in delivering packages. Be mentally and physically prepared because each day is fast paced while lifting and bending. Eat balanced and fuel up the right way so that your body and mind can thrive and focus.  If you are willing to hang strong regardless of inclement weather, tgen tou will succeed. The drivers appreciate and depend on quality help during the hustle and bustle season. Trust me, you'll earn a great amount of respect  from the driver. I have built good relationships with my drivers and keep in touch with them from time to time. They are always willing to put in a good word for good workers if you wish to move up or be considered for other positions after peak season i.e. towards spring or summer. *Must show up on time to meet your driver each work day. Don't have drivers waiting around for you. Also follow safety standards at all times *"
good,"Seasonal job. When you got called into work. You had between 1-2 hours to get into work. Punch in. Might had to wait for a hour or 2. For your truck. How ever you got paid for it. Now you got your truck.. Now you might have to search for your trailer"
good,"Awesome company - Hard Work - Good Culture - Staff initiatives- Great Benefits"
good,"Had a great time working there, the managers were friendly and productive. The training was easy-going, too. The only complaint I have is that I applied for a part time job but got a seasonal/temporary instead."
good,Had a great working experience at UPS the pay was good but the benefits were great you are apart of the union. I wouldn't recommend joining management as they are not union.
good,"Great experience working here , I worked in store and it was a good learning experience . They are great for a consistent job to keep if you know how to work"
good,"If you don't care about getting your hands dirty then you will love UPS. They will help keep you in shape as well as making you stronger, and make sure you are safe in the process. I honestly do like working here. The coworkers and Supervisors are supportive and understanding and will work with for any reason."
good,Loved it. I was a peak hire and after holiday season they laid me off...super bummed out. They kind of lead you on with false hope of staying on full time. But really you have to apply and or wait for a position to open and you dont start as a driver you start as a preloaded and work your way up and or get on waiting list. All after being a full time package delivery driver all season long....HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT
good,Enjoyed the fast paced working environment. I enjoyed the co-workers. The variety of duties and fast paced working environment made it never a dull moment.
good,UPS is one of the largest companies in the US that can give you a lot of opportunity. If you are hired there is a lot of internal positions if you would like to expand your career and get promoted.
good,"Busy,physically active,organized,team oriented,drivers were very friendly and helpful,the constant walking and exiting and entering the truck keeps one in good shape,pay was excellent."
good,MY experience as a seasonal loader was good work was completed and I was treated fairly with my time there . Very understanding and business forward people
good,"Hard work and fast paced. Short shifts, just part time. Very detailed work. Early mornings shifts, time to be at work changed quite often, great benefits and pay."
good,High paced and sometimes stressful especially during holiday season. Rewarding after working long days. The hubs are usually a disaster and management try hard to make sure drivers days run smoothly as possible.
good,Great job keep u fit n alert meet a lot of people fast paste bending lifting etc wonderful management methods  keeps u fit and active keep u alert and focus very fun friendly enivorment
good,I love the people and the work I do. I get paid to work out daily. Benefits are excellent and the job is what you make of it. Good if you want and poor if you have a bad attitude.
good,"I loved my job at ups, the pay was great, it was fast paced to where u would look and it would be time to go home.  My jib was temp but would had lived to be able to stay"
good,i liked working for UPS because the managers do not micromanage you or belittle you in any way. It is pretty laid back as long as you get the work done and assist your driver whenever you are needed.
good,Ups is a great job to work for.  They have great benefits and are team oriented. The only reason I'm looking to work a second job is bevause my hours are not as high as I wish they were.
good,"my work there was seasonal job.. But I would like to go back and work there as a full time job and start my shift at 3 am,  My work experience was good I learn a lot... thank you..."
good,",  I would never be bored always kept myself busy helping others as well as employee's.  "
good,"If you know what to do the job is not very hard, but not all people can follow direction. Definitely room for growth at a company like this. I would recommend anyone who has good people skills and is able to follow direction."
good,"At UPS, everyone puts maximum effort in their job. Having every one do all that they can to finish on time make you feel comfortable and encourages you to give it your all as well"
good,UPS is good place to work. I come in to work clocking . Than I go to my computer. The drivers drop off boxes than I look up address to se what is wrong with the address. If a customer wants to pick up the package I’ll look for it than walk it to the customer counter than I handed over their package to them.
good,Good company that pays decent money and fast paced. Off weekends and holidays. Drivers work long hours but are paid well for it. Seasonal jobs even pay $15 per hour.
good,I scan and load packages on the truck for delivery. I learned to be a team player. I enjoy interacting with my manager and co-workers. The most difficult part of the job is lifting the real heavy packages.
good,amazing potential for growth within the company many opportunities to advance within the company after being employed a set amount of time fast paced hard work very gratifying
good,short hours that doesn't have good pay for the labor required. Very nice and friendly people there. would recommend to a friend because this job requires manual labor and helps you workout (while being paid to do so) and improve your strength majorly.
good,Fast pace work environment not a job for everyone heavy work for entire sort but everyone works as a team to get the job done meet many great people team working skills are extremely needed
good,If asked to do something don't hesitate and wait to do it knock it out and keep going don't let what is being said to you hurt your feelings it is a business
good,A typical day Ups would be coming in early that morning discussing and going through the game plan for te day with the crew. we were then assigned trucks to load and scanners to scan and confirm the loading of packages.
good,"Great company to work for , Unfortunately It’s only for a temporary position. Wish they could hire more seasonal workers into full time regular employees."
good,I applied for a seasonal job and got an interview on the same day I applied. The hours are not steady. Shifts change every day. And pay is a not low for the amount of strenuous work we physically put out. But other than that I love my job
good,"Wonderful experience for me, owning a business is rewarding and fit nicely with our family priorities  It is helpful to be able to work on your own schedule and control costs"
good,I really enjoyed working there part time. It was very competitive to most people. You could get as many hrs as you wanted but too to long to move up in the job.
good,Every day is the same so after a while it gets boring but great company and great place to gain experience in the field. Management is on -point. Family oriented. The employees is the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"I used to find different trucks and put gas in them, and then run them threw a car wash and find out what spot they needed to be parked in, also cleaned out the insides of them"
good,Bonus adds to the job but its constant repetitive work so it is about your mindset. they allow you to move around if you work hard and put in your time.
good,Ups is a great job an I hate that I was layed off. People were great.its a pretty fast pace company but it's easy work an the drivers an management were GREAT.
good,"Ups is a very hard labor job. If your'e looking for hard work that's the place to go, just don't expect to get paid for the hard work your'e dishing out."
good,the hours are there if you want it but low payts a great place with an excellent environment and good co-workers that are always there to help you to improve. Good payments and benefits. It's a little bit stressful sometimes for the pay
good,"Training is top notch"
good,"I wish I didn't have to relocate. It is a great company to work for. It was more like family. People long for the financial security a company like UPS offers. Pension, 401k, life insurance on not on me but my kids and great medical benefits."
good,Ups was a fast paced work place. This position included loading and unloading trucks also organizing what is loaded. This position also included delivering packages
good,Great! I loved it the people are friendly and the vets try to make u feel comfortable for all working conditions. It comes with many benefits as well if you get on permanent
good,Delivered packages during the holidays. This was a temporary position. I have no complaints about the management team. I delivered packages out of my personal vehicle.
good,-Collected roll call and replaced whoever was absent that day to accumulate enough helpers for the drivers.
good,Good place to work to work great benefits decent pay. Nice job to get extra money on the side. Also very great management very helpful the whole ya through.
good,Problem is it was part time and after 5 years I needed more. Working from 3 - 8 every morning I was able to go to school and work another job but that gets tiresome. Would have really liked to go full time. Work with lots of people and use a variety of equipment as I worked at the airport.
good,"UPS is a great job , well paying. You will not have as much time for family as you want , but ""once you make book"" you get great benefits and a great retirement plan as well."
good,"The management at UPS showed its best to its workers by ensuring that all employees were treated properly and knew their role in the company. During the busiest time of the year, peak season, the management went all out giving employees coats, hats, gloves, and food during longer shift days. The workplace had a great sense of community. It was very easy to get along with your fellow co-workers."
good,"Working part time during highschool this job paid great and the work was hard but oddly satisfying. One problem is the ""part time"" hours you work usually range around 35-40 which might be a lot for some looking for part time work."
good,I love working at ups ..... Picking and packing was a lot of work but we had fun 😃😃😃😃😃😃 riding a forklift was a great idea got my forklift license
good,Stack the boxes in a layer so the boxes won't fall and make sure you can fit as many boxes as u can before the drivers have to leave at the end of the day
good,UPS is a place for young people looking for the wait time is money and at the same time to work with people in the youth that are looking to work people Within the youth too
good,Definitely a great place to work. You will put in 50+ hours but the pay and benefits are on par with the workload. You can advance if you have a degree but the pce for advancement can be slow.
good,"quick and past faced"
good,"Ups' work place culture was centered around a constant focus on time and excellent customer service. TIme commitment for all service levels was probably the biggest concern.   Being safe was also something that was a very big part of a normal work day at UPS. Getting hurt was not an option. "
good,"A lot of work but, i worked with some really good people. i learned how to interact better with individuals. also how to do each job better then the last time."
good,"Working for UPS was a great experience, as I was able to balance my physical and mental activity in the best way and earning many important   skills.It also allowed me to establish a bond of trust with the management staff."
good,"Ups has great benefits and great pay but it does wear on the body! "
good,"Well what a place,sure I love it....now they need an essay to compliment them. Probably shift but who cares..,,😉😁,😞😅😅,,could have paid 14quid hour but the pay is good ."
good,we would have a 10 min break threw out the whole day. It was a great place to work. Everyone was friendly  and helpful. I would tell others to work there.
good,This was one of my best jobs I’ve ever had but it was only part time you have to put a lot of years in to get something out of it but all around this is a great job
good,I'm glad I've had the opportunity to work at UPS It's a great place to work. I started in 1993 where I learned many aspects of the company.  I will retire from this company.
good,UPS is a great job I have benefits and a lot of training that I can use on other jobs I just wish it was a full-time job UPS is not for everyone the job is hard at times hot noisy but it's the only part time job that I know that has benefits Medical 401k vision Dental and paid vacation
good,"Loved the job, loved the work. Had to leave due to relocation. It broke my heart to leave. Great team work, great management. Fast paced environment which made the day go by quick."
good,The UPS Store is an overall great workplace. As a student it is hard to find a full time job that’ll accommodate my schedule. THE UPS Store has made it a great experience for me with relocating and even making my hours flexible. I’ve also grown in computer skills which is a plus for me and the degree I am pursuing.
good,Absolutely amazing place to work. The owner is the boss and works along side his employees. If the distance (70 miles one way) didn't get to me I would still work there.
good,UPS is a great job. You go home feeling like you've accomplished quantifiable physical labor. The people are very friendly and understanding of each other.
good,Working for ups is great is an amazing company and weekends are days off. Is tired but is totally worth it the paid is fair and overall is was a great experience. And is a weekly paid job is great.
good,"Since working there, what I enjoy most is the interactions with my peers. It is a pretty friendly environment where everyone gets along and willing to help others"
good,"This is not a job for just anyone. My family has been with this company for year. I love my seasonal position at UPS. Pay was amazing, I was treated like part of the team as soon as I was hired in."
good,"This a perfect part time, seasonal job. Pay was great for the job and location. Didn't have much interaction with management after being hired, I just met the drivers at the base and helped deliver packages throughout the holiday season. Only down side is that they call as needed. Would be hard to have additional jobs."
good,"I loved this job I just wish they offered more than just part-time. I met a lot of awesome people. I loved that you could wear whatever you wanted to work, but since you were working in a warehouse it was important to wear breathable clothing and drink lots of water."
good,"Enjoyed my time there, but went back to school to try and pursue a new career path. Typical day starts early, have learned everything in the last 13 years that pertains to a major logistic provider. Management was good. Culture was good. Hardest part of job is very fast paced and physically demanding. Most enjoyable part of the job is my co workers."
good,Ich kann diesen Arbeitgeber nur weiterempfehlen. top
good,I really love what I am doing just wish it could be done in a normal work week. Worked well over 60 hours per week.  Also wish there was a more formal training.
good,"A typical day of work consisted of opening the store, opening the cash registers, checking the computer for print jobs, printing, shipping packages, packaging items to ship, handling customer complaints and concerns, tracking lost packages, initiating claims for lost or damaged packages, selling boxes and other retail items, opening mailbox accounts for customers, forwarding mail, taking inventory of supplies, training new employees, greeting customers and attending to their needs."
good,Unfair HR practices. Doesn't go by their own EDR guidelines. HR doesn't listen to the needs of their management employees. Many issues arise and HR looks the other way
good,Cool job you can go up in the company teamsters for life baby lmao cant wait to return make that good money ups is a good company to have under your belt
good,Ups was a great job. I learned a lot about that field of work and leadership. They taught me how to manage a variety of different people. Time management was key in order to keep up with the fast pace of the job.
good,I loved working at ups yes it was a paid workout but the money helped me get alot of much needed things that i needed and wanted at the time really wish i could work there again
good,"If you are looking to sit on your butt and make a pay check. Then don't come to work with UPS. You are going to work hard. And you are going to sweat. "
good,I worked long hours but the pay was good and the co workers were good. Lunch breaks lasted an hour but were sometimes we would just skip lunch so that we could get back earlier.
good,if you need temporary work being a truck loader is a great thing. you are paid well however you have to be able to keep up with the extremely face paced and organized system. also it is a great workout but try not to lose too much weight. a lot of the packages are heavy but you can get help with moving them
good,"My employment with UPS was only seasonal, but I did enjoy the time I had."
good,The shifts are short but the benefits are premium. It does not pay enough as a part-time employee to raise a family but a great addition to another part-time job. The schedule is set and every weekend off which is really nice. A great company to move up with and stay with for many years.
good,"Great company I love UPS but the management is weird, very competitive and vindictive. Working there is like a work out at the gym, the hours are short but great benefits."
good,"Fast paced work environment. Worked on a loading dock, along side a conveyor belt, assigned to certain trucks that we would load with the packages that came to us down the belt."
good,it is a cozy place to work in with employees who will treat you like family. They will help you with your problems and they will always greet you with a smile
good,"Overall UPS is an outstanding company to work for. They offer great benefits after the first year of employment at no cost to their hourly employees. The hourly pay rate in most states is very competitive. "
good,Everyone from the HR secretary to the janitor was a delight. Just seemed like one big happy family working together towards the same goal. Much respect
good,"I started at UPS because I was going to school and needed help paying for it. UPS has not only helped me with paying my tuition but has taught me much more than I thought I would have. This job, however, is not for the faint of heart but if you have a good attitude and are a strong, capable individual both physically and mentally then this job is perfect for a career or as a stepping stone onto what you are really wanting to do. Right now is the time to get in."
good,"Ups Is a Great Company To Work For. "
good,Ups was fun i got too meet some new people that enjoyed my company. The work was easy I got offered a part-time supervisor job so with that being said the opportunity too move up is at a high rate if your a hard worker . Your work don’t go unnoticed.
good,"UPS is a great company to work for, you have your good days and bad days like you would at any other company, you can advance if you would like and the benefits are good."
good,"Great environment, Great people, Good management, Great opportunity. Would definitively recommend to anyone looking for a job with opportunity to advance in"
good,Working at ups I've learned a lot about mail how people get there mail putting zip codes together for the mail to be shipped to the right place sending the mail out on the trucks to different states an countrys
good,"A physical, fast-paced position that involves continual lifting, lowering and sliding packages that typically weigh 25 - 35 lbs. and may weigh up to 70 lbs."
good,its a decent job but its not something i would rely on or keep as a permanent job. the management is a joke because anyone can become a supervisor within a month or two after innicial employment
good,"Work with small businesses to help them grow.  Learned how to get a better understanding of a companies order to cash cycle. Management and supervisors tend to micro manage a lot.  A lot of negativity.  Luck of the draw for your patch, you can be a good ISR but have a bad patch and lose money on your bonus check. Most enjoyable part is being able to help out small business owners complete their dreams."
good,Great place to work and to move up at the start of your work experience part time is great so that you may continue your education if you would like to
good,Everyday you’re doing the same thing. Working a sweat and in hot conditions. However you are being paid fairly and if warned of these climates.  The team is great and productive.
good,i learn that you have to be on time to get a bounce is your late you dont get any bounce point. the day at work is mostly friday and monday time is morning for part timers
good,"A typical day at work would be unloading or loading semi trucks for 3-5 hours a day.  Its pretty fast paced, but once you learn the pace, its fairly easy"
good,i performed several jobs duties  that include  processing  incomeing stock and materials picking and fileing orders from stock packing and shiping i didnt fill i got paid enough
good,UPS Freight is a high paced place to work. Teamwork is essential to meet goals. daily pre shift meetings help with daily objectives. communication between managers and supervisors has room for improvement.
good,"I really enjoy working here. The people are great to work with and for, however; it is a lot of lifting and bending. It is not a job for someone who cannot be on their feet all day or bend and lift all day."

good,"UPS is an excellent organization to work for.  They're  extreme professionals who focus on safety, customer service, and professional courtesy.  UPS provides excellent benefits and valuable experience and training.  A typical day at work requires thorough attention to detail and safe methods, policies, and procedures.  The hardest job part of the job is the pace, and package count each driver is responsible for.  The main focus as a worker is safety.  The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with customers and building repore with the community."
good,"working at Ups is challenging in the beginning but after a while you get used to it. If you are looking for money asap, Ups is not the place. Ups is a great job for long term. Work as a team is really needed."
good,"working UPS is a job you  have to want to do. You just come to the job and think its easy,its not. also have to be a people person. you would be dealing with people everyday on a daily basis."
good,"A typical day at work is generally low stress with the customers, I learned a lot on keeping groups of customers moving rather than having them stand in line for long periods of time (workplace efficiency)"
good,I worked in a warehouse. It is hard labor but it’s simply putting boxes onto a truck so it’s easy money for the physically fit. It didn’t work with my school schedule for spring semester so I only worked seasonal hours.
good,"I worked with UPS for only 8 weeks. I enjoyed it and recommend it for a full time temporary Seasonal job, I worked as a Delivery Helper. Being able to handle the elements is important in this position."
good,"It's a very good company to work. It's is a good part-time job for students. They will help you with your college career also. For a person looking for full-time, will take years to achieve it."
good,Enjoyed my time at UPS wish I could have stayed on but they did not have any driver positions available at the time. Management team was excellent and very supportive.
good,"UPS was a stepping stone. It allowed me to gain experience in logistics & manufacturing. Becoming a seasonal delivery driver granted me an experience that I fell in love with. Being able to talk to customers and maintain business rapports daily was satisfying to me. Driving all day was relieving. However, I worked harder than I did on any other job I maintained. This job also helped me to stay healthy and in shape."
good,I really enjoyed working as a seasonal employee at UPS. They paid for me to go thru a drivers certification course and put me up in a hotel while doing so. It was a great place to work with excellent pay.
good,un settore basato sulla velocità e la puntualità e questa azienda ci riesce molto bene
good,I have had  GREAT TIME working there and would recommend people to work there. I tell any one if you like to work hard that's a great place to work for

good,This was a laid back place where the employees had fun doing their job. It was hard work for rewarding to get the job done with your co-workers. Fast paced but not stressful.
good,High paced environment as deadlines and deliveries are time sensitive.  Management is respectful while knowing when to push the pace.  Strong work ethic is rewards with advancements.
good,I liked working at this company because it keptvme thinking and taught me how to deal with different personalities. Working at ups has helped me grow and showed me that when things get tough to take a step back and re-evaluate things.
good,Great organization to work for if you're a driver and in the union. The union back you as long as you're paying your dues.  Great benefits and retiring pension.
good,This job was a nice steady first job. It had a good management along side with decent co workers. There was good communication as well as new opportunities to learn different set of job skills.
good,I would be stressing out because I am always working hard and I am the fastest as well. I sometimes call in because the stress would be to much because everybody excepts me to do all the work while the rest becomes lazy
good,I worked seasonally but a Good place to work. someone is always willing to help if you have a question. sometimes working till 12am every night during peak is rough but good money!

good,united parcel service is a productive workplace to move higher on a career scale and learn alot about the industry in which you are apart of. united parcel service is a fast paced environment with benefits and great pay
good,"I worked as a Driver Helper and had the best time. My driver was great and we worked timely. It was just us two throughout the day, but nevertheless. it was fun. The only hard thing was carrying the boxes if they were too heavy, but even at that I wouldn't have called it hard. I think the only real hard thing that I couldn't control was when we couldn't see numbers at night or if they were hidden behind trees."
good,"I hated to leave UPS, but going full time was one of the hardest things to do at the company. I enjoyed the fast pace working environment and I also loved taking on a lot of responsibilities. I would gladly work there again if given the chance."
good,a great place to work at if you like long nights no sleep hard work but it was fun just keep in mind there are alot of people there with the seniority aspects about them so if u mess up they will always take the hire ups word over yours so stay to your self work hard
good,"It was a great overall experience, I enjoyed my co-workers and was often helped when needed. All management was professional and friendly. Although the breaks were short, it was manageable with the supervisors I was working with. I did see it as a challenge at the beginning because there was some things I needed to get down such as the safety precautions."
good,"If I was able to go back and start working there again, I would. But I was hurt on the job before working at UPS, so I couldn't finish. Love meeting people when I did and driving the truck."

good,"•	Manage units to various conveyor belts while communicating with others team members to ensure an efficient and effective process"
good,"I learned how to stack walls of boxes neatly. A typical day at ups is crazy and fast, you have to keep moving all the time. The hardest part about that job was picking up the really heavy boxes and stacking them."
good,You work hard and sometimes some long days but pay is good. you work your own pace but have to get your job done in the time aloud. people are nice and easy to talk to.
good,"I loved working for UPS. Unfortunately, it was a temporary position with no way of being hired. The people are wonderful. The management are very professional and very fair. They kept me busy and did not hesitate to answer any questions I had. If I could I would work for them once again."
good,"Fair experience at UPS, I learn a lot "

good,Honest Days Pay for an Honest Days work
good,"UPS is a great place to work, but it is a bit old fashioned. They have a lot of competitive benefits, but they also expect a lot from you. It can be very competitive to earn a promotion and you often will be expected to go above and beyond your regular job duties."
good,"At first your have to work your butt off doing manual labor to get your foot in the door. It is very rough, but after a couple of years you can move to a driver position that pays well. Career advancement is very good in this company."
good,"Open all international package invoices. Check to ensure all info on invoice is 100% accurate. Audit any mistakes, scan all next day,2 day and 3 day invoices for local deliveries. Wash and park trucks at the end of the night."
good,"If you like to move fast and work hard, UPS will give it to you. Everyday is different and everything is constantly changing. UPS is under union so if you worry about getting canned for somthing small, dont. The union provides a certain level of job security."
good,"At UPS, there is always to move up, and became someone different, you could start in unloading, and within a few months you could became a part time supervisor, or a driver, which most people try to go for."
good,"Although there were certain times of year when the volume of packages increased, everyone worked as a team to accomplish the days work. Supervisors communicated extremely well with what they expected and ways an employee could improve. The mood in the facility was generally upbeat and positive."
good,"Working in trucks unloading boxes for about 4-5 hours a day. The job showed me what I can achieve by being disciplined. Managers highly energetic finding different ways to motivated us to keep working. Warehouse type environment, hardest part lifting hardware most enjoyable part having someone to talk in the truck while working"
good,Fast pace exciting even though I was seasonal help the pay and bonus were good work atmosphere was great and co. employees very friendly and helpful. I had a good time working for UPS
good,Personally I really liked the company and it's policies with it's employee's. I don't think their is much they could change to make it a better work environment!
good,"I recommend UPS for anyone who can begin the process of getting hired-- either as seasonal or as full-time employee.  A typical day begins with a PCN meeting to address any concerns. I learned to simply work as fast as possible while remaining safe.  Management has a lot of responsibility, so it is in your best interest to support them well. Keep your nose to the grindstone and limit unnecessary interactions while working."
good,Drivers were all very friendly as well as office personnel loved the atmosphere work was very simple and explained in detail. There was nothing negative i experienced.
good,"It's typical to find yourself picking up and delivering packages and learning skills such as data entry. The staff was easy to work with and the management wanted and encouraged you to work. It was nice to get to see and learn about my area even more, enjoying the work of assisting customers."
good,"I would recommend UPS as a job but it isn't for everyone. You have to be organized, listen, understanding, and you never know everything so always ask questions."
good,I really did enjoy working here. The atmosphere and people I worked around made it very enjoyable. The work is very fast paced and long hours go into working with UPS.
good,"UPS is great company  to be a part of, and to work for, it's  a fast paced job.They teach you about safety on the job, they also trust you too do the right thing even when no one is around."
good,You will lift alot and be sore. The pay is great and you can earn overtime easy. You don't get many breaks and you will sweat your clothes. The people are great and very friendly
good,The company knows how to recognize the hard work. They give you the opportunity to move up. Also the managers are very responsible and it makes you want to work even more. They encourage people to work their best.
good,"As a package handler, you spend a lot of time lifting boxes that weigh up to 50lbs. This is a fast-paced environment, and some of the positions are NOT for the faint-of-heart or faint-of-muscle. The best part of this job is you're hardly ever left with nothing to do, because management tends to time the shifts so well. The worst part of this job is what time I wake up (1:30AM; Yikes!) and that you can come home physically drained."
good,"Really enjoyed the time I had working with my driver.     It was fairly active and physical type of work in all weather conditions.    I was told it was supposed to end on January 15th, but immediately after December 25th,  I was no longer needed which was disappointing to me since I was hoping for additional hours to meet holiday bills."
good,Great place to work if you like to make money but it does it facture family life because you are working 40 to 60 hours a week to. Pay And benefits are excellent.
good,One had to load 3-4 trucks without error.  Too many errors would lead to termination.  Heavy lifting was involved.  It was a great workout.  Management was easy to work for.
good,"Fun place to work. Fast paced work environment. Only thing I didn't like was all the dust, it gets everywhere. Really liked the driving and walking, if you don't like walking this job is not for you."
good,The hours were good.  The people were friendly and gave constructive criticism.  The customers I encountered were friendly and the time alone was very refreshing.  The road conditions were not always the best due to winter conditions.
good,I liked working here people where nice and understanding. They did not offer paid vacation. Pay was ok for young people who are just looking for a parttime job.
good,"Organizing your detailed duties from the Supervisor. I achieved my goals from veteran workers, by observing the work environment and time management. Team work was excellent and priority. The most difficult part of the job was securing the packages and safety for all employees. I enjoyed working with my co-workers and the days that I worked."
good,"Fast-paced, a lot to learn but you feel like you've accomplished a lot in a day's work. On your feet a lot, which is nice. Not a sedentary job, which makes it healthy. Fulfilling overall."
good,"The UPS store is a nice place to work at, its fun, relaxed, happt, and you learn a lot of things."
good,"love that job!!! great benefits,great partners,work Monday thru Friday.i strongly recommended for people want start a carrer!! leave because I move to texas!"

good,"Good place to work"
good,"Gteat benefits, good people to work with, good pay , benefits include vision, dental, and health it's free after first year, It'sa career not just a job"
good,It was a great job for the time I was working there. Being that it was only a seasonal job though had its disadvantages. I would love to find a full time job with UPS because they seem to be a great company to work for.
good,"It's pretty easy. All we do is drive to your house, find and scan which packages are yours, quickly and carefully carry your packages to the door, find a place to hide them, and ring your door bell. then we go back to the package cart and go on the the next house."
good,"A Great place to learn new skills and get hours, Managers need to be more organized and give hours to those that show up. Very fast paced at times and very thriving enviroment."
good,It's a great place to work at in the summer. Once it gets cold they don't have any heat source and you just freeze. They will tell you to get more clothes but if your like me you don't have $50 to spend on a new coat. Great pay and benefits. Some wonderful people work there.
good,I worked evenings for the busy holiday shipping season. It was a great job and I would do it again if they opportunity presented itself. This is fast paced job of unloading and loading trucks and sorting packages.
good,Not enough hours for part time.  Approx 15 hours per week.  Job was very hard.  Very labor intense.  Repetitive job.  Must lift up to 70lbs continually.
good,"Challenging place to work during the holiday season, but it is extremely rewarding. Seasonal management opportunities are a great position to gain exp."
good,"great job to work for those looking to make money, but dont want to be working 9 straight hours. job isn't a cake walk though, it requires a lot of heavy lifting. how ever that being said you'll always have someone with you to lend a hand, and vice versa. in my opinion the hardest part about the job was waking up in the morning"
good,"Internship there was very professional and you actually do real work for the company.  BIG emphasis on cost analysis and break-even analysis.  Always aim to optimize.  Pay is great for internship, but the hours are pretty rough.  Because of the nature of the industry, your day starts around 12pm-2pm and ends between 8pm-10pm."
good,"fun and exciting place to work during the holiday season . when I worked at UPS , I never needed a gym membership and I always had fun and enjoyed my time working at UPS."
good,I was a package handler and it was my job to load packages a a rate of 400 per hour. I wish I could say it was easy. I did enjoy the workout though...
good,"The way that the work is set up in the warehouse is made to be comfortable in your given position. If loading trucks, you can clearly hear and see the work load coming your way. If unloading trucks, you can expect a workload on par with your physical ablitiy. Managers are good at making sure you are trained well in your position."
good,"Great place to work as a student. Great benefits. Help you stay fit (lost about 50lb in a 6 months)"
good,"Friendly work environment, organized shifts, many opportunities available.  Helpful management.  Plenty of room for advancement.  Good place to learn teamwork skills."
good,"It was a good place to work, because everyone got alone with everyone. co-workers worked together to get the task done.They also help you get your CDL with their equipment."
good,"Very fast paced, but completely worth it. I tried for several years to check back with management to see if anything permanent had opened up...no such luck. I also worked there during the Christmas season in 2011-2012 and I came back down to the keys Christmas season 2014-2015 for 2 months to work this job."
good,I wouldn't pass up the opportunity to work for such a great company! timing was great hours where great for student which was my situation managers are great and people where good too.
good,"Great work environment. Training provided and opportunities to advance, though limited, are attainable with job performance and commensurate experience."

good,fast pace very easy job help assiting the driver you have to like to work in all type of climate changes learning how to use the rf gun making sure it was the right address and package
good,"Delivered packages to different business's and residential areas. I was a driver helper. I loaded the UPS truck when it was time to make deliveries. When we reached a location, I would deliver the boxes and retrieve signature if necessary."
good,it was an extremely easy job. all you have to do is help your driver deliver packages and sort through packages in the truck and provide the occasional directions
good,I was there for a long time but the time went by fast. The days were long but I was used to long days and enjoyed the team work. We were well compensated with overtime.
good,one of the best jobs ive ever had  I regret leaving  great culture great company  they care about their employees  good work  steady job not very stressful
good,"I was in charge of the customer service desk at the Silver Spring, MD UPS store. My responsibilities included getting the customers’ packages shipped to the right places and also tracking lost packages. My position required me to interact with lots of customers which taught me a lot of customer service skills as well as respect and honesty towards customers."
good,"The majority of my day was devoted to analyzing and updating data regarding the material handling equipment"
good,"UPS was a great place to work.  The time flies by due to the fast pace of work.  The day would start with a presort meeting.  Then a meeting with the package handlers.  Then about three to four hours of loading packages into trucks.  I learned time management, employee supervision, and proper package handling unload and load."
good,"The nice thing about UPS is how most days are diverse, your always challenged by customer requests whether it be packing an oddly shaped item to shipping something very valuable. The compan itself gives the locations great resources to help with marketing and training."
good,"Taking care of their internal and external customers is a priority for UPS.  It's a company you would want to retire from.  Family oriented.  It can be hard work, depending on your job description.  My job as a Data Management Supervisor is very easy and stress free."
good,I worked as a helper for the holiday season and it was great. I worked with several drivers and all but one were fantastic! They are super flexible and there are many positions to grow into at the company.
good,"very fast and it's part time, I'm looking for full time and more pay, some of the things they say about safety they don't enforce, I am in training and have been trained in haz mat clean up donning and doffing SCBA."
good,"At ups I learned to be more safe while working using eyes and ears   more. Lifting safety, Driving safety. A lot of lifting being done and walking. Dealing with customers all day so you will need some good customer service skills."

good,l’environnement de travail j'ai vraiment apprécier nous étions dans une bonne ambiance de travail l'équipe était motivé et sérieuse.
good,"i like moving all day, i dont like like just sitting around. so pulling boxes from one truck to a belt to another truck was alot of fun. being a driver helper was also alot of fun, because for 2 months you hang out with a guy that knows everyone...and everyone is happy to see you!"
good,"Although I was unable to work there long due to having to relocate across the country, my experience was positive.  I enjoyed the manager/owner and the others who worked there.  My hours were good for the time period that I worked there.  I received good training that helped me be independent.  The hardest part of my job was when the occasional person came in and wanted to do a transaction that I had no experience with, or so minimal that remembering how to complete it was difficult.  However, I did have another employee there who could help me when it was necessary."
good,"Clock in for work at about 8:45am every monday-friday to be assigned a delivery route for the day. I learned extensive driver safety for all types of vehicles. Also learned how to manage my time properly and how to keep my body healthy. The management team was very strict but fair as long as you take your safety training seriously. The hardest part of driving for UPS was delivering all stops within the estimated time given while following all safety protocols. The best part of the job is the great pay, benefits and the guaranteed hours."
good,I love the job it was truly and amazing place for me to spread my wings as a working man and learn what I am capable of  the work environment is great and the supervisors do the best to make sure you understand what you're doing
good,I begin work promptly at 5 and end around 9:30 or 10 pm. My experience is quite routine as I perform the same task of preparing international shipments for customs clearance. The workload is somewhat the same every day with variations of volume each night. I enjoy the teamwork and and challenge of working in a distribution center that changes in flow and personalities throughout my evening. The fact that the timing of the shipments all ends around the same time gives me freedom to pursue all of my various time constraints while also giving me an opportunity to work constructively and with purpose.
good,"Worked in the general office.  Overall it was an excellent place to work.  The people were the best part of being employed with the company for 19 years.  It's was unfortunate that my department was relocated to another state and well over 60 people were laid off.,"
good,"productive workplace.It keeps you busy so the time flies by as well. This jobs also keep you on your toes, because you never know what you're going to ship out. It's a pretty cool job."
good,"I only worked this job seasonal as a high school student, the pay was great for a after school job. Management was very understanding and always made sure my schedule would not conflict with my schooling."
good,Great company led by great people. Management gave great deal of advice during the completion of my task
good,I enjoyed working for ups as part of the management team I worked hard to meet deadlines an goals the hourly employees was great to work with I only wished that I could of made more hours there
good,This is the best place to work at I have so much funny here I recommend this place to everybody this is amazing work I got so healthy from his job and I'll learn so much about the workplace from this job I can't wait to find a new job to use what I learned at this job at the new job thank you
good,UPS is an awesome career to start if your willing to wait 3-7 years to go fulltime. But when the time comes it's the best job in the world. Job security is guaranteed with the teamsters union. The stock options are amazing and the benefits are the best around
good,A Typical day would be a face pace steady movement while working with boxes and envelopes. a lot of movement and lifting. supervisors will relocate you to other area in the ups air hub to help other supervisors when need be.
good,"I appreciate the hard, physical work & focusing on the route, DIAD, pkgs, etc. I used the driving skills learned last season, all year. Miss MY TRUCK!"
good,Great place to work. Atmosphere is wonderful and management treats you very well. Love and enjoyed the time I worked there and made friends for life. Greta place to start out your career.
good,While working at UPS they treated me very well. The people I worked with were all hard working and all managers to understand completely what they had to do. When given instructions they were always made clear and supervisors helped if asked by an associate.
good,Had troubles with the manager and after having a injury started losing hours and got no replies from him .............................................
good,"Just clock in, do your job and clock out. It's that easy."
good,It's a very laid back environment. The benefits and the opportunities for advancement are amazing!!! I enjoy the flexibility and they pay tuition reimbursement.
good,"UPS was a great place to get exp. with customer service. And learning to work with others and learn different tasks, this was not a career for me nor could be for anyone else."
good,"I started as a person who unloaded the trucks ,then I did sorting where you read where a box is going and put it on the right belt .Then I did the hardware run where I drove around the hub with stuff that could not go on the belts ,Ex , Tries ,cans of paint etc,"
good,"I love working with ups, I always said to myself while working there I wish it wasn't just seasonal. My driver was amazing. I learned how to use the ups scanner soon as the driver showed me. Some drivers tired to over work me and sometimes I always asked for more packages. I loved working with ups and I wish I can do it all over again/partime/ full-time. The hardest part was walking back to the truck with heavy items if the resident wasn't home and walking in the blizzard trying to deliver packages on time."
good,"As a package handler a typical work day was getting on the line loading multiple boxes onto a truck following safety guidelines, step, pivot, don't twist and how to lift objects properly. Management was Phenomenal. Workplace culture was great, co-workers always encouraging one another and reminding each other to stay hydrated."
good,I go in at 4 am Monday- Friday. I work very fast there. You can't slow down also you got to do more then one thing at a time. My management helps us a lot. It's very hot in there and the boxes get very heavy.
good,"This is a review for working at the Franchise the UPS STORE. Each company will be a different experience. Mine was nice because of managment but customers always thought of us as UPS, really i was a retail worker at what used to be called Mail Boxes Etc."
good,The work done with this company is physically hard but not stressful. The potential to grow is great and the benefits are excellent as a part-time employee.
good,U.P.S. has by far in my working experience the best benefits that anyone could offer. I'm a part time employee right now with full time benefits. Employee's are enjoyable to work with as well as management.
good,"It was a seasonal job, great experience. Good working environment and managment, very busy customer service and administrative job. A normal day  entailed answering phone calls and providing customer service and information."
good,"UPS is a company that will be around forever and a day. They are always trying to find a new and innovative way to do things, and are most of the time successful. Management is overworked and underpaid and don't have the union which in the long run is why they have such a high turn over in management. Union members get the best pay, best benefits and the most stability, but the job can be tough and management expects the best from you."
good,Unloaded trucks at  fast pace daily. This is an awesome job if you like a fast paced environment. Th epeople were easy to deal with and I never had any problems.
good,"I really enjoyed working for this company mainly because the benefits were great. However, the hours for unloading was something I could not get adjusted two. It was a good workout and the pay was decent. Wish I could have held on a bit longer to have been a driver."
good,"It was a part time job as i was going to school for massage therapy. Which i did enjoy this job,learned a lot about the workplace of ups. I didn't realize on how much they go through every night. The management there was good to everyone that worked properly and followed the rules. The only problem with this job was that it was very fast pace and easy to get hurt without proper body mechanics. I lost a lot of weight working here because of how much you move."
good,"Its a lot of hard work and you have to be dedicated, every job has pros and cons but overall its a great company. You just have to find the position that fits you best. It is not the job for everyone."
good,"UPS (Freight) is not like the UPS smallpack devision, its more stressful plus company never wanted to buy the right equipment for the job, but expect it to be done.."
good,This is a great company to work for with great benefits for a part time job. I would recommend this job to anyone looking to obtain a part time job with great benefits.
good,A typical day at work was organizing the packages inside the truck and delivering them to the doors of the customers. The hardest part of the job was the heat in the back of the truck when it was hot outside.
good,Très bonne entreprise réputé de livraison pour entreprises et particuliers
good,I had a very interesting position. Loved my work. Work environment was usually laid back. Got along with all. Account managers were very helpful persons.

good,"UPS is fast paced with a high process rate."
good,"I started with U.P.S. via an employment agency. The company was in the process of relocating and consolidating this end of this billing office. I started at 10 pm and stayed until all of the billing was complete, usually by 2 am."
good,Learned to work as a team. The most I enjoyed is unloading the ups trucks.the hardest part the heat. The culture was a learning experience. The management team was fantastic.
good,"job requirements done in a fast and timely manner"
good,They paid good and the work was the right amount of work to get paid for also. Only thing was a 30 min luch break but that never bothered me. I only left because it was seasonal only or else I would have stayed.
good,"I currently still work here. Hours that UPS offers are not more than 5 hours per night. I have the opportunity of working as a forklift operator, loading trucks, and scanning boxes."
good,"there are lots of opportunities here at UPS but the hours of work that i do currently don't really come into play with what i want. much rather be working during the day. overall, great benefits and a good place to work at for growth and opportunity."
good,"This job was seasonal, temporary. Every day could be different. I enjoyed the fact that the job was a physical one. Constantly moving, troubleshooting and assisting new employees. The ability to work outdoors was both the most enjoyable part of the job as well as sometimes the hardest part, depending on the weather. Learning new computer equipment and training new employees to use it was sometimes a challenge. I thoroughly enjoyed this job and working for this company. I would love to be hired on full time. It is difficult to get in permanently as the employees who are there never want to leave. Open positions are few and far between."
good,"Staff and management are high caliber of positive people that make a harder work environment(shipping) fun and pleasant to be at."
good,Co-workers are very friendly and helpful. Very well organized and great benefits as well as pay and flexible hours. Training is very detailed and keeps good employees safe.

good,"UPS, albeit temporary, is good for those who need to work nights/overnights. Quick paced, advancement possibilities, tuition assistance and equal opportunities."
good,"This was a part-time entry level job that turned into a great full time job. Store owner and manager were amazing to work for, it just wasn't enough pay at the time."
good,This job is fast-paced and you have to hit a certain number of production per hour. The employees are helpful and great to work with. The pay is nice as it goes up by a dollar every year that you are employed.
good,"The managers have bad attitudes. I would love to work here again but only if I could go to another location, cause the twilight shift managers were always angry"
good,"This job is for a very physical active person who can lift 50lbs consecutively. I learned that you always have to come up with a back plan just in case things get out of hand. Managers are great in assisting but needs improve on explain talking with workers. The job is very confusing at first but, very easy going after a while."
good,"The benefits and advancement opportunities are worth the stress of the job on both your mind and body."
good,Great place to work part time and a good thing about it is you have a paycheck to look forward to every week. Benefits are excellent and you will always be surrounded with positive energy.
good,"I liked working for UPS I took a lot of skills from."

good,"Good fun work, but low pay. The work isn't overwhelming and pretty laid back. It is fun being around and inside planes all night. The only bad thing is the pay isn't great. Would be impossible to live with this job alone."
good,"fun working which means time go by fast .I  learned that its best to work smart , instead of long and hard. management didn't fill us in what was going on at the end. the hardest part was  not knowing you getting laid off specially for something u could not control it had nothing to do with the work ethic. The most enjoyable part was working it was fun and you are exercises the whole time which i enjoyed."
good,"I assisted the driver in the delivery of packages. There was a lot of fast walking, which I love to run so it was a great fit. The position was only seasonal, and I was hoping to get an offer into the warehouse after the season was up, but it never came, that's why I rate job security so low. 2 months of work and then you're out."
good,"Time flies when you're working hard, UPS is the place for you if you like intense fast paced work. You get tremendous benefits from the union. I wouldn't have been able to have surgery without it."

good,"In my Two years working here, I have learned way more than I thought I would learn. I learned how to pack a variety of different things, ranging from a simple vase to valuable china dishware, to full-suspension bikes and grandfather clocks. I learned how to make business cards and flyers, as well as promotional posters and banners. The employees are very helpful, kind, and whenever I didn't know how to do something, they were willing to teach me the right way of doing it."
good,Great company to work for! A company where you could have opportunities to move around to different position. Also a company that is always concerned about safety and making it a priority.
good,"A great place to work! Great opportunity to advance. Good pay and great benefits. If you are management, it can be challenging to work with the unions...contracts and all that. If you are a woman, you work around all men and it can be hard to be noticed for more than just being a pretty face! You have to work much harder as a woman here to be given respect...especially if you are good looking but the opportunity is there!"

good,UPS is a great company to work for you must have great patient when it comes to job advancement because of seniority rights and privileges. It's a wonderful opportunity for a recent high school graduate or a college student because it's industry is part-time.
good,Fast paced loading and unloading of aircraft and trucks. Good opportunities for advancement. Must like working outside in the elements year round during the overnight.
good,"The work was not that hard to do. I learned how to load,  scan and unload.  This is a fast paced job as well. This job requires great physical activity. The hand on experience is well worth it."
good,The main tasks that are required of UPS store employees is to provide excellent customer service. Each day is filled with smiles and assistance to customers. Packing and shipping items is the main goal of the work at UPS store. It is very enjoyable to work for others and meet their needs. The challenges day to day include overseas and bulk item packaging.
good,"You Work hard, Union employees, Great place to work. Several customer interactions, Customer focused, well paid, Safety training and Compliance training. Self audits and action plans to meet goals."
good,"Happiness at this job really depends on where you are. I worked at three hubs and a good supervisor is really what you need. This job is tough and obviously very fast-paced but once you know what you're doing, it's worth it. "
good,"It was only a seasonal driver assistant job, didn't receive too many hours but that was expected. It was a very straight-forward job that kept me outside and moving, the drivers I had worked under were all very friendly and great at leading me."
good,I learned a lot being a driver helper. They have a hard and exhausting job but I wouldn't have it any other way. The benefits for employees are great and there is always room for advancement.
good,Ups has one of the best benefit ups help to get in school for free they pay you good great lead personnel they give every weekend off that most jobs don't give you
good,"This job is not for the faint of heart.  Its a physical demanding job. You may have to work odd hours.  But the medical benefits, 401k, and pension is awesome."
good,"Il lavoro era molto dinamico e l'ambiente molto armonioso."
good,Great job work while in school back in the late 1980's and early 1990's.  Pay and benefits were above average during this period; it is unknown what they are like today.
good,"I entered National Account contracts and addendums.  Also set up meetings for the Pricing Dept.  No problems with any immediate Managers.  Coordinated United Way volunteer day on a yearly basis. I also was allowed to tutor at our Elementary School which were very enjoyable.  The hardest part was not being able to advance without a degree when I felt I was more than capable of doing the job with my experience.  Workplace was very professional but as with all companies you had to deal with gossip, etc..."
good,"Though I was only a seasonal employee, I enjoyed my time working for UPS. My supervisor was supportive, my coworkers were friendly, and the working conditions were good."
good,Found it to be very interesting. All my other Co workers were very nice and very helpful. The job wasn't very hard the more I did it I got use to it so I am happy that I got the opportunity to work there.
good,Enjoy delivering packages to the customer learning the location. other drivers were friendly and willing to help. This is a fast pace enviroment when there is work
good,Great company to work for just wish they offered more benefits such as sick time and vacation time.  They Do offer health insurance which I am grateful for.
good,Great benefits little hours very flexible with time off and great with overtime hours things do however get crazy around holidays and warehouse goes from extremely hot to cold depending on the seasons
good,"Great Pay and management is really at your side and ready to help. There is a LOT to learn and pressure, however it it totally worth it. Where else can you make this kind of money without an education?"
good,If I had to do it all over again yes I would definitely still work for this company I've learned a lot have a lot of knowledge working in the transportation field. As they say it's not what you know it's who you know with any company that can get you to a better position.
good,The hardest part of the job is getting used to the work. Part time hours. Several different shifts. Good management and equal opportunity to move up. Fast pace.
good,"Place and Job you can grow in. Part time mostly. Three different shifts morning, twilight, night shift. Management usually on different page."
good,I loved learning a new trade through the UPS Store. The management was uplifting and always there to help when needed. I learned more skills in customer service than I had previous to working here. Glad to have been a part of a wonderful work team.
good,The management are very supportive on your needs and work related aspect. Good benefits but limited on work hours. They have full training about the jobs they can offer you and complete half day orientation.
good,"i miss it long hours but gratifying great atmosphere they show the most appreciation for there employees"
good,"A good place to work. Direct supervisors were great to work for, little to do with upper management. Compensation was not bad for a starting employee."
good,"UPS offers opportunities for anyone who is wiling to commit. They over part-time educational assistance, and advancement opportunities. You have to be willing to work and commitment."
good,very fast paised fun enviroment with great co-workers. Everyone is eager to help if you dont understand but its mostely very self explanitory. My supervisor always answered my questions to the best of his knowledge and very quickly. The hardest part of the job is some objects being shipped are heavy and hard for women to lift alone.
good,"Greatest name in delivery. Freight is handled with delicacy and efficiently. Amazing employee benefits and career advancement. Located in Elkridge, Maryland."
good,"Typical work day was 4-6 hours.  Pulling the packages off the conveyor belt, labeling packages accordingly and loading them into the designated trucks"
good,Great job as well good pay benefits great evirement friendly as wel hard work learned allot of new things I was a preloaded unloaded use to be a driver helper
good,I loved working at the Gulfport Ups. I was very interesting and I lost weight. I was a seasonal helper. I wanted more money so I also became a preloader. I loved working at Ups. I wish they could have brought me back on because I was and always a hard worker.
good,"Being your own boss has it's own benefits. Not much room for advancement. Great if you have good communication skills, but defusing customer situations on a daily basis can be taxing on the soul."
good,Enjoyed working for this company. Very professional work environment.Chance to grow at this company. Had a very good work experience with this company.
good,I really enjoyed working at ups. I LOVED MY JOB sad that they laid off allot of people.I would certainty enjoy working at another warehouse or ups warehouse. I had great supervisors they were awesome.
good,"The store I worked was privately, owned and operated by a family friend.  I worked there until I was able to find anthe job."
good,good place u work hard and that makes the day go fast i just worked with the driver but many people work inside so a good place as long as u can work fast in reading numbers and addresses
good,I enjoyed being employed. Great company and has lots of room for advancement.managers were great . they need more inprovement with payroll
good,"Working at UPS you will get a great work out in while working, can also listen to your music to make time go by faster and you get out standing benefits if you get in at UPS,."
good,"Great place to start an career in IT. I work at the Plesantdale location and have had a great career there. Not to say things are flawless, however with a goal and dedication people suceed"
good,The work and environment was for me personally a fun learning experience. I met a lot of people and management knew you by name even when so many people worked there
good,"Seasonal driver helper, package handling, customer service. Good in training in degree and certification programs."
good,"UPS has taught me more then I can say here. Its a No Nonsense 0 tolerance environment. If you are on time, you're late. Always be prepared to expect the unexpected because things can shift without warning. Patience and communication is Key and Teamwork is a Must! Employees here develop friendships very quickly because they rely upon one another. Organization, preparation, information, speed and efficiency is the name of the game. Technology now gives us the ability to be accurate and accoutable to our customers. One of the biggest things UPS has taught me is NEVER ASSUME ANYTHING and dont ever get comfortable. Use every minute to its fullest. Most of all.......The Customer has other options! The competition is ALWAYS lurking outside the door.  So don't give the customer any reason to leave...."
good,"I was hired shortly before the Thanksgiving and Black Friday rush in a large group of new hires. I was told to anticipate many busy hours and days full of work, with work weeks being an easy 40+ hours. I found getting more than three hours of work a day (average) to be difficult. "
good,"For the most part I look forward to going to work, and I fell it is an excellent place to work. I would recommend it to anyone looking for an excellent place to establish a career."
good,I would get on the job about 11:00 a.m. everyday and end till we are done with everything. Somedays we would be out till about 9:00 p.m. delivering packages all over the city.
good,"Customer service"
good,Delivering packages all day. The work can be long and at times hard but it can be rewarding. You get in good workout getting in and out of the truck and dropping off packages.
good,It is hard work but after your got to eight hour shift.  You feel like you just worked a whole twelve hours and it's satisfying.  It's not the best environment and it's probably not very healthy for your lungs.  But I'd give it a good review
good,Very much enjoyed working here. Great employees and management. The hardest part was the cold weather. Bundle up. Worked the evening shift it was nice to have the days off other things that need done.
good,"Although I was a seasonal driver helper, I enjoyed the fairly fast paced and invigorating work that came with being on the road delivering and picking up packages."
good,"Working at UPS I learned that if I work with other people the job will get done faster and better i loved working there, the management was great ...the hardest  part of this job is never give up on your self when the job get harder"
good,"This is a small franchised UPS store.  It has been a good work experience. I have learned new computer skills, I work with an amazing staff.  The hardest part of the job is the fact that there is no room for advancement."
good,"My job with UPS was a seasonal job. I hope they call me back as a permanent employee. Great pay, fun coworkers and the benefits are very cool."
good,This job is perfect for the seasonal position it is. i wish i knew about it sooner. They contact you extremely fast after you fill out all of the required documents. This job is not for people who are not in shape! Very simple instructions very east concept but the work is work. The pay is good but you will work for it. UPS times everything! keep up and you will be fine and there are chances for retention if you do a decent job. Be ready to work every day and never be late and you will have a better chance getting more work and possibly staying on the pay roll.
good,A typical work day consists of people dropping off pre-paid labeled packages for us to set aside for the drivers. Our other customers have packages that need to get to a certain destination so we make them their labels and collect the payment. I learn something new everyday. I love my manager who is also the owner. The hardest part of the job is dealing with angry customers who are not happy with the price of their label for their package.
good,"UPS is a very strenuous job though they offer many benefits. One of the most outstanding benefits at UPS is their superb healthcare options. Furthermore, because UPS has a union most workers experience great job stability."
good,"stocking packages in trailer, some heavy objects and different sizes, co-workers are hardworking people, night shift can be hard on body adjusting time"
good,I do not want to discuss any details pertaining to my position at UPS - you can view my ratings should you want an opportunity to work there. Best of luck.
good,"Data entry required perfection; less than 1% error and meeting a daily production quota.  For a responsible and reliable person, this is a great organization for employment.  Flexibility (working 3rd shift) was my initial draw to this position, but all employees seemed so helpful and pleasant that I enjoyed two years working through a placement agency as a temporary hire.  Except for the level of pay, temporarily-hired employees were treated as part of the group and were invited to partake in UPS events.  Because UPS prides itself in speed and accuracy (for tracking shipments) the employee has to meet accuracy standards (both quality & quantity quota) and a willingness to work longer hours in order to complete daily workload."
good,Good job but too much headache. The pay is excellent as well as benefits but you make your pay.  The supervisors can be a pain following you around and causing more stress.
good,Had lots of fun aiding the driver in delivering and pickup of packages during the Christmas rush.  Lots of fun interacting with the customers.  Good pay but this was only a temporary position.
good,"well every morning show up at work, greet coworkers, check manifests to see what was going on for the day, make some phone calls to check an ETA for some shippings, or find out where some orders shiped weare, the stressful part was missing parts in rush hours"
good,"i hope i can continue work at ups store, spend one of best  time of my life in those 3 years,"
good,"3.5-5 hour shifts, no real breaks except for bathroom runs, constantly on the go but a great workout, with an amazing benefits package"
good,Great place to work.  Good supervisors & work environment was pleasant. Great benefits.  Good vacation plan & extra days off!
good,"Working for this company from start to finish especially from the beginning days was a ""storm"". I didn't think I would manage something so frequent and competitive."
good,"PROS: Great starting pay"
good,i loved going to work at UPS. good job great people. very bad wages i had to leave not enough $$$$$. felt like being on a great team.
good,"Driving a UPS truck is hard work, very demanding time management skills. heavy lifting, pays well, outside work, for a self motivated individual, I got too old for that."
good,"I would deliver packages to doors for the driver. Sometimes help with finding boxes too, this was a great seasonal job the drivers loved me and always requested me!"
good,"Gerencia Comercial no Estado de Minas Gerais, abertura e manutenção de contas, soluções de problemas de cobrança, atendimentos de rotina (cotações/emissão de contratos), assessoria de importação junto a Receita Federal, etc."
good,great workplace excellent pay and benefits. you can advance your career. works is hard but rewarding. you have to deal with hot temperatures and confined spaces.
good,"good place to grow, but not for life-long people. Management is fair, Good co-workers that care. Family atmosphere yet maintained work ethnics, Alot of room for advancement, but not for the hard workers."
good,Easy work nothing too serious not the best job not the worst though. That branch in particular might be a little unorganized.
good,Meeting new people and getting to learn different states from different packages . Learning to work people. Learning how to transport packages . Fun learning to work the machines
good,"i loved working here, was very tedious work, but definitely was worth it at the end of the day. only during the winter you definitely want to bring lots of coats and jackets with you."
good,UPS they work you hard but the pay out is worth it in the end. It was a different experience for me when it boils down to it. It made me view working in a different light.
good,"A work day at UPS is very productive. You are constantly lifting heavy objects, loading and unloading delivery trucks. Only a person with a desire to work hard can complete the day you cannot be lazy."
good,Ups direct is very small bt very productive company.every one is so friendly with our ceo also.its a very busy company any one can wish to work the.it has a friendly staff with our coe as wel
good,"UPS was great, a handy man's job fast passed on a busy day, friendly people to help all around, i really liked the job, i was a package handler all i did was load boxes in a 18wheeler, could be more, it depends on what day you working on, could be busy, could not. it was like playing tetris it was fun, they got more positions such as driver,loader, unload-er, and others."
good,"Without exception, the best company I've every worked for.  Great people, great practices and philosophy.  Terrific management and a true people company."
good,"I enjoy working with my customers helping them to get their freight on time and with good rates. in this position area I do most of the process since approaching the customer to quote, rate, coordinate pick up and coordinate delivery."
good,"Good place to work very safety conscience, good benefits. Overall one of the better places I have worked for to date. Typical day at work consists of picking up load driving to destination, usually multiple stops."
good,the houres where long but fun the driver that I was on was great mentor and was patient and he was willing to teach and you had to be fast on the delivery overall it was a great job.
good,This is a great place to work if you can handle the heat. They have great benefits and wonderful help with college. You definitely get a work out while working there.
good,"I love the company. It is the best decision I ever made. The culture is an older culture, but they are becoming more and more modernized."
good,"Through my years at UPS, I have learned a variety of positions/skill sets.  There is always room to grow with the company.  The health insurance provided is better than many other insurance policies."

good,it has a very good and safe working environment as well as great co workers. I was there for a year and loved it! The management was good with a lot of knowledge
good,"The most enjoyable part of being a Safety Supervisor at UPS is the people. Getting to know and connect with the drivers and the inside employees is a great thing. I also love being able to make inpact and their daily work lives and home lives, "
good,UPS pays great but it is very hard work. The job is part time but there is almost always the opportunity for overtime. Management is looking for employees that are ready to work safe and fast.
good,"Working for UPS has been a really enjoyable experience. I love the people I work with and for. Being able to manage at UPS has given me the ability and confidence to be able to manage anywhere else I go. The only downside to UPS is the union. The union protecting the jobs of the people who shouldn't be working there and protecting the ones who don't care about their jobs. Instead of hiring people who actually need and care about working, we're saving the jobs of those who don't care."
good,"On a typical day I would take care of customers with their shipping needs or choosing a box option for them to take home. I would work on print jobs with different software’s. I would make post cards to posters or flyers of all shapes and sizes. "
good,"Great Management,clean environment, great location, friendly customers/drivers, like having route duties but everyday is still different.  Always learning something new or new ways of doing things."
good,"Ensure that my employees are working safely to OSHA regulations and are building walls properly to UPS load quality in each trailer. Also, verify each trailer, record employees stats, and conduct safety observations."
good,"I was with this company for over 10 years, It is an excellent company to work for. I had a lot of fun with this company and understood a lot of their procedures. I would work for this company again"
good,Easy day at work sometimes got difficult with head and volume of packages friendly co-workers and staff always took care of you
good,"for the position I had which was a temporary seasonal position, good hours, nice co-workers work hard.  Met many types of people, have good communication skills with them.  position entailed always moving quickly with deliveries so can meet up with driver."
good,wonderful company with diverse and friendly staff. I would love to have the seasonal position year round if available. Hard work is not so hard with team mates and managers at UPS. I am able to say I enjoyed my hours put in at that company
good,"A day at work can be really fast pace because I have to load four trucks by 8:30am. Sometime with the management that don't give us a correct start time or that we get understaff it gets more wild. We still get things done, but co-worker are friendly and helpful."
good,Overall we had the same routine I delivered to the same houses every day on the same route. It was definitely a different experience. Im all for broadening my work career. I just dont recommend working outside all day.
good,If you are going to school and looking for part time ups if the place for you and if you want to become full time you have to wait for a long time before you can get on.
good,"The Job Was temporary.I enjoyed the change of atmosphere and job duties.The constant movement can be tiring, but Its a great opportunity."
good,Working there is easy you get trained but its repetitive work and you do not work weekends witch it's good for who don't want to work weekends . They start you off with a good hourly pay but raises are great. Fridays you get catered food for all.
good,"Working primarily in maintain and a development a 10m territory (north east) in  sales in Puerto Rico. "
good,"While the pay is great the work is demanding. They didn't get the name ""the tightest ship in the shipping business"" by being timid."
good,"Day to day I help customers with packing and shipping needs as well as printing anything from basic copies to designing flyers, invitations, banners, etc. As well as cleaning, restocking, and general keeping the store organized and in order."
good,"Excellent company, great benefits! Exciting to work for but very hard to get full time employment. Part time jobs are fun and supervisors always have a good attitude."
good,"A typical day is checking to see if we have all that we need at the store , Counting the tills and opening the store. Helping customers with any problems such as printing, scanning, shipping packages, Creating designs, placing clams, getting any projects done. The Hardest part of my job was keeping my mind off everything that needs to be done."
good,A typical work day included  but was not limited to package loading and unloading customer service and a lot of walking people were very nice and trained very easily
good,I was just seasonal help. Co-workers are vey nice. Good place to work if you can get on full time. Good pay. Long hours. Would like to get full time but there is a long wait for delivery drivers.
good,"UPS was the best employer I've worked for so far. The company pays well in exchange for an honest days work. Some of the younger guys would complain, but I've noticed that among millennials. The only thing I did not like about the job was knowing that I would be most likely laid off after the busy holiday season. If I had it my way I would still be delivering packages."
good,"up load and down load of air craft, jet fueled air craft, assisted captain and crew. supervised 20 plus employess, and safty around aircraft."
good,I love working for u.p.s. ! they also have benefits for there employees. The pay was very fair. Management has everything together. People there are very helpful as well.
good,"Nice, wish I could have stayed longer."
good,"Working for UPS was very eye opening for me, it allowed me to get a real understanding of real jobs out there and I'm glad I got the chance to work this hard. It pushed me to my limits even past my limits and I in turn realized more about myself working under circumstances I was faced with. I am a very hard worker and I tackle things that seem to challenge me. Even if my hands are full and I see my co workers are struggling a little more than me with these packages that wont seem to stop coming down that belt, I go and help in any way I can."
good,Work is demanding and fast paced but fun and interactive. Co-workers have integrity and watched out for me. Down side is having to work in all kinds of weather.
good,"Loved the job and my co-workers! Am a seasonal employee, but would love a permanent position. Job was fast paced and challenging. Co workers were great to work with."
good,Our starting work time was at 9 am. We would all meet for a morning briefing which took about 10 minutes. then we would get our package scanning machines ready that would tell us our routes. After we got our machines we would locate our delivery trucks and go through them for any wrong loaded packages inside the delivery truck. After that was done all drivers would leave the facility to deliver on their established routes.
good,This position was only a seasonal position. My responsibilities were to assist the Driver's with Delivery during the peak season.
good,"I got on with all my co-workers and enjoyed the job. Most of the management team I got on with, and found the work fine. loading the 7.5 ton van on my own, on occasions, was the hardest part of the job as there was a lot of heavy parcels to load. the working hours were good and opportunities for extra hours was ok."
good,UPS is a hardworking company. They expect the same from their employees. Safety is a big concern. All of their rules are necessary and simple to follow. I enjoyed working with them.
good,Great training and opportunities for growth. They want people to be outside sales representatives so if your looking to relocate to another state its perfect for you. Its hard to get local positions and its very political. Good Attitude will take you far. Be positive.
good,"At our local UPS facility we view success in terms of fulfillment and gratification – not just promotions and money. Sure everyone wants to be promoted. Everyone wants to earn more."
good,I loved working for this company. I wish it was still around today. It was a family owned business and I really felt part of the team even thought this was my first job.
good,A fast dynamic service business with constantly changing challenges and demands. I enjoyed the variety of tasks and assignments. It made everything interesting and the opportunity to continually learn and accept more responsibility.
good,"A typical day involved fostering and encouraging team motivation and cohesiveness for extremely fast-paced work flow."
good,Ups was very productive the employees where very nice and the managers where very helpful the job really wasn't hard . The only thing that i didn't like about ups was that we where only given one break.
good,"Early start times and non stop workout for about four hours. Sorting packages, unloading trailers and loading package cars. Do more before 8am than most people do in a day. Great benefits. Plenty of time left in the day for a second job or work around the house."
good,"A very busy company on a daily basis. Must continually multi task with various office duties, including answering multiple phone lines, faxing, maintaining emails and generating a number of reports. Must be able to resolve customer issues. Have to be able to communicate effectively with drivers as well as supervisors and managers alike.

Assure drivers are making their deliveries and pick ups in a timely manner and following all rules. Maintain a clean office presence.  "
good,You better make sure your physically fit. But that's one of the benefits. The job will keep you active. The environment is a little hectic. You stay very busy which makes time go by fast. The management are real good at training you and helping also.
good,"fast-paced environment"
good,"This was a great place to work at when I was in high school. The staff, management and owners were great! If I could have made more money here I would have stayed."

good,"bring your own lunch "
good,"Have worked for this person on 2 separate occasions totaling more than 5 years. Absolutely the funnest place I have worked so far, great  management, co-workers and customers. I would have to say the hardest part/times of my position would be the holiday season hours,  always go, go, go. The most enjoyable part of my position would have to be the hours and the steadiness of business. I really thrive on being busy always."
good,"Un día típico en el trabajo era llegar a las 9 am saludando y deseándole buen día a todos mis compañeros que me topara en la planta. Llegar a la oficina encendiendo la computadora que tenia signada, ver que pendientes tenía, llamadas programadas por mis jefes y quejas o preguntas de mis clientes."
good,"I started work off with what we called ""kick-off"" where I would let them know their goals and what was expected of them for the day. Then would update management of the progress throughout the day including the customer. I would ensure orders were being processed properly both on small pack side and freight side. I would try to create processes that would benefit the department."
good,Great company to work for with outstanding benefits. Excellent career opportunities. Excellent in house training through computer base training or CBTs.
good,"UPS is a great company to work for,  They have competitive pay and excellent benefits.  This is a company where you start at the bottom and have to work your way to the top."
good,Typical day here begins with group meetings on the day's objective. Everything is about preventative maintenance and safety. Very great company.
good,Very fast working environment with great support from upper management. I have learned a lot through out my years of employment and ready to share my abilities.

good,"You learn a lot from different people of different cultures."
good,I enjoyed working for UPS SCS as it allowed me to hone my project management skills and exposure to all the major industry sectors.
good,"every day was simple and i just clocked in, did what i had to do, clocked out and went home and i got paid really good for it. i recommend this job for Everybody"
good,"A typical day consists of accommodating the operation. Different questions and concerns people may have for HR. Also attempting to find people who are looking for that particular work. Phone calls, email blasts, etc. to increase applicant volume. "
good,"Fast peace place lots of driving with excellent customer service, work without supervisor, resolve issue, help customer, deliver on time, load and unload, maintain logbook and vehicle."
good,I have worked for UPS for going on four years. I started originally for extra income as a college student. Upon being hired I was informed of tuition reimbursement as well as the added FREE health care benefits. Since being hired I have fell in love with the company and its opportunities to advance. Upon graduation I hope to move into an area of my expertise.
good,"Was only at UPS for about three weeks or so, I just had to leave for health and school reasons, but the time I was there, the job was pretty good. Very nice guys to work with. You get yelled at constantly but it's only to break and motivate you. Some work loads I couldn't keep up with, tired me out too much with my health condition. But overall UPS is..pretty alright."
good,"A typical day at work includes very strenuous activities that requires a fast and motivated team player. Throughout it all I have learned to adapt to concurrent changing conditions precisely in a timely manner. Management gives opportunity to learn as well as lead you in the right direction. Co-workers are friendly and eager to help when assistance is needed. To people without perseverance, physical capabilities, or awesome work ethics this job will be very difficult. I enjoy the challenges. The most enjoyable part of the job is creating new experience outside of my previous job history."

good,"Working for The UPS Store was by far the best job that I have ever had, although the pay could've been a little better since there isn't any benefits that's probably the only thing that I can actually complain about. The management and crew are very understanding if you need time off for whatever reason they typically will make it happen. A typical day at work is helping customers whether it be with print, packages, or even opening a mailbox there is ALWAYS something to do so your day is never boring I learned a lot while working there they train you in a wide variety of things and if you stick with the company there is always a chance of moving up if your motivated enough"
good,"I really enjoyed working with the drivers at UPS. They are all really motivated and care about what they are doing. When I was working there I started with a driver who had originally wanted the person they had in previous years. I didn't know this and was switched to a different driver after several weeks. I was fine with it, but it was strange to have to break the daily groove I had finally gotten used to. I also got the chance to see how different each driver is, and how routes can vary a lot depending on how populated an area is."
good,The work is very easy to do yu can learn the job very quick. the people are very helpful there.i have learned how to process and handle mail. the coworkers there are helpful also an easy to get along with. the hardest part is that yu have to move really fast but once you learn the work its not so hard to move quick.

good,Great Place to work. They offer great benefits. The shifts are short but with getting off so early I have the whole day to take care of business
good,"I start work at 4:15am by ""pre-tripping"" the trucks I load. Pre-tripping involves removing any obstacles inside the truck such as a handtruck, stocking the truck with totes for next day air envelopes, and pulling any hazmat slips from the previous workday. After that, I pull packages from presorted bins and load them onto the trucks to which they have been assigned. I am also responsible for sending irregular sized packages along the ""irreg"" belt so they can make their appointed destinations. Most everyone I work with is nice, but there are some who lack motivation and proper work ethic. The hardest part of the job is the heat in Summer. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to temp drive in the fall and winter months."
good,"This position was valuable to me in that it fit my exact needs for a college job. I assisted local small business professionals as well as the general public in shipping and print services. Management changed over the years, and the owners were an enormous benefit to me learning great customer service tactics. My co-workers were extremely easy to get along with and we grew to become friends. The hardest part of the job was dealing with conflict, such as a package being broken. The most enjoyable part of the job was the laid back atmosphere, and the ability to solve problems for individuals."
good,"as a Seasonal helper ; you meet the truck On time . Buckle up because the driver knows their route and they are trying to get a lot done in the amount of hours available. "

Each day followed a similar path, with a notable number of detours for residential deliveries.  All I needed to know how to do was use the device I was given for scanning a package and obtaining a signature when needed. The hardest part of the job was simply coping with the cold weather."

good,I enjoy working as a team work. team work means thing can be done more effectively and productively. I am very flex able to work there.
good,"A typical day at The UPS Store would include; providing large and small format printing services to customers, processing shipments, packaging fragile & sensitive items to a shipping standard to ensure safe arrival, cash register work, processing mailbox agreements, and finally proving quality customer support to customers who may have had a package lost/damaged. Generally speaking, there would be a manager working mornings, with the rest of the staff working afternoons. There was never more than three employees on the clock at a time, and all of were equally qualified to help customers. The short staff would cause some headaches during  a rush, however that was easily the biggest woe (not too bad). The most enjoyable"
good,I give working at UPS 5 stars!!! I loved the fast paced work environment and the overall vibe of the workplace was pleasant and motivating!
good,"A typical day at work was shipping boxes for customers and scanning mail to be picked up that same day or the day after. I've learned to relate to customers from all over the world and to manage them according to company standards. Management was very professional and efficient, taking care of customer service. My co-workers were very helpful and very supportive in the work environment. The hardest part of the job was dealing with crowds on a busy weekend with short staff. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people everyday."

good,"I loved working for UPS! It was really fun and my driver was extremely helpful during the whole experience. I learned a lot about what it means to be a driver, from delivering the packages to getting them ready. The management was super nice and professional. You could see that they really cared about the Driver Helpers. They would occasionally stop by while you were working and go over safety sheets to help you improve while working out on the job. I mostly enjoyed being your own boss when you are out and about delivering packages. Not always having someone looking over your shoulder. I think the hardest part was understanding the Diad board they gave you. It had a lot of buttons and different things for different situations. It's what the drivers used to scan in each delivery. I was fortunate enough to have a driver that let me use one and really learn it. It definitely made the days better."

good,My job was to load 3 trucks a night with a fast pace and load at least a thousand packages or more a night in a 5 hour shift with a 15 minute breal

good,"UPS stands on the values that they have built the companies name and logo.  I absolutely loved working here, even though it was a temp assignment.  I enjoyed the job duties as a Human Resources employee and the HR Management team was experienced, professional and forth coming for the most part.  I really wanted this to become a permanent employer."
good,"This job was great in all aspects in my opinion, the only downside i can find was the overwhelming amount of packages needed to be delivered and the weather conditions. The supervisors made the job very enjoyable and fun."
good,"A typical day at work on the ramp at PHI airport, is usually a work day/night where everything gets done on time. You're always racing against the clock to make sure the planes go out on time. There's tons of responsibility for part-time & full-time supervisors every shift. For the most part its a good thing having that responsibility, that way you know you can't slack off. But then again, you have to deal with other things that shouldn't be going on; like in house politics! Bosses who act like they're your friends but that will throw you under the bus to save themselves. But for the most part, everybody works together for one common goal & that is to make sure everybody stays safe & get everything done on time."
good,"I loved working at UPS.  I was in full-time management.  However, I needed to balance my family life with my career."
good,I worked a lot of hours which was a plus. I learned working at UPS is tough work mentally and physically. Management was very helpful in keeping me busy maybe lacked communication with others but other than that they were good. My co-workers were pleasant but we didn't talk much due to the fact of how busy we were. The hardest part of my job was keeping up with the belt and making sure I got the packages in the right trucks. During peak season it can get a little overwhelming but you got to go in there with a sense that you can work under pressure. Most enjoyable was the weekends off and knowing every Friday that when I got out of work I really earned my paycheck.
good,A lot of learning here working a union position. Had a lot of good people around me. Spent a lot of good  times there working with public and my team members.

good,My typical day at work would be from my office helping others with technology issues of any kind. Maintenance on server equipment and network infrastructure. I was the only tech on the night side for the entire 3 state district so I was in charge of coordination with site outages and local support if needed. I have learned quite a bit from this job! and it's 20+ special programs made for UPS. Management offered no support what so ever and in some cases used me as an example for not following paperwork that was not needed at all. Co-workers that were supposed to work as a team did not due to fear from management. The hardest part of the job was actually the night hours. Being in IT for the first time was a very large learning curve which was extremely fun but also very stressful. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people with their issues. For a very long time I have had a skill with computers but this was the first chance to actually use these skills to help keep the business stable and growing!
good,Un load or load my three special routes changes every day it was cool..Mangment was the worst  that I ever work with in my life the harassment towards people . Hardest thing was the supervisor harassment it is wonder there in all the class action suits. Most was doing the job.

good,this was seasonal position at the time being the drivers helper

good,"Overall I enjoyed my seasonal job at UPS, I just wish I could of became a permanent fixture of the company."
good,"I looked forward to coming to work, because I was able to meet new people. I loved learning new things.A typical day at work you would go meet up with your driver and head out on the route you were given. I learned how to work the keypad, scan packages, write notices, and input signatures. Management was very on point. My co-workers were very nice and willing to lend a helping hand if needed. I can't say there was an hard part of the job unless there is a huge package that I had to take up stairs. I still manage to get the job done over all. The most enjoyable part of the job was just being there riding in the truck getting in and out to delivery packages and seeing the smile on peoples faces when i come and just have the most sweetest spirit. – less"
good,a typical day at ups was an experience i will never forget. i learned to always be organized. the management was always helpful and coworkers were great to get along with. the hardest part of the job was getting to destination on time in the inclement weather. the most enjoyable part was the look of satisfaction on the customers faces.
good,"had fun in the trucks. the drivers are all so nice. you get to meet new people, when ur out in the truck."
good,"Great Mamagement, Flexible Schedule, Friendly Co-Workers"
good,I love working with the drivers.  I would love to work full-time with this company.
good,"A typical days work was delivering packages and talking to the driver about what is happening through out the day. Working with UPS, I have learned the proper way to carry, pick-up, and set down packages and not hurt yourself in the process. My driver was a very friendly guy, but also very hardworking. Everyone i have ever talked to in UPS was very hardworking and never messed around. The hardest part of the job was differentiating hours. Some days could have been 8 hours, others could have been 11 hours. It all depended on the amount of deliveries. I enjoyed working with my driver the most. He is a good guy, but i also liked being able to put a smile on everyone's face when i delivered their package."
good,"Area locations consolidated.  I went from midnights to working a split shift, 5a.m. to 9a.m., 5 p.m. to 9 p.m.. Shift was not working for my family.  This made working almost impossible."
good,"As a seasonal driver (Christmas holiday season), I was expected to be at work on time, learn the route and deliver all packages to completion. Work days would run ten to twelve hours / day, with some days even longer."
good,"I really enjoyed how challenging this job was. Day in and day out it was hard work. Unfortunately it was just a seasonal delivery driving job, but it was the best job I've ever held."
good,"Love meeting new people.  Very fast paced job and hard work, but really enjoy the co-workers, management and customers!"

good,"UPS is a tremendous company. The training program for its employees is second to none. The attention that is given to the formation of its employees guarantees that the culture of the company is instilled in its employees, thus making them an integral part of the success of UPS."
good,"a typical day at work is arriving at a meet spot the driver picks, throughout the day we would sort a shelf to make sure we are not driving in circles when we pass through a route. Time really flies when you are focused and working at a steady pace. My day would usually start at 10am and end around 3-6pm depending on the volume of the truckload or if some other drivers need help. I learned how the packages are organized, to use the DIAD, write info notices for undeliverable packages, and how to deal with angry customers. (these people will follow the truck to harass you about their bad experience, when they should call customer support instead) Management is understanding and willing to work with your schedule (btw awesome college benefits) As of co workers, I've been able to meet different drivers. Some i could not believe they had a job still (stayed out til 8pm in a winter storm with a driver who did not sort) However i met a few great drivers who had technique. The hardest part of this job is delivering heavy packages to houses with a million stairs, the most enjoyable part would be seeing the satisfaction on people's faces and interacting with the neighborhood businesses."
good,Everyone worked as a team..my manager was right there to assist us..I learned that hard work pays off..and  that helping coworkers who needed assistance made me learn to be a team leader.
good,"Hard and sweaty, but easy when you get the hang of it. Diad function, pay pal numbers and labels to the lining up of the packages in order to run your route including air mail. also the most important was the 3 point safety rule when getting in and out of the truck. Management was excellent. All co-workers were cool and real. Looking for the address in the dark. Seeing people and helping them get a smile on there face and there kids when they get there packages."

good,"A typical day as a Seasonal Driver's Helper would include rendezvousing with my Driver at a designated place and time before delivering packages across town for several hours. While this may sound boring to some, traveling and meeting new people and seeing the joy on their faces as they received their special packages and presents was rather worthwhile. "
good,"I assisted the driver i delivered packages to people homes."
good,"Hectische maar afwisselend job."
good,UPS has a system where they will promote from the ground up. Work and hours worked are steady.
good,"I started out in the loading section. I would have to scan labels and load them in a 53' tractor trailer truck. I loved the job, it was fun because I was pushing myself and the supervisor made it into a game and would give speeches and motivational speeches at the beginning of the day."

Couple month working there it get easier and i started to work faster and faster. Some day it can be hard because of the volume. A lot of box will come your way and it will stack up high. The management at UPS will be on there job and will make everything right, they will come to you and tell you what to do to help yourself because all they really want is safety."
good,i load package cars of packages. i load about 3 trucks a night.
good,"Go over supply orders for clients & try to fulfill all the orders in a timely manner along with working closely with the Loss Prevention & Overstock departments to make sure any misaddressed packages are accounted for delivered intact. I've learned a lot from my direct manager about purchasing protocols & negotiation techniques. as well as reducing cost and overhead. We had a good team in the Materials Management department that handled all aspects of purchasing & supply internal & external customers with on demand supply deliveries. It was hard to keep up with learning new material daily at the start, but all that made it enjoyable to learn. I was & still am hungry to learn new things in my personal & professional life."

After that was all said and done, I would climb up some stairs and stare sorting packages onto conveyor belts to be shipped vie airplane to their destination.I would sometimes go a level higher and  debag all the incoming small packages down a chute to be sorted. I learned better focusing and concentration skills. My supervisors were always very wonderful. Very lenient and outgoing. Always understanding our needs and striving to give us more hours. Everyone was pretty nice. It was a big place so there was a lot of people I didn't meet, but everyone I did was pretty cool. Nothing really was that hard about it. It was actually very easy. The work itself.  I find repetitive work very relaxing and I enjoy it immensely."

I was hired in this permanent position after the reference from my supervisors gave to HR based on how well I did in a holiday seasonal position from November 2012 to Jan 2013. I accepted this position because there are opportunities to move into a supervisor level position and getting the experience to learn the UPS process is very important to me. I have found from my experience, the managers and supervisors are knowledgeable and are team players. I have a good relationship with all my supervisors. I take pride in my position and getting the job done exceptionally."

good,"A lot of time is spent doing hard work constantly, but if things get tough, help is usually on its way. Loading and unloading is a hard job, but it works out out like nothing else I've tried, and more often than not, you can take the time to take a needed break for a short time when you're having trouble keeping up."
good,"As a loader, you build tiers of boxes that are given to you from your conveyor. As an Unloader, you would do vice versa."
good,"A typical day of work as a driver helper for ups, included waking up early meeting my driver at a designated spot and running packages house to house for a 10 hour shift. It was a hard job, running hard to try to make quota but I loved it. It was a good workout and my co-worker/Driver was an awesome guy. Him and I as a team beat every other driver on most packages delievered and fastest time delivered."
good,"I started with the company directly out of college and I've just celebrated my seventh year with them. Working at UPS has given me extensive experience in sales, negotiating, and customer service. They have given me the tools to become an organized and hardworking individual committed to success in all projects and positions."
good,"I enjoyed working for ups warhouse, but the pay wasn't for the work. 100 to 150 dollars a week wasnt enough to a man with pills an a family to support but i did enjoy working for the company."
good,"A typically day at UPS Warehouse, was very draining, because the lack of contact with the outside."
good,"we had a lot of up dates on traning of laws on the CDLS and hazmats and the safety of driving and on how to move and lift freight on checking the trucks out before leaving the yard. management was knowledgeable of their jobs.Co-workers were like any other company you had some you could laugh and talk to and others that just wanted to complain. For retieres we meet once a month for breakfast to keep intouch with each other. The hardest part was working long hours, but to get through the long hours, meeting new people, talking with co-workers and the satifaction of making it through the day and going home safely."

My favorite thing about my job is seeing the group of employees, who I trained, succeed and do a more than satisfactory job. The most difficult part of the job is dealing with problem employees and the different personalities but that is a challenge that I welcome"
good,Fun to work with my co-workers they make the day go by fast because when it come to work need to be done we all do the job together
good,load boxes into loader.
good,"I typical day would have been using the delivering packages House to House & loading the truck. I learned how better communication skill & sense of direction in my town. My co-worker was Cool, a older man showing me the ropes to make it threw the day. The Hardest part was probably Lifting big boxes, Overall i enjoyed the job because it kept me busy everyday."
good,My 10 years at UPS is the most memorable work experience to date. A typical work day is all about moving packages and freight timely and efficiently.

An average day involved the physical movement of packages,along with customer relations,and counting money,and maintaining high value company equipment..Being responsible for so many things teaches you responsibility ,and develops a can do attitude that will last a life time. A tough job you come to love...."
good,"At first it was difficult but when i learned the routine it gets easier,i also learned how to get along with other people,make friends with doorman,securities and others"
good,"When I first started at UPS, I would unload trailers onto the belts until empty and then go to the next trailer, do the same until they were all unloaded.Then I started filling in on other shift so I learned to load the UPS deliver trucks for different routes.Then I bid for the air driver position and got it. So they sent me to Denver for training.Soon after I started the air driver position. I had to come in early,get my truck,then meet the plane at the airport.Unload the freight for the plane and go back the UPS hub. There I would unload my truck, help sort and reload the next deliveries on my truck and make my deliveries on time."
good,everyday have a mind set on obtaining the goal that is set for the day with the packages.
good,I work at 4AM during most of the year and i load 4 trucks at one time all day as packages come on a belt.
good,One suggestion for anyone not planning on going to college and

good,"it was a fun place, the trucks would come in we would unload them as fast as humanly possible. It was pretty stright forward."
good,"My career at UPS been very rewarding and I have always been very gratefull for my job. The work is very physical and demanding. They reward you very well for your hard work,but they do expect very much from you. I really enjoyed the work and developing friendships with customers. After 27 years of delivering I have many memories, some enjoyable some very tuff. I believe that how you look at life and the attitude you choose makes all the differance."
good,"Early mornings, fun place to work and great benefits!"
good,"Board the truck, go over safety procedures, and Deliver packages starting from 1000 to 8000's. My Driver was Awesome and he treated me like I worked there for 10 years. He showed me the in and outs of the job which made the 9-10 hr workdays go faster."

good,"Co workers were great, along with management, really work with your schedule to maximize your happiness"
good,Assisting the driver during the holiday season heavily reduced his workload and stress level as a second set of hands made everything move nearly twice as fast. The social experience with the driver and his regular stop locations was a fun and welcoming experience. Management and the team at UPS was very organized and friendly. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the back of the truck empty out each day. The only hard part of the job was delivering heavy mechanical or electrical equipment from time to time.
good,I enjoyed my time with UPS although the pay is not enough for the amount of physical labor that had to be done. Other than that everything else was great.
good,great please to work. Great people great enviroment great people.

I am currently a at UPS where I am responsible for completing time cards for all employees, running numerous programs on seven different computers, dispatching the drivers, maintaining all safety documents, knowledge of hazmat shipping requirements, shipping both domestic and international packages, supervising the drivers and inside staff.

good,Was a great company to work for. Traveled 90% of the time internationaly but was not a good fit for my family life.
good,"If you are looking for a company to work for that promotes from within and has awesome benefits and pay rates, UPS is the place to be! I worked for a little less than two months and was up for promotion, but I worked for UPS but through a different company so I became ineligible for the position. The way the company thinks the best way to do something is a little off sometimes. Common sense doesn't appear all the time. If you are management or a customer service rep it's awesome. If you're a driver, well then after Thanksgiving you sell yourself to the Devil, but it's completely worth it in the end! The overtime rates are awesome!"
good,Atypical night at work for UPS was clocking going to the hub getting my outline for the cans I needed so the loaders can fill the cans up with packages. After picking up the cans i would wait for the loaders to fill the cans up hook the cans to my dolly and take them to the air ramp. From there on we would leave the cans on the air ramp and wait for the planes to load them onto the plane
good,"Safety is a big concern, great benefits for part-time work, Supervisors work hard and well trained."
good,Great company to work for. Enjoyed my time there. Enjoyed co-workers

good,United Parcel service is a great company to work for you ll have time on the weekends to spend time with the family. The benefits are great. The pay is low but you get a yearly raise. They believe in showing appreciate thier employees.
good,"Each day as a UPS supervisor is basically the same. I arrive 30 min before shift start, get all my daily paper work ready and head to my assigned work area. From there i make note of all my employees present and move them to their assigned areas for the day. Next i ensure that all trailers are properly validated and employees have all tools necessary to meet daily goals safely and productively. After all trailers have been emptied, i make sure all of my employees have been paid properly, and all my paperwork has been completed and is accurate. I would say the biggest thing that I've learned working at UPS is how to manage a lot of work in a short time span. With the amount that has to be done each day could easily make the day an eight hour day. But since this is a part time job, you really have to learn to manage your time efficiently. Management at UPS i feel is really on top of their game. They really want us part time supervisors to succeed, and they ensure that we have the tools to go out and do our jobs the best we can. The hardest part of this job would have the be the equipment that we use. This is a production oriented company and that tends to clash with equipment that will shut itself down when it gets overwhelmed with the volume that we unload an per hour. The most enjoyable part of this job is the fact that as supervisors we not not micromanaged but upper management. Our bosses have enough faith in our abilities to do our jobs, that they tend to stay out of way. In all i really do love my job with UPS, my only problem is the fact that it is a part time job, and"

good,"My days would consists of coming in and pulling customer orders, packing and shipping them out. All the way releying heavily upon team work, and individual motivation at the same time."
good,"Ups was an excellent company to work for. While employed i developed good core values. working with all kind of people,situations and cultures. It made me a better organizer,planner and goal setter. Ups is a fast moving company that demands the most from all of its employees. I was a supervisor. Days were very demanding. working with co-workers was a must. The hardest part of the job was maintaining accountability from the employees. Sometimes it was not easy dealing with union employees. The most enjoyable part of the job was the different scenarios that you faced everyday."
good,"Loved It. The Driver I worked with was awesome and I had an overall great experience. A typical day for me was I would get there and we would drive to a street and the driver would pile me up with a hand truck and a bag full of packages or just a hand truck and I would walk down a street and deliver packages to houses and apartments. It was hard but the more I did it the better I got. I would do that about a couple hours then we would go to lunch. After we would deliver to the businesses mostly and then get the houses that request their packages to be delivered after a certain time, and we would also pick up packages from businesses. The hardest part of the job was the hand truck and the walking especially if it was hot. Everyone knows how to use a hand truck of course but using it with all those boxes and manuvering it correctly without them all falling over is quite a handful. I would say that was the best job Ive ever had by far"
good,"I was a loader/unloader of flatbed trucks in UPS. I was a part time employee but recieved full time benefits. My co-workers were the best thing about my job. Great bunch of guys, supervisor was helpful and it was a fun place. I learned how to use scanners and how to properly load a truck.

The best part of my job was my customers. Seeing them everyday and getting tom know them, there families, basically they all became my extended family. This job taught me about discipline, loyalty, self motivation, and accountability which will carry me through to my next career."
good,My time at ups was amazing great employers and employees management that works great with you not easy work fair breaks and plenty of water breaks when needed
good,"There was always work available, you would never be sent home early.  The manager owned this store, so he was always willing to buy lunch or dinner if you had to stay."
good,Good place to work and get your work out on. Fast paced so your work day goes by nice and fast. No lag time at all. Great place to work at. Room to advance yourself and career. Tuition reimbursement.
good,Good people that know what they are doing. Answer questions truthfully and the best you can. True life experiences goes a long way. Be punctual and ready.
good,"I work there almost 10 years. I enjoyed working there, I needed a change of work. I had a special department that I did work in investigate department, looking for lost packages"
good,"On a daily basis at UPS, work was fast pace and productive. I learned how to communicate and assist my coworkers. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the fast pace. The most enjoyable part was being able to assist my other coworkers."
good,"With this job you never really know what your day is going to be like. One day could be nothing but packing and shipping, the next can be notaries or live scans."
good,"I enjoyed my time as an ISR and felt accomplished with meeting certain quotas. Things were constantly changing within the company with positions and promotions, although I was not directly affected, this was something that waved through the entire building. I wish I could have advanced with the company with my move but due to availability of the position, I was not able to. I will continue to look for opportunity with UPS."
good,"I enjoyed my job UPS. Although it was tough at times, I met a lot of cool people. My job was to load the trucks efficiently. The management was good as well."
good,"I loved my job with UPS ,  met great people,  there was emense opportunity for growth, and people  who encouraged me to go further. The opportunity for growth, is all within you!"
good,UPS is a great place to work at and you’ll lose weight while working there since it is a warehouse and there’s a lot of physical movements but you also have to be careful while working.
good,Job was a cool job to work some days it was a slow pace other days it was a quick pace driver was definitely a cool person to work with and made it feel like it wasn't work
good,UPS is a good thing to do with life everything runs so smooth while you work aslong you get the job done it shouldn't be hard to work there just work to get home
good,UPS is a very intense fast pace high demanding work environment. Working within the constraints of a union environment. Individuals who are self-motivated an enthusiastic will succeed. The rewards will far exceed anyone's expectations... Excellent compensation package along with salary and stock options..
good,"I work at the Omaha Gateway.  This is the first job I've ever had that I feel excited about going to every morning. "
good,UPS is there to help those who want to help themselves.  All walks of life comes to work faithfully because as long as you show up and help packages reach their destination your job is secured.
good,Definitely a fast paced environment gotta be willing to stand on your feet for 10+ hours . Great benefits and discounts just for being an employee even more if you join the union
good,"Professional and friendly. Very direct interview person. Friendly yet serious and inquisitive HR Professional. Dress business professional and speak clearly, thoughtfully, and honestly."
good,"Im only part time and I still receive full time benefits for such a low monthly fee!  If you work hard management will notice and you'll be the first to hear about new job openings.  Also, this is a union job.  Substantial job security."
good,Job security and hours leave very flexible schedule. Full benefits for dependents and overtime after 5 hours can be very beneficial. Physical work-wear and tear.
good,Great company. Challenges the mind and body as well as teaches determination and leadership. This is a great job that also helps with benefits. I definitely recommend working here.
good,A typical day at work is decent 5-7 hours of work. I learned how to multitask better and to interact with people better. Ups management is very decent in my opinion. Hardest part of the job is taking public transportation early in the morning to work. Most enjoyable part is gaining a relationship with your co-workers.
good,"I absolutely would never leave if the pay didn't require a second job to support yourself. We are a little short staffed but for the most part it is a relaxed environment except busy days. The management is extremely understanding and kind. The customers are decent for the most part, you do always have some entitled people. There aren't benefits but the company does work with you when it comes to family issues and sickness. It teaches a lot of skills."
good,"I enjoyed my job there, my job wasn’t easy but at the same time it wasn’t hard and I had fun doing it, me and other employees worked as a team to get the job done as a whole."
good,UPS Secretary is a good job but it can be a competitive tho handling with this people but mainly it’s a good job to work at. You can work at any spot just make sure you stay up and not fall asleep.
good,"Your expected to work hard for your pay. They give you above industry standards in benefits and salary. Gone are the days of pension, but they still contribute & offer benefits you won't find anywhere else ever! If you're a good/hard worker with great work ethics, you'll go far! They're accommodating to their workers with hours & start time fluctuation when requested. I stand behind the company and have for the past 27 years! I'll retire in two more with a great pension with 401K back up. "
good,"Very fast paced. Not much room for error but at every UPS building I've worked in, I enjoyed my co-workers and the overall energy. The worst part is probably lack of consistent staffing."
good,go into work supervisor tells me which door to start on go to door and unload whole trailer after said trailer is unloaded repeat with other trailers assigned by your supervisor
good,"The benefits are the best in the country and you can work about 10-12 hrs a week and get them, no money taken out of paycheck! (after 9 months of working there)"
good,Very good company to work for. There is growth for advancement in the company. The company promotes from within. A good incentive to encourage longevity in the workplace.
good,At UPS if you are willing to work hard and physically deal with packages for hours then the job is for you. UPS is also a fast paced job where they expect you to learn quick and take over.
good,Great holiday job..Great driver to work with..We worked great as a team and always had one goal no matter what the weather conditions or the heavy package volume we delivered to our customers on time
good,It's a good job and time goes by fast. It can get real hot in the facility . You can be in your own world at this job and people there is nice and helpful
good,Besides some of the employees having trust issues and not caring about what was said the department that i was in was ok to be in. The manager on the other hand was fun and very relaxed to be around.
good,"Above says it all, great staff and amazing management. Good wage, close to home. Physically rewarding. Paid weekly so that is a bonus."
good,Experience I had working as a seasonal driver helper with UPS was exceptional! Considering. The rate of pay  for part-time position I cannot complain about the rate of pay.
good,It's a good place to work. It's hard work but it's most definitely worth it. You stretch exercise in the morning to get your joints moving. Drink a lot water. The people you work with are helpful they work with you. They also have teaching methods for around the facility to learn. The management they're there to help they might get on you but that's just so you can maintain your work area it's hard witk
good,My experience at ups has been good.  I work good in a fast pace environment.  It does get stressful at times. It's good to be early to work to be ready and focused for your day. Always have a positive attitude with a smile because it does rub onto others.
good,"Clocked in and would walk to the supply area to get all my cleaning supplies. Made sure i had enough materials for the day, such as trash bags, my cleaning chemicals for the restrooms and plenty of latex gloves. So much trash from the loading dock would have to get cleaned up daily. Started from the top where the loaders stood and would drop everything to the floors. After all the trash was on the ground i would use a leaf blower to blow the trash and dust to a lower area under the conveyer belts and would sweep the trash into piles and pick it up. After that area was complete i would clean the 2 restrooms and sometimes the break room. If my area was cleaned up before clock out time i would check if any other employers needed help in their areas."
good,"I worked for UPS for a very long time. They pay great and were flexible with scheduling time off. It's a hard job mentally but you made a difference. Everyday was a new challenge, which kept my job very interesting.  I love a good challenge and the opportunity to think outside the box.  It's about customer satisfaction on each call."
good,"Was a good holiday job, work was physically demanding but I got along great with my driver and had no complaints or problems with my coordinator.  Would reccomend to anyone looking for something to do in November/december"
good,After working with UPS I have a much higher appreciation for the package service and the work ethic for any person(s) who has to hand deliver mail to residential/ commercial building.
good,"Hard work, but it is absolutely worth it. Outstanding benefits. Working with culturally diverse employees teaches you how to live, very thankful for this job."
good,A lot of pressure comes with the job. Especially around the holidays.  There are daily changes to your day and you have to be able to make adjustments and be able to work with customer demands. But it is a very rewarding experience in the long run.
good,Was a really good place to work. Everyone was helpful towards one another. The managers would always help to motivate you when you felt like giving up and very stressed out.
good,I love my job it can be stressful if people don't show up to work though.......ove helping the drivers during peak season even though its for 2 months
good,"This job is very physical, lifting over 100lbs at a fast pace. I loaded trailers. They like the trailers to be well organized. There is no use of forklift or machinery. I would reccomend to anyone looking to get in shape!!"
good,Good job it was very relaxed with a really cool boss. The people around you were very friendly and good to work with. You get a 15 minute dinner break
good,The company has many opportunities available. Great pension plan and job security. Opportunity to transfer anywhere in the world. Safety for safe is always a big concern and taking very serious. They have an excellent support program.
good,You really feel like you're on a team. Everyone there is like family and we all have eachother's backs. The management depends store to store but mine is the best I have had of any of my jobs.
good,It always awesome when colleagues co-habit which was seen at Konga.com; the management believed in process improvement and always desire clients satisfaction which all staff believed. Third party logistics with Konga.com
good,Love the job.  Excellent company. Excellent pay. Team work oriented. Driven to be the best version of yourself. Promotions are available within the company.
good,"Amazing place for young, motivated adults."
good,sure the work was hard but you get used to it. fast paced but it is well worth it. time will fly when working and the ladies and gents there are all friendly
good,"Once you put your time in at UPS everything else will be great for you and your career at UPS. Benefits are out this world. Better than any others, next to the military very good."
good,"The job overall was good, good pay, good hours and the people working a long with me in the warehouse were fairly nice people. It was a great work environment people were working collaboratively and the energy their was positive."
good,"I would recommend this job to anyone with a winter off for school. I got a $1,000 bonus for working December 1-25. My driver was great and the work simple and straightforward. Great job to pass the time and earn some money while your waiting to go back to school."
good,"Good while it lasted. Fast paced seasonal job."
good,The job at UPS is not for the faint of heart. It is a fast paced stressful environment that expects a lot out of you. We have to work until we finish the amount of trucks for the day. But for how stressful it can get. The employees and managers knew that and were extremely supportive of you knowing things are tough and that we're all in this together. That is vibe I got working at UPS.
good,The hours for preload were great. You had the rest of the day of the day to enjoy. Pay was great as well. However the on call status this year was unsatisfactory. Made it difficult to reach financial goals.
good,"Dealing directly with each of my employees (378), handling Weekly New hire training, meeting with operations managers, forecasting, meeting monthly goals.."
good,"i got hired here during the summer and it was super hot ,but the place was nice and let you take water breaks, and if they make you leave early (and you usually only work about 4 to 5 hours here) you can request that they honor you guarantee and make sure they pay you the minimum pay for working the day, everyone i worked with was pretty nice and the supervisors were cool, but i wont lie to you that first month was the H word in a hand basket, but if you can make it through all the bruises and pain it will get so much better i promise"
good,"UPS Feeder job was a great opportunity for me personally, I enjoyed my assignment while working there. My manager was highly trained for his position and was a great people person. I"
good,"I love this job. if you stick it out and do your time, you're compensated well with pay and benefits. you have many directions for growth, in all ways"
good,"UPS is a very rewarding place to work.... it is a CAREER..not a 9-5 job.  If you are in management and willing to put in a minimum of 50 hrs. per week, you will be financially set for rest of your life.  With the pay into the 6 figures, sales commission and stock options, most UPS management people can retire as millionaires.  UPS also offers current retirees a great pension at 55 yrs of age along with FULLY paid healthcare benefits."
good,Its cool . Some of the people tend to make the day go by faster and the others just there to get in you business. Love talks about sports and everyday life styles.
good,I had worked this Company - Overall it’s very good company - Management is corporates and friendly -Good job for student and new comers as package handler -
good,After 43 years and many assignments later I can say you must make your own career.  No one holds your hand and you need to be a self motivated individual.  If you wait for management to push you to your career moves this is not the job for you.  Have a thick skin.
good,Great place would work there again it’s fun. It’s a workout. And there is no hostility in the environment what so ever. It’s a great place to work. :)
good,Throw away your gym membership. You'll get your workout here. Great opportunity for young career seekers. Doesn't take long to move up the food chain!
good,"Typically helping customers track their packages had its downfall at times. Mostly the customers that called were angry because their delivery was delayed. On the other hand, all other calls were very pleasant."
good,"Great company to work for great benefits, real fast paced. Great opportunities for advancement. Company does care. Flexible schedule. Decent hours. Good overtime during peak season"
good,This was a very nice job everything was relaxed but also fast paced made time go by faster had nice management but I had to end up leaving this job because of a relocating issue because my grandma passed away and I lived with her so I had to move with my parents in shepardsville until I could move back on my own
good,"This was the best temp job I’ve ever had! My driver was awesome and gave clear instruction, and we even got our routes finished early on certain days."
good,The owner was very involved in the stores and one of the best people I have ever worked for. The company excelled at hiring people who could do the job well and provided the environment and atmosphere they were looking to create and cultivate.
good,Loved the challenge of working in very fast paced work environment. Can be very stressful at times but the overall satisfaction of a job well done outweighed the stress.
good,"This place is great"
good,"I enjoy working at this company it's not very many hours and I receive great pay. My bosses are very lenient when we have emergencies and or just not feeling good. But they also let us know that they do not like call ins. Our benefits are amazing, you can move up quickly if that's your goal, you get plenty of paid vacations, and the people you work with are pretty great."
good,"I worked at 2 different UPS locations, both as a supervisor and package handler while going to school. The hours were great at night, and them giving $5000 towards tuition per year was great."
good,"This is a very fun place to work, there are a lot of rules, but they are easy to follow and very easy to understand. This is a perfect retail job that can help any young professional understand what the real working world is like."
good,"I was seasonal hire. I didn't stay long enough to give better description. Job was good, but the boss of facility had a tendency to make poor decisions."
good,"A very demanding job. Hours are early, working conditions can depend on the weather, and the work is physical. Great opportunity for those who intend to prove their worthiness and loyalty to a company."
good,"Liked working here. A typical day would be to come to work and load trailers, and if you were a hard worker the supervisors would definitely notice and move you around more. After peak season though, the hours you get will decrease."
good,"A typical day at UPS is fast paced and very challenging each day. I am the flow controller for Twilight sort, which controls flow of the building and placements of inbound trailers on designated doors. Communicate with operations managers and floor supervisors during the entire sort. "
good,"Working for UPS was a dream come true. The only reason why I no longer work there is because I had to move to Ohio. The management was amazing, supervisors are always there to encourage us to work harder, be a better version of ourselves , with constant positive reinforcement . great team effort, we literally got paid to workout."
good,UPS was my bread and butter for 37 years. My career provided many opportunities which kept me highly engaged. The job was very demanding but rewarding at the same time.
good,"Its just a nice productive place that allows me to stay in shape. I enjoy the environment in general. Plus I've been there at this location for some time now , and I just love my schedule I work."
good,"It was a busy day, I would check on the computer if the day was heavy or lite, check deliveries, routes so me and my co-worker could manage the driver and helpers day.  Our management team would prepare the employee's for their day by simple stretching and motivation how many packages will be delivered"
good,"I liked the time I worked at ups, management and people there had a good attitude. Work was clear and as long as you showed that you wanted to advance most people where willing to help"
good,"Since working at UPS I’ve not only gotten stronger, but I’ve worked with great employees and other supervisors. The job itself is very tiring and takes tolls on ones body. However, learning to not let the little things bother you and love on from mistakes really helped me with becoming a part time dupervisor."
good,"Always pressed for time but fun and challenging."
good,"friendly customers "
good,"a  typical day at work consisted of delivering packages to clients. what I learned at UPS was safety first.  and they focus on safety first."
good,"My position was a package handler. This job consist of working at a fast pace, working efficiently, and being organized. A typical day at work consist of loading and unloading trucks at a fast pace while organizing packages, part of the job included team work which taught me good communication and teamwork skills! The work environment was diverse and transparent. The hardest part of the job involved loading and unloading more than one truck alone. However, the most enjoyable part of the job included interacting with co-workers balancing the work, everyone was friendly and helpful one thing i enjoy talking with co workers everyone is friendly, helpful, and open-minded. Overall, the job taught me how to approach with the right attitude, how to work at a fast pace, and how to balance conversation with work."
good,"Job was temporary for the holidays. Easy going job, just have to be quick on your feet and observant. Worked 4 to 5 hours a day, depending on truck load. Driver was awesome to work with. Pay per hour is decent. It's a good part time job to have. Overall a good company."
good,"I would go back, benefits are good, start to feel like family in just a week. Work pace is good even when you’re moving fast it still feels relaxed, well once your body get use to it as long as you aren’t lazy then this is most def. the job for you."
good,"There are 3 different shifts and during the peak season things get a bit hectic but that is the best time to rack up hours and there are many different positions fit for all different types of people so even if you cant lift a heavy box there are light weight positions, but I did the loading of semi trucks and that job takes a good bit of muscle and good planning cause a bad wall means stopping the flow of boxes and restacking. The management is very nice there and every week you are on time everyday of the week you get a bonus in each paycheck"
good,"A typical day consisted of opening or closing the store, helping customers ship packages internationally and domestically, packing items for customers, completing print jobs, and preform live scan services (if you have the training). I learned that I prefer working in a team setting and with friendly coworkers as well as skills in shipping and customer service The most difficult part of the job was dealing with stressed out customers, who wanted to micromanage our staff, in a calm manner while making sure everyone kept themselves under control insuring the customer left satisfied. The most enjoyable parts of the job were knowing my fellow coworkers and I were on a team helping each other and that there was no competition between us we all worked to achieve a common goal."
good,I enjoyed the constant exercise. Every driver was great and friendly. I gained great people skills and customer service. It was a very good experience for me.
good,A typical day at ups consiste of lifting packages and delivering boxes the hardest part is keep on coming out the truck to keep on delivering the package in any weather
good,The department is always busy and fast paced. Everyone is there to work and they are focused and professional with their daily tasks. Everyone is helpful and will lead you throughout the day.
good,UPS has always been a company of class and held its employees and supervisors to the highest level of standards. UPS practices and implements one of the strongest and well rounded safety programs I've ever been a part of.
good,The job is pretty hard while the compensation is very little. The only good thing about the job is the people. I have worked there for 2 and a half years and still get paid the same as a new hire because of the new contract they made
good,I enjoyed the work and would love to go back. Everything was good except the manager wasn't very informative and had attitude. Plus it was climate controlled and fast paced.
good,"This is job is good starter for people who work there to build their development, socialize, and workout too. nice to have work for holidays and more money (bouns)"
good,I was a union loader for 7 years then was promoted to a supervisor for a week before I had a brain tumor. They had great benefits and I loved the work enviroment
good,"During my years at UPS, I was given the opportunity to learn and grow proportionately with the time and effort I put forth. I learned management and communication skills that allowed me to manage a highly effective team of 300 plus employees. The workplace is that of a family business. The employees genuinely care about the success of each other as well as the company. It was hard work that demanded you bring your A game daily to meet strict time commitments. We always felt a sense of accomplishment when we delivered on our commitments. We were also recognized and rewarded for our achievements."
good,"Honestly didn’t expect to be writing a review, but UPS is what my mom would call a great college job. It’s definitely busy, and definitely considered a workout at times."
good,"It was a good job, you had to work hard and flat out all day but I enjoyed it."
good,Excellent Management Team- Company has good strong values and the only way a person can get fired is if they fire themselves. They provide training and a career path. The only thing is that you may have to travel to advance.
good,Really strict and proper of handling packages to the right people great environment to work around with great management and great company great customer service rap communication skills proper labeling and inventory of Warehouse Great system
good,"nice temp job, good extra money , nice managers, working employees, great people, easy work when actually working. nice pay for drivers . nice environment"
good,"I really enjoyed my time with UPS. I always had fun and always managed to get everything done. I had a great driver, we had a good work relationship. I got along with my fellow coworkers and always had a positive attitude coming to AND leaving work."
good,I appreciate all my coworkers and management and supervision are definetely awesome. if you have a consistent and strong work ethic plus report punctually for work the rest will take care of itself
good,"A great job for a look into the corporate world of how business is ran. Fast pace, thinking on the go, and a constant customer satisfaction mindset. Small margin for error when dealing with the mail and personal/business belongings. Amazing benefits and knowledge in the fields of business and analytics."
good,Nothing too big to say. It was and still is a cool job. Just not much to get you by. Need more pay for the work they do. Once that goes up I’d say it’s a reasonable job to further yourself with out having to dread a long wait to move up.
good,"The company is well organized. When you start with the company, they train you and give you an overall idea of what your will be doing.  Besides, they give a a very complete training in hazards.  I love it."
good,"Training is thorough for your department. The opportunity to earn more can be achieved through a sorting test or patience through seniority. It is a manual labor work, but one of the few that is not too difficult to manage because everyone starts out as part time, and the ability to earn a  living wage with benefits is what makes it more a better drawn than most companies.. The best part about working for UPS is the culture, everyone at UPS understands that manual labor work is physically intensive and every employee strives to work together to ensure that safety and production standards are met."
good,"You work 5 days week but u only work 4 hour shifts. You are almost like your own boss,management leaves you to work unless you need them. They have catered food on Fridays after work."
good,"As a UPS employee of 28 years, the days were long and challenging. UPS offers opportunity for career growth, excellent pay and benefits, but at the price of work/life balance."
good,"Working for UPS is fun, fast paced and challenging.  Once you learn your route it gets easier but there is always something to do when you run out of work."
good,This is a great place to work I was hired on as seasonal and I was hoping to stay. The job area is filled with great people and the managers treat you as if your a person and not a number it is an overall great place to work it will make you stronger.
good,"I was truck loader at UPS and it was a good place to work. Don't get me wrong-it was physically draining but you can dress and talk however you want which is nice. Being insulted by supervisors and irritable coworkers is normal, but they can't force you to anything out of reason. You learn not to care about it much and just end up doing your own thing. For the pay, it was very good work and kind of fun."
good,"It was a main hub in Dallas, Texas and the employees were helpful and helpful. But they had a high turn overs in the teams and team leader and management and lack of management communication."
good,I loved it . I liked getting up and being at work at 4 am. It was a very fast moving set up where all the pieces fit  and was well organized and worked
good,"UPS paid very well and has an outstanding benefit package. In turn UPS is a very demanding goal orientated company that puts results ahead of all else.  Work life balance was hard to accomplish when working between 55-80 hours on any given week. Team spirit and the UPS way is a huge part of the culture.  I enjoyed the fast paced atmosphere and the people I worked with, at the end of the day you knew you had accomplished something, but knew the next day would be just as challenging. I retired after 32 years in package operations on good terms and with no regrets."
good,"You can learn so many things here its great you understand how mail works, operations, and procedures. The people around you are excellent and helpful."
good,It was a high volume call center on each day I would answer approx 200 calls (they count the calls). Ppl would be extremely angry on the phone and most would be trying to find their packages.....I would help them and turn their attitudes around
good,Very great job  When you walk in its a very friendly environment very caring and great way to lose weight is preloading aswell simple job with lots of chances of advancing
good,"You basically work inside of the trucks and take the boxes off the truck , and place them on the belt line . As you put them on th belt line it moves to another work department and they shipped the packages in other departments."
good,Start of the day is fast paced then it turns into being stressful by answering concerns from customers about where there package is and how to get it. Mostly part time work to start that can turn into full time
good,"I didn't want to leave but they lie to me . they promises that i would move back Wilmington in 4.5 years i work hard to make every thing the best i could .   there rule was don't lie ,steel,or cheat  so i went from 40 call my first year to 6 call in 2 years . i had 40 units to work on pm,mi,repair ,inspect ,order parts,reeve parts"
good,Good balance of pay and benefits.Excellent career company. Opportunities for advancement are readily available.The brand of UPS is world class and honor to be associated.Tranafering to different locatiins throughout the  country is a good option
good,"If your looking for a good job that's gonna lead into a career, this is a great place to start. Really good benefits and also your in the union. I highly recommend this to job for everyone to try out."
good,"If you dont like sweating or working hard to complete a goal than its not the job for you, although its tough there are more pros than cons for working within such a vast and prestigious company"
good,Ups provided its employees with anple overtime both throughout regular hours and with overtime hours during their holiday seasons. The hardest part of my days at ups would be the weather would change  and your unloading trucks in sweatpants and a tank-top in 30 degree weather.
good,"management is cool and considerate. "
good,Best place to learn customer service skills. A lot of training. Very busy phones but they trained you with all you needed to know with their products.
good,"I wasn’t there long enough because I was only working for the season, but I was offer a full time job driving the van, but I didn’t have a driver license."
good,"Fast paced and changing job with a high attention to detail required. Generally supportive management, although being part of the union did cause issues that management could not resolve"
good,It is a seasonal position that was paid at $15 an hour. You ride on a delivery truck and deliver packages to desired destination of the customer. It is fast paced but not too demanding. Paid training and very easy and relaxed.
good,"I worked at the UPS WorldPort in Louisville, KY, and absolutely loved my time there. They paid for my college through the Metro College Program (including books!!) and were understandable if I had to leave a little early due to an early class."
good,I worked at U.P.S. for two years and it was fast paced.  It felt more like a five hour workout than just a regular hands-on job. The most incredible thing about working there is you never forget what you've learned.
good,UPS was a great place to work. They really cared about my needs and worked with me really well. I never had an issue working here. I always looked forward to working coming in everyday.
good,Love the job until I can across poor management. My supervisor was not nice didn't appreciate the this that I had done. Talk to me crazy . Overall I likeed it
good,"When I worked there during peak season, it was very stressful. The largest parcel company in the world during Christmas season. You can imagine how intense it got. Pay was good. People are friendly."
good,I would rate my experience as an overall good experience. Great manager and co-workers. Break room and bathroom stayed clean and stocked up with supplies.
good,Great environment with plenty of help from co workers and management. The union kind of separates management from employees but not so much. during peak season is a great time to make more money but off season is slow with not that many hours offered.
good,Enjoy my job have no intention of leaving plan to retire from Ups when the time is right. Excellent customer service and employee benefits. I enjoy making sure customers receive what they pay for. I am currently seeking part time employment opportunity to supplement my move to a new state and occupy my time away from Ups.
good,Great benefits and people safety was a very big issue. It was a great environment to learn about shipping and handling hazmat material. Union was very helpful
good,UPS is a great company to start at to advance in a career or to grow ones experience in a warehouse environment. The people I worked with are very friendly and it feels like more of a tight nit community rather than a workplace environment dynamic.
good,The people are really concern about you like you are really family no matter what the issue may be. And try their best to come to the best conclusion on everything therefore I feel its a good work environment. Putting out quality product and doing it in a safe-way.
good,"UPS is a great company to work for if you live in Atlanta or if you are willing to relocate there. The company offers great benefits and pay, and opportunities for advancement if willing to move around"
good,"i would recommend ups to any young person, The pay is pretty good and you have benefits. the only thing is you don't see as much money as you feel you should unless its peek season because they are part time."
good,"If you a hard worker and like getting your hands dirty then this is an ideal place for you. Amazing benefit package, strong union, fun work environment"
good,"Its was very fast paced everyone was preety cool, Only thing about it that stressed me is how early i would have to sleep to get good sleep before the shift started"
good,love the work experience it was great love the people i worked with love all the over time love when the drivers was there on time and l love that they pick you up from bart
good,"great place to have a career !"
good,Great company to work for. The company constantly praises their employees on a week to week basis. The company will also tell you your doing a great job
good,"Overall, UPS was a great experience for me. If it wasn’t for me being temporarily employed i’d be there for a life time. Although it was “peak” season when i got employed, I was told i did fairly well for a “newbie.” Don’t get me wrong, i got overwhelmed plenty of times but you just have to take some deep breaths! Fortunately, i was efficient enough that they temporarily brought me back from May 13th-July13th!"
good,Easy way to earn cash while u get a workout. People are nice and friendly great benefits great for people wanting extra income good training management opportunities
good,"UPS is a great company. The only problem is you start as part time, averaging about 17-20 hours a week. Depending on the wait time in your hub for full time, you could be working two jobs for up to 10 years. This job is great for people who can stick it out to hit full time, or those that own their own businesses and use it for the insurance."
good,"Co-workers are fun-loving people while the job itself is very physically demanding. During the summer it gets very hot especially because of not having A/C in the trailers. Management is very good with the safety of the employees, encouraging them to drink water as often as possible, and if it gets too hot, they will bring us ice water and/or popsicles."
good,"As a driver. Fast paced, always on the move. management/supervisors are ready to jump all over you if your production falls off- can include ride alongs to “fix the problem” as to why your hourly production in road is falling off.  Say ur at 20 stops an hour. “ why are you doing 17”?  That kinda of stuff. Your not strolling on the beach at this company."
good,"You will work harder at UPS than almost anywhere else, but compensation is better too. Hard to schedule things after work, because it fluctuates a lot."
good,"The job isn't hard but it's not just a cake walk either, I say it is what you make it. Its a good job especially if your a student but if not and your just looking for extra money without working hard your in the wrong place."
good,I really like the hard labor jobs which makes me feel good about myself at the end of the day.  If you can make a full year with UPS the benefits are amazing. Great way to get in shape. This isn't a job for lazy people.
good,The job I got was very fast paced and always a way of learning how to make it simpler. The break times were paid which made me work with a purpose. The supervisor was on the road also to assist with wrong slot
good,"Nice place to work and earn a decent living , always paid on time but sometimes had to make corrections. Management always pushing employees to perform at hectic rate , very fast paced."
good,"I worked at many different functions at UPS. Operations would start with a daily planning meeting. All service elements and producyion goals are reviewed. Staffing levels are reviewed to match the business plan, The operation is fast paced and you have to think on your feet. Working with supervisors and employees was extremely rewarding. As a project manager the planning was intense. A weekly deployment would start with traveling to the site and insuring all hardware and programs were in place, The bulk of the deployment was then spent training all employees."
good,"great environment very very competive very hard job high pay and you earn every dollar if you dont like fitness then you'd hate this job, if you do and you are lucky enough to get the chance to be a driver for this company do not pace it up do not take it lightly this is THE JOB EVERYONE should want"
good,great employee s  as long as you did your job you would have no problems . Great training for safety work place and driving  . Sleeper team you must be a self starter you work on a time based route .
good,"Great company. You can have a long term Carrier here if you want. High standards for working appearance, completing work assignments. Well maintained equipment."
good,"All of the workers were on the same page when it came to coming to work, making your money and going home knowing you just made PLENTY of money at the end of the day. Everybody is basically happy."
good,"While working on a MBA I started working at UPS. "
good,I would come to work 30 minutes early so we could have a PCM ( Pre-communicating Meeting ) so we can all be on the same page of what is expected that day. I learn how to plan out a operation and be the leader at UPS.
good,Great place to work for a part time job. I took this job just for extra income while I went to school. Hard work but rewarding and a fun place to work.
good,"Ran the business. I was operation mgr, I.E mgr..Prelaod mgr and local sort mgr. I was also called the business mgr. Fast pace and excellent quality is expected...."
good,"Unload my trucks quickly but safely as possible. I learned fast pace work, communications, team work, leaderships skills. I have a whole nother family inside UPS. The hardest part of the job is the packages over 150lbs. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people I work with everyday."
good,I enjoyed working for UPS workplace and I recommend it to anyone whom applies or is looking for a job. Job requires a lot of hands on work and you will be on your feet the whole day.
good,UPS is a great place to work. They have great communication skills and very nice co-workers to work with. Also great future advancements if you plan to stay with them longer periods of time.
good,"Definitely a great seasonal job. It requires punctuality and performance, but the money is good. They love to give hours to good workers. I worked overnight, and sometimes evening into overnight. The employees are really helpful and the managers are very assertive, but playful. I loved it."
good,"Good benefits, great staff, reasonable hours, management works with you, flexible with schedule , very fast paced  work to keep you busy and motivated"
good,"Fast paced, but very intense on the work we did. We sorted packages by zip codes, or load an unload trucks while scanning the packages. We worked on conveyor which was very fast paced. There was really no room for mistakes.. I truly enjoyed working for this company. I can only work up to 24 hours a week"
good,"This job is a need to go job. You need to wake up in the morning ready to move and ready to work. Its outdoors, its excercising, and itll keep the heart going."
good,"I loved this job they have so many benefits , some seem to be kept a secret unless you know the right people. They also will pay for you to go to school wether you wanted to advance in the company or move on to bigger and better things they are a very supportive company just poor management skills everyone wants to play the boss roll but don't know nothing when you ask them, it's always go talk to this person who's going to direct you to someone else that doesn't know the information you're inquiring about  but other than that  best  job I've ever had besides Google."
good,"UPS offers a culture of being not only dependable, but being the best.  Founding principles such as under promise and over deliver are fully deployed throughout the organization.  "
good,i worked here on monday's through sunday's on holiday season  because it was seasonal so i worked 6am to 4pm  for seasonal work through the holidays that was the only time  we worked.
good,"I really enjoyed my time working at UPS.  I met a lot of great people, however the people that have been there in the company have been there for many many years.  It was often difficult to establish rapport with them than it was with my younger counter parts."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was getting out, meeting new people, and providing quality service. While working at UPS, I quickly adapted to the fast paced and friendly working environment."
good,"long days, learned a lot about route driving. management was great respectful and understanding. team help,safety first each one teach one. the hardest part was just the long days."
good,I absolutely loved working at the store in westley chapel. The women I worked with was very verbal with the customers and ran a lot of people off. So that was a obstical there every day just to deal with them. The owner was weird and wanted me to come to his house and I declined to do that. But the job was fun and the customers loved me.
good,"I worked part time "
good,I was a seasonal employee but was still provided with adequate training. Would have liked to work full time but was only a part time seasonal position. Management was great took care of any pay or other issue you had immediately. Overall good experience will go back next year if still in the area.
good,"good atmosphere,very good salary,lots of overtime,but at the end of the year they send workers home because of lack of work"
good,I've been working for UPS business credit for 17 years. I enjoy working here they are very family-oriented. Work-life and family life is a great balance with this company. They appreciate everything you do.
good,This place has taught me a lot. The people that work there vary tremendously and getting along with and learning managment skills is a pro. They are strict with attendance but it is a limited operation with needed employment.
good,I would wake up every morning as usual and wait for a text from my driver which would depend and vary upon the time and how many packages he would get for the route we drove. The work days were about eight or nine hours and some challenges were present such as heavy packages you needed to carry across some obscene driveways. But at the end of the day when you stick it out and got all of it delivered and you saw that paycheck you knew it was worth it. The guys down there say that if you stick with it and don't quit the first few days it'll pay off. It does. Honestly wish I had the chance to do it as a full-time job. Good company to work for in the short time I was with them.
good,i learned that when ever its a hazard dont touch walk away and notice a supervisor . A typical at work its a hot sweaty day lots of heavy lifting boxes. Theres really nothing hard about the job unless you not fit for it or don't like when supervisors are yelling and rushing you and knowing you only have a ten mintue break.
good,I was one of the best preloaders that they had on the metro I loaded on. My drivers loved me and let me know they never tipped a loader that was brand new as much as they tipped me. I learned from a very great advocate how to load quickly so props to her. Sorry to have taken your spot light. :)
good,"Been working here for 7years. I've adjusted to the strict attendance requirements. I've learned to meet critical deadlines and work with a people from diverse ethical and cultural backgrounds. The hardest part of the job is the early morning start times, yet it's enjoyable to have the rest of the day to myself. I'm normally coming home when most people are going to lunch. In previous job's I'd learned not to take a long lunch because it's would only make me anxious about going home."
good,"As a temporary driver helper for both Christmas seasons of 2016 and 2017, I would absolutely recommend this to someone who is looking for solid work from November to the beginning of January. You ride around in the passenger seat of a box truck with a driver who typically has enough experience to make sure you can do everything that comes up during the day, which usually consists of running packages to residential doorsteps or into businesses, using a dolly or manually carrying the packages if there aren't that many. You also need to get signatures using the electronic pda, as well as scan packages with it to ensure everything has been delivered to a specific address. It is a physical job that requires lifting boxes that can be up to and heavier than 70 pounds, and the truck can be cold which you will get used to fast, seeing as you usually drive around with the sliding doors open to save time. This is one of those jobs where you don't just get to drop everything when the whistle blows and go home, instead you're there until you finish your route. This can contribute to the fast pace as you will be more motivated to finish your job every day so you can get off at a decent hour, but also opens up the opportunity for overtime."
good,"UPS is a SUPER fast paced, Competitive environment. UPS is very fun and supportive.  They provide room for growth if you're willing to grow and learn. Ups does provide open door policy."
good,I would give a very positive review of UPS.  There is little not to like.
good,As online shopping has increased so has the volume of packages at UPS. A good understanding of what this job requires is essential. This job can be done by most people. It is not the right fit for all people.
good,Great people. Amazing job. Great opportunity. Just have to have patience for it. Although it’s hard when you’re working part time and have living expenses.
good,"Excellent place to work at excellent management, and flexible hours. Has great pace employees work pace are great and everyone is positive no negative vibes"
good,"The environment amongst the co workers is great. Management is very strict and intimidating. "
good,"UPS is not a place to expect perfection, it is more of a boot camp for learning people, company structure and function in the transportation industry on every level of business. The environment can be harsh and challenging (not for people who cannot take criticism, climate changes, or dirty work). The culture can be highly stressful, but will prepare you for tough situations (e.g. handling conflict & resolution). Managers, supervisors, and co-workers are not a total blame for your day going bad, it all depends on how much you educate yourself on proper job procedures, regulations, management/supervisor/union/and hourly employee job roles."
good,"fast paced, days goes by fast. you get paid overtime 15.75 an hour, got to pay attention so drivers don't yell at you otherwise it's great. Sometimes you'll have to lift heavy boxes by yourself which is fine. Drivers will assist you or use of dolly."
good,I enjoyed working here. a lot of physical movement that takes its tole on you after awhile but the environment is great to be around and so is management.
good,UPS Great company to work for if you can be hired full time through the company with benefits. If you want to get a workout then UPS is the job for you.
good,"hard work until you build muscle. nonstop lifting and lowering. no ac and no heat. constantly exposed to outside weather, very loud, but benefits are definitely worth it"
good,"this place is a great place to work it is a high volume and fast pace "
good,daily routine would include watching and mentoring employees and coaching them in safe and unsafe work behaviors. Holding everyone responsible for proper methods and job safety.
good,"Work day starts at 7:30 - 7:45 AM ends around 5:00 PM."
good,You have to be able to work quickly but also still have a good time. You have to make the best out of it. It could get fun at times. Sometimes they cooked us food to how us appreciation
good,Got to deliver Christmas present and other package. how to deliver packages to homes and offices. management was very good and so was the work place. Getting every packaged to homes and offices and getting on and off the truck.
good,Its a great job if u want to advance you can its defiantly a job where all advAncement is based on your own will and personal development aka interdependence from independent from dependence lear how find true core values and precipitate only what you put in the seat for your own responsibility
good,"All positions start off as part time employment, but do have the opportunity for full time positions after an extended time of employment or educational level."
good,The locations I worked at in Newport News VA and Williamsburg were both owed by the same person. I was very lucky to have good management and a nice owner. I dont think everyone will like The Ups Store as much as I did largely depending on the management and ownership.
good,"My day starts with loading Packages into ULD's to be loaded onto aircraft or semi-trailers. I marshall aircraft on and off airport runways to designated gates, board aircraft unload containers then reload containers back on aircraft . I also de-ice aircraft."
good,"This job takes real good care of you and your family benfiets retirement,401k stock options. Truly Blessed to have a job like this. Meet great people learn different areas work on customer service skills. Learn how you can grow with job."
good,Fast pace enviorment with competitive pay. Very easy to advance and the have tuition assistance. Unlimtied overtime opportunities for those who need extra income.
good,It’s one of my favorite jobs I’ve had so far easy job to get used too. My co workers are the best so when you work at Ups you are definitely going to make friends
good,"Be prepared for physical work, dress for the job including sturdy work boots with a slip resistant sturdy sole. Bring water with you to hydrate yourself and stretch prior to starting work. Start with a safe work ethic and always be aware of your surroundings, team work effort."
good,"A typical day is packing and shipping packages, notaries, live scan fingerprints, inventory and greeting customers. The only intense moments are rush hour. I've learned to multitask to help decrease the long line. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with different customers."
good,"I was around nine years old when i started working because my mom was the owner and since she had breast cancer and lymphedema. So, She needed help at the store. It was good until some customer and coworkers were stealing and causing problems.After my mom passing the store went down hill and my father tried to turn into a FedEx. But the store went out of business."
good,"UPS is a great company to work for IF you get hired full time. The seasonal postions are great, however you're thown to the fire from the very first day. That would be my only complaint is that training at the center is rushed."
good,A typical day as a loader is just being placed on one or two trucks and stacking boxes in a logical manner while making sure the belts in your section aren't jammed. It can get really fast paced so you have to keep moving or things will get backed up and it will be much worse. But other than that it's not hard once you're used to it.
good,"this is the place to work for a company driver who wants to make the highest rate in the industry. high paced and always moving, lots of rules to follow and all about safety which is  good thing."
good,"I loved UPS, not for the weak hearted, very physical job-carrying heavy boxes as well as jumping up and down from the truck left me extremely tired at the end of the day."
good,It is a great and fun place to work it would be better if the minimum wage was higher because the cost to live in the Bay Area is more than people make
good,"A good place to work"
good,"most management was professional, employees worked very hard, opportunities for advancement was very rare. benefits package was excellent, time off was very hard to get, especially thru peak season "
good,It’s a very quick pasted job... benefits are good I was paid 12.50 an hour ever really had a problem with anyone including the managers. Overall I loved this job
good,I loved my job at UPS I worked with many people everyday and had a lot of interaction with fellow employees I worked for the hamptons center which dealt with the summer crowd I had to deal with a lot of CEO's of companies packages since most lived out on eastern Long island during the summer months
good,"I wish my job was not seasonal because I would have stayed on board for a long time."
good,"I liked working at UPS. Even though it was temporary,  it was fun. Got plenty of exercise.  Met  a lot of friendly people. It was never a dull moment . I would recommend to anyone looking to get in shape"
good,I don’t have a review about my job. It is a great job and a great work place and also all the people are also great. Nothing more nothing less. I would recommend this job to family and friends.
good,I was called in to fill in for someone else during the Christmas holiday but ended up working in his place.  The job of Driver helper is very quick paced but is also very rewarding.  You feel like you have actually done something good for those along your route when all packages are delivered and accounted for.
good,"I enjoyed working for ups."
good,"Depending on the holiday and time of day, the store will be extremely busy or very slow. Be prepared for anything. Christmas time especially. Also offers notary services."
good,It was a good place to work. The people were friendly. Made really good friends while I was there. Relaxed atmosphere. I did  like going to work everyday.
good,Really fast paced environment. Time management is important and accuracy is a must. My driver was really cool and helped me learn more about UPS and career opportunities.
good,"As a first job, I quickly learned the ins and outs of The UPS Store and became the Shift Lead where I was instructed to train others. Once the businesses were sold to a new owner, I was able to help the new owners get acquainted with their new business and allow for an easy transition. "
good,"Great company to work for, wish my stay could have been longer. I learned a great deal and was held to a work ethic above the standard, which I greatly enjoyed."
good,"I'd say it was a good experience overall. I enjoyed meeting new people while working for UPS. Yes, it's physically demanding, but if you lift with your legs and not your back you'll be okay. I learned a great deal over a two year period with UPS and the driver I was paired with."
good,"Algunos empleados no saben trabajar en equipo, pero muchas personas tienen buena actitud , sobretodo las lead.."
good,"If you want a great job with pretty flexible hours during the holiday season, check out your local UPS.  The one I worked for was phenomenal at getting me work when and where I needed.  If my schedule was open (which it usually would) they would even allow hours beyond the typical 3 to 5 a day, just so that the drivers could keep up with the volume.  This lead to some weeks being close to 40-50 hour weeks, as a temp.  The work itself is not mentally taxing at all and is more based on your ability to do and move and memorize."
good,it was a nice place to work. good money and the management was ok i was there for a while and i would not change anything about it. you get great pay great benefits
good,"This is one of the rare jobs where you don't need any education and can make a very lucrative career and retirement.  Most of my co-workers are retiring now and they seem to be doing it effortlessly.  The only bad part is that after 30 years of body pounding work, some of them aren't moving around as nimbly as they could.  This could also be the case if they were in another job and overweight because of it."
good,"The work is hard and steady, but that's what you sign up for. Before you know it, the day has gone by without too much difficulty. You meet other people who are friendly and professional."
good,Good company to work  for good benefits good pay off good schedule off on the weekends good environment of people and everybody knows you and everybody's happy to see the UPS man
good,Unload trucks process of packages through out slot machine delivery of packages to residential or business collect signature identify fraud and opening packages.
good,"Working here was a very rough experience, but it was definitely worth it. The skills I learned there have helped to succeed in other jobs I had as well."
good,"You’re typically with the same driver every day, so you build a relationship with the person. You also get to know about their career and what they did at UPS and how they got to where they are."
good,I made a living working for UPS. Your co workers  and your family. It's a second home from home. Management is tough. But if you can grind it out it's the place for you
good,"Job was good fast pace job had rest of the day to do what ever I wanted to do and great team work atmosphere, great benefits. I had a lot of fun being a drivers helper."
good,"Loved the work, and the hours. Didn't love that some managers didn't understand the job they were working over. The location manager was great and the immediate supervisors that helped and understood were amazing."
good,I like working at ups it's a really good place to work. I like going to work there. They make the day easy but you have to work fast. It's kinda hard when you first start but other than that I like it.
good,I love this company.  This company has helped me develop my interpersonal skills.  I was a driver helper with my own route and as long as you show our want to work the hours are there
good,"No complaints.  I do not want to leave, however I can not transfer out of my department at this time.  "
good,If your active and up in the middle of the night this is the best job to sign up for! Benefits are great pay every week not so good but great people and management!

Learned time management and organizational skills. Great place to work. Worked well with others and worked unsupervised. Self motivated, Quality assurance of work processed."
good,"Very fair, well paid and structured work environment. The company gives nine personal days in addition to vacation. Umderstands about family obligations. Well compensated for your work."
good,"I worked for ups for 19 years from preload, to preload supervisor, to dispatcher. Very fast paced enviroment, hard work, great benefits, 401k, and paid time off."
good,"USPS provides many oppourtunitied to grow and g ain more benefits of. The only times the job was frustrating was on those very hot summer days due to the fact you may driving a metal box that becomes like a oven. In the winter, it's cold while delivering packages but it it have a VERY nice heater that just helps keep you completely warm even when you have the side doors open."
good,We attribute the social and psychological problems of modern society to the fact that that society requires people to live under conditions radically different from those under which the human race evolved
good,"Checking trucks& trailers in & out of the yard, make sure you know for sure where the are to drop off thei load& where they are supposed to go.It would get a little hectic at times especialy wen there were other trucks waiting to dropff/pick up their trailer"
good,Fun and exciting. Meeting new people. Actual hard labor. Got a workout everyday! Management was awesome people! Took care of you. Had events for the community and company! Good Times!
good,Owners were all amazing to work with as well as my team. It was more like a Family than just coworkers. You weren’t just a number. They actually care. Pay rate was low for my skill level at my second location but I love the environment and culture. Can’t find better people to work for.
good,excellent job with many opportunities to advance in the company. fast paced but you can usually work as many hours as you want. great insurance as well as union benefits.
good,"very fast paced job, with so many different tasks per day that needed to be completed. Each day of week there would be different reports to be completed, as well as other tasks and phone calls with employees needing assistance. Dealt with employees walking in that needed direction in numerous areas and would have to assist them. I learned on the job in different depts such as Billing, Payroll, Tech Support, Key entry, and Human Resources."
good,I worked at the Alpharetta UPS location and the atmosphere was amazing. I completely recommend working at this place. Management is also amazing. Lots of free food.
good,A typical day at ups all depends on how the day goes and how you get along with others. I've learned things in ups that i never did before very intersting and what not. The workplace culture they become very funny style and pick and choose who they like. The hardest part of ups is coping with  others and teamwork from time to time. When you get heavy packages the guys will stand and pretend that they don't see you struggling with heavy boxes and won't help you.
good,"Ups is a pretty good place to work. The management is descent and understanding, my pay has increased over the years and they're plenty of different job opportunities posted weekly"
good,This was just your typical high school/college workplace. Fine coworkers and managers. Very flexible with scheduling to fit around your class schedule and during exam time.
good,"I would like not to discuss at this time. But do recommend this company to any individual, great coworkers to learn anything and everything about the company. i personal learned a great amount of knowledge. and i thank the individuals who gave me the chance within the company."
good,"Loading ,unload trailers, attention to detail, management great, the weather was the hardest part .I love working with a team to get the job Done!!! Done!!! Done!!!"
good,Great place to work! Great people and nice environment! Very comfortable! The people where very helpful with each other! Great benefits! And the bosses was always working wit workers far as everything from work to home
good,"I worked here part time for a year. It was great and I like my coworker there. But this job was not for me. "
good,Ive worked here for years and I enjoy working there. The benefits are one of the best if not the best but like any other jobs some things can be better.
good,"I enjoyed working for UPS. I learned how to work at a face pace, I learned how to communicate will with my co- workers as well as the Customers. My management team was awesome. The hardest part of the job was working in a 100 degree building with no air circulation."
good,"UPS Global accounting is a great place to work at! It is a lot of work but at the end of the day, you will gain a lot of knowledge and  respect from the management team. It can be challenging at times, especially around Peak season but the amount of work you put in will be the amount of experience you will earn."
good,"UPS is a great place to work, although I was only a seasonal drivers helper.,would like to work there full time They have the best benefits and the retirement package is at 100%.  Very fast paced and hectic."
good,"I worked as a Software QA Engineer and it was very demanding. When releases go out, you fill fulfilled because you were part of those who made sure that the application was released to the public with very minimal defects."
good,"UPS is a fast paced job. Need to physically able to do some lifting, squatting, and bending. I learned how load and unload the trailers and package cars. I learned how to drive the package cars. Management was a bit on the negative side. The workplace culture was very diverse. The hardest part of the was keeping up with the conveyer belt when you were loading the package cars, and playing catch up if you fell behind. The most enjoyable part was making it through another day without injury."
good,Driver would drop off packages for three different housings to where I drop it off. Hardest part of the job would have to be how much things people were ordering everyday.
good,I worked as a Seasonal Driver Helper for UPS after college and it was exactly what I needed. UPS is a challenging company and they have firm deadlines that they meet day in and day out. It showed me what hard work and a positive attitude could accomplish.
good,Gets vary hot n have to be fast there's no slacking at this job. Manger that I had was not vary easy to talk to I had got sick from touching a package n ask to go home but he fired me
good,"This job was very fast paced, but it was also easy. just get in drive and drop off packages. Sometime you may finish early. i even was able to take some night classes."
good,Overall I didn't mind this job at all. Even though it was a seasonal position they still offered a boat load of benefits. The driver I was assisting was very knowledgeable and was a great instructor.
good,Ups is a great job u can work there for many years u get paid every week and u get paid vacation and with in your first month u can move up in the business
good,"Typically you will start your career at UPS as either a load or unloader."
good,"I believe UPS is a great company to work for.  Chance to become management very easy, or go driving. Which both come with competative pay. Very well compensation for the stressful labor."
good,My job was fast paced and required a think and move mentality. The hours were great and union protection helps to be treated as an employee and nit just a number!
good,"The benefits are insanely awesome! You have to work there for a year to recieve them, but it's worth it. The other guys are great to work with, and helpful. The management is mediocre, but you don't have to deal with them too much. "
good,Everyday I would have to pack and schedule people's packages that needed to be sent out all the way from small letters to larger packages such as instruments. My manager and co-worker were both very nice men who would always help me out if i was in a jam and needed help with any customer. The hardest part of the job had to be christmas time because everyone is trying to send gifts to their families all around the country.
good,Ups treated me fairly. The drivers I was out with were helpful and the HR was really nice. The atmosphere in the work setting made me feel comfortable working there.
good,"I worked for ups through a temp agency I worked seasonal and work every extra hour they gave me..."
good,It is a good part time job but if you need more hours this job is not for you. With no A/C you can get dehydrated very easily. Overall it's not a bad job.
good,This job requires dedication and a will to push through the tough quick paced environment. the people are funny and very helpful. the management and supervisors are great and very helpful when needed.
good,Always knew what was your daily tasks and if you didn't there  was always a manager there to help you when removed from your area to help another area other associates in that area would explain what to do to help the overall task get done
good,"UPS is a company that works hard, everyone from the top-level managers to the ground level associates are working diligently to to execute the daily plan. "
good,"It was great to be part of the training team.  Learning the loading and unloading kept me very fit.  Management staff were totally on the ball and I was privileged to have been part of the team."
good,"UPS is one of the midst productive, team oriented, clear objectives and fair and balanced reviews. Sometimes I wish I didn't retire after 20 years.  UPS has a great repainted for being the most productuve transportation company in the world.  Also UPS Z had the best overall safety rating in the world.  "
good,Was a very friendly atmosphere. Felt like a small family owned business even though ups is a global company. High turnover because the work is not for everyone.
good,Every minute of your time is precious and time management is definitely a must.  I learned the importance of excellence at all times and the importance of on-time delivery is great customer service.
good,"Helps with heathcare. Also soon as you are employed u can enroll into school on ups, with that you could then apply for the better paying jobs in ups."
good,If i regret one thing in my life it is quitting UPS and moving. I moved from Texas to Florida to start a new life and I really wish I would have stayed at UPS and worked on my life in Texas.
good,Perfect job for anyone to have. Local or college student. Great pay rate increases. Great job security. Flexible hours. Simple work to learn. Optional whether you decide to drive or work in the warehouse. Great benefits.
good,"ups is a goid company to work. the work environment is fair for the most part, there can be a bit of micromanaging. the benefits recieved are absolutly second to none, and that is number 1 best thing about the company . the pay is ok bur what they lack in pay rate is made up with the benefits."
good,I was not happy with other employees cause they do nothing but look down on you they always make you feel as if you are completely stupid when you make a mistake being your first week I think that's it's just unfair and cruel
good,"Very physical job. Lots of heavy lifting, long hours depending on job. Have to be mentally strong to be able to work here. Hot during summer, very cold during winter."
good,The particular store I worked at was in a busy location so I was able to keep busy.  I also had time to study for class as I was in college.  Great job for a student.
good,Great company over all I would highly recommend to become part of the ups family. The benefits alone are more than most company's. I enjoy working there
good,UPS is a great company with alot to offer. The job demands that you are meeting with customers and farming your current customer base to increase their share of wallet. A lot of upward mobility.
good,This company is wonderful. The co-owner and other managers are very proficient in communication and helping to make sure all employees are satisfied and competent.
good,"Best job I've ever had. Don't have a ged or college degree and average 90,000 with over time. It's hard work and work nights for ever. But  How many mechanics do you no make 35 an hour. Plus time and a half for over time. The benefits can't be better unless you work for the feds."
good,There are many pros and cons to working here. You have to be determined and in it for the long haul in order to become successful at this particular position.
good,"Love going to work having fun with my co-workers everyday something different, no telling who going to tell the funniest joke or  story that may have happen at there other job."
good,"Morning always started with a quick drive to airport for Next Day Air,then a  little data entry back to the hub for loading and sorting,more data entry.I then started repacking drivers to hurry them out on routes,more data entry and job well done!!!!!"
good,"nice job, rewarding most of the time, nice employers and employee's overall i am sad to be leaving, got to learn many new skills which will help me for the rest of my life"
good,"I was very happy to be employed at UPS, fast paced good music and everyone seemed genuine. I like the fact that if u needed help of any kind.. All you had to do was ask. Overall I believe UPS is a great place to work and would return if the opportunity, once again was presented."
good,"Safe drivers- I was a runner/Driver assistant (During Winter)"
good,would still be there if I didn't move out the state. Great pay and benefits. Able to progress in the company with the ability to increase pay as you move upward.
good,"Been here almost 3yrs at this point. Started during my second year in college, which was great cause I had all morning classes and worked at night. If I had a final exam at night my Supervisor would work with me, and either give me the night off or have me come in after the exam (this was usually during the holiday season when they needed everyone in)."
good,"This was an excellent place to work at. I had many chances and opportunities for advancement and networking. The people here we're great too, as well as welcoming."
good,when you get to the work area I had to be on the line to get the packages then I would have to scan them and label them. after that I would have to put them n pallets to be send out.
good,Walk in Clock-in go to supervisor for stretching exercises. Supervisor tells us which area to go to and stay their and work. They're two different area positions scanner and putting the boxes in the bag. To pace yourself because you will get tired eventually. The workplace was enjoyable the culture was mellow. Hardest part of the job was when there wasn't any work. The enjoyable part was when the shift was over.
good,Amazing company to work for. Every employee was their to do their job with no fuss. management was always on top of any situation or concern. Typical day would include knowing which route you are loading. prep the trucks for any bulk orders. hardest part of the job was the early hours. Typically had to wake up around 3 to get to work. seasonal was extremely long and stressful but overall great company.
good,People were great to deal with always teaching new things and good training good team work and communication very good place to work highly recommended a+
good,"Great company, great benefits. Management loves to train and develop their employees. UPS isn't just a job but it's is a family.  There are many areas where you can advance your career and UPS pays for your college degree."
good,"This is a great place to work at, at first it can be a bit overwhelming because there are a lot of things that you need to remember.  This job also comes with a lot of responsibilities even without the manager position. Little mistakes can lead to big problems so its good to always double check your work."
good,I would arrive on time for work.I would come in and sign in and proceed to my door that i was assigned for that moment.Mangement was a bit harsh sometimes but very cool to work for.
good,"Will call customer service rep. Deal with all the problems people had, check in packages, work cash register, load and unload trucks. It was a nice place to work and a lot of room to grow"
good,"Great job , great benifets .. good work schedule. Weekly pay . A place where you can advance yourself into more job growth opportunities. Flexible schedule."
good,"A typical day at work would have been a good speed of calls so like a 3 second break between calls. I was in the tracking department, so I dealt with info slips. Info slips are left to customers who have missed their delivery time and call us to help them get to their package as soon as possible. The system was easy to manage but sometimes the date provided was false and we have to go towards what the system says. The hardest part about the job was you didn't really conflict a lot with your supervisor or team lead because the company has a big staff. The workplace was decent not much free time you had during calls on busy days but on calm days you could have a goo conversation with your co-workers and it was always a blast with the people I sat next to."
good,"Had a good 12 years at UPS, first full time I had, would have probably would have stayed for 30 years if not have been giving and opportunity to utilize mu education in Business Management for F W Webb Co,"
good,Working at UPS I was responsible for loading and unloading truck in a fast pace environment. I was responsible for sorting a thousand packages a hour.
good,"Been good to me working with my school schedule amoungst other things. Everyone is very easy to get along with and the hours make it easy to have a regular day outside of work. You do get far more hours in ""peak"" season which is around Christmas."
good,"Job is easy. All you do is drive deliver and scan. As long as your management team doesn't decide to ruin your life, it's fun. The hardest part of the job is when it's freezing cold and everyday traffic. But the FREEDOM OF THE AIR, ROAD AND weather makes it great"
good,"UPS taught me that safety is most important for everyday life. Whether you are out biking, at work, or just in the kitchen cooking. The most enjoyable part of the job is being in a safe environment that allows me to come home everyday after a day at work."
good,"I worked for UPS when my pay rate was 11.80 per hour and time and a half after 5 hours with full benefits. Going into management while I wouldn't trade the education or experience, you start loosing money since you are salary and working 70 plus hours a week. The offered 100% benefits with zero out of pocket. Along with dollar for dollar profit sharing which they no longer do"
good,The job was hard work but if your used to labor its nothing loading was like playing tetris just knowing we're to place the right box . The job is perfect for someone that needs job security and or who is just starting out at working
good,"Ups was a good company to work for. Work was always there due to the shipping industry.  They had many clients and were always pushing employees to contract more business.  It was hard work, but if you were willing to do it the payoff was great."
good,The work environment was systematically laid out and very fast paced. I easily learned how to do my job and was very good at it. Looking for other workplaces like this.
good,"Being a driver helper for the peak season in the city was very demanding and fast paced, but nonetheless a great place to work. Friendly staff and great benefits if you were to become permanent."
good,"Livraison "
good,"I worked at ups for 2 years as a package handler, tough work but pay isn't bad and UPS paid for 2 years of my college with their school reimbursement program."
good,Working with the UPS is great and brings about much discipline within yourself. Compensation is great. You have to be physically fit to work as a package delivery driver.
good,With the help of the managers and supervisors it is very easy to learn new positions that make you a more flexible employee. If they ever need help in a different area you become extra capable of helping out.
good,I enjoyed learning new things. Its a little hard in the beginning but once you get the hang of it you will feel like you been there forever. It also builds your body strength.
good,"U.P.S is the worldwide leader in global shipping operations. Must be able to physically lift and load the packages onto trucks or deliver them to customers."
good,"Fun Workplace. high salary. good boss. the bad part is that you are required to do OT every now and then, but of course it is paid. if given a chance, i really want to go back in UPS."
good,"UPS is a hard working company that promotes a team concept and a can-do attitude toward solving problems and meeting customers needs. In spite of being such a large company, there is definitely a close-knit team and family atmosphere that pervades."
good,Very hard work but they pay you well.some management can be very demanding and disrespectful towards employees but the union usually steps in and takes care of the problem but you have to fill out paperwork in order to resolve the issue you are having.
good,"Quick-Paced Work"
good,"I loved working there, I am a little sad that the seasonal work ended so quickly. The employees were all awesome to work with. The only downside I had there was that there were a good number to customers that no matter what always yelled at the employees. It can be hard when someone won't listen to anyone in the store."
good,"Within this particular franchise, the owners are amazing. They believe in their employees, and create a work environment where there is ALWAYS room to grow and succeed. Our customers are also amazing. It is honestly an all around great place to work."
good,"Tons of potential to move up within the company. The benefits here are amazing. The staff and management team are friendly. The dart rate as far as safety goes, could be better!"
good,"Very professional work environment to be working towards your college degree, Great for growing on fundamentals such as computer skills, printing, and cash handling that will give you a higher chance to be hired in the future."
good,I was currently in highschool​ when working my first job at UPS and was a great experience and now looking forward to get a career going I wish I could've been there to further my career with the company
good,This job is great and the benefits are exceptional theu area really come in handy for evey day things it is hard labor but it all pats off in tge long run
good,The work keeps you challenged and on your toes. There is opportunity for advancement . Supervision regularly engages the employees. We are also safety oriented.
good,"loading and unloading packages from trailers by hand . also scan packages with a small hand strapped scanner . very physical , high paced , fast moving job ! learned to multitask ... do job fast also !! work can be from 3- 5 hours maximum ...usually !"
good,"The staff is unbelievable. They go above and beyond for their customers and each other. I had a great time boxing and packing items, I worked on my computer skills and designed some print jobs. It is a lot of fun to work there."
good,It is a extreme fast paced job since you have about a 4 hour time frame to complete your work heavy lifting is definitely required for this job it is very challenging throughout the seasons due to it can be extremely cold or extremely hot
good,I have worked with UPS for almost 16 years. Nice place to work for with great benefits for those who chose to stay over a year. Great part-time job for extra income.
good,"Typical day would be to load trucks."
good,I love my job at UPS its just hard to move up.  There are so many jobs that are part time and to get a full time position you have to be employed with the company for years.
good,"I worked for UPS the summer before I went to college. It kind of stunk because I was up between 3-4am to go to work, but I enjoyed the people and the fast pace of the job."
good,Ups is fantastic place to work during the times you are going through school they help you with schooling and many other things if you need a part time job for extra money this is the best place
good,"Unloading and loading trucks, fast atmosphere, you get no breaks when you part time, but working 5 hours I usually need to rest, due to the fact the boxes are heavy. Even though boxes are heavy we do get a lot of help around."
good,"A great place to work, great people to work with.  Lots of areas where you can learn and advance your skills. Working in the Air Operations, it's very busy and fast paced.  You have Pilots and ground crew relying on your expertise to do things right and follow all the safety rules to get your job completed right."
good,I do inspections on my vehicle every morning before i leave the warehouse. I safely Drive to the Area im delivering that day. 12 hours later im done and take the truck back empty. Wake up and repeat the process.
good,"Fast paced, team work, communicate with very nice people daily. Learned that good customer service and positive attitude will pave your road to success within this job and life. Management was exceptional, because they're very knowledgeable about the company and how to deal with customers. The hardest part was trying NOT to have so much fun while working hard. The most enjoyable part was seeing the smile and joy on customers faces when satisfied."
good,"Was a good work out, nice driver, good holiday position and I'd do it again. "
good,Hard work and long hours but very satisfying. I spent many hours helping the driver deliver packages during the busy holiday season to businesses and homes.
good,"Excellent employer, good benefits, very physical demanding job, but hard work is well paid."
good,"I have worked for 6 months now and I learned a vast array of techniques in customer service and package processing. It's not a big work center but the coworkers make you feel you are part of a family as soon as you start working there. Work flow varies throughout the day, before you know it you are swamped with customer request and services to be provided. However, there are plenty of helping hands around that make the tasks easier to tackle down."
good,"To give my best in my professional pursuit for overall benefit and growth of the company that I serve the facing the challenges, I will show my caliber and gain more experience. Want to work in an environment of growth and excellence and earn a job which provides me job satisfaction and self development and help me achieve personal as well as organizational goals."
good,You have a lot of young supervisors. I have never seen so many disrespectful people. The mangers are great. It's takes forever to become full time. You only get 4 hours a day
good,"Greeted every morning, very friendly well productive place. People telling you in and outs making sure you did everything correctly was great."
good,"each day is different and enjoyable, I learned a lot about the logistical side of parcel delivery and the ins and outs of each bit of the process. the management team are very helpful and supportive. The hardest part of the job is going the extra mile for the customer but not getting the packages delivered, the most enjoyable part of the job was team I worked with and the job satisfaction."
good,"Better to go out in public and deliver packages to customers homes with your driver, it's a fun routine for me. The only time I don't like work is heavy packages to carry."
good,"A typical day at work involved conference calls, meetings with my team to delegate work, fix billing errors, train employees, help finish any unfinished work by end of day by assisting and supervising.  "
good,hardworking atmosphere with lots of physical labor. Very rewarding work if you enjoy getting a work out. Can be overwhelming if you cannot keep up with the packages.
good,"The UPS store is one of those places you want to work if you are an honest, friendly, and hard working multitasker willing to abide by the law/rules and learn a lot about the basics of mail/shipping. The management has changed recently, so I do not know the environment for working there now, but when I worked there - it was quite the experience."
good,Was a very fast paced which I enjoyed the most. In my opinion its great to work at a fast pace because it keeps me focused on the task and makes the day go fast. Very long days but was very worth it. The headquarters usually made things easier for us package handlers as well when the time came when it was busy. Very intriguing job.
good,i don't know how the guys make it to 25 years. it pays well but it is a hard job. Good benefits and retirement package. during the peak season you get a helper which is nice
good,"I have worked at UPS for about 1.5 years. The people there are friendly and all on a first name or nickname basis. They have already given me the opportunity to work as a package car driver, which doesn't usually happen with people until they are there for at least 5 years."
good,I really enjoyed working at United Postal Service although I was only hired for a seasonal position.  I would definitely work there full time.
good,It's great depending on what position you do and your shift. the people there are polite and respectful and support employees of their goals to a great future
good,"Nice job to work at during the holidays. Keeps you moving through out the day. Very fast past, nice good working people, great environment, good benefits."
good,"-Helped my driver moved package"
good,This job gives very great benefits but not much security. Even when you are a permanent employee they still only provide you a spot by seniority basis only no matter how much of a good worker or employee you are. Basically your replaceable and you oly work part time.
good,"I only worked seasonally, but I got along well with everyone I met there, and it was clear that UPS thinks highly of their employees. It was very demanding physically, but it was never anything unreasonable, and coworkers were happy to be helpful and understanding"
good,"Great work environment with excellent benefits. There was a sufficient orientation time to understand the job, and an easy to understand two week long training period."
good,Management is well understandable with life issues and always willing to help one another. A well family Business with great people. I always enjoyed working with my co-workers. They always helped and looked out for one another with job duties.
good,"UPS is a fantastic company to work with,they do not have consist work hours which can be very frustrating at times. However they have great pay, medical benefits and for part timers they will pay for the college tuition if they have a partnership with the school. coworkers are iffy its always best if you keep your head down and do your job right."
good,"A typical day would require tons of customer service. I would greet customers, and ship whatever it was they needed to ship. Sometimes it would be documents, other times a birthday gift to their mother. Some customers would need things to be bubble wrapped and packed in a box, and others already had this done. I had a ton of repeat customers and that was the best part of the job. You pretty much knew who was coming in."
good,"I worked for ups during December as a walker, delivering packages on foot around my local area with a sled. Enjoyable, albeit cold."
good,United parcel services was a great company to work for as a seasonal position of driver helper. They are flexible with your schedule and provide you with everything you need to work efficiently .
good,To plan your work day and fullfil customer service is rewarding and to work with guys that are just hard working a plus.not so bad but neede to have management have your back and not be negative work as a team and work together and diversify
good,"I loved this job, it was physical, i got to explore my new area, had a good time talking with drivers, greeting all sorts of people, i liked being outside, it was overall fun for me, i was sad it had to end seasonal."
good,"This is a very physical job, but worth the effort.  There is some difficulty in getting where you want to be, but after you work is noticed, you will increase your chance of advancement."
good,I drove a route for the holiday and really enjoyed my time with UPS. Supervisors were helpful with making me comfortable with what I was doing.
good,Fun workplace easy to get hours. very difficult transition once seasonal work ends and halts very fast. Overall a great place to work
good,Its hard work but fulfilling. Its only part time but I have met some great people and my supervisors are easy to talk to. If you work hard and show up you will be rewarded.
good,"Unload Packages"
good,Excelente ambiente de trabajo trabajo bajo presión muy buenos compañeros y supervisores
good,i was employed with cenetrplate but we worked at AT&T park with the San Francisco Giants it was a great experience the job was very chill we just had to keep the bars stock and bring produced when needed
good,"Awesome company to work for you work hard for your money and in the freezing cold or summer heat, but its worth it. Its a company you can make a career with"
good,"The job itself was not difficult, the only true hard part about the job for me was shaving everyday.  But other than that I enjoyed working for the company and getting to know the different drivers I went on routes with."
good,pack package in a certain safe way. provide labels for customers. and they also do printing services. the environment is the best i ever been with. vey flexible into your schedule. good location with friendly costumers and co workers
good,"I love working at UPS just that I don't get enough hours a part time job should offer. Overall the work environment is very great, the co-workers get along and the job production can't be beaten in my opinion at my hub."
good,"At Ups i loaded and unloaded company trucks. I learned how to properly lift and load packages. The only hard part of the job is that there is no a/c or heat in the warehouse, so whatever the temperature outside is the same inside."
good,"Excelente, buen ambiente de trabajo, constante oportunidad de promoción"
good,"Get in there and do your job there is opportunities everywhere. Every Job is different, but Ups is a great company and its long term. Remember work safe!"
good,"it is a wonderful work place , it keeps u busy , very fast paced,  it is very stable, keeps u moving u will never be standing still , pays good , good benefits"
good,"Enjoyed working there, it was tough work but it helped me lose weight. Great company to work for because the benifets are great."
good,"Working at UPS can either be the best or the worst, no in between. Really depends if you Are a team or not. You have to be a team player here. If you aren't. You'll never make it"
good,"Not a bad place to work, hardest part of the job is the physical demand of being a loader and the constant movement. The most enjoyable part of the job would also be the physical demand of the work, everyone worked as a team and provided a good amount of help to get the job done. Working here gave opportunity to learn management skills and teamwork and helped to strengthen work ethic."
good,I enjoyed my time being there even though it was only for a short period of time. I would actually love to go back work for the company again.
good,Not really much to day.. This job was just seasonal and I didn't know. I had fun even though we were working in extremely cold environments but overall I did have fun
good,"Love working at UPS. It is a great company that has a broken down step by step method for everything you do. The only downside is upper management always expects you to make a lot out of nothing. But on the other hand, trying to meet those expectations can allow you to do far more than you thought; even if you still fall short."
good,working for UPS was very intense for the late shifts. some days were easier because of smaller boxes being loaded. I learned easy ways to make everything go into place and that patience is key to picking and handling packages.
good,"I would show up in the early evening to the job site and work between 4 and 6 hours with a short break in the middle. The flow of boxes remained consistent throughout, giving little time to slack off or be lazy, and promoted a strong work ethic. Emphasis was placed on goal focus as I wasn't there for a full 8 hour shift, and a certain amount of boxes needed to be moved in the shorter time frame. Management lacked communication, though overall it was not a problem as I knew my responsibilities. My coworkers were very friendly, open people and made me enjoy coming to work every day, as well as made me want to work harder for their sake."
good,the working experience was great just didn't last long with it being a seasonal job. the worker were actually very friendly enjoyed every bit of the working environment with UPS.
good,"We start by taking boxes of the truck and labeling them, then we sort them to go to the right area, and then we pack them on the truck for the drivers. I learned that working as a tem is better then doing it all by yourself. Some of the management was great but there was a few bad seeds. The co-workers was amazing. The hardest part of the job was getting up at 2:00 am to be there at 3:00 am. I just love the job as a whole because I had the chance to do everything in the building"
good,"I really enjoyed working for UPS during the holiday."
good,"En esta empresa aprendí el manejo de caja, a realizar cortes, usar tarjetas y cobranza con estas."
good,a typical day at work is i go in and immediately start unloading trucks that are filled with boxes and bags of mail hardest part of my job  was to lift some of the things by myself
good,"UPS is one of the finest companies I have EVER had the privilege to work for in my life. Their reputation for excellence supersedes ANY  employer I have EVER worked for in the past and present. They excel in customer service right on down to managing their part time package handlers. Even the new hires are in the local union and get benefits in 90 days. When it comes to discipline, management is steadfast to honor the terms of the contract and ensure collaboration with a shop steward. I was always PROUD to say ""I work for UPS."" It is the job I still mourn about the most for leaving."
good,"Great company, great benefits! Work life balance is great. The down side is that the bonus is impossible to figure out and is only paid quarterly."
good,"Obtain and compile copies of loan applicants' credit history, corporate financial statements and other financial information. Handle customer complaints and take appropriate actions to resolve them, also collecting on customers past due accounts."
good,Management was very kind and understanding. good to all their employees. would work with you if needed. availability was outstanding.
good,I love the atmosphere here and the job security is grade A. Every night is filled with accomplishment. Satisfaction at it's best.
good,"Was a very good experience working there. The employees was very good cooperators and teach you what you need to know with out excuses. They have good benefits, but they request more than 10 stops done per hour and is hard to make it some times."
good,"Very structured, worked with customers shipping and receiving packages.  I completed all my mailing duties such as, maintaining contracts for personal mailboxes.  I also had closing duties such as counting inventory and cash drawer."
good,"fast pace, like working out, co workers are cool, hardest part is when packages get backed up, enjoyable part is when your almost done with work,"
good,"Great compensation and life balance for par-timers, they pay me to go to college.  The only difficult thing I experience was the night schedule and the high pace environment one has to work. There are so many workers that you can make many friends very easily."
good,"My crew had the graveyard shift that started anywhere from midnight to 3 AM. We would usually start out by bringing in,unloading, loading, then sending off some of the larger aircraft (MD-11, Boeing 767, Boeing 747) then move onto the smaller propeller aircraft and load them with individual packages and send them off ending our work day at around 11 AM or so. Most of the people working there were very friendly and were willing to help at a moment's notice. The management could have done a better job. The hardest part of the job was finding the energy to load the last plane. The most enjoyable part of the job was just being there working. It was a very fun experience."
good,"UPS is a culture of best Logistics, Distribution, Delivery and Pick up, Small Parcel Service ever. It has given me the opportunity of show my abilities and shine. "
good,"A very demanding work day that can take you to your limits. Management does it's best to provide you with the tools and motivation to keep going. Although the day is heavy and can at times make one go completely mad, satisfaction is guaranteed when you and your co-workers work together to complete a grueling day of work."
good,Fun fast paced job. Awesome pay if you do it right. If you're a college student stay to unloading and sorting and in three years sign a bid sheet for driving and there you go. 50k a year.
good,"Learned how to dirve a four point forklift. Before i could only drive a regular forklift"
good,"A typical day of work is loading and unloading packages and delivering house to house with a package car."
good,"Very fast passed work environment working hard from clock in to clock out. Typically moving up to 800 packages an hour between unloading, loading and sorting."
good,Each day you are tasked with finding and retaining business. This is done by calling on existing and new customers and visiting customers to provide them better solutions to help grow their business. The job was not micromanaged and you were expected to schedule your days and manage your time correctly. There were sales goals you were responsible for reaching and exceeding. The most enjoyable part of the day was winning a new large account or getting to go home each day.
good,"I worked seasonal for UP, but it was a great experience! My co-workers were very nice and helpful; as well as management resolved work related issues in a very prompt, fair and timely manner. I definitely recommend this company to anyone looking for a job!"
good,Very energetic and lively place to work. Love the employs and supervisors. It's hard work at a very fast pace environment. Every minute counts. Dedication and drive gets the job done!
good,"I work in the warehouse early mornings, I work as a clerk in the date gathering part of the company. The packages that are unloaded are scanned so we know where they are in their journey from supplier to customer. Some packages won't scan for a variety of reasons, label wouldn't scan, person moved, address needs to be typed in,etc..."
good,"As a processor at UPS you will be weighing packages, putting a label in the correct spot and putting the package on the specified belt. It sounds pretty easy and for the most part it is. There will be times when you will come across issues such as a package not processing for various reasons. It is a very fast pace job and sometimes it can seem like a lot is being expected of you but you can catch on pretty quickly. The team leads, trainers, and supervisors are really easy to get along with and you can go to them with anything and they will listen and help. Overall this job is pretty great and if it were full-time I wouldn't have left."

good,"When I first started working at UPS I hated it. I was barely making any money because they were taking out taxes AND Union dues, and thats $25 of every pay check. So i definitely felt like I was getting played. But a few months went by and i realized it wasn't that bad. You get a $1.00 raise every year and once you pay your Union dues your paycheck still looks bad, just not that bad anymore. It keeps you in shape and every thursday they have pizza.

good,"It is a good place to work and provides great benefits for its employees. The atmosphere is ok, besides the temperature inside of the trailer. My co-workers are helpful at times. Management is very hands on with us and helps us when were backed up. The hardest part of the job is the temperature of the trailer, once the sun gets involved it is really hot. Also there is a type of smell that gets to me once I get there and the task of keeping things together when I have two trucks to load at the same time, but other than everything else is alright."
good,"On the job training was excellent, as well the opportunities offered for advancement to employees. Management at this company is very employee oriented."

good,"An extraordinary experience. Simple, but demanding. I highly recommend this job if you need some cash in the holiday season."
good,"Working at ups is a great experience. The co-workers are amazing i made a lot of friends working at ups. A typical day at work for me was to come in early get comfortable and get my sorting station. When the work starts coming in it would be lite for a little while then start to get heavy meaning i would speed up. Sometimes i didnt have a bagger which meant i would have to bag and sort for my self , which was a little hard , because as i would start bagging for myself the work would build up, but i always got the job done. i would say that that was the hardest part of the job ! Working at ups was pretty easy , everyone was nice even the supervisors , they would even bring me snacks because i was such a good worker !"

good,Hard work and a lot of walking but a lot of fun and makes the time fly. Working outdoor and in all weather sucks but livable.

good,A typical day at work fairly difficult and repetitive but with the cooperation of co-workers they day goes by easy. I learned how to build box walls that can withstand immense pressure for long periods of time. Management is usually cooperative and helpful as well as the co-workers. The hardest part of the job is coming in to the repetition. The most enjoyable part is working together with co-workers.
good,We would start at 9am and we would organize the truck a little before we head out. We would make stops such as residential and commercial business and we would deliver packages. All the driver helpers and the drivers were cool and respectful. The hardest part of the job is working those long hours from 9 to sometimes getting out at 9/10pm.
good,i was in charge of the customer counter i would have to pull packages for customers and sign them in to be shipped off. the hardest part of the job was getting the heavy packages came to the end of the for a customer. I enjoyed the holiday season that's when there is more people to help and make your job easier and less stressful. If any packages were left in the building I'll rescan the packages to get shipped the next day or take them to the location of the driver.
good,this job was mentally and physically taxing because i had to wake up extremely early and work through the night.
good,I like my co-workers.  The management is friendly.  The hardest part of the job is the really heavy packages.

Ive learned how to read different types of labels on UPS boxes and I have also learned that there are plenty of UPS hubs around the world. the management is okay. sometimes they don't make good decisions and cause us to be backed up. the hardest part of the job is keep a steady past and learning which boxes goes to which area of the hub and which truck it goes in. The most enjoyable part of the job is the co workers. everyone there pretty much gets along and its always fun and laughs."
good,"A typical day for me was to meet my driver, and then begin the route. It was pretty simple, door to door package drop off. It doesn't sound the best but I found it very enjoyable!"

Management was great and able to work around doctors appointments and other things.  I was able to get along and become friends with most all of my co-workers and continue that friendship today.  "
good,Met many great people that I still stay in contact.  We had a great team in customer service and human resources.
good,"A typical day at UPS consists of meeting and greeting customers as they enter the customer counter either to pick up a package placed on hold or to ship out a package.  I have learned to speak alot of Spanish, enough to deal with my customers.  I have been working with my co-workers for almost 20 years and the hardest part of the job is the packing and lifting.  The most enjoyable part of my job is helping my customers that come into UPS."
good,"United Parcel Service was my first job after High School.  I worked there for four (4) years until I had to take a family medical leave.  United Parcel  is a great company with plenty of room for advancement.  A typical day was consistent with loading four package trucks into sequently order.  I learned that hard-work pays off, because you need to be fast and efficient.  The management team was very  demanding.  The co-workers were like family, and we always helped one another out when needed.  The hardest part of the day was always trying to complete more than what called for.  I definitely enjoyed my employment with United Parcel Service and altough I moved from New York to Las Vegas, I would strongly apprceciate a transfer. United Parcel Service also offers an excelllent benefit package."

good,"I loved coming in going to my sector , picking which trail I wanted to unload at a speed above company requirement and getting nothing my compliments for my work ability and words to continue to fuel me to move faster, and yet still exercise all the safety procedures I was taught while lifting a package. I didn't have to talk to many people but I didn't have social issues up there either. I say the hardest part of the job is keeping someone else I was working with motivated to do as good or better then me. I was generally hit the the response of you get paid by the hour not the package. The best part of the job was the constant support from superiors."
good,loved this company I worked for this company four years no problems at all blanaced with life work and school
good,This was my first job & I loved it. I loved all 3 of my managers & loved everyone I worked with. We actually had nights where everyone would get together & do bowling. We were always busy throughout the day.

good,"A typical work day in a sentence would be fast-paced yet productive. I've learned how to improve my leadership skills and better communicate with others from an authority position. My co-workers are great and really add to a good overall work experience. The hardest part of the day would be right at the end of the shift, getting employees motivated to finish the last stretch of a physically demanding job is difficult but not impossible. The most enjoyable part of the job is just knowing the impact on our customers lives we make being able to operate efficiently, It's like we help the world keep going around."
good,"Typical day at work was learning new things,"
good,"One of the few jobs that was exciting day by day of work. There are times you have to go in harsh weather, and depending on your driver your hours can go longer than your average four hours, which is a plus for you if your seasonal. There is never a dull moment, it is truly what you make it."
good,"Very busy the one you can't breath."
good,"A typical day at work would start off with a sort meeting with all of Management from our Sort Operations before the shift starts. After our meeting, supervisors would then collect our paperwork, radios, safety equipment etc. and go to our areas at least 15-30 mins before employees arrive and prepare our areas for the package sort. What i learned was that in order to be a strong leader, you must be capable of having high consistency of work ethics, realizing that everything that you do will make the job easier or harder, for you and your people, to focus all your energy on the tasks at hand until its over. Lastly but not least, to leave every problem that is not work related at the front door for if not done, you can tamper with your own work production. As a leader it is important to have high standards in order to have employees listen and respect your orders and trust your judgement. I most enjoyed the fruits of my labor when all of my employees understand my code of work ethics while my operation was still open. There was no need for me to even speak to them about what needs to be done, how to do it, and when. The system that was created for them was just implemented, thus making smooth and easy days at work, no confusion or confrontation. The hardest part of the job were the winter days. Management at UPS are not permitted to wear hats, so during the winter time in about 15 to 20 degrees outside, it gets pretty cold in the sort hub. Management is caring, they teach every supervisor how to be better than they are. Always room for improvement. My-Coworkers were not just my"
good,"You get great benefits for being a part-time employee but you have to bust your butt off, UPS is no kick back job, you have to put in your time before you start making that good money, meaning you start part time until something full times comes "
good,"Everyday is always different and it's never the same (as far as the amount of packages we recieve.) I have learned a lot since I have been there since I first started. I used to load and unload the trucks and now I am an Auditor/E2DC Clerk. I try to excell at everything that I do to try to get to where i'm going. I have excellent co-workers that I work with and we work hard to get the job done. To me, there isn't really a hard part to the job. The only time it was hard was when I first started to learn it but, after that, it became second nature. The most enjoyable part of the job is that it's different everyday but, I'm very adaptable, so I love the challenges that it brings."
good,"I enjoyed working in an environment that is productive, and inspires employees to strive for excellence"
good,"Working at the UPS Store for the past 7 years has taught me so much about myself and what I would like to do with my future. I work at a UPS Store in Hot Springs, Arkansas; the stores are all independently owned by different people, my boss is an amazing boss to work for, I have never worked for or seen a person that owns and manages a store that cares so much for there employees as he does and my co-workers make the environment even more enjoyable. I have also learned a lot about how to work on my customer service in stressful situations and I have learned a lot about all the other things UPS can do for you in my 7 years of employment other then shipping your packages; for example: copies, binding, mail services, business cards, flyers, notaries, freight along with numerous other things the stores and employees can do."
good,"I started and stayed at ups for about 5 years. Don't get me wrong the work is hard but it is worth it in the end. Yearly raises, the incentives, there's always a advancement for employees the bbq's and other things they gave us are well worth the labor. I loved this job the most. The people were great except a few which is normal, the health benefits are the best I've ever had they covered 100% of everything!!!!! You get a chance to always make extra money and they pay for your school! The start off pay is a little scarce due to union dues but, trust me the dues come in handy when you need a shop stuart. If I could go back I would have never left ups!"
good,"The work is tiring, but worth it. The pay is great, although I could use longer hours. People are friendly and cooperative, and work well with everyone to get the job done."
good,"Never a dull moment; from packing and shipping to copying and faxing; customer traffic is always at a high and the speed of service always keeps you moving; customer service and satisfaction is always primary focus as well as great experience and repeat business; a full service business dealing with UPS, USPS, (the post office) and all encompassing business services, ( copying, faxing, laminating, etc.); this also means boxing and packaging services"
good,"Firma przyjazna ,dobre wynagrodzenie, możliwość awansu"
good,"Incredible place to work. Excellent benefits and pay Home every night, plus union backing. Management is fair to good"
good,"If you want to get paid to go to the gym and play a giant game of tetris at work this is a great place to work. I had muscles hurt when I first started that I did not know I had. Great part-time job that will help you pay for college and offers free benefits for employees and family. (Union that is) management does pay for it but still affordable and great coverage. If you don't have work ethic and drive you will learn it or you will quit. There is no middle ground here. I will be sending my kids to work here when they are of age as it is the perfect job to start off on the right track. Career growth is rough here because no one leaves (EVER) Good thing for the company not so great for the person wanting full time employment. It is made for the college student, someone wanting extra income or like I said gym work out while getting paid."
good,"UPS involves a lot of intensity, but overall, a good place to work."
good,UPS is a great place to work.  My most enjoyable part of the job is meeting people and working directly assisting customers with their problems.
good,"Packaging, Processing packages for shipments, Scheduling print jobs, Answering telephone calls and providing requested information, Operating large printers & wide-format printers, fax machines, computers, laminators, coil binding equipment, and much more."
good,UPS is a good place to start out in the brokerage business.  Most of the people that start at UPS usually leaves after the training phase due to the pay scale.  It is lower than most of the competitors.
good,This job is a good fun job. Very active moving and shipping items so you will never be bored.
good,"Three positions held. Customer Service for resolving customers shipping concerns. Support for sales and account reps. Outside sales. Developed strong customer service skills and time management. Strong, but fair management. Co-workers all on the same page and eager to assist. Hardest part of the job was sales. Sales is not easy. Did enjoy the opportunity to advance quickly."
good,A typical day is going into the air trailer with another coworker loading the air trailer while drivers come in and having to have it loaded by pull time. Being able to joke with the drivers as we work. Than helping unload or going straight to my internationals if I have a lot. Than being able to input my internationals into the system. The hard part of the job is the loading and unloading of the packages which is just manual labor. The coworkers there are fun and easy to get along with. They are easy going and like to smile and joke as we work. I enjoy going to work being able to work and smile at the same time.
good,"UPS was a very organized, demanding company that compensated me for my sills and abilities. Most of the management, really appreciated me.
