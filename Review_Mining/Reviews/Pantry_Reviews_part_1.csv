rating,review
bad,If your a store manager don't plan on having a life outside of work. High expectations and low pay. Workweek is a minimum of 50 hours but that usually ends up to be at least 65-70 hours do to the low hours you are allowed to schedule the front desk.
bad,Absolutely loved being able to interact with the public and meeting new people but the management was horrible. This position taught me a lot about what I would not be like if I was to ever become a manager. Working with the public is hard but to be able to open yourself to appreciate the differences in people takes you a long way.
bad,"This company merge with Circle K in 2014. It is no longer in business. See Circle K review. "
bad,"I was sicker than a dog and they made me come in anyway then complained about everything i did. I went completely through the checklist the manager left me, and the manager told the district manager that i refused to do anything that night"
bad,"Uncaring management, poor pay and benefits, this job was simply a means to an end. Would not recommend for anyone seeking fulfillment..was definitely just a paycheck."
bad,People who work here only look out for themself. They do not care to help anyone. From corporate to management.  Employees only care about heir paycheck and making sure they put the blame on someone else for their wrong doing.
bad,This company is dishonest.  Does not pay you what they say they will.  Will no pay overtime if you work it.  People walk out in the middle of shifts.  Husband of owner tries to be the boss.  Horrible work place environment
bad,this is the worst place to ever work for. The manager leaves brand new hires to tend to entire store by them self after only an hour of training on the register and the drop machine. When they are call for assistance they don't answer or just turn off the phone.
bad,Manager was horrible! Showed up only for set up and 2 more times within 10 days. It took her at least 7 hours to respond about anything work related. She was rude and a bully when it came to selling the product. Payroll was horrible. Only received my 2nd check om time. The 1st and 3rd ones were at least 2 weeks late. They canceled the roadshow during work hours without a notice.
bad,"awful place to work at. All the managers are nasty to the staff and don't care about your safety you work 10-12 hours all by yourself in a gas station, just waiting to be robbed"
bad,"I worked as Asst Mngr and was told I would be on graveyard shift for a little while and then move to second shift.  That never happened.  No one wanted graveyard and I got stuck with it.  The 2nd employee that worked with me was not interested in working.  I ended up doing most of the restocking, cleaning, emptying of garbage, etc.  "
bad,I learned a lot and the people were nice.  I would have loved to stay on board.  Most enjoyable part of the job was getting to work in your own space but still be apart of a team.
bad,"People would often clock in to work whenever they felt like it."
bad,Overall this is a difficult position and working graveyard shift is very hard to adjust to.
bad,The position that was initially applied for was a station clerk making more money than the position I actually obtained and the monies I eventually received.
bad,"worst employer ever, don't care about their employees or their employees family"
bad,No benefits other then free soda
bad,"My manager did not give me 3 of my paychecks, it was some roadshow company that went state to state. Horrible costumer service and horrible management"
bad,"what a joke. Stupid management, stupid procedures, stupid policies. Working corporate support for the Pantry was the most soul crushingly awful position I've ever had. My co-workers were OK, but the management and other salaried staff were total guffs."
bad,"The management was absolutely horrible, and the hours were ridiculous."
bad,"Loads of customer service and inconsistent scheduling of my hours was a weight-loss program, so who needs they gym?"
bad,"The Pantry claims to have honesty as one of their main values that they stand for. They hire a manager that has done nothing but lie his way into his position, and when called on it, my hours were cut to nothing. Trying to get in touch with someone in corporate office was just a joke. I was promised a return phone call about 3 months ago. They are NOT an honest company to work for."
bad,"I have nothing good to say. It was horrible and I don't recommend anyone working there ever. The hours were long, management was horribly inept, pay was pathetic, responsibilities far outpaced the compensation. Favoritism among the staff, no loyalty or cohesion, and overall the worst job experience I have ever had. I resigned and the supervisor still pressured me into working one more day."
bad,"Totally a republican-centered company.  As a white female in management, it's funny how execs would assume I was Republican and talk candidly about 'those people' and 'idiot democrats'."
bad,I would not recommend it as a long term job.There is a generally a pretty fast turnover rate.
bad,"I started this position under the pretense I would be trained for assistant management within 3 months. At about 7 months I started to get a bit concerned. I spoke with my fellow employee (working ther for 5+ years) and was told he'd been being baited by the same routine for years. I also found the current assistant manager garnishing my hours for his own benefit and time schedule. After multiple complaints about prior/post shifts not doing their most basic work duties I found the manager of the location didn't instill ANY discipline in her employee's at all. The work remained undone leaving it for me to clean (as always). When I approached the manager about these infractions it was met with a cavalier attitude and resulted in fake ""complaints"" (that were never brought to my attention up to that moment). This place is the living definition of a ""horrible job,"" stay away guys! The $8 an hour ISN'T WORTH IT."
bad,everyone watches each other and tattles. Doing the job accurately and efficiently does not count
bad,"It was one of the worst jobs I've ever had. The management was that bad. There was inconsistent management from store to store, the DM would lie, it would send emails and then coming to the store in a race the email say that he never sent them. Absolutely awful."
bad,no loner open was bought out they no longer operate and has been bought my circle k no longer work due to being bought out so I rally don't know what to say
bad,"A typical day consists of the MGR and AM showing up half a hour to a hour late, and blaming others. Avoiding their own job duties, and assigning them off to others. Each employee is responsible for the previous shifts work not completed. Which translates to  being responsible for others who are not doing their jobs."
bad,"I work the overnight shift which is from 11pm to 7am.  My duties include but not limited to, cleaning, stock, customer service, inventory, merchandising, and paperwork."
bad,Not a functional environment. Sort of like our government: a lot deflecting responsibility and team work within groups or departments.
bad,The Pantry is a cheap company that values profits over employees.  I on numerous occasions worked 45-60 days straight without a day off.  I worked without breaks and I was fired for complaining about work on twitter.  The Pantry is the worst company in the world.
bad,"the pay is horrible, the managers are incompetent and make up there on rules.  had to deal with a lot of drunk customers as well as rude customers.  not the safest place to work at night but local law enforcement was always close by in the vicinity"
bad,The last manager I had was a thief and no one believed me when I tried to tell the District Manager and Regional Manager. In the end he got caught and lost his job due to him stealing a lot of money from the company.
bad,The Pantry is a good place to work if cooking is your passion. The environment is stressful and somewhat unprofessional with the advice and training given.
bad,"The management staff were never on the same page. They often overworked employees with little to no appreciation. Some employees were treated with more respect than others. Also, racial slurs were never adequately disciplined."
bad,Company has good benefits but is bringing in college grads that no nothing about convenient store work and trying to let them run the districts. That is what cost them the company and forced them into selling to Circle K.
bad,Planned weekly circle time activities and assisted lead teacher with daily activities
bad,Contractor or employer misrepresented the job.  It was presented as IT but spend a lot of time doing paper work.  Company does 0 investing in its employees.
bad,"A customer cussed me out and I got fired for not apologizing, My manager let me go after I clocked in to work. It was the greatest day I remember at the job"
bad,"In this job I learned that, you have to smile regardless of how you feel."
bad,this job is great for students wanting extra cash
bad,While working at the pantry my role was just to ensure the dish area was clean. After six or eight months of working I was put on as a cook and my job was to keep area clean as possible while ensuring my orders got made correctly and quickly.
bad,"It's like being a bartender without the tips. Management ignores important issues regarding employee safety, and time-cards are changed without notice, or consent. When concerns are voiced, management and higher ups laugh at it, because they know we can't do anything about it if we expect to keep our jobs. I am currently actively looking for a position in almost any other field than this one."
bad,"I started as a dishwasher then busser, now a cook. Still being paid as a dishwasher. The restaurant is old and falling apart, managment is never there. The co-workers are great."
bad,"This is a hard fast paced job; that many people couldn't survive doing. The owners are not very kind to their female employees, and often times you are yelled at for things that are out of your control. The owner is also very bi-polar so the things he wants from one day to the next is always differing. An example is one day if you have a complaint for a customer they might tell you to discount their meal. Where a different day with the same complaint they might tell you to tell them to never come back into the restaurant again."
bad,"I worked the 2nd shift 3-11 in a dangerous, high crime area. I was robbed repeatedly towards the end of my employment and the management would not schedule a second person for my shift to make it safer even though my sales were high enough for management to do so. I was a hard worker and was never able to receive a raise more than 10 cents. However I did enjoy the work and my regular customers."
bad,Pay is rotten. Raises are pretty much non existent. Benefits were cut to minimum and cost twice as much. Management doesn't have a clue. Shifts are swinging shifts so you can't plan anything with your family. Overtime is non existent. Employee input or suggestions have no value. Certs will not help you because the systems are so old and out dated that most people have never used them. 
bad,I learned to work with a variety of cultures and people. The hardest part of the job was scheduling everyone to their timelines. The part I enjoyed most was working with customers and gaining their respect through excellent customer service.
bad,"I was hired at min wage and did not receive a raise until min wage was raised, very small kitchen  easy to clean hard part was trying to clean the end day list and clock out otherwise manger will be upset for hours."
bad,Job is made for people in their late teens or early twenties. Not a terrible job but not something for people that want something different or better in their lives
bad,There was not a written manual with rules so that rules could be changed frequently without any notice.  The job was very stressful and did not have good leadership.
bad,Could not keep employees or even get too many reliable employees.  Someone was always calling in so the manager (me) had to fill in at all hours of day or night.  It was very stressful and I couldn't plan my life.
bad,Low opportunity for advancement.  The company lacks internal communication throughout the organization as a whole.  There is a very low work life balance.
bad,"Fast paced, room for improvement. Pay level is inadequate for market, good place to meet different people. Not enough people on job to perform duties as needed. Learned Management skills by performing duties."
bad,"I love this job, but when it comes down to upper management all they see is numbers. When your numbers are good or even great you still don't get any respect. I worked there for 3 months as a manager and never got an assistant manager. They would allow me to occasionally borrow an assistant from another store so I could have a day off. I was told that the store was fully staffed before I took the job. There was many times that I had to cover 3rd and 1st back to back.   "
bad,Very unsafe job due to working alone at all times. The management is awful they are only out for themselves and that's not right.
bad,"Daily reconciliation, deposits, inventory, ordering, vendors."
bad,A typical day at The Pantry was ok. I've learned alot here because this was my first job upon graduating high school. The management is great and friendly. The co workers where great to get along with and help eachother out. The hardest part of the job was serving a busy line of customers during lunch hour.The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know the customers.
bad,"The pantry was an okay job for me to get off my feet. The customers that I handled were all great, but the hours I had to work did not work with my schedule and the managers would not work with me."
bad,"I was the cashier and clean up guy!"
bad,Great company to work for. Benefits are great. Time off is great. Boss is great. Culture is great. No complaints from me none at all.  Work hard and see what happens..  Place is solid
bad,My job here was to mainly prep foods and clean some dishes. Most of the food items kept in the freezer were not properly dated or sealed and when brought up to management was quickly dismissed and swept under the rug. Many of the cooks left grease on the floors without saying anything which proved very dangerous as I had slipped multiple times. Cleanup at the end of the day was left to 2 people while everyone else went home resulting in an extra 2-3 hours of cleaning up another peoples messes. The hardest part was keeping a positive outlook on a place that was kept in such a dismal state.  The most enjoyable part was being able to get a free lunch everyday that you worked.
bad,"A decent first job before you realize you'd like to have some time off when you actually want it every once in awhile, not to mention people will be extremely rude to you despite your best efforts to help them get in and out of the store."
bad,This company has gives little loyalty to their employees. Managers often work 60 - 70 hours weekly. Staffing is a common problem with many managers working without assistants for months at a time. Priorities change depending on who is visiting from out of town.
bad,"My typical day at work is talking to customers, smiling operating the cashier register."
bad,"The Pantry is a corporate owned gas/convenience store. Company constantly setting unrealistic goals for employees. Raises were next to never unless you received a  promotion. Not the best company to work for, but it was a pay check. I always did my job."
bad,"Advancement was not given on the basis of knowledge, skills and ability but on personal relationships. Working for people who were not able to do their job was very frustrating. There was no assistance by the upper management either; they would stand behind their supervisors who could not do the job."
bad,It was a good place to work because a shift only consisted of you and customers. theres 3 shift to get hours. It was not much to review i spent 8 hours dealing with customers and cleaning stocking
bad,"With my years of experience  as a being manager in the retail industry and food service, I took on managing a convenient store not realizing what I was getting into when you have a 24- hour store that is open."
bad,Under table job. Just like working at a 711 or was a only smaller.  Boss eass very rude and treated his female employees like trash. Worked deli cashier stocked and lottery.
bad,You give this job your life on a platter then you are given false hope for advancement until you catch on then you realize all your extra effort was in vain.
bad,Poor execution of their mission statement and values.  Additionally far too many Region Directors are promoted to the position before they are ready to take on the responsibilities of the position.
bad,The Pantry or myself would not benefit from me giving a review as the company stands today.  Too much is wrong right now and I don't want to be the one to talk trash online.
bad,job would have been alot better if it wasn't for problems of certain district manager.
bad,This job was like none I have ever experienced in all my years of working. 
bad,I didn't know what my schedule would be like or which location I would be in.  I learned to be patient. I enjoyed serving people and most people are good. The hardest part was driving long distances and not being provided mileage. This was a commission only job! Cut throat!
bad,overall the chain is not bad to work for but job satisfaction dose depend on the owner ship of the franchisie  and how theay treat thair employees
bad,I worked as a Store clerk where I took care of daily task such as making drops into the safe to make sure that there was not a lot of money in the draw which would make you ma target for getting robbed. Clean glass doors and windows sweep rugs and floors. Mop floors. Clean glass doors on coolers. stock and front face coolers with products for sale. Clean the cooler and break down boxes and dispose of the boxes. Assembled displays for monthly promotions. Ordered Products for the store. Checked in products delivered by vendors and paid vendors as necessary.  Trained new hires. Verified references for new hires being that I worked first shift with the managers during normal business hours.  
bad,Stayed busy most of the time if you were working 1st or 2nd...but 3rd shift was more stock and janitorial.
bad,"The company paid very, very well , but they excepted so much , that is was almost impossible to get everything done in a day. The only way to complete everything was to be there at 15 hours a day, which I was most of my tenure there."
bad,"was not a very good job as I work late, husband insisted that I quit and the gentleman that took over my shift was robbed twice in one qeek"
bad,"customer service, monies handling, credit card handling, grocery ordering, cleaning, stocking. manager was worst manager I have ever had, she had 2 assistant managers *me being one* and would not allow us to do that things that we should have been doing, she would lie about things to the district manager and he didn't care, so he allowed a lot of wrong things to go on."
bad,"In the short time that I was there I noticed that I was not the only manager/employee who was stressed, underpaid, and under trained. This company seems to throw people in their job positions, sink or swim. The support that I did get was from my former co-workers. I my self just feel that I was set up for failure. I just hope and prey that I am fortunate enough to find another company who is willing to work with me to get the proper training that I need to succeed in my job field. When I do find that company, I plan on sticking with them for a long time."
bad,"The atmosphere here with the co-workers is not bad. They are opened and friendly.  The managers Ive had between the departments have been awesome to work with and has helped improved my skills over time as I am learning more things.  "
bad,Was an enjoyable job as long as the District manger wasn't trying to do the managers job. Asst. Manager was constantly trying to undermine me and my work habits. Wanted my position.  Was a very undermining company.  Sometimes I had to work 3 days straight with no break and no help. Became delirious at times from trying to Manage and perform regular duties.  Hard to get good people that wasn't constantly stealing in the Beach area.
bad,"I loved it, but the hours went from 20 to 40 back to 25 and some weeks just a day"
good,"The compensation was good; however, the work/life balance was not.  Being corporate and salaried you were expected to work many many more hours than what you were paid for."
good,Managment is un-organized and very inefficient. Treated new people and employees/workers like children or  incompetent. Under paid not minimum wage or server wage.
good,"I could work and go to school at the same time, what more could I ask for?"
good,didnt like the superviser he didnt like women at all mad every womens work/life hard to be there
good,Count and Deposit Cash
good,"I went thru more managers in 2 years then I have gone thru at any other place that I have worked.  I went thru 11.  The current manager is no good, does not have any clue what he is doing.  Co-workers are really quite crazy.  The hardest part of the job was going to work and the most enjoyable part of the job was the customers."
good,needed more hours. the food was great and the culture was awesome
good,The employer is a good company but the managers in the company were very unfair and did not give the opportunity to grow. Work hours at times were very unstable.
good,"Customer service for patrons, stocking, maintaining food items and cleanliness of store, area and property. Long hours on your feet make them hurt. Some people have no people skills. Management in the beginning was not very good, replacement was much better. Balancing your register drawer if someone else got into it and customers who told you the wrong pump and someone else pumped their gas. Vision of the pumps was obscured. Waiting on regular nice customers you came to know and were happy to see when they came in."
good,the work is ok the co workers are fun to hang with .NIce work place the owner is nice.But the salary is below minimum so it is not good if youre far from  home.
good,"went into labor at work, and before my 6 week maternity leave was up my district manager was calling wanting to know why i wasnt back at work. my baby was in the nicu and she still expected me to be at work and threaned to fire me"
good,"When I first worked for this company, it was enjoyable. I had my first promotion to assistant manager after only about 5 months of working for them. My mistake was becoming a full-time manager. I was working 10-18 hour days, and I was working 30-60 days straight with no breaks. There was very little praise for a job well done."
good,the district manager would come through town approx. once a month. gave no training or assistance to train.  she left company and the new district  changed managers at other locations because she didn't get along with their personality.  the company has since closed up the current location in Elizabeth city because the district manager said that it was too far for her to oversee and it was out of the way for her to drive from the outer banks beach area.
good,Was bought out by circle k. So nothing to really review. Dot dot fun filling characters in a razor blade between battery and the metal thing for some reason
good,"Mismanaged but customers are enthusiastic and friendly. Flexible hours and simple work, but not much room for advancement or promotion. Safe and clean work environment."
good,Overall the company was great. i just didn't care how they took care of the upper management. You never knew if you was going to be let go for no reason. I enjoyed my managers  and the staff.
good,"The duties of working for the Pantry (i.e) Kangroo Express, were fairly simple: Operate the cash register, ensure excellent customer experiences for every customer, clean the store, stock the store, keep fresh coffee brewed. The job was very simple and easy to accomplish. It was the way they worked us, however, that made it a poor working experience. Management would run a bare-bones crew to save on labor costs even during our busiest times like holidays. One person is generally enough to run the register during those times, but one person cannot possibly clean the store and stock it when they are the only one there and busy with customers constantly. Management liked to hand out reprimands for neglect of duties despite this fact."
good,"reliable work scheduale year round, lots of overtime, must be able to work independantly and wake up and be at your first location by 5 am and work late hours,, this job will keep you in shape and put your muscles to work"
good,"Assisted customers, and performed light custodial duties. I also restocked the store as needed. The hardest part was not being compensated to train or shift lead. There also where security issues. Otherwise the job was enjoyable."
good,Was responsible for helping customers and managing co-workers daily. Was robbed twice and the management would not let me leave early on my shift or seek counceling for the situation. No sympathy for personal safety.
good,"A typical day at The Pantry Inc. was mostly lonely other than the customers coming in and out, I was the only cashier there for 8 hours or more, you couldnt sit down at all and your only break was when there were no customers. I learned how to handle customer problems and i also grew great bonds with a few loyal customers. I learned how to be independent and helpful. Management varied, due to the fact that that i had 3 different ones. My first two were alright they did really well but i didnt really get to know the last one. My co-workers were cool we all got along really well. The hardest part of the job was working third shift and having to walk back and forth and gather up items to sell because we used a window late at night, and also having to keep your eye on all the people that came in and out of the store when i worked first and second shift, especially when i was alone. The most enjoyable part was the customers, conversating with them, uplifting some, helping some, up selling ittems to a few, and getting to know the loyal ones."
good,"Working for The Pantry, now Circle K, was an extremely fast paced, somewhat hectic environment.  The District Managers had unrealistic expectations of the stores, because the the regular employees tended to be unreliable and not excited to be working.  They would hire anybody they could get, creating an unstable work place.  "
good,"Loved working for them prior to the merger. The support staff was great, always available to assist with questions. Not the best company to work for anymore."
good,"I loved the work I did, but management played favorites making it an uncomfortable work environment"
good,"Working an 8 hour shift, opening stores, most of shifts are single coverage due to company cuts, long days, long hours, the people are understanding and cool. Great college job"
good,"counted daily receipts balances reports and sent information to corporate office. assisted public with purchases, loaded lottery tickets, cleaned store, stocked inventory. Most of my co-workers where great to work with, problems with not having the right manager."
good,"The first two years running a store were great.  I went through two district managers who I got along with and praised me, though were honest about store conditions.  We had a great working relationship and were moving the store ahead towards greater efficiency.  The districts changed again and the third district manager was a bully boss who would get in my face in the back and used intimidation tactics to try to get me to 'do my job'.  I took three years of this before I got so depressed that I decided to quit.  Before I quit, I tried to use the open door but it slammed back and hit me in the butt.  Other managers would call me to ask questions and my advice on issues in their stores and had nothing but positive things to say about my location, but my boss called me a slob, made fun of my weight, and had no respect for personal space and boundaries.  "
good,I had to work third and first shift for a while. I did not have an assistant. I was unable to get a day off. My district mgr got rid off all black managers. What happen to equal employment opportunity?
good,"A typical day at work began at 3 a.m and ended around 2 p.m. I'd open the store, balance the paper work from the day before, make the deposit and then open the store for buisness. I learned to deal politey with customers, manage my time between them and daily assignments. I rarely saw my co-workers outside meetings and shift changes. The most enjoyable part of my job was my customers. Knowing who and what they wanted, getting them in and out in a timely manner. It was like a personal contest. By six months i knew almost every customers by name and could guess at least half of what they had intended to purchase that day."
good,A typical day at work is very fast pase from open to close we have no breaks. I am on my feet all day sometimes the management is good and on point depending on what manager is working. The hardest part of my job was because i wasnanregular employee and worked with my coworkers for 5 years it was hard for them to do everything i say when i became manager they thought they could do everything they wanted but that didnt happen. I learned the importance of multitasking in the work place and teamwork
good,"Greet Customers"
good,"One of the most memorable job of my life."
good,"Working for the company can be rewarding, if you know the right people or can gain the company new clients to advance the company."
good,"Working at Subway isn't that bad. It can be harder then most people expect because it isn't all about just making sanwhiches. At work you have dishes to do constantly, food to prep, break to bake, charts to be filled in, and much more. The co-workers are nice but don't always do wht they need to and it makes things harder. I used to like working there but after being there over 2 years I don't really like it anymore."
good,"A typical day at work consumes mostly of assisting customers, cleaning and maintaining the store, stocking, running the register, and running reports,"
good,"Company is Not family friendly. I was taught a lot about food service , which I am grateful for.There seems to be a problem when managers are always  stressed out and employee's are able to see it ."
good,I learned to always do your best no matter what... The hardest part was trying to clean the store and handle customers at the same time... the most enjoyable would be the perks.
good,"I am grateful as I have learned so much while working for the Pantry. For a student, working in a restaurant is a good way to take my mind off school and relaxed. All my coworkers are nice and I love how I was able to meet and engage with so many wide range of personalities."
good,"There was always a lot to do, merchandising, stocking, cleaning, and of course dealing with the public.  A very fast paced place to work. Managing the staff was a great learning experience."
good,I like working there. I just can't afford it. You don't get regular raises or promotions. You work long hours without breaks. The turn over rate is also horrible.
good,typical work day was always stressful nothing would be prep so you were already rushing to get stuff done at the same time you had to cook orders that was coming in.
good,"Longs days, lots of traveling. I learned many different type of management skills. All the traveling was the hardest part of the job. Also, staffing locations with good quality people."
good,"Busy days sometimes to past the time. I learned the operations of convenience stores and support the network and configurations."
good,Was a fast paced environment.Learned alot about convenience shopping. Stock and keeping fresh product on shelves was a day to day challenge.Also the challenge of keeping shrink to a minimum was a great importance.
good,From working at the Pantry I have been able to develop my customer service skills allowing me to be more confident when working in this type of industry
good,some of management tells lies to get you in the job and cover their shifts but are not honest with you about your work hours. also when they hire new management they are always comfortable with fully giving the position over to the new person because they are comfortable with the current way things are with cause conflicts with managers and emplyees
good,"Job security was always in question, sometimes on a daily basis.  The ""bottom line"" seemed to be far more important than quality of work and general atmosphere.  I worked in the corporate offices."
good,"A typical day at work would be stocking shelves, refreshing the food, providing customer service, running the register, then cleaning. I worked night shift my entire time working with the company. Managment was not as proficient as i would have liked. There were no hard parts to the job. I always was able to do everything assigned to me and much more in a day."
good,"As store manager you work on salary.  This job requires a lot of hours, requires the handling and traveling to and from bank, of large amounts of cash. Shrink is always a huge problem."
good,Terrible company to work for they dont stand behind there employees. The district managers are very unproffesional toward there store mangers.
good,Operated cash register and talked to people every day. I had my regulars almost daily and they treated me as a friend
good,"Working with the company for the short time that I did was ok, sometime the my manager would have me do her work and tell her manager that she did it with out the help of her team."
good,"Hours goes by in minutes. Very fast paced, great job for someone who doesn't like to sit still. Advancing is on your own professional work ethics. Work/Life balance was extremely difficult, as you put in a min. of 50 hours a week and typically ends up to be 60-70."
good,"This job was very demanding. At times, the labor budgets were so  tight i was working 80 to 100 hours a week. I enjoyed the work, but felt that the company was not very concerned about it's employees, just the bottom line."
good,"I aquired some of my foundation for my managment skills with The Pantry. I am grateful for that opportunity, but there was no other real benefit to working there."
good,"Not the greatest place to work, There is too much company politics, too much employee gossiping, too much employee overturning. Some managers play favorites."
good,I think it is a good company but I have been having problems with my pay.
good,"The Pantry was pretty cool. Once you build up your own clientele, you learn so much from your customers. Management was great they tend to be pretty laid back. The most enjoyable part of the job was definitely the customers, especially on the holidays. I really cant think of anything hard, the job was pretty easy. A typical day for me was clock in, cashier for a while, clean when business died down, cashier again, clean some more and set a planogram."
good,I completed sales transactions. I liked working with the public.
good,"Cashier, stock, keep store neat and clean. Team environment."
good,"As much free reign as you had in the kitchen, the pay was not great and the head chef is pretty inconsistent with his reliability. Heard things have changed recently however, and became much more updates."
good,"As a first job, this opportunity provided me with the opportunity to learn how restaurants operates and the many different job position work together to ensure a functioning establishment."
good,"It was okay to work for them, but the company has been bought out by Circle K. I'm not sure if things are still run the same these days or not. Relaxed environment."
good,I liked working with the customers. I liked doing suggestive selling. I did not like the fact that most of the time you were there by yourself so if you had to use the restroom you had to lock up the store.
good,"this company is closed, it has been bought out and no longer exists,"
good,"It was a good place to work, but it was stressful.  I enjoyed it until I got a new boss, who had no clue how to do their job.  At that point, it was time for em to find a new job."
good,"Typical temporary assignment, traveling to stores in assigned territory to train mgrs. in new company wide retail processes. Not much interaction at the headquarters location on a daily basis."
good,The Pantry owns numerous convenient stores throughout he US and they are a good company to work for. You will be required to be cross trained and you will work multiple positions.
good,Pantry Inc was very fast paced and stayed busy with customers. Dealt with all ethnic backgrounds. I really enjoyed working for Pantry INC. I would go back if I had the opportunity.
good,I would come in and start the shift with helping with the customers and coffee making then I would open the safe count the money balance the shifts and make the bank deposits. I learned a lot about myself and other people. I learned how to make schedule and how to dea with people of all kinds. Learned how the stock the shelves and the coolers and the safe temperature of the coolers. Learned how to make an order for inventory how to send it and when it came in to receive it and put it away. Everyday was different I loved meeting all the people over the years.
good,"learned how to work independently, take the heat when clients are upset, yelling etc, met some nice people along the way. must be organized, work at a fast pace, exercise good judgement, be resourceful and can follow directions to perfection."
good,"Krystal has a fun work environment at times, it can be a stressful job at times. They don't pay a lot, but it's a good job if you need a weekly income."
good,Store Management is great but above that management is horrible and make 10x more than they should. Some of the pay that goes to Regional managers that do hardly anything could be spread out amongst the little people
good,Learned necessary skills to maintain and operate computer hardware. The hardest part was working on weekends both Saturday and Sunday.
good,"A typical day at work would be very busy, a lot of customers, especially looking for lottery. Co-workers are always good very reliable. Management unreliable. Enjoyable part is interacting with customers all day. Hardest part is frequent schedule changes at the last second or on your days off."
good,"Hard to grow within the company, misuse of management, unstable supervisor team, changes out at least yearly."
good,"Each day at work was about the same.  I was not over joyed at the location of the store, but we seem to get along good with the companies around us and maintained a very good relationshop with the customers.  I feel like our business would have been better if the company would have kept the store more modern and attractive.  The parking lot needed repaving and the store itself was very run down. Many people I talked with said they would not come to the store because they felt it was unsafe.  My co workers were the best.  It was three of us and we all covered each other.  We learned to be friends as well as co workers. The hardest part of the job was catching someone stealing and having to banned them from the store or call police and charging them with theif.  The best part of the job was the customers.  We all become to know many of our regular customers and could enjoy a visit from them as well as serving them."
good,"The experience of have to tend to different types of people and trying to sell them products. has been interesting. Management is fine he tries to give me hours to work but corporate is very strict when it comes to that. The pay sucks for all they expect out of me. Don't get me wrong its an easy job, but when they have you working by yourself they want to handle customers and pick up sales and take of the store and premises its self. It gets kind of hectic, but I still get the job done."
good,"It was one of the worst experiences of my life. The hours worked were all over the place. I might get off at 9pm one night, and have to be back the next morning at 4AM."
good,Out of business in my area but enjoyed meeting different people. I moved to management within two weeks. I did not enjoy the hours.
good,A typical day at work could be anywhere from slow with occasional increases in customer flow or fast paced with a high volume of customers. The co-workers were mostly reliable however if a coworker did not show up these responsibilities constantly got pushed onto myself or other workers. Picking up the slack of others was the hardest part of the job and the most enjoyable part was having clear and concise leadership on tasks to be completed.
good,It had its good days but a lot of confusion as well. People believe because of the size of the company that it wouldn't be that way
good,the hours was great at first but they wanted you to work work work!
good,"same as long john silvers, as manager I did scheduling, ordering, inventory and ect."
good,"•Increased store sales by three and a half percent over the previous year"
good,I enjoy working for the company however in 3 years I have not seen anyone in the region advance.  Without upward mobility there is little chance of further development
good,The guest made my day the most because they always had a funny story to tell you.
good,This job has no benefits and only pays min wage. The job is fairly easy but the security practices are not good for a gas station and could easily put an employee at risk from robberies. The stress is low unless you work the nightshift when the danger of being robbed is the highest.
good,"A typical day includes greeting all customers and trying to make their shopping experience pleasant. Keeping the store stocked and clean is also very important. A clean and friendly environment is was we strive for. My co-workers are all very easy to work with as is my managers. Standing in one spot for hours without a break can be the hardest part of the job, but meeting people and seeing regular customers makes it worth it."
good,I enjoy the customers and getting to meet new people daily. I have learned the daily transactions of a fast paced environment and working along with others in a close setting.
good,The job is fast paced. You have to be able to muti task and work quickly and correctly. You have to have great customer service skills and be able to problem solve.
good,Good customers and smiling faces. Easy access to the highway.
good,"Ongoing company, good workplace environment. Fast paced. Need attention to details, must meet deadlines."

good,"Sales representative, displaying and explaining products to potential buyers."
good,"Waiting on customers, pumping gas for older customers, cleaning and stocking of store. I learned to work hard and fast, smile no matter how your day is going. My co-workers where helpful, always ready to help when you when you needed it. I think the hardest part of this job was staying awake till 6am. The most enjoyable part of this job is that I made a lot of friends that became my regular customers."
good,"Provided superior customer service "
good,I enjoyed my time with the company and due a merge a lot of employees were displaced because of the restructure of the company.
good,"it can be a demanding job at times, you must have excellent up-sell techniques. Its not a hard job, just a busy one. As a Lead Assistant Manager, you are 2nd in command, i often find myself covering shifts that are required by the SM, and have my ""days off"" moved to the end of my schedule."
good,Company is always changing and never seems to be set for a long period of time. Co-workers make the job great and good benefits.
good,"The best part of the job is that there is always something new.  The convenience store industry is very competitive, so we are always trying out new ideas to better the customer's experience and outshine the competitors."
good,"I've dealt with between 8 and 13 bosses in my time so far, and this one was by far the worst. He didn't know how to run a business let alone his employees, so I got heat a lot of the time for things that weren't worth mentioning. "
good,"My typical day  as a restaurant supervisor - I typically handle almost every aspect of running a restaurant at its physical location. I am normally in charge of making sure guests are happy, training employees, and seeing to it that the restaurant is complying with all rules and regulations put forth by local health and government officials. In addition to taking care of guests and employees, I  might also be in charge of handling and balancing the money taken in between shifts. I am occasionally seen working at various jobs within a restaurant. I am normally able to wait tables, cook, and act as host or hostess if it is necessary."

Assist customers with purchasing decisions as well as locating merchandise, resolving customer issues/concerns and promoting products and services. Handle various transactions and payment methods while maintaining a safe shopping environment. Operate equipment, such as cash registers and related tools, to process customer purchases using appropriate procedures for different payment types and items sold."
good,"Good company to work for, only issue is you will end up with very little home life. Their pay scale is great. Being a manager requires quite a bit of responsibility. Training when given is great and can be applied to other positions in other fields."
good,The pay was decent. I enjoyed customer ineraction. The job was entertaining.  I have not worked there in awhile and is now owned by Circle K. I liked the atmosphere and felt safe.
good,I enjoyed working close to home and the managers I had while working there were great it's just that with no benefits and no overtime allowed workers came and went faster than you could learn their names = always getting called in on days off or asked to stay a second shift because an employee either didn't show up or didn't bother to call in.  They treated me wonderfully but I had to relocate.
good,Daily routine consist of receiving calls from stores and helping them fix register and back office issues to the best of our abilities before escalating issue to senior specialist.
good,"A typical day at The Pantry is fast paced and focuses on a persistent strive for perfection. I learned time management, gathered cooking knowledge from senior cooks and absorbed responsibility. The management is fast paced, knowledgeable, hardworking and friendly."
good,"Typically my position would open the day counting lottery,money and reports starting at 430 am.the store would be busy,register non stop. Coffee would be made every 5 minutes and gas pumps would be operating. It was usually hectic in the mourning. By afternoon the lunch rush crowd would come in and eat up all the hot foods and play lotto. So it was busy again for an hours or two. Just about time to go home, when the store was calm and clean,the second shift person would call out, and I would expect to work a double.i learned to multitask and please customers at the same time. The busy day was the best part of my job, but working when nothing was functioning was hard. People got mad at the person behind the counter for power outages."
good,good for begining career in management. Not for young mothers.I was able to do many aspects of the job. I managed a very high volume district and I also had the oportunity to teach shrink and P&L classes to managers within the region.
good,Fast pace environment to work in. Sense of urgency is very much so needed for this job. Co-workers and all worked as a team at all times to keep the business afloat.
good,"The team in the store was great. The store manager worked with us and with our schedules."
good,Everybody are friendly and team-player. I do enjoyed working at this place and I gain lots of experience but I need more schedule more than once or twice a week or once in other week.
good,"RIng up customers, Suggestive and upselling products dealing with over 20 customers within an hour."
good,Fast paced work environment with long hours.  A great job for someone who likes working with the public. A decent opportunity to advance if you put in the time and effort
good,"When I worked at The Pantry, it was very stressful for me.  I did a job that 2 people should have been doing.  I made a lateral move from my previous job."
good,My favorite part of this job was getting to know all my customers. Most of them were regulars. I still say hello to them when I see them out. They made my day great.
good,"working for the pantry was a great job, now that the company was brought out by circle k I find that it is not a good match for me. on any given day I will travel an average of 200 miles and work on walk in coolers, freezers, air conditioners, kitchen equipment as found in a Dairy Queen Subways....."
good,"Works closely with stakeholders and members of the IT department to perform business and systems analysis for projects and support inquires.  Involved in system improvements and automation that are strategic in nature including: Construction and Store Planning, Facilities, Real Estate, Operations, HR, Accounting and Finance."
good,I learned some of the ins and outs of working at a gas station. Hardest part of job was not having no breaks even for the restroom.
good,"-Store walk "
good,"this was a good job. but the crash of the country caused me to return to maine, where my safety net is located. nothing bad to say about this"
good,"10 hour shifts or longer, responsible for hiring, training, and evaluate, executed inventory counts, control shrinkage, keep clean, well-stocked, high demand items on hand with back-up, and customer-friendly store"
good,A typical day at work is all about customer service. Making your customers feel Welcome  when they enter your store. When in Retail its all about making your customers happy and creating a safe and friendly work enviroment by working as a team with your employees.
good,"overall this was a great place to work, there is always something to do the bad thing is if the next shift didnt show you are left there working a double"
good,I was a very good manager and worked with all employees I did payroll scheduling all employees flexible eyes for everyone ordering groceries stocking shelves some housekeeping
good,I have learned new cash registers operations.  Fast paced enviroment helps the day go by quickly.  Customers are friendly and pleasant
good,"Dealing with different sorts of customers throughout my shift really brings to attention how much i love being around people in general. You learn so many different things on how to stock and ring up customers in-between, and really learning to manage ones time in-between customers,cleaning,and stocking the coolers/products. With the employees I work with, all have different attributes on how things should be cleaned or stocked. I take those attributes and make them  my own. The hardest part of the day would be mid-afternoon to late evenings on certain days. I say that, because depending on which lotto is playing that night determines whether or not we'd be super busy. I enjoy this job because you get to see the same faces everyday to the point where you can remember ones order! And also because you make new friends, I know i have."
good,"Assistant sales Manager covers store while manager is gone. Long shifts and basic skills with computers, printers and registers."
good,"This company took the chance hired me with no experience, I learnt fast and we always had fun at work. It was great making people's day and felt rewarding  the employees were great, the owners of what was the chilliwack location were not honest and why I left."
good,"a typical day at work would be serving the costumers and doing dishes since they never brought one in. what i learn was all the different foods they had on the menu. the management where over too friendly getting into personal business and always asking why they were actually talking time off the hardest part of the job was to be there by myself and being busy and getting annoyed that you werent aloud to call in people to help you out, the most joyable part of my job i would have to say was the people who came in and made  you laugh when you needed it"
good,"If I did not  have a family, this would be a great job for me. The hours are very long."
good,"As a manager, I trained employees and oversaw the general retail operation."
good,Manger is amazing. Benefits are not good and the people i work with are amazing. The hardest part is the hrs i have to work
good,Pay is minimal at best. Managers do care about you though. Customers can be rude and there isn't much you can do about it. No protection at the counter if a dangerous situation arises.
good,"running cash register, communication with others, stocking shelves, keeping coffee fresh,"
good,I loved working here and helping people. The manager sucked but the employees were great
good,"My grandchildren where going through a hard time and I was working PT. I told the manager that Social Services was going to take the kids away from there mother and that I couldn't work nights and weekends for a while until things were straightened out. This was on a Monday or Tuesday. A co worker had just retired and I asked for some of her daytime hours and was told NO. I asked to just be a coffee hostess in the early AM hours and was told NO. When the new schedule came out at the end of the week, The manager had me down for Thurs. thru Sunday 3 to 11pm. So I had to quit for my grandchildren to be able to be placed in my home instead of fostercare!"
good,"A work day at the Pantry was never boring, They trained there staff well and taught you how to do your job properly. I enjoyed working for the Pantry because of serving different types of people and knowing that it was up to myself as their server to give the customer the best experience and great service would get them and others by word of mouth to come back again and again. There was not a hard part working as a server or while setting up for a banquet or the clean up it was all worth it to see customers have a good time and enjoy a meal, Not many places have good service any more."
good,Customers were pleasant
good,"I loved working for this company, because I LOVE convenience store work. I volunteered to work overtime. I learned everything they'd let me learn, because I wanted a management position. I could get people to come in and work when they wouldn't do it for the store managers. That's because they knew I WORKED! alongside"
good,I took this job just to work part time but ended up being the Assistance Manager which was highly stressful but I did enjoy it. The customers were very nice.
good,A fun work place and was always productive. Workers are great and happy. Just not enough workers during dinner shifts. But overall was a nice place to start at.
good,"Loved the customers, had many regulars. Learned some basic assistant management skills. Depending on the manager it was great.Co-workers were king of negative, like some managers and you cant be like that in a customer based career. Nothing was hard. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers, and the ability to provide excellent customer service to see them smile."
good,"typical work day is preparing for rush hours"
good,Answered incoming emails and phone calls. Dispatched out service work orders for all Maintenance related issues. Followed up on open work orders and reviewed bids for approval.
good,Interaction with my customers on a day to day basis is what makes work worth doing. The smiles that I can give them and that they give me truly make this job worth it!
good,"The pay was awful. The hours didn't compensate. Management was way too lax. I was put in danger countless times on the job. Fights broke out in store with no warning, buildings in complete disrepair."
good,"A typical day at work includes interacting with a variety of customers,  providing them with fast and friendly service. The typical shift also includes insuring that the work are is clean and safe for employees as well as customers. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing a customer leave satisfied after each visit."
good,The Pantry is a company that has many different business. They provide a good chance to start woking but not a place to work for the rest of your life.
good,This is a gas station/convenience store. Your main priority is waiting on customers. You are also responsible for stocking and putting away inventory.
good,Had a great experience working there. No job advancement and needed more hours. Great coworkers looking for advancement and better pay. Management was good.
good,"It depended who I worked with. It had its ups and downs. My favorite part was working in the cooler, and some great regulars."
good,"I enjoyed this job tremendously, the location that I worked in was a small town that would usually have the same customers on a daily basis. Getting to know each one and what they wanted was great, feeling as we were all family. The company was doing its best as at that time the economy was struggling."
good,"I was a dishwasher that would help bus tables then wash all dishes, pots and pans. I would throw all trash and would also help prep some things then store them in the freezers. I would help with anything that was asked of me."
good,"Answer and review all incoming calls and emails, rating each one on a priority system to dispatch on a time table. Based on provided information ask critical questions to expose possible causation of issue that requires specific type repairs before dispatch.

good,"I learn how to handle pressured time, during the peak time. Management is good."
good,"Most of the time you had the same faces everyday to where I learned some of them by name and would greet them that way by name. And if I was gone more than two days the customers would ask where I was. I stock coolers every night, front faced the store, clean and make coffee all night long. Price changes, put up sale signs, count all the cartons and loose packs of cigarettes everyday. Help do morning paper work print reports ."
good,"Work was fast paced, high volume of people at any given time. There were many different roles to perform there, from running the cash register to stocking the floor."
good,"Nothing special about the job, it was a basic entry level job at a convenience store and subway. I enjoyed it mostly because it was close to home and I was able to make a few friends."
good,Good company to work for. Fast pace environment more so at lunch and night time. You learn to interact with people. The most beneficial part of this job is meeting new people.
good,"The management team was really unprofessional, the co-workers were really nice and gave a good working environment, the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting the customers!"
good,Not a difficult job. Fun atmosphere with your regular customers being the best part of the job.This is a job where you get paid to talk to people. Toughest part of the job is getting to learn the lottery system.
good,Great place to work besides a decrease in hours available. Meeting new people everyday makes it a great environment to work.
good,"*I audit paper work when stores send in there information."
good,"A typical days of work i clock in about two o'clock pm or earlier. First a break down the salad bars from breakfast which is about 60 items of veggies, fruits, and pre made salads and lettuce. Then i begin my prep for the day which also includes fruit, veggies lettuce for my line and shrimp, chicken and turkey. After all my prep is done i go around and ask all my co-workers if they need help with anything. Since i do this I've learned how to make (omelets, prepare shoemakers, turkey burgers, and pizza,). Then its usually break time after I've helped someone and after break we open for dinner.At the end of the night I'm responsible all deserts such as cakes, pies, and ice cream. I sale them.  I don't have any part of my job that i can consider the hardest because i enjoy it all. "
good,"Great team! Flexible hours with overtime available. Currently I am planning, creating, and dispatching work orders"
good,"I started as a cashier. I assisted customers with whatever the need was. I ran the cash register, cleaned, stocked, and did a little suggestive selling. Eventually I became a shift leader. This consisted of me over seeing other workers, exchanging monies, making deposits, and paperwork."
good,"Love this job but it doesn't pay enough. Customer service, cleaning and stocking."
good,"kinda dangerous but not very hard pay is louzy"
good,An enjoyable work environment with a small town feeling where everybody spoke to everybody else. The management team was excellent.
good,"Great schedule, easy going employees."
good,"I worked for the Pantry in the Myrtle Beach SC area for years. I loved every store I worked in. I especially loved the management and crew at the Surfside Beach SC location. Just like family. We sold everything that a vacationer or local would need such as groceries, gas, medical supplies, beer, lottery, and I always did grocery day because of my organizational skills and readiness to get the job done as quickly and efficiently as possible. My manager always asked me to train new employees because she knew I knew my job forward and backwards. My job offer with the SCDOT ended this position."
good,"A fun environment to work in with each day varying."
good,I enjoy working with people and I seen a lot of the same people everyday along with many new ones. I enjoyed supervising my employees and helping my customers in every way possible.
good,I love the work.  I feel you get paid way to low for the amount of work you are required to do and with no breaks.
good,"Nice working place"
good,My work was over night so I was always by myself.
good,"I worked alot of late shifts that drained me. I was always nervous of who would walk in and I never felt safe. If anyone else was working with me, they would find something else to do and keep me on counter taking care of customers. The best part of my day was going home."
good,There were so many of them they never kept you in the same place long. I did not like that because you never really get to know your customers or your surroundings.
good,"Very fun atmosphere to work in. There is always something to be done, in this retail store."
good,"The Pantry aka ""Kangaroo"" is really committed to servicing the customers and community. They are active in the ongoing troubles and celebrations of the local community life by providing food sales and charities to soldiers and their families, Christmas gifts and food on Thanksgiving, car washes, bake sales, as well as low prices and open availability and conveniency for their customers. It was truly a joy interacting with customers everyday!"
good,"I actually started working for The Pantry, Inc. in 1987 as a Real Estate Representative. The department shut down for 1 year and I was the only one (of 10 reps) to be rehired. I held several positions including Director of Real Estate & Construction, but primarily was the sole manager of site acquisitions and divestitures of non performing locations and vacant land-banked properties. For the past 10+ years I worked from a home office with very little clerical support from Corporate. I traveled most of the 13 states where Pantry/Kangaroo convenience stores are located. The most enjoyable part of my job was using my people skills and negotiating contracts. The hardest part was knowing when to ""shut it down"" for the day!"
good,Serving ppl customuer complaints . Nice place to work
good,I enjoyed my job there a lot. I just had a boss who had no idea what he was doing. AS management is concern they sucked
good,Listening to customers talk about their problems and were they are going .How to be more understanding of others.Manager was a very good person to work for.They were sometimes easy to work with when they did their job . when some ones drawer came up short.When customers are more happy about their service and how things are taken care of.
good,"The Pantry strives to be the best in customer service. Every aspect of the job, and every decision made, is based around how it will effect the customer. This is both good and bad. Employees need to constantly on there toes and basically bow to any customer demand. Failure can result in termination, on the spot, no if and's or but's."
good,"I spent the day washing dishes, cleaning floors and providing support to other staff when needed.I learned about time management and teamwork. Run well, good communication. The hardest part was keeping up with the amount of work. The most enjoyable part was working with others."
good,"I learned a lot in this company as a pantry cook, especially since it was my first time working as a chef cook and not washing dishes. The employees and the managers are very fun but also focus when it gets down to business."
good,"ring out the customers, as efficiently and quickly as possible. Meeting new people will always be a challenge and getting to know them even more. But what a joy!   At the time of transferring to my last location, the store was having major problems with management and I was asked to come and help out. I have always felt that the team of co-workers was the best. We helped each other out in times of need. Tho it was not a true daily chore, leaving the people was the hardest part of the job. meeting and knowing the people of Yalaha Fl was the best, serving them with the best that I could possibly do for them."
good,Each day started out differently. It really depends on what I end the day before to know what the next day will start out to be. It was a very busy and steady work load that kept me very active all day. All of the work had to be done by the end of the day on Thursdays. We worked 4 days a week at 10 hours per day. Very productive.
good,"A typical day for me varied because you never know what kind of situation you can walk into as soon as you clock in.  I like working in a gas station because their are a list a duties that need to be done throughout the day, everyday, to keep you busy, there was hardly ever a dull moment when you stay busy.  Upper management did a great job in training me, and in less than a year I had been promoted to assistant manager.  As policies started to change and new management came in, it was a little difficult to switch from the old rules to new rules.  You become custom to doing things a certain way and there were clashes between a few people and new management.  The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting, talking, and helping new people everyday and conversing with regular customers."
good,10 hours days worked a lot of weekends got paid every week. really liked working for my manager. Co workers very down to earth.
good,"Meeting friendly faces. "
good,"Love working with the public, it gives me a great feeling to be able to help people."
good,"My day in work would start by preparing the café for opening with a co worker. Cooking the bacon and sausages and other breakfast items to be kept warm in the bane marie. The tables and chairs would be placed outside and the café would be opened. My colleague would be in the kitchen preparing the meals that have been ordered and I would be front of house taking orders and taking payment for meals and beverages ordered. I would take beverages and food orders to the tables and ensure that tables and condiments were kept well stocked and clean. I got on very well with all of my co- workers and I am still in contact with the manager. I enjoyed meeting new people and the hardest part of the job was the long hours that I worked e.g. I worked 8am till 5pm. As you are on your feet for a long time and they get tired, also there was a period in the afternoon when it would be very quiet. I enjoyed working at the café as all the staff were so friendly and everyone got on with each other."
good,"The most enjoyable part of this job was getting to meet a variety of new people and have them leaving this store with a smile on their face. I learned what it was like to not only work in a convenience store atmosphere but also what it was like to aide in running one. I feel that there are some areas of management that could be worked on. I fit right into this job as if it is what I am meant to do. Unfortunately due to extenuating circumstances at home (a very sick child) I had to take some time off and my job could not be held. The hardest part of my job was making the decision to let this job go. The most enjoyable part of this job was getting up and going there everyday. I enjoyed the people I worked with as they did me, and I enjoyed my customers."
good,was not a bad place to work but you work more hours than normal but get paid little
good,I loved the fast paced environment. The rewards and awards recieved gave a personality of recognition for hard work.
good,"learned a lot of great things in management, food service and inventory very corp orriented very unpersonal"
good,"Upper management needs more training and experience on in store procedures, and how to accomplish tasks. Most have been hired from outside the job field and have little, if any, knowledge of how to operate a store on a daily basis."
good,The management team for this store was very good and the location rocked
good,I enjoyed my job even though I lost my position in a corporate downsize. Only company I worked for where operations did not drive what happened in the company.
good,"Very fast pace and definitely Continuous customer base of all types of people very interesting"
good,"Great place. Enjoyed working with the staff."
good,"no room for advancement, no benefits everyone is part time. management is great owners are horrible. co workers are great if you don't make anyone mad."
good,"Worked as a cashier, then an assistant manager, and store manager for this company. The pay is good but when you're in management they expect alot from you and it can be stressful when you don't have good employees to help with the process"
good,being a manager for The Pantry is hard work. You are a salaried employee and do not get overtime. You also are on call 24-7-365. If someone calls out and you cannot find a replacement then you have to work. The people I hired were great and we all were like one big family.
good,staff all got on well together and worked as a team..Management could be stressful at times when it got busy but everyone pulled together to make cleints have an enjoyable night out
good,"Responsibilities include receiving payments by cash and credit cards, counting money in cash drawers at the beginning of shifts to ensure that amounts are correct. Further responsibilities include maintaining a clean and orderly checkout area and completing other general cleaning duties, such as mopping floors and emptying trash cans."
good,This company was enjoyable to work for. I started off as a regular cashier/employee and within 2 months I became assistant store manager. Six months later I became store manager and managed my own store.
good,"A typical day at work mostly consists of greeting and checking out customers, in between,side work such as, cleaning bathrooms, stocking coolers,sweeping and mopping."
good,The three years that I worked for the Pantry were very nice. I really enjoyed working with every employee and coworker that I came in contact with. I still remain friends with a lot of them.
good,If you enjoy working with the public then it is a great job. Management varies with each location.
good,"Customer satisfaction is a priority at the Pantry Inc, as a manager, one is expected to set the standard. Co workers are fun working with, because we respect each others views. The hardest part of the job is dealing with a customer that is hard to please, and the enjoyable part of the job is dealing with people."
good,"Normal day at work would be coming in, getting the til opened up for the shift,ringing up the line that had formed, and then stocking what i could between customers. slow paced when u got a break but very fast with the rushes. Learned how to run a simple P.O.S. as well as the other functions of the gas station. Got better with the people of the town. Management when I got there was good. Higher management wasn't so great. My co-workers were great to work with and we helped each other out a lot. The hardest part of the job was to manage to get everything done between the rushes, and the enjoyable part of the job was working with the other employees and seeing the people from town that I had gotten to know coming in the station all the time. "
good,Supporting 8 Fuel networks on 2 POS platforms creates a very complex and challenging IT environment
good,"I worked a low volume store which pushed us to reach sales goals, critiquing customer service and up selling skills. There was various stocking and general cleaning both inside and out. Being the assistant manager I had to review other shifts work and delegate accordingly. I also completed daily paperwork and reported to the home office before the deadlines. The hardest part of the job was balancing the work load between ever changing volume of sales. I enjoyed the customer service experience and challenges presented in management the position most of all."
good,loved working here for the most part..got to meet a lot of good people. It was always busy.however my position as assistant manager got taken from me while I was on family leave.. overall good job
good,"A typical day at work involved ringing out customers, ensuring that the money in the register and credit card machine was accurate and up to date, cleaning in slow times, and handing out waiters' and waitresses' tips at the end of the night."
good,I loved my job and as you can see I was with them for over 8 years I had family problem and had to leave. I would have gone back to work for them but they don't rehire no mater what so I am looking for a job.
good,"Typical work days at The Pantry would consist of arriving at 9am and washing the equipment used by the bakers or taking in deliveries, however there was a lack of shifts that I could I work as well as being in education at the time of employment which ultimately led to my departure of the position"
good,"Learned a lot and enjoyed my 27+ years at The Pantry, Inc. / Circle K.  It was a good place to work and earn a very good living.  I am well prepared for any opportunities presented as a result of my years at The Pantry, Inc. / Circle K."
good,Good place to work if you enjoy helping people from all background and ethnicity. Side jobs are not hard either. Plenty of stores in your area to choose from.
good,"I would like to find a company that promotes within, will value the opinion of their employees along with respect their employees for the work they put in. I am also looking for a company that understands that their are times that things happen with families."

good,"Great job and I enjoyed the company and people tremendously until we got bought out and everyone was laid off.  Professional, dedicated, teamwork and nice offices."
good,"- Very short hours with little to no income as a host/server"
good,"Although I do not care too much for the benefits or how ""secretive"" The Pantry conducts some of their business which directly involves employees; my overall experience has been rewarding. I landed an average job with average pay upon employment. Hard work paid off and I was able to advance within the company as there are very many advancement opportunities for almost anyone who is willing to work hard. As with many companies, there are difficult bosses and difficult people but there are also great ones. The good outweighed the bad for my experience here."
good,I worked for The Pantry for nearly five full years.  I went all the way through the levels of management.  I started as an Assistant Manager and was a District Manager before I decided to cut ties. I enjoyed learning while with the Pantry and appreciate the opportunities that I was given in the company.  The management teams I had all had great insight and my peers were the same way.  I have nothing but nice things to say about a company that gave me so many opportunities through the past five years.  I will however say that the company was just recently bought out by Couche- Tard and I do not know where the Pantry will be in five years as a result. However the transition goes I wish everyone the best of luck.
good,provides good products and service to customers. Hard to find good help and when you do it can be an amazing place to work. I had some of the best employees
good,the bosses / owners are good people. have been in business for 40 years. some things wanted done at work is not possible. love working with the customers
good,- Helping customers
good,"The one thing I loved most working at the pantry was getting to know my customers on a everyday basis. Working for the pantry has taught me patience, motivation, and self emprovement. I enjoyed learning new things within the cmpany and discovering new ideas on how to take our store and company to greater heights. Training my employees on an effective sales operation was also a plus. The most complicated part of my job was dealing with lazy employees. I believe it takes a team and everyone in it to achieve goals, and when someone doesn't put the intiiative in that you know they are capable of, it get's pretty frustrating."
good,"Overall, the Pantry is a good solid workplace that offers competitive wages and hours. It does seem they outnumber their competitors by 5-1 in and around our community. This speaks well for the company's growth and stability, but offers no real competition or alternative similar employment."
good,"The Pantry is an interesting place to work, due to the fact that there are a number of different functions and positions one can perform for a small, but busy, locally owned business. The front of the house ranges from stocking and registers to barista and deli positions. While the back end is comprised of prep cooks, meal prep, and an entire well known and popular baking establishment."
good,I would recommend working here because there are opportunities for job position promotions and there are benefits. There are always job duties to perform. At times it is very fast paced and most of the time the employee will be working by themselves.
good,"Enjoy even though it is hard for me, but reality i need to grow and my inspiration are my family. Family in the kitchen field and also our real family. Love our work and enjoy it."
good,The ability to have a conversation with people while you are working is wonderful you are able to get that here. While working there I enjoyed going to work and seeing the regulars of the store and meeting new people who were just passing through. This is a tough job but that is what made it fun.

good,"Changing gas prices, maintaining cash register, stocking shelves. I learned to check inventory. Management was supportive and hands on. Co-workers for the most part were eager to work and knowledgeable. Hardest part of the job dealing with irate customers. Most enjoyable part stocking the cooler."
good,"This was a great managing opportunity for me, and as an associate clerk as well. There are stores that are well managed where you feel you would never leave, they just need to provide benefits for their employees and better security measures. The hardest part of the job were the hours because you are on call, but the most enjoyable part was being able to put smiling faces on guests and employees!!"
good,"I love customer service so I thrived at this job.  It starts as part time but this is a company that loves growth.  It is definitely not cut out for everyone because you have to be self motivated.  management is not there to  monitor you throughout your shift so you must take control of your shift and handle the crowds.  I hope you do not mind drunk people as well because that is part of the job.  Good job, and a good learning experience if you take it serious."
good,I typically work 50-55 hours a week. A lot of requirements and high expectations. Good employees are hard to find and keep when you can't pay them what they are worth.

good,"I worked here for 13 years and all though many hate working with the public I loved it. A typical day at work was always providing speedy service and fresh coffee as I worked the A.M. shift. Once done helping out my fellow coworker, I would start on my paperwork and in between check on my crew and vendors. I would make a list of what needed to be done for the day and all of the crew, including myself would complete it. Every day there would be different tasks: cleaning, stocking, checking in vendors, banking, gas spills, training new hires, there was always something. We all worked as a team and communicated very well making things very easy on all of us. My coworkers were great! The key is to find what someone is great at doing but also finding their weakness and encouraging them to become stronger. The hardest part of the job for me was running out of challenges. I had been to 3 stores and had raised all of the sales in each one until I had the highest volume store. The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing my customers and my crew. They were like family."
good,The Pantry was a good work place with personable management and knowledgeable staff.
good,A nice company to work for great benefits customers are nice and friendly Co workers are great Not enough money for all the different things they change every day.

good,A typical day at work would be seeing familar faces of guests who come in for coffee before work or while on break getting their snacks making sure that their visit is a happy one and help them if they werent able to find what they were looking for.  The co-workers were like family a great bunch too work with.  The hardest part was losing some guests due to death they had been like family.
good,"Fun to work, co-workers are easy to get along with, customers are great."
good,"Good job.  Working alone and can be scary depending on the area you work in.  Pay was ok, but the overtime made it better."
good,My review for this job would be a - out of 10. The only thing that burned me out was the every weekend and and working in unsafe conditions.

good,Fantastic manager who created opportunity for advancement within the organization.  Culture was relaxed and friendly.  Work load ebbed and flowed but was slow paced the majority of the time.
good,"I would go to work, if it was busy I would prepare the dishes but If it wasn't then prep work. I was always working never a single moment to relax. I never made a big mistake so the mangers liked me."
good,A typical day at work for me is going in  early to get the pass on and I have learned how to communicate well with others and I have had great experience working in management as a Team leader and working with co-workers is a great experience but some of the co-workers can be a challenge but the hardest part of the job is miscommunication sometimes and the enjoyable part of the job was taking care of others need and wants with a smile on my face and knowingly at the end of the day I can go home and rest good.
good,It is a relaxed place to work. There is more to do than just standing behind a register. The managers are accommodating if requests are with in reason. Most stores have a small staff of 5-10 employees which is nice. All stores have their set regular customers that come in on a daily basis and they make it worth your wild.
good,this company has great oppurtunities to move up. it is a very structured company

Despite my humble position, my fellow coworkers acknowledged the value of my work and that gave me confidence in my position and urged me to push myself even harder. This was my first job and it was the perfect environment for a new worker to get comfortable with work culture, to identify personal strengths and weaknesses, and to set the standard for healthy work relationships."

I liked meeting customers old and new that come into the store and most of all travel. I also kept the store clean and checked the gas pumps during shift change. I am good with people people"
good,"A small little place, the Pantry is a good place to fill in. I worked as a dishwasher and a busser whenever I was needed to fill in to help the servers on a busy day. The food is good, but the owners are ignorant in running the restaurant, and the manager takes the fall."

Other than that was a great job, they could step up their training for new managers so it's not so hard on some good managers to take care of their store."
good,This were my first manager job and I enjoy working for the pantry. There were some challenge but I oversea everything. I turn a store around and made it to be a successful store. My skill and hard work pay off. My supervisor was a outstanding person. She aloud me to make changes to the store if need but as long as it was with the company guidelines.

The hardest part would be when I had to cook for 9 tables at once. Enjoyable part would be finishing and cleaning up"

good,"The Pantry aka Kangaroo, was a gas station. I started their as an cashier and in six months I was an Assistant Manager. I typical day consisted of ten hours and an 50 hour week. I learned a lot working here. If it wasn't for me relocating I feel that I could have really grown with this company. The hardest part of the job is when one thing was off and it threw all the paper work off. You could be over in money and coming up short on paperwork. Then you have to go through every thing you inputted in the system to find out where your error was. Sometimes taking at least and hour or more and paperwork needed to be in by 9 AM."
good,I would say the pantry is a great place to work if you nee a few extra dollars here or there. However if you need a constant job it's not for you. It really depends on the season for how many hours you get.
good,Great staff and amazing customers. Always busy and on your feet. Only open until 4pm so that could be hard to manage with school. Management is well organized.
good,i liked working at the gas station. it was a fun environment and the time wet by fast. the manager was not a good people person. i would go back but not on 3rd shift.
good,Fast paced daily work. Learned more details of payroll. Our team was great and manager was always there for you. I mostly enjoyed the training to process the payroll for the team. The hardest part was getting all the time cards in from the stores on time.
