rating,review
good,"I got the opportunity to work for P&G later in my life (over 30) but was the best decision I have ever made.  I achieved more than I ever thought possible; gained competencies and skillset that would not have been possible elsewhere.  Benefits, retirement plan is essential for retirement years.  I would not have the retirement account that I have today without P&G."
bad,The worst people i have ever meet they didnt care about you at all. You were just a number. It was very dangerous to work there lots of violence between employees terrible pay and long hours with no break
bad,the work environment is horrible & so is the pay. when its hot outside its ten times worse in the warehouse & when its cold outside its like Antartica & the air condition doesn’t work. they say you’re going to get paid 12 an hour but you only get paid $100 every week
bad,Don’t treat employees very good or give out raises to those that deserve them. Have terrible communication and don’t respect the employees at all whatsoever
bad,"The management is horrible. The job is simple and easy, but people does not treat the lead right. The workers work lazy and be on their phones. Its just horrible how the workers act."
bad,Negative work culture. Do not allow easy advancement of position and did not encourage advancement. Hours were not the best (12 hour swing Shift). Generous vacation time.
bad,This company  have not good  salary  & nothing  chance grow up. I did 4 year in direct  marketing.  They told do work  dedicatedly  promotion  will happen  but since for year they didn't promoted me.& no growing salary
bad,Work you too hard for 8.00 and hour and no raise some people have been there for years and still making 8 and hour. Needs to go up on minimum ways for blacks people to make a decent living. Sad
bad,Worked both as a temp and as a contract employee in warehouse and driving shunt truck. Contract only. No benefits. No real managment structure. Little training but expect you to know the job. Blame game all the time between employees and mgmt. Company only cares about one thing - profit. Closing best plants and teminating good employees for bottom line.
bad,The rules are ridiculous. they don't pay enough for the work they want from you.i don't like it there plus the line captains are not professional or polite to fellow workers they think there above everyone
bad,I enjoyed working for Procter & Gamble it was a factory job hard work constant work and easy work work with others to get the job done work as a team and never doubted each other
bad,Had to leave had bad plantar fasciitis my manager didn't care was being treated terribly wouldn't train me anywhere else. Asked if could get on full time but without them not letting me be trained other areas to get signed off not point staying in situation like that.
bad,Negativa gestione del personale.meritocrazia inesistente.scarsa organizzazione .tanto lavoro e poche ore a disposizione.
bad,"Low morale, high nepotism with managers protected and technicians abused. Not a healthy work environment. Not family oriented or care for employees at all."
bad,I don't feel like they care about their employees anymore.  It feels to me like they only care about the bottom dollar and I feel like I am just a number to them.  Many other managers have said the same thing to me.
bad,"If you are being paid by the hour...do not work here.  Company gave out .34 cents for annual raise.  You must use your own car and get about .15 a mile.  This company is lost.  Also, if you are not a part of LGBTQ group, you have a zero chance of advancement."
bad,always working always no home life balance to show
bad,Worked there for a few months and ended up leaving because they took me off the lift and kept putting me on the line when i was suppose to be gettin my certification to get my raise
bad,"I felt as though I sacrificed far too much for this company without ever seeing a return on my ""investment"". I constantly got roped into the 60+ hour work weeks, and never felt satisfied with the work I was doing. I was working an internal IT position, more specifically security related, and I never found time for myself or my family. I've since moved on and found a much more fitting position elsewhere, but I would absolutely never recommend this company to anyone."
bad,"It is just bad, you are over worked with less pay than the people that are sitting in the office. Just leave that job alone if you are trying to make a living."
good,"I got the opportunity to work for P&G later in my life (over 30) but was the best decision I have ever made.  I achieved more than I ever thought possible; gained competencies and skillset that would not have been possible elsewhere.  Benefits, retirement plan is essential for retirement years.  I would not have the retirement account that I have today without P&G."
bad,"The full time staff are the bosses and the temporary workers get paid half the salary but do all the work and get none of the credit. Only full time employees are given benefits and vacation. Fellow employees treat each other badly, it's like middle school all over again, taking behind your back, telling your boss on you and not working together to get the job done. It came to no surprise to me to see that the brockville plant was closing."
bad,No comment. Was only there a few months. Employees were very nice and helpful. The company had not moved into it's permanent facility and were located in the local community college.
bad,"This job pays pennies and work you like a slave! This is the most ghetto, unorganized warehouse I have ever worked at! The managers are young and dumb! They watch you from upstairs through a window  all day! Everybody on drugs or alcoholics!"
bad,"Not recomendable. The pay is terrible, line leaders give the worst task to those they like the least. Poor training, barely any breaks (just one in the morning and lunch)."
bad,"I started working for the company in Jan. 2018 my manager was very rude towards women and did not want to believe anything you said. He didn't know how to communicate he was very rude and extremely disrespectful. When you bring this up to other managers or your HR department they didn't get involved and told you to figure it out yourself. The work load that was placed on me was completely unrealistic. They demanded your work to be done by the end of the day regardless of how much it was. My manager was never around and when he was he was either smoking or ""in a meeting"". The place was just completely unstructured and there is no advancement opportunities. They claim you move up to a manager position in 6 months to a year and it's just a lie. The only pro was the other technicians because they were honest people."
bad,"As the summary said, I worked at the Mason, OH location for two years. There were 20 temp-contract workers for every P&G employee. The contractors were hired through Advanced Testing Laboratory and were paid between 12 and 15 an hour. Some people held masters degrees or a phd and were making 13/hr. That is not ok."
bad,There to strict and there is no one that cares for there employees they treat people like slaves and expect so much with out giving the slightest bit of concern for a persons personal life
bad,"Lack of leadership, inconsistency with weekly hours, lack of stability..i It was a Great deal of Turn over Within The Company,  and Lack Of Stability."
bad,I finally had enough with the horrible culture of man hate sexism at Gillette when they started demeaning men in their marketing instead of just in promotions and pay.
bad,"Had to work every Saturday, did not get paid enough and the work was hard such as lifting. They sent you to different lines almost every day. Main supervisor, bad attitude and very unprofessional."
bad,"Working at the Dayton Ohio location is horrible. They lie to you during the onboarding about schedule, pay, benefits & work environment. Was told would be limited overtime but yet we worked 13 days straight & a mandatory 10hr shifts on second. Managers are fresh faced kids who have not had an ounce of management training in their lives. The work load is consistently updated to keep you from doing your ACTUAL job & if you ask managers how to do it they have no clue. They just sit at their desk on computers and look at numbers. The production people drive themselves mad trying to please them. We’ve had people pass out, one guy almost had a heart attack, workers leaving in tears due to frustrations. Managers choose to yell & attempt to demean you to make themselves look good. Very toxic site & they do everything to keep you from moving on which after you’re hired they tell you that you’re not allowed to move sites. I’m sure the company as a whole is great but the Dayton site is a horrible representation of the company. More than 75% of the employees are actively looking for other jobs. Be mindful please!!"
bad,Terrible. Honestly you shouldn't work here unless you are very good with ignoring people. You get yelled at for anything small. They treat you like you're supposed to know what to do even if you're new.
bad,The management team has no experience and there is no opportunities for advancement.  The management team has no problem lying to the people on a daily basis.  If a person decided to work there plan on being on 2nd or 3rd shift for years and years.  The company treats each person as a number not a person at all.  They show no loyalty and couldn't care less about anything that you have going on with your life.  You are nothing to this company
bad,didn't work there long bad staff and good workers long day and nights can work weekends and dont geive no time off at all and you do what ever you like
bad,If you are on a technical career path they make it impossible for you to do what you want to do and make the money that you deserve to make while other people that do way less will make more money than  you. The company is about doing more with less which means you will have to do your job and the jobs of three other people too while keeping a few production lines going for the least amount of pay possible. Everything you do will be scrutinized and you have no say in your work schedule as they will always do whats best for the business not you. They don't care about you they care about their numbers and if you aren't meeting the goals they are not going to be nice to you. They will set you up to fail.
bad,Poor management the allow harassment and intimidation there is no one to go to they all cover for each other Their was a lot of favors going around if you snitch on other employees then you were good if not you were a target
bad,They would put you on this rider. You never drove one before. they did not ready train you in the right way. They would say here you are go for it. Then when you mess up or run into something they want to let you go.
bad,"packing tooth paste all day ,there wasnt nothing hard bout the job mix culture everybody work at the same paste,breaks was to short,they had a lack of commuction"
bad,"Disrespected by all staff, and expected to run until injury occurs. Dirty facility. No such thing as safety. Bias authority everywhere. No system to abide by at all. It was always how much you were liked by those put in charge. I was talked to like a dog multiple times here. I'm glad it's closing down."
good,"I got the opportunity to work for P&G later in my life (over 30) but was the best decision I have ever made.  I achieved more than I ever thought possible; gained competencies and skillset that would not have been possible elsewhere.  Benefits, retirement plan is essential for retirement years.  I would not have the retirement account that I have today without P&G."
bad,"P&G is a company where your advancement will depend not really on achieving results, or just making yourself look good. You need to make others look bad."
bad,"there are long 12 hour shifts, mandatory overtime and they have a bad system put in place to where in order to succeed you have to lie and cheat to make it by,"
bad,having to work as a team with everyone lacks picking up someones lack team work to complete assignment bad communication no help when needed quick short break no lunch
bad,The company itself is okay but it was just a way to come up with quick money. The management sucks! You don't have time to live your life because you're there 24/7.
bad,Managers are recruited with no people skills or previous employment.  Work schedule is very unpredictable making home life hard to manage. Job is very stressful.
bad,"In st louis mo the plant is very clean, that's my nice thing to say. I was given the things I needed..venilator, gloves, protective eyewear and was told we would do paper work later. Later never came. I was shown probably about 2hrs on What to do. Men and women disrespect each other it was awful the conversations they had. Apparenyly the leads run the companies temp service. They seemed always angry."
bad,"No room for advancement, stuck at 11$ and could not get anything higher. There basically was no job culture there, you just did your job and went home. Nothing exciting, nothing changing, same work every day."
bad,"We would sit in the break room for hours on end with nothing to do. After three hours of just sitting there, someone from management would come in and say, ""There's no work for you today, you can all go home"". This happened twice a week. We never got more than thirty hours a week. I've never seen a Fortune 500 company run as poorly as Procter & Gamble is. I could've done a much better job of managing the work staff in order to get the most out of the production department.."
bad,"Quan ly ko có trình đô và cach quan ly ko phù hop.hay thay đoi nơi lam viec,chê đô luong ko chính xac"
bad,I really enjoy the independence the jobs give me. i also like meeting and building a rapor with store managers it makes you feel like you are independent but also part of a growing successful team
bad,"Empresa con buen ambiente laboral"
bad,If you enjoy being treated like the lowest form of life this is the place for you. They force you to do things outside of your job description with fear of loosing pay. The offer no Medical insurance only major medical. The pay is low compared to surrounding companies
bad,Would no recommend this for steady employment  to many coriteens.There is not enough money for what is asked of us as employees. They are in the mist of trying to get it together.
bad,"They hire anyone. Then they try to pawn off all the worst jobs on someone else. Work on high lifts, scrape paint and wash building before painting. Outside the whole time."
bad,Was placed in jobs for a week at a time and maybe worked a day..never again will I ever work for this company again.. you don't ever get enough work!!!!
bad,"This is the worst place to work, the mangers do not know what they are doing and the cuss at the workers you are standing on concrete for 12 hours or more with no mat's and there is no safety out there flights are broking out between the workers and staff. they only have one restroom open and its all the way at the front of the building and that is a 5 to 8 minute walk if your working in the back of the building."
bad,"Pessima empresa para trabalhar."
bad,"co-employee policy was very strict, I am surprised we used the same restroom.  Very un-ethical. Temp assignment, P & G would not hire anyone at that location."
bad,this was a pretty decent job...the managers are very unprofessional...the job is easy all you are doing is counting inventory for diff stores..everywhere..its okay but some of the people will make you hate the job.
good,"I got the opportunity to work for P&G later in my life (over 30) but was the best decision I have ever made.  I achieved more than I ever thought possible; gained competencies and skillset that would not have been possible elsewhere.  Benefits, retirement plan is essential for retirement years.  I would not have the retirement account that I have today without P&G."
bad,Good for some. Not good for others. Strong company. Good people  good brands.  Nice working envirmemts. Work from home option.
bad,"Hired in to take over existing accounts I had established  only to be given Western Kentucky and Illinois. Made Cold call on salons, provided product demo and classes. Managed salon inventory and set up displays to make my products stand out from the competition."
bad,Don't really like it there because nothing is ever organized or you wait hours on end for one product or warehouse can't find the product because they didn't put it back in the right spot so it delays everyone else.
bad,"there's only a few good things I can really say about this company , but right now I can't think of any. it's not really the job that's so difficult it's the management."
bad,"Unprofessional !! My first day there it was a fight . Not a safe environment to work , everyone is childish . Not good at all"
bad,"&G is a very good company to learn , forecasting , business plan  etc."
bad,"Was placed at P&G through an agency and they were the most rude and condescending people to their temp workers! Treated with no respect, called ""Adecco"" regularly, as if it's your name. As a temp you can't speak to P&G employees so you're an outcast..... You're expected to sit in your corner, do your work and not talk to anyone! P&G Managers have no clue what the temps do or how they do it, so as an agency supervisor over the temps, communication is aweful with P&G managers! They implement rules and process changes w/o knowing or caring  how temp employees are affected. They Actual P&G employees didn't even have high moral! Aweful place to work as a temp!"
bad,did not like the people management was not good at all. the company dont care about the people. wat wat wat wat. not fun to work at .i hated it after addecco took over it went down hill.
bad,"I learned most of the works in this company."
bad,Loading and unloading material from truck and storing in racks in warehouse. to stay focus. management was all right.  co-worker work together to get it done.   when the load is turned over in a truck. when the truck is unloading all skids put in proper racks.         THIS IS ALSO A TEMP JOB.
bad,A typical work day was generally ran at a fast pace. I learned how to operate various machinery. Most importantly I retained supervision skills of twenty people at once.
bad,"P and G treat the contractors that work for them horribly. When they have tours from other business people, contractors are not allowed to be seen. Who keeps their oil spills and dye spills cleaned up? THE CONTRACOTRS!The contractors are the main people who keep machines repaired and running. Contractors keep their business clean, and presentable. Yet p and g treat us like we are outcasts! The contractors of our local are Spalinger,United,Challenge,Sodexo,Abm,All Star staffing, Lacosta, and Avi. Thank you for your work contractors!"
bad,"•a typical day at work"
bad,They contract out their quality control lab.  Not science based at all. Poor management and when you walk around the plant you see highly-paid mill employees sleeping.
bad,Do not care about employees. Low pay and benefits. Fortune 500 company who got where they are by cutting corners and outsourcing.
bad,a typical day at work was unloading boxes and watching bottles . what i learned is how they make soap. the managment taught us. the coworkers were always lazy. the hardest part of the job is having to do the stuff when the machines were down. the most enjoyable part of the jobis watching how the soap is made.
bad,"This was one of my first warehouse experiences where I first learned to use a pallet jack, shrink wrap machine, and we all had fun working together."
bad,"I worked in a factory ,it was hot in the summer and cold in the winter . My co-workers were very childish it was always a bunch of he say she say stuff going around ."
bad,This company has been a joy to work for. I have been with them for over 10 years. They have kept us well informed concerning their expectations of us. The work has been varied and enjoyable. They have provided proper training for us to accomplish new projects. They have provided us with a handheld computer to take to stores for purposes of scanning and inputting of information.
good,"I got the opportunity to work for P&G later in my life (over 30) but was the best decision I have ever made.  I achieved more than I ever thought possible; gained competencies and skillset that would not have been possible elsewhere.  Benefits, retirement plan is essential for retirement years.  I would not have the retirement account that I have today without P&G."
bad,"He is very unprofessional behavior from the senior here and does his salary "
bad,Sold out big style to make sure we didn't get our full pension entitlement and with less workers protection from our government than the germans we got screwed happy days to minimum wage
bad,Sold out big style to make sure we didn't get our full pension entitlement and with less workers protection from our government than the germans we got screwed happy days to minimum wage
bad,They ignore your experience and education.  Whoever adheres to the multilevel marketing scheme like culture here will receive a promotion!  But wait there's more!  They also will promote you without a pay raise until you complete a number of tasks with specific people who are never available or cancel your appointments so they can go eat lunch with their friends.
bad,"Too busy worried about new people coming in, they've forgotten about the ones, who been there since day one. We don't have the same opportunities as the new hires"
bad,"Dangerous. "
bad,Production lines are short staffed so it's hard to be adequately trained in the time frames that is expected of a new hire. Males are sexist and racist.
bad,"This job is not fair,there's no growth or advancement.I pray that this company develop patiences and leadership role.I would never every referral anyone to work here"
bad,"Possibly the worst job experience I’ve ever had. They tell you a set hourly wage and never pay it to you, make working hr promises that they can’t keep."
bad,"It was a job that got you a pay check,you got no benefits,no payed holidays. The management played favortism,and my co-workers were lazy and a lot of the time I did 2 people jobs."
bad,P&G was a 12 hour shift job 6am to 6pm and very hard job hurt your arms from putting boxes on the line and unloaded semis. Other than that it was and alright place to work. Just hated going through all star staffing to work at p&g
bad,Era bueno trabajar ahi. Se ganaba bien hasta que dejaron der a las personas como eso personas
bad,"Strong culture of cronyism, promoting and protecting people based on politics and not actual productivity. Field assignments: expect long working hours 10+ hours per day. No commission or rewards for exceeding your sales quota. Very small percentage of workforce will see a promotion/significant career path."
bad,"Un día típico de trabajo un área muy buena ya que estuve en el departamento de cobranza, un departamento el cual  me dio mucho aprendizaje, el ambiente de trabajo era muy bueno debido a que todos trabajábamos en conjunto , lo que mas me gusto del trabajo el aprendizaje que se obtuvo, la gerencia es muy bien llevada y siempre a la disposición  y ayuda del personal"
bad,They are moving out of Boston. P&G ruined Gillette They blindly try to impliment outdated manufacturing methods.
bad,Mi sono trovata malissimo..... purtroppo facevo un lavoro pesantissimo
bad,"As a plant technician at the Greensboro location, you switch shifts every 2 weeks. 3rd to 2nd to 1st. Due to this there is little work/life balance. You start with $15 per hour and it is ack breaking physical labor. If you want to make more and do less, apply for a management position or something administrative where you’re in an office setting."
bad,"Disorganised group where the management and staff are in a separate entity. No communication, no respect for staff."
good,"I got the opportunity to work for P&G later in my life (over 30) but was the best decision I have ever made.  I achieved more than I ever thought possible; gained competencies and skillset that would not have been possible elsewhere.  Benefits, retirement plan is essential for retirement years.  I would not have the retirement account that I have today without P&G."
bad,"Horrible place to work would not recommend, unless you want to be treated bad. But lots of opertunity if you know the right people. And most management are clueless about the issues going on."
bad,I worked for proctor & Gamble via a temp service. I did not enjoy my time there at all. Most likely Because it was my first job. I worked the 3-11 shift.
bad,"Their talent management system for local offices is different than their main business. My experience was with a local office serving a major retailer. The talent management system is not based on aptitude or performance but time in chair at the location. So a person can come in with an MBA but they will be hired at a lower band and pay than a fresh Bachelor's degree holder from their selected ivy league colleges. Then they have to serve 'time in chair' despite their interest and performance; to move further. The management at the local office treats you with no respect and has no interest in your career goals. If you speak up, they will construct a careful plan to eradicate you."
bad,Terrible environment.  Not willing to help employers develop skills.  Not enough hours.  HR would loose your check.  Not once or twice but several times.  Just terrible all around.
bad,Very poor place to work in. Management was terrible and there was no room for advancement and there was favoritism.
bad,"The team at Bournemouth were brilliant, a wonderful place to work. The management at the Skelmersdale Distributuon Centre however, are a completely different kettle of fish. If you're happy with intern's putting you in an office to deal with any issues then take the credite for everything running smoothly this is the place to go. After 5 years of being there, the site leader didn't know who I was or what I did there. I was the SAP Business Process Owner. I was the SAP Systems Support Owner. I was the Inventory Systems Leader. I was the Organisational General Controls Leader for the UK and Nordic markets. I was the Systems Access Leader. I was the SAP Security Administrator for Skelmersdale and London plants. I was the SAP Master Data Analyst for Skelmersdale and London. I was the SAP Key User. I was the CHEP pallet account owner!!!!!"
bad,"I was terminated without explanation  of my side of the story, I was subjected to mistreatment of supervisors. Blamed for things i did not do nor commit."
bad,"Terrible place to work. If you did not have a engineering degree, good luck!!!"
bad,Hard work and 12 hour days and no more than 40 hours sometimes 32 and sometimes 24.
bad,Its a part time job in what they call the flex center.Very boring work.There are diabled people working there and they treat everyone like u have a mental disability.
bad,A typical day at work:- first day of my joining
bad,I ejoyed working at a fast pace. The work was not hard or strenuous
bad,"Only strong refrances entertained if anyone join them as 3P employee then he is not a human they treat him like donkey"
bad,You start the job with hope and excitement thinking you’ll make good money and be judged and make advancements based on your merits until that dream of being happy is slowly crushed and whittled away until there is nothing left but an empty shell of your former self. I’ve seen it not only happen to myself but several other people hired after me. I’ve seen more people get promotions  based on how big of a game they can talk compared to actual skill. I wouldn’t recommend this job to anybody but brainless sheep.
bad,"- long work hours"
bad,Nothing to add at this time and I seem to have to type many more character to be able to continue. Therefore I will type the minimum number of charact
bad,Financial rewards must be provided to experienced employees actually doing the work.  Reduce the number of middle managers and reward those workers.  Downgrading roles from within and hiring massive interns will not bring industry experience and ownership desperately needed for P&G to be great again.
good,"I got the opportunity to work for P&G later in my life (over 30) but was the best decision I have ever made.  I achieved more than I ever thought possible; gained competencies and skillset that would not have been possible elsewhere.  Benefits, retirement plan is essential for retirement years.  I would not have the retirement account that I have today without P&G."
bad,"Proctor does some things very well and others they just continue to do the same things expecting different results.  They have an excellent safety record and safety programs.  If you aren't careful you'll be drinking the HPWS/IWS cool aid and it's all over after that.  It's unfortunate that really smart, well educated people stop thinking for themselves.  Not a set of balls among the entire middle management staff.  Not even a halve a set."
bad,i worked part time in what is called the flexi center.It was always cold in there.Worked with a lot of people that have mental disabilities.So found my self doing the work of two people most days.
bad,Not challenging enough and had a lot of trouble with tuition reimbursement cause all of that is contracted out to Costa Rica.
bad,"I am not getting paid what they told me I would be. Constant changing of shifts and nothing is done by senority. Can advance at the company but there is no more money for doing so!!!!! Management has a serious lying problem with all employees. Company's point of view, "" you don't like it, there's the door."""
bad,"La jornada laboral es muy desgastante el salario no corresponde a todas las actividades que se tiene que realizar, es una empresa que exprime al máximo al colaborador sin importar, las consecuencias tanto de salud como social y familiar."
bad,The training was very poor and the managers got rid of you if they did not like you. HR was trash and were biased against employees that may have took a little longer to learn
bad,"You work 12 to 13 hour days. Your work is managing temp workers who do not care about their job. You get 1 paid break and 1 unpaid break. Turnover is extremely high. Work loads do not change with turnover, so the same work gets done with less people. Upper managers are out of touch with conditions on the floor."
bad,"If you aren't part of their groups/cliques, they'll do anything they can to get you fired. There's a reason they've never had layoffs. They'll look for any reason to downsize/fire people."
bad,"they fire people with zero evidence on the word of another person? never let anyone there know about anything in your private life, it'll be used against you"
bad,The pay is low to support a family and after 5 years the only way to continue to get a pay raise is to become management. Also your pay won’t increase year to year unless the one that signs off your step up cards like you enough to do it. Doesn’t matter if you can do the job only matter if your liked. Very poor design for pay raise.
bad,"Go somewhere else ... Seriously!!! The culture is corrosive, they can't even keep an HR manager. This place is a JOKE! Plus there is always mando OT ... you will HAVE to work 6days a week 72+ hours every week!"
bad,"Lack of real leadership, treated like school children, managers will micromanage EVERYTHING, take credit for every good thing, but take no blame for the bad. 12 hour swing shift sucks, pay and benefits are decent, used to be fairly competitive, but not anymore."
bad,"Focus on lean manufacturing principles with very little value placed on process engineers.  Process Engineers are present with a view to become people managers, no chartership support which means you're moulded into the company's ethos and it's very difficult to branch out into other fields"
bad,They always said that they balanced work and family but all it really was about every day is the bottom dollar no matter what.  They lied to the employees about life changing events.
bad,1982 plant. No confidential info here. I would not recommend apply for a job there. 2006. I was like a kid in a candy store due to my experience & training. But I was not P&G certified. Powers that be don't see training.
bad,"Infantile management, straight from the university with no work experience or clue. Constantly moving target for success, needlessly stressful, rotating 12 hour shifts."
bad,"If you are willing to have very poor quality of life to get the pay and benefits they offer then this is the place for you. Very long unsustainable hours and will be relocated for months for training, also will have to move out of state if you want advancement. Climbing the ladder depends on who you know. Favoritism is rampant and absolutely no work/life balance.  Culture is very toxic and disingenuous."
good,"I got the opportunity to work for P&G later in my life (over 30) but was the best decision I have ever made.  I achieved more than I ever thought possible; gained competencies and skillset that would not have been possible elsewhere.  Benefits, retirement plan is essential for retirement years.  I would not have the retirement account that I have today without P&G."
bad,"Good company to work at and very professional.  Great training programs and compensation however, work-life balance is very difficult to maintain.  Office environment is not especially motivating."
bad,It was a fast paced job and easy work. Poor upper management in supervising employees. Supervisors were always playing favoritism. You do not get the same supervisors every night so you have to deal with the different environment.
bad,Lack of experienced management. Bad combination of training and real situation handling. It is very hard to progress if you haven't apply for internship
bad,"Good environment for work where i can utilize my skills for "
bad,Since joining employment at Proctor & Gamble I've learned to work well with others. My days went by very smooth lo some days its didn't feel like I was at work because my coworkers became family and we made it our duty to make eachother feel like we were home
bad,"Es una empresa que brinda  armonía laboral, a si mismo exige para q las labores sean realizadas aun 100%,  incentiva a sus  empleados creando en ellos una seguridad diaria para realizar su trabajo con el mejor agrado."
bad,"This company is not family oriented as they clam. They keep you on a rotating shift to prevent you from advancing your career. The good workers get treated badly, the sorry workers who sleep all the time are make a lot of mishaps still get advancement while you get stalled."
bad,Management does not know what to focus on. They are more focused on making their mark in their 2 year roles. They also lacked accountability which allowed for a bad culture to set in.
bad,"Each day starts with multiple meeting to go over previous days results and plan for the current day. In the afternoon we would have another meeting or two to discuss how things are going and the plan for the coming night. There is typically no time for a break. Maybe a working lunch. We spend a lot of time talking about how we are going to get better. The main issue is that leadership lacks the ability or intestinal fortitude to make the call the move forward with those plans. They are so afraid to fail that they would rather the status quo remain the same than try something else. To add to that, no subordinate leader will give feedback to their superior. There is a genuine fear of retribution."
bad,"Eles dificultam ao máximo para que você não receba uma promoção e tenha um plano de carreira solido, tentam limitar sua vida ao máximo. Horrível."
bad,They work you to hard for the little pay they provide. They also do not fully train you in different sections before just throwing you in that area.
bad,"In my specific department, management seemed to be burned out and always came in to the office huffing and puffing about everything going wrong from the moment they stepped in the office. I worked my tail off and was willing to be there for them and help in any way possible. However, their office was a stressful place full of brown nosing, competitive, and back stabbing co-workers and managers. A couple of us that didn't fit in were singled out and made out to be ""not fit"" for the job. Managers lied profusely about things I had or hadn't done just to get me pushed out of the job. It's a shame because it seemed like a good company to work for at first, but seeing as how they allow a department to fester in that kind of putrid environment it made me realize it was not the company for me."
bad,It was a temporary job that was most of the time fast pace. I learned the process of ordering and distribution of major corporations. The hardest part of the job was when things was a mandatory and the process of dealing with employees that lacked in responsivities.
bad,Management have favorites. Supervisors are terrible people. They sleep with lower level employees to make them favorites. Barely any English spoken.  Most terrible job I ever had
bad,poor management they wont advance you if your African american they talk about opportunity  but there is no opportunity for a regular employee. best advice just go and get that check and leave
bad,A lot of overlooking the important things until last minute or too late.  Not enough of responsibility of for incorrect actions of the facility.  A lot of cover up.
good,"I got the opportunity to work for P&G later in my life (over 30) but was the best decision I have ever made.  I achieved more than I ever thought possible; gained competencies and skillset that would not have been possible elsewhere.  Benefits, retirement plan is essential for retirement years.  I would not have the retirement account that I have today without P&G."
bad,"No communication"
bad,very interesting place to be for starters because they have a solid foundation with basics of how a person needs to know how to work in an industry. Team is very friendly and committed to working
bad,It’s was a very good work place and environment  i just felt under paid but it’s a good team great communication and it made my have a good work ethic
bad,"This was an awful job, hours and shift sucked especially when you have a family.  Pay was ok but to get a raise was nearly impossible unless you knew the right people.  You ALWAYS had to watch your back because someone was always watching every move you make."
bad,Pay and benefits are great.  To many chiefs not enough Indians.  hours are long and your entire life is dedicated to this business.  When your not working with them your partying with them.  No family life.
bad,"My typical wor day didnt start till 11P.M which was reasonable "
bad,Great it was a good opportunity it was only temporary  nice place to work strict on work policy had to be on time it was never just a day at work when working there
bad,I worked hard and had great success at P&G. I went to go ride with a rep and began to have intense abdominal. I was admired to the hospital and was told by my bosses at P&G not to worry about anything and that they would support me. I was diagnosed with cancer. On my first day back to work I was laid off after following all of there procedures and being paid company sponsored short term disability. The company is fun at first but they do not care about you atall.
bad,The management is horrible. The plant got a new CEO last year and since then everyone has been getting in their own way trying to brown nose and make a name for themselves as far as management is concerned. The place needs a union.
bad,"Probably much has changed since I worked there.  The politics were not for me.  There is no standard (e.g., laboratory instruments are not calibrated, the calibration stickers are years expired, the methods are not validated, the documentation of scientific results is haphazard and varies per supervisor)."
bad,"Management changes frequently, as do goals and targets. Stressful, mandatory night shifts, mandatory overtime shifts. Weekends, holidays, no way to project work sched more than a week ahead."
bad,Just a hard job heavy labor. no benefits. to hot in thesummer always new workers so i always had to trin somebody. i hate to wear steel toe boots they hurt my feet.
bad,"I was there everyday I was scheduled worked my hardest to show initiative, reliability and dedication only to be let go for a 11 year old mistake. also hours are not reliable or any positions."
bad,"we worked under difficult conditions, in extreme weather because we were in semi trailers, we had long shifts, and inept managers. we worked for a staffing company that provided inept managers and supervisors who mistreated workers and workers who regularly did not do their job. it was a difficult job"
bad,I very much enjoy my role. The company is supportive and I've had an opportunity to grow and learn.
bad,"people was not working ,loud crowed and unprofessionaly the whole day.no where to sit at lunch no where to put your food ..no where to sit in the morning when arriving to work ,wait an hour to start work in a crowed cafeteria  ,line manager dosent know what he/she is doing most assignments we just stand around and wait .."
bad,I don't feel I could give a fair and impartial review given that I was only a contract employee.  Treated very different from a actual full time employee.
bad,"working 10/hours at first. got to work, went to my belt line worked the whole time. got a couple breaks plus lunch break. Great people to work with. Made some friends. the hours weren't the greatest but it was a job. Packaging the product was easy to do not to bad."
good,"I got the opportunity to work for P&G later in my life (over 30) but was the best decision I have ever made.  I achieved more than I ever thought possible; gained competencies and skillset that would not have been possible elsewhere.  Benefits, retirement plan is essential for retirement years.  I would not have the retirement account that I have today without P&G."
bad,"worked 12 hour shifts driving a reach fork lift moving product to shelving areas."
bad,"did not like 12h shifts"
bad,There was not enough to do and the job scope was not clearly defined after I accepted the position.  I was not able to be included in the remote team activities and projects because of the remote factor.
bad,"From 8.AM to 8 P.M"
bad,Muitos dos colegas de trabalho tiveram problemas de saúde devido ao ritmo de trabalho e pressão.
bad,"This was the worst job ever.  The pay is bad, the management is even worse.  The long hours left no time for any thing but the job and sleep.  Fast paced environment with an excess of slow paced workers"
bad,"always enjoy work in rural place,learned how to complete as much as outlet in short time,working on route basis,distributor and outlet handling,focus on primary and secondary"
bad,"I get there in the morning by, 6:20 a.m. and wait for the supervisor to assign me to a spot on the line, if there are no spots on the line she gives me two hours and I go home. When I work the full day which is  6:30 a.m.-2:20 p.m. I usually pack boxes, stack the pallet or fill the hoppers up with make up products it's easy work. I've learned how to stack a pallet and use a hand-jack. My supervisor is very unorganized and shows extreme favoritism , she doesn't call me to let me know when I'm not needed I live in Woodlawn and my job is in Hunt Valley and it is very time consuming and frustrating when I go out there for nothing. I really don't talk to my co-workers I stay to myself and get the job finished. My  favorite part of the day is my 40 minute lunch break because I'm able to eat and re-boost my energy and see the outside for a while , being somewhere all day without any windows can be depressing. Which leads me to the hardest part of the job , which is working in a facility without windows."
bad,"Prestadora de serviços - terceirizada os representantes dela so apareciam na Cia, em época de pagamento. Os donos ficavam administrando suas maos de obras em um predio fora da Cia. Então se tornava muito difícil contados com os representantes da mesma."
bad,I like proctor and gamble from the get go and then later down the road I started not to like it so much. They just hire anybody and the company is so unprofessional.
bad,"I didn't mind the hard work one bit, but management never had a clue what was going on. We spent more time waiting for them to figure out what we were supposed to do, then we did actually working. When we would finally begin working, we wouldn't have half of the product that we needed, So we would continue waiting."
bad,"Unloading semi trucks and loading onto assembly lines, Manger was nice, Nothing really hard about the job."
bad,I had a good time working there untill they removed the only fast paced line they had in there. The other employees were not very kind and kind of snobby towards anyone who was new.
bad,concentrated
bad,"I found it very frustrating, as a temp you are put where there is a void and no one really wanted to take the time to show me how things were done. so I found myself asking alot of questions."
bad,Nothing  stands out.....nothing was great about it......no real hours.....not enough money....team leaders were rude....just wasn't a good experience for me so I left and im a hard working young lady
bad,Kansas City plant hires family members. The plant is racially bais. There are very few minority groups that work there yet the minority people are terminated at a much higher rate
bad,"There are too many temp employees.  I believe that there are more temps than P&G employees.  If you are a temp you are treated as sub-human.  The staffing companies don't care if the managers are qualified, just subservant."
good,"I got the opportunity to work for P&G later in my life (over 30) but was the best decision I have ever made.  I achieved more than I ever thought possible; gained competencies and skillset that would not have been possible elsewhere.  Benefits, retirement plan is essential for retirement years.  I would not have the retirement account that I have today without P&G."
bad,Would not recommend low pay and require hard work. No grace period no sick time benefit high for one and withhold bonuses... keep looking before accepting this place...
bad,"P&G just want the money, they could care less about what their 3rd party companies are doing inside of their busniess. Very unprofessional enviorment, if you had a dollar for everytime your check was shorted hours you'd be rich. they act as if they cant purcahse equipment for you to do your jobs, they rather  fire you. turn around rate is CRAZY but the money is good if you can get OT"
bad,"nothing good to say...i wouldn’t recommend, bad management, horrible hours, lack in leadership, pay rate progression is hard to obtain, if your not with the in crowd you will be held back..."
bad,A typical day is started by stretching and telling all the employee what needs to be done all day. Then u would go on a line and wait for them to send baby wipe pack down the line.
bad,"Typically would get to the office around 6AM, by 815 my entire plan for the day usually changed 4 or 5 times.  Wouldnt be able to actually do my job until 4 or 5 at night because of the paper work that my bosses wanted.  "
bad,They have work sometimes. But most the time you get sent home because they have no idea what they are doing. Race decently is a problem. Theyre line lead only pick you if they are of their race. Witch is not fare because most of them are Spanish witch is fone but they do not pick white people. So the white people and some blacks get sent home because the line leads obly stick with their race
bad,The company has gotten away from the values that made it a great place to work.  I feel the company is going in the wrong direction.
bad,Boring work rude team leaders no cooperation little bit friendly with old people and not new co-workers normal not that friendly though
bad,"Working in the Pet Care division for 2 years, I've never seen such mis-management of brands and incompetent managers.  The culture is very stoic, it's a ""do it our way and don't question why"" atmosphere.  If you push back or have an opinion, you are an outcast.  They are looking for robots, not people with personality and individual thoughts."
bad,"P&G does not have a strategy for growth. The workplace culture is one that is unmotivating. Upper management does not care about the employees well being or work/life balance. There are too many systems in place to get simple tasks done, and all systems are convoluted and slow. Not a lot of technical advancement (i.e. some employees still use Office 2003)."
bad,There is no ethics only challenges are there and noone will help you out nor they will listen to you.They will only ask you for bussiness and if you wont dilever they will terminate or ask u to leave...No job security in this organization.....
bad,"20 years at P&G."
bad,"Spv di garut tidak bersikap adil, dy hanya mengutamakan orang2 yg dekat dengan nya, hadiah program banyak yg tidak sampai kepada konsumen"
bad,The corporate philosophy stresses an excessive interest in diversity.  They aren't nearly as interested in competence.  You had an extreme advantage if you shared you were LGBTQ.  This was much more important than any skills or job-related experience you could offer.  There was little interest in understanding what you offered to the role or how you might advance the goals of the company.
bad,"Flexibility yes, clocking up 1000’s km in your own car yes, expected to complete 10hr days because of travel time yes, not paid for time in between travel yes, minimal communication or care from management yes."
bad,One of the worst managed companies I have ever worked for. Babycare side takes short staffing to a whole new extreme. Plan on not having a life outside of work if you come to work at Cape Girardeau plant. Forced mandatory overtime consistently
bad,Management should listen and be more understanding of line related break down issues not everything is a 30 minute fix. And no need for being rude to maintenance technicians
bad,The management takes out more of you than it compensates. It is extremely difficult to get ahead in Procter and Gamble. Most of the management changed in one year.
good,"I got the opportunity to work for P&G later in my life (over 30) but was the best decision I have ever made.  I achieved more than I ever thought possible; gained competencies and skillset that would not have been possible elsewhere.  Benefits, retirement plan is essential for retirement years.  I would not have the retirement account that I have today without P&G."
bad,They didn't give me my check until a mouth later knowing I have children to take care off. I was pregnant working there and i didn't like it so i stopped working down there so that they wouldn't have to work me like a cow.
bad,"The pay is good enough to get you stuck here. The hours are long with mandatory overtime, atleast 1 of your days off, no holidays off, schedule always changes. Super stressful environment and negative/toxic atmosphere. Anyone will stab you in the back to get their advancement or their way in general."
bad,Place wasn't bad at the start. them the new GM came in and it went downhill from there. Upper Management showed up for 15 minutes and told 20 bosses they had 2 weeks and then they were done. A few were offered the opportunity to go back the floor making half or less than what they were. Not for me!
bad,They was alright pay was on point'I think i could work for the company again.People i worked with was cool we all got alone we ate lunch together. Some of us road the bus together
bad,"Normalmente a empresa funciona com uma hierarquia excelente, mas não é tão simples acessar a gerência assim. O ambiente de trabalho é maravilhoso, diversificado, sem restrições a nenhum espectro humano seja credo, seja cor, seja classe social, todos se respeitam e criam um ambiente leve e cordial."
bad,"If you decide to except an offer of employment, be vary wary of workplace competition. Save as much of your income as possible. Greedy managers and deceitful employees can be very dangerous. And above all- keep a sharp and wary eye on Human Recources. They are NOT your friend!"
bad,"Après avoir effectué 18 moins dans cette entreprise."
bad,"Poor quality management, unprofessional. Treated with unkind words, expectations unreasonable, poor work environment, never paid for ad min time even though I was owed that time..manager neglected to tell me to report Ad Min time."
bad,"12 hour days, split weeks, repetitive strain, occasional opportunity to work other P&G plants but 12 hour days and no days off for out of home site anywhere from two weeks to ? Typical warehouse operation, no room to advance."
bad,"This business unit of P&G is the high end fragrances. 90% of this business unit's management team does NOT support the employee. The work life balance, well there really is nothing to speak of."
bad,"It was my first job coming out of school. It was simple enough and I didn;t expect to make it a life just a means until I found something better,"
bad,"Este empleo lo obtuve sin buscarlo, por apoyar a una amiga de la factultad. No sabìa que el esquema era vìa outsourcing y en la empresa habìa esquemas contractuales muy precisos para contratar de manera directa, yo no cubrìa varios de ellos asi que no podìa ser contratada de manera directa."
bad,I pushed boxes around. It was not very challenging and very mind numbing.
bad,My typical day for this company consist of my arriving at 6:30am - 3pm and attending to the machines and cleaning the warehouse floors. Some of the co-workers there were fairly descent people just trying to make a living. The hardest part of the job was when the machine would not work right.
bad,"no se pueden lograr objetivos, mal clima de trabajo, demaciada competencia"

I achieved more than I ever thought possible; gained competencies and skillset that would not have been possible elsewhere.  Benefits, retirement plan is essential for retirement years.  I would not have the retirement account that I have today without P&G."
bad,They will tell you that their most valuable asset is the people.  Don't believe it.  It's ALWAYS about the bottom line. They will cut positions and then dump that work on you and you're expected to get that work done along with the work that you already had on your desk.
bad,The pay and benefits were good. The rating system that they use is discouraging to administrative level roles because someone has to receive the lowest rating and it is pitting co workers against each other to see who will get the best rating.
bad,job is being moved out of state. they bring in new managers out of engineering school and rarely stay in their role to see a project all the way through.  As soon as they start to get a grasp on what they are doing they move to another role.  The company is way too top heavy.
bad,Trabalhar de segunda a sábado é o pior tipo de escala.
bad,Our company seems to have great values and principles but our site is so poorly managed that those values are lost. The culture is very clickish and high school when it comes to gossip and professionalism.
bad,"A empresa, como muitas do segmento, tende a demonstrar uma visão metódica para conquistar seus objetivos, os critérios quanto à escolha de líderes e supervisores é, em boa parte das vezes, tendenciosa e questionável, não dando espaço para o crescimento pessoal e de sua formação técnica."
bad,"During my 6 years there, my work load literally doubled. Once I hit ""top pay"" I was told that there was no way for me to get another raise. Since I was only a temp (if you call 6 years working 36-48+ hour a week a temp), I had no vacation, sick days paid holidays, or any other type of paid time off. When to company had shut-down days. I lost work that week and had to stretch my barely livable income that much more. While my supervisor was excellent, the management a Procter & Gamble was disorganized, ineffective, uncommunicative, and suffer from the worst forms of cronyism. Temps there are regarded as nothing more than than rental equipment, and the constant turn-over of P&G employees meant that most times the temps were more knowledgeable that the actual full-timers.  Temps we also excluded from any type of company function, and were allowed to purchase food in the cafeteria, but not allowed to eat it there. We had our own office; a trailer with holes in the floor, a leaking roof, half the light fixtures didn't work, and we were constantly trying to get rid of the cockroaches. By P&G's own admission, I was doing a job that required two people, and was told that 4 more production lines would be in within the next year. This did not, however, grant me a raise, and the possibility of hiring more drivers was limited because they started people below the average wage for the position, and the benefits were minimum federal requirements."

bad,I think they should treat their people better  better pay I like to work in there in the beginning but then when I start switching hands I didn’t want to work there anymore I wouldn’t mind going back if it’s organized better
bad,"Gerencia ruim, trabalho sob pressão, você é contratado para uma função e acaba desempenhado outra."
bad,"It's a who you know, who you blow environment. They don't care about the employees. Moral is awful at the bear river Utah plant. The shifts changing from day shift to graves every 2 days is the worst. They say they're number 1 concern is safety but if you get hurt it is always your fault. Worst manufacturing place I have worked in my 25 years of experience."
bad,Good place to work if you like over time. There is a lot of overtime there on top of rotating shifts. Very poor work/life balance.
bad,"Le travail chez PG est hyper stressant. De nombreuses personnes en peu de temps ont : "
bad,"Loved the PG COmpany and most everyone I worked with.  The Lima, Ohio plant has a culture of it's own that does NOT follow the corporate model.  If it ran as it preached, it would be the best place in the world to work...EXCEPT for work/life balance.  PG runs as if you have no life. 12hr swing AND rotating shifts are ridiculous and study after study has shown the company that this is hard on the body and bad for the health of the people."
bad,"you are just a warm body, they do not pay well. I applied for an admin job and took factory work until something else came up and they never offered me anything else. they never answer their phone"

bad,"Terrific employer, always creating a variety of projects to accomplish. We are all saddened by the closing of RetailPulse Division of Retail Merchandising, but look forward to new and exciting ventures with other employers."
bad,"I did not have a great experience at P&G."
bad,If you want to be any type of lead you give your life to the company and you have to brown nose. You get told you don't know anything but they refuse to take time to really train. However they do have great benefits and PTO
bad,"not a good place to work. management is spotty , would rather sit on their phones, online gambling. initiatives are not followed through with. questionable promotions. the free product is a bonus."
bad,Yes they will try to work you a lot and some days you will come to work and they will send you home for no apparent reason. The two temp services that paid $8 an hour are preferred personal solutions(PPS) and premier. But if you need some quick easy money go to the temp service and pay for the drug test and have them take that out of your check and let's not forget about the gloves they will be $5
bad,"""Not my fault"" is the rule.  Deny and deflect culture. This company uses almost entirely third party contractors for all of their benefits. So if you have an issue, it's not their responsibility."
bad,They do not pay you enough for the work that you do and they hours. The work place get hot and the breaks are not long enough and the co work do not do their jobs.
bad,Horrible place to be while plant is closing. Go somewhere else while you can. The best workers left long ago so whats left won't help in doing a good job.
bad,Limited growth for South Africans as the upper management levels are all expats. No formal or SAQA accredited training being offered. Company do not invest in formal training.
bad,I go to work get all my belongings and put them away i wait on the team lead to call me to my line then my shift start i get 2 breaks( 15min 30min ) get off after a long 12 hour day at work then go home
bad,"⦁	Sold Procter & Gamble Products within a given territory."
bad,"P&G used to be about the people.  They were it's biggest asset.  I loved working for this company. "
bad,Management wasn't fair . I couldn't balance life and work no understanding of family issues. The hardest part was working rotating shifts.I couldn't balance my days and worrying of getting enough sleep.
bad,Working there was not good enough for me. The pay wasn't good enough and they didn't give me enough hours to atleast get good pay. Even after asking for my hours they denied it.
bad,"its a great company if you have a high position mainly there to babysit the labor workers and pick up there slack, made sure every worker was doing the best they can, the management was usually absent or late so i usually had to take more responsibilities for the labor worker which helped me expand in the wearhouse."
bad,"Empresa muy regular"
bad,Not professional. They hired basically anybody so it was like a high school atmosphere filled with drama. They talked to the employees like we weren't people.
good,"I got the opportunity to work for P&G later in my life (over 30) but was the best decision I have ever made.

bad,Gran escuela de marketing con gente apasionada y competitiva
bad,"I did not like the work environment and culture at all. I guess I am rather conservative but I did not fit the factory environment at all. The training program depends on who teaches. Not real organized or consistent. Ask questions whenever in doubt, do not assume anything will be repeated."
bad,Es una buena empresa en lo que es recolectar llamadas de los clientes que necesitan una ayuda para saber sobre las rwalizaciones de sus facturas.
bad,"The culture has changed from that of a ""family"" type atmosphere, where team mates looked out for one another, to one where it is now self centric. Advancement is not applied based on ability, experience and capability.Stressful, and toxic work environment. Rotational shift lends to loss of family time, and is not conducive to the prosperity of personal relationships. The shift is also not compatible with a healthy lifestyle, and healthy sleep patterns."
bad,"PROS: pay, benefits start day one, being able to flex your hours"
bad,Procter and Gamble is CPG company were I worked while attending college on a part time bases. You made store calls checking on product shelf placement.
bad,"Worker  moral is non-existant, no accountability or sense of urgency.  Security problems, un-safe environment, multiple class 4 injuries and multiple visits from OSHA in under 2 years."
bad,The company is great. It was a hard job. I had a lot of fun on the job. The work environment was very loud. The management staff was always around and very helpful.
bad,"Trabajo de mantenimiento, se apoya a produccion con los problemas de operacion, fallas y averias."
bad,P&G requires all facilities to work a rotating shift. The shift doesn't benefit the company in the slightest and destroys the lives and health of the workers.
bad,I am unable to say any more due to legal reasons concerning my termination and compensation. I can offer no further comment.
bad,"Wszyscy znajomi szukaja nowej pracy."
bad,"I learn how to handle stock, always use FIFO method to manage stock. Inventory accuracy required everyday. How to collect order from field sales executive and how to deliver the required product within the timeline."
bad,Once upon a time people strived to work and retire from P&G but the corporate culture changed and people no longer stayed loyal to a single company.  Massive restructuring and changes made this company a shell of its original self.
bad,No pay involved due to it being a volunteer spot. But it was a very fun atmosphere and really productive. Great environment and very enjoyable.
bad,Small Plant with less than 150 people. Right now it is bleeding people and losing talent. The morale is low and it isn't a fun place to work. You have to jump though ridiculous hoops to advance and they absolutely do not appreciate the talent that they have. This plant doesn't have anyone running the show who is a leader. It feels like P&G is using it as a tax right off because I cannot see how they are making any money!
bad,Hard work atmosphere.  Certified forklift operator of all shipping and receiving operations. No opportunity of full time benefits after 2+ years working there 7 days a week on night shift.
good,"I got the opportunity to work for P&G later in my life (over 30) but was the best decision I have ever made.

bad,"Great benefits. Longtime mangers are great, newer managers are ruthless. Every other week shift is terrible. The culture changed in the 24 + months I was there. It changed from , Purpose, Values, & Principles, to 100% politically correct rules.  They promised wages would be at a certain number within 2 years when hired & it would include a level change in the position. I received outstanding reviews for my job performance for two years.  I had the promise in an email from my manager that I would receive the level change & pay increase & she lied to her manger regarding it.. Once I brought up that pay increases never reached the promised amount or the T-3 level change, I was written up for false claims, in which it took 3 months to negate. After that I left the company"
bad,"Aside from job security this company doesn’t have much to offer unless you want to climb the ladder unethically. The company preached fair opportunity, work life balance, etc but does not deliver."
bad,My managers never sent me to Band 1 college.  After working over 25 simultaneous programs our group was promised more help.  We received more help only to have some of us being let go a mere 3 months later.  Employees I endorsed for the positions were not let go while I was.
bad,"The typical day of work as a technician isn't bad, It can get tiresome working three 12 hour shifts in a row."
bad,"Ambiente estresante, multicultural, nivel alto de habilidades requeridas, evaluación de desempeño dura. "
bad,"good pay for someone with no degree, however you have a 9 month period of where they can fire you at any moment and after that a 2 year wait to transfer within the plant. employees with high positions are rude. everyone starts out friendly but quickly show you their true colors. 12 hour shift rotation UN-healthy and stressful, you never get use to it. they say they value your opinion and there is room to grow but they don't and it isn't room unless you are a yes man or know people in high positions. they expect you to work roles with out compensation (supervisors working without supervisor pay) this plant in browns summit comes up with every excuse not to pay you as you advance in levels. they also do not honor degree skills nor transfer with skills. I heard other plants are great and pay more please don't come to the one in browns summit. P&G is a great company however Browns Summits puts a bad taste in your mouth."
good,"I got the opportunity to work for P&G later in my life (over 30) but was the best decision I have ever made.  I achieved more than I ever thought possible; gained competencies and skillset that would not have been possible elsewhere.  Benefits, retirement plan is essential for retirement years.  I would not have the retirement account that I have today without P&G."
bad,Nothing personal we just had a weak management group. Human resources department no bueno had co worker his son was sick they didn't care. He had vacation time sick time the company wouldn't let him take off. Always 6 day mandatory.
bad,Most of the time was located to sfety and to issue permits. The reason was the people not sure how to address the Basic principals and to overcome the urgency
bad,"If you like getting free body wash it's ok. Management wants you to do multiple things to ""progress"" in the company but rarely gives you time, direction, or resources to do it. Schedules are supposed to be locked in by Thurs morning but after you make plans for the weekend they drop mandatory OT on you, or you cancel plans because you're supposed to work and they cancel your shift on Fri afternoon, or you get a phone call on the way in saying you don't have to come in. There is a ridiculous amount of pass-the-buck when you try to get answers about anything. It's either not their area, don't know, or someone else's job. Pay is good once you jump through all the hoops. Benefits have slowly declined. The company is not what it was. Tend to hire brand new engineering or management college grads and stick them into a production system they know nothing about and have them ""improve"" the area. If you like a 12 hour rotating days/nights shift and frequent overtime you found your home cause you won't have a life."
bad,"to many cheifs not enough indians not enough managment that have the expierence to really understand what it takes to operate in the department  that i worked in, need less fresh hire managment strait out of college with unrelated degrees"
bad,"I got put in an area with high turnover, highly ambiguous work, in my opinion not enough training on the job itself, and incredibly high expectations.  For me, the work itself did not play to my strengths and was incredibly high on areas where I had little experience.  When applying, I had to apply under the broad umbrella of Supply Network Operations and not for a specific position so I had 0 idea what I was getting into until I was there and it was a bit too little, too late."
bad,"Work place culture is suppose to be about work life/ balance, but some departments are extremely competitive. Hard work ethic is not enough to make you a valuable employee, you must be on radar as what your manager considers what is an achiever."
bad,"It is a place with a lot of great employees that work hard. It is a place where most of those employees do not feel appreciated. If the owner likes you everything is alright. If the owner begins to dislike you then everything is then blamed on the employee the owner does not like. It is hard to see logic in the way the company is run at times. It would be a fantastic place to work if the owner would sell the company to a larger company providing reasonably priced benefits, built in retirement and better policies with multiple people to ensure policy is followed."
bad,"No room for growth, limited training availability."
bad,Learn how to launch a product in market and how to place right products to right place. Very hard to convince consumers to change their consumption habit. The most enjoyable part is- this job gives me a chance to communicate with a lot of people.
bad,"This company has the least value in its employees. After 3 years, they keep employees as temp and unless you know someone in upper management, will you ever grow. No benefits"
bad,I did not work there very long and the job is repetitive and not challenging enough for me
bad,"ir a reunion, salir a ruta, visitar los clientes organizar la mercancia,anotar los agotados para que el vendedor hiciera el peddido"
bad,"Aprendi como e importante trabalhar em equipe, conheci novos amigos a parte mais agradável do trabalho e quando tinha o trabalho e mais desagradável e quando não tinha o trabalho, mandavam a gente para outros setores."
bad,"-Typical day at work was generally long, quick turn-around from nights (630pm-7am) to days (630am-7pm)."
bad,"I think they can do better in paying their employees more money. Needing to train your team leaders to be more respectful in speaking to the employees "
bad,Completely unorganized and second level management changes every few months because their manager is a narcissist. The people I worked with were nice but the manager we reported to got a power trip and loved talking down to others but only via email. Classless.
good,"I got the opportunity to work for P&G later in my life (over 30) but was the best decision I have ever made.  I achieved more than I ever thought possible; gained competencies and skillset that would not have been possible elsewhere.  Benefits, retirement plan is essential for retirement years.  I would not have the retirement account that I have today without P&G."
bad,"Empresa com bons beneficio,salario pois na parte do gerenciamento muda muito e com isso dificulta o  conhecimentos do funcionário"
bad,"I was laid-off with the least seniority. Based on that my opinion of P&G is non-favorable."
bad,"Very up and down when it comes to work load, either drowning in work or you're dying of boredom. The salary as a contractor is laughably bad, not enough to live off of if you're paying for an apartment. Very small amount of staff that are actual employee's while the rest are stuck as contractors with no way forward in the salary chain."
bad,Es una empresa que no ofrece un contrato indefinido por la area de ventas
bad,Not to awfull but management in the area where I worked sacked.  Each manager kept stepping on the other and you would pay the price for it. Even if you miss a shift with a doctor note it is still held against you regardless of what is said at hiring.
bad,Procter and Gamble was a terrific place to work in a very good atmosphere.  The other employees were wonderful and always courteous.  It was a huge company with a busy switchboard.  I enjoyed being busy.
bad,I do not recommend this company to any minorities(gender or race)
bad,Found it difficult to progress and achieve my full potential
bad,"A empresa oferece alguns beneficios mas devido eu ser tercerizada não tinha os mesmos beneficios que os funcionarios da propria empresa. Amizades boas, sem problemas com colegas ou gerencia"
bad,The rotation is tough on the body and tough on the family. The people you work with are exceptional and diverse. Management tends to be weak until the band 3 level at which point they know what they are doing and how to handle a diverse amount of obstacles.
bad,P&G has put too much focus on pleasing the fringe elements of society and placating to political correctness and in doing so have lost focus on creating innovative products that are valuable to consumers.
bad,the right of each worked is a priority and workers are allowed to develop their skills after hiring. the stressful part of this job is the double mandate on the side of the night shift
bad,The pay and benefits are good but the work schedule is a 12 hour swing shift that destroys your social life and your physical well being. I wouldn't recommend working there unless you hate sleeping.
bad,"I would never recommend working at P&G as a contractor.  You are treated like a second class citizen.  Managers avoid talking to you.  You do equal work for unequal pay.  The safety of contractors in the lab is ignored.  I asked for access to a respirator because the container of chemicals I was working with said ""Respirator required when dispensing""  I was told "" That doesn't mean you, you don't need one"".  A coworker was made severely ill while measuring ammonia because it could not be done in a fume hood due to  scale sensitivity. She was blamed for not using a hood after being told it could not be done there.  They provide a literal and emotional toxic work environment."
bad,Management is very unstable in the customization area. Both the regular managers and the E&I manager. Very agressive manager in the north who bullies other managers. Would not recommend jobs in that department.
bad,Procter and Gamble's company was my first job a salesman but even though I didn't have any experience from any field but it was okay because since I was a student in high school I started to sell rice cake in my classroom.
bad,"I spent many years at P&G, met some great people and enjoyed most of my career, however, in more recent times the work environment/culture grew toxic and the job less satisfying."
good,"I got the opportunity to work for P&G later in my life (over 30) but was the best decision I have ever made.  I achieved more than I ever thought possible; gained competencies and skillset that would not have been possible elsewhere.  Benefits, retirement plan is essential for retirement years.  I would not have the retirement account that I have today without P&G."
bad,"It's hard to have a personal life when you're working the mandatory 12 hr, rotating shifts!!!  And there is at least 18 months between raises and the management will do everything that they can to push those raises back!"
bad,"A typical day at work can go fine when you have a chance to go on break and discover part of your lunch is gone and we have employee that's saying they didnt see anything. I learned how to keep up with my paste, keeping my workplace area clean, and keeping up with my routine. Certain co-workers we're appropriate for work we'll other co-workers come to work not ready that's were the management should come in to address there employee's on there appearance. the hardest part of the job was lifting heavy boxes all day and the enjoyable part of the job was pulling the boxes and loading them on the rapper to be wrapped."
bad,"job was fine but had me go on 12 hrs 7 days a week   driving  70 miles there and 70 miles back   also  ware house was completely un organized ,"
bad,"La empresa promueve el deporte, motivo por el cual a realizado un campo de fulbito con grass sintetico, un gimnasio y un campo de juego de mesa y ping pong, es desde mi punto de visto lo que lo hace agradable y atractivo el ambiente laboral."
bad,"Aspect le plus difficile : être sous stress en permanence"
bad,"Professionele divisie binnen P&G is een business die enkel werkt met heel ondernemende mensen, de afgelopen jaren heb ik heel wat geleerd door de constante trainingen en seminaries die je kan volgen, deze zijn specifiek gericht op wat je dagdagelijks doet zoals negotiation skills, budget management,return on investment, create good joint business plans etc."
bad,"losuy because of shift work, but good people, packaged and sorted pads"
bad,P&G does not fully explain the parameters of the job. It wasn't till a couple months in I realized I was not expected to be a technician doing quality inspections..I was expected to do that and be a Mechanical Engineer/Mechanic. The amount of work expected of one person is enough for two people. And mechanical engineering is beyond my experience.
bad,A lot of employees at P&g have worked there a long time and are ready to retire.  As with any business P&g has to have cost savings to remain productive.  The employees have been treated so well their whole career that they don’t understand when their benefits or staffing gets cut so they take personal.  As a result they are counting the days til they leave.  They have watched a very good carp turn into a job.  As a result they just want to do their job and go home(understandable) which leaves new hires lost with no direction.  The training is almost non existent and it is the most complicated process P&g has.
bad,"i wasn't very comfortable here, it was not enough pay for what the job consist of. There was really nowhere to move up im positions. managers always seemed like they had an attitude. the up side to working there was that it was close to home."
bad,"A typical day is testing different raw materials. Gaining all kinds of skills. I learned gas chromatography, liquid chromatography, AA, viscosity, IR, HPLC, TOC, and conductivity. Management is very excellent. Co-workers needs improving, they bully you and say things they shouldn't say. The hardest part of the job is dealing with co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job is all of the skills I have learned."
bad,A typical day at work was to call on Target go check all of Procter and Gamble product. Talk to DM about missing tags missing endcaps and find out wy they were not up.
bad,The pay is ok and and the benefits are good but you never quite get used to the schedule. It’s a rapid rotation swing shift so be prepared to feel like a zombie most days.
bad,"aprendi mucho en este tiempo de trabajo,en lo cual fue muy satisfactorio para incrementar mis conocimientos"
bad,Ibwould recommend this job to young people with lots of time i didnt like how long it takes you to move up in the company so i found better pay n more skill training
bad,The company has no direction and the R&D focus in on the US and Singapore with the UK office doing the admin and being a supporting function. Constant funding cuts make it impossible to innovate.
bad,"Uma empresa boa de trabalhar,nunca tive problema,apenas acho q trabalhávamos demais pra um salário fora do mercado,plano de saúde era muito caro e o ticket cm valor bem abaixo."
good,"I got the opportunity to work for P&G later in my life (over 30) but was the best decision I have ever made.  I achieved more than I ever thought possible; gained competencies and skillset that would not have been possible elsewhere.  Benefits, retirement plan is essential for retirement years.  I would not have the retirement account that I have today without P&G."
bad,"Decision making is slow"
bad,Its a great environment and the people are helpfull and do there best to train you with all the perfect safety precation.. Also have alot of opportunity to grow with the company.
bad,Work in a small dept. Manage to pick up the job duties within a short time as work wise is similar to Solutia Pte Ltd. Most enjoyable part of the job is that the benefits are also extend to the contract staff.
bad,"Schawk has little to no work culture, extremely limited growth opportunity and generally low morale in the work place. If you simply want a career in which you punch in, write orders, then punch out, then this may be the job for you."
bad,Agencia de colocación por lo que la empresa se mantiene a la distancia
bad,Je ne recommande pas cette entreprise. Les missions confiées y sont très intéressantes et enrichissantes mais la culture d'entreprise et la façon de manager sont contre productifs. On ne cherche pas à faire grandir ou évoluer les stagiaires et la hiérarchie y est très présente.
bad,I enjoyed the place that why I stayed there for a long time and ate good food while I was at it. But to tell one the truth I would probable make this one of last place to get hired because the work is tiredsome.
bad,"Being an employee is really not an easy task, you have to work for 8 hours, bear with the stress, handle work loads and other things. There are also times that you get angry and impatient because of the environment in the work place."
bad,I worked at P&G for a few months and really liked it. Until I was thrown under the bus. I was fired over an accident that I did not cause. Since I was new and everyone thought I did it I was automatically guilty and terminated. I tried to tell my supervisor that if I caused the accident I would have spoken up but they did not want to listen to what I had to say.
bad,"I learned there how to work in proper Manner ,how to reached office on time. my Hardest work is there if any issue with system all officer works full night in office i am not satisfied thre so i want to leave"
bad,"no organization, lousy pay, but the work isn't hard, gets real hot or cold, most people are lazy and hard to work with, more of an entryway to gain exp in the manufacturing and warehouse career field"
bad,"Procter & Gamble fut une expérience difficile."
bad,"When I was little I learned how to speak, how to walk and etc...this job gave the art of customer service, how to greet the customers, to understand and to apply in the right way the body language, how to use the questions to know the needs of the customer and in the end I learned how important it is the smile."
bad,"Visiting super&hyper stores,taking stock position of our products,arranging products according to company planogram,checking promotional signages/displays,company assets aligned to the stores."
bad,"Uma empresa ótima, aprendi tudo sobre o que sou hoje, o forte era venda de pontos em empresas de hipermercados são paulo,sempre me dei bem com meus colegas de trabalho, entrar nos hipermercados com documentação cada um pedia uma coisa, hoje em dia me dou muito bem com meus ex-colegas de trabalhos pois me aposentei nesta empresa."
bad,hard work none stop really for men and not good pay would never go back
bad,"If you want a comfortable place to wait for the end this is it. I found the job monotonous and boring and was afraid that one day I would blink and 30 years would have gone by and I'd have not idea what the happened. The pay was great and there was no expectation to take you work home with you, if you're a parent and just want to pay your bills and watch you kids get old, you'll love it here; if you want a challenge or have any ambition to grow yourself I would stay away."
bad,"i was young when i had this job, the money was ok to me, alot of standing in one spot, the people from what i remember were good, and fun to work with"
good,"I got the opportunity to work for P&G later in my life (over 30) but was the best decision I have ever made.  I achieved more than I ever thought possible; gained competencies and skillset that would not have been possible elsewhere.  Benefits, retirement plan is essential for retirement years.  I would not have the retirement account that I have today without P&G."
good,"a good learning place but hard to survive as there is no job security, employee can be fired in half an hour without any compensation."
good,"The job you can learn a Various of skills that could be useful in the future. Just as every company it has its good, bad and flaws."
good,"On a regular day 5 people are in the lab including a manager. We would walk to every line in the factory and grab product to take back to the lab for testing. I learned that there is a lot that goes into making toilet paper and paper towels and napkins. The hardest part of the job for me, was the stress of having everything done on time, but i always succeeded in doing so. I worked with some very nice and fun people so it made the job enjoyable."
good,Highly demanding working environment creating stress and very less chances of improvement. promotions were highly controversial and unjust.
good,I feel like I learned a lot because I gained knowledge of the inner workings of the company and how products are made. To see the factory and meet new people that have different skills from the ones I have was very interesting
good,5 plant managers in 10 yrs and they have their own way of running the business. Its simple whatever helps managers career path is what your site will be focusing on. If your a technician good luck your just a tool.
good,Very fast passed and informative. learned a lot about factory work. Met lots of different people from all walks of life. learned  a lot about myself and what I am capable of doing.
good,Good company to start a career for freshers. learning opportunities is there. Great comapany for those who would like to work for FMCG sector.
good,"The company is great but certain plants have too many internal issues.  There is no advancement at all and you are expected to work forced overtime whether or not you have prior commitments without notice.  If you do not, you were disciplined.  "
good,"The P& G is well Established company is Bangladesh, work also good abut i want change my life by same hard work . and i like to work to Australia."
good,"on your feet most of the day, it was 12 hour shift on both day and nights.Management were strict. co workers were ok. hardest part of job was the hours.Most enjoyable part was learning new skills and meeting new people."
good,"hardest part of my job is rotating shift.."
good,its just for a person who dont want to move up in there career and its nothing that i want the hours vary sometimes you could work from 6am-8am just all depends on the work its not a bad experiences i just want something better
good,Los líderes nuevos no se toman el tiempo para conocer al personal. El trabajo de los líderes no concuerda con las políticas de Procter. los líderes son acosadores mienten y maquillan los resultados.
good,The job is 12 hour shifts for 2 or 3 days then 2-3 days off and come back on then come back on the opposite shift each time. Spend most of my off days just trying to rest my body and get acclimated for the opposite shift sleep schedule. The work itself is somewhat enjoyable and you work as a team with the rest of the line. I am just finding the 12 hour shifts and the rotating schedule very exhausting.
good,"Good place to work, lots to learn sometimes people think they are bosses that are not but overall it is okay. Pay was nice just wish it could have been for a longer time frame."
good,Good growth good act good skills good ratings good atmosphere good learning good interest over marketing promotional behaviour and brand disposition learning
good,"I got the opportunity to work for P&G later in my life (over 30) but was the best decision I have ever made.  I achieved more than I ever thought possible; gained competencies and skillset that would not have been possible elsewhere.  Benefits, retirement plan is essential for retirement years.  I would not have the retirement account that I have today without P&G."
good,"Best place easy to work, yet management was horrible, favoritism, no work home balance worked 29 days for one off day it was poorly managed. Poorly managed lunch times, breaks! It was like we were slaves"
good,"The company expect people to perform at their best when there is no support behind it. They do not provide much time for people to adjust, if you cannot perform in 3 months, you are out"
good,"Decisions are made that affect the work/life balance of employees, and if you try to talk to management about these decisions and how it has/will affect you, you are labeled as a ""whiner"" and are told in a round-a-bout way ""If you don't like it, there's the door"".  They claim to care about their employees, but the reality of it is, they are only worried about their advancement.  I felt like I was just a ""warm body"" that was ""filling a spot""."
good,"Desafortunadamente la empresa que me contrato que fue un outsourcig, tenia una pesima administración"
good,"ok place to work, descent pay when I started now lots of places pay more ant top out higher with better benefits. Slow when it comes to business decisions in the market. Way too many layers of management"
good,Poor management. No movement to advance unless they have a personal like for you. Forced overtime by seniority not hours worked. Timed breaks for certain employees not others
good,"Working for proctor and gamble was ok. I left because my car broke down, it was to far from home to catch a ride. The one thing I didn't like was it wasn't a guaranteed 40 hrs a week,"
good,"the work was very easy,the the night went by fast, loading boxes on the the pallet, putting bottle on the conveyer belt sweeping and mopping work area"
good,"poco spazio per trovare lavoro, ambiente di lavoro ottimo"
good,There were not enough working hours available. Many days I was sent home due to lack of work. Unfavorable behavior by many co-workers. They were young.
good,"It's very good company but it has more pressure to the promotor "
good,P & G has upsides to the work environment but the service division is managed by Sales People and Accountants which do not understand how to run a Service division
good,Proctor and Gamble was ok. They weren't consistent. I would go in and 2 hours later they would send some of us home. I couldn't depend on that income to pay bills because of the inconsistent work hours.
good,"a munkahely nem lenne  rossz  csak a vezetőséggel vannak  problémák  nem tudják meg becsülni a dolgozni akaró embert."
good,"Got in through XLC Services and the whole thing was a chaotic mrss. Hostile site owner on 2nd shift, pay only goes far as 8.25 and too many changes in schedules and teams"
good,"P&G paid great money and offered tons of hours. However, management wasn't reliable. There was little to no structure. Employees where wild and unruly."
good,"being the part of this organization, i evaluated the potential as one man army in me. the place was really good for beginners but passionate person can get stuck after manager level due to small size of hierarchy. more responsibilities create more accountable which become painful after certain time period"
good,"Having not being an employee at Procter and Gample, I cannot comment for PG. I can comment about working at PG but as an employee of the company called MTF. "
good,"I got the opportunity to work for P&G later in my life (over 30) but was the best decision I have ever made.  I achieved more than I ever thought possible; gained competencies and skillset that would not have been possible elsewhere.  Benefits, retirement plan is essential for retirement years.  I would not have the retirement account that I have today without P&G."
good,"the job is awesome, but the rotating shifts are horrible on you physically and mentally. its really hard to do anything but sleep on the 2 weeks that you are on night shift. while on day shift i find it OK, but the night shift just really drains you. 12 hour days/nights. the team leaders are horrible. they think they are above you but really they aren't. i am more qualified than my team leader, i even make more money than he does. but its whatever. they don't have respect for you."
good,"Não tive contato direto com a empresa, seus promotores são ter"
good,Would be a better organization if it was managed better. A good place to balance work and life but no place to advance in the company.
good,No setor de trabalho o ambiente era muito agradavel o que levava a muitas aprendizagens.
good,quite efficent and co-workers very work oriented
good,Needs to pay workers better I left because I wasn’t satisfied with my checks I was getting. I have to provide for my daughter and myself and the money wasn’t enough.
good,They no longer care about their employees.   It used to be a good company to work for but no longer is.  They sell you disability insurance but then figure out a way to fire you so you can not receive the disabilty benefits.
good,"Je moet er voor zijn om bekeken te worden veel testen af te leggen en muggenziften op details. "
good,"Tratan muy mal a su personal , tanto como rb y recursos humanos , nunca te sacan de apuro , no son claros y los directivos creen siempre tener la razon sin escuchar a sus empleados .para ellos los promotores siempre tienen la culpa de todo lo malo."
good,again it wasn't a bad company to work for but it was temporary for me  it was a typical 8 hour shift sometimes more it depended on thevolume of the job
good,its not fair at the moment when you have to be first & line & fight for a spot to work & risk taking to drive out Shippensburg for an hour just to get sent back .
good,"Micromanaging environment."
good,"It is alright if you are looking for something for a while. I would not do this kind of job for longer than 6 months. Management has to meet its quota, therefore they push people every day, sometimes even without reason. As I said its a warehouse environment work for not much more than the minimum wage."
good,"They talk a real good talk. Its a rush, rush atmosphere, yet they push safety. It wouldn't be a bad company to work for if people who work there were held accountable for their actions, but they aren't and equality is just a myth at this particular plant."
good,i was one of my first job the money was good but i didn't like the mandatory overtime in that work environment i worked every line in the factory . Met a lot of good people.
good,"12 hr shifts, rotating 2 days on 2 off then 3 days on and 2 off, busy work environment, pay could be better. Most people were easy to work and get along with, training was good."
good,"I got the opportunity to work for P&G later in my life (over 30) but was the best decision I have ever made.  I achieved more than I ever thought possible; gained competencies and skillset that would not have been possible elsewhere.  Benefits, retirement plan is essential for retirement years.  I would not have the retirement account that I have today without P&G."
good,"mucho trabajo "
good,"well paid but very stressful environment"
good,"a typical day at work was twelve hours long and you were moving the whole time. we had machines that we had to clean and maintain and getting inside the machines was very difficult. management was crude and unhelpful, as was the rest of the staff."
good,"The labor was not worth the amount of money I was being paid. One 30 minute break. The overall management was fine, but the team leaders did not discipline workers, so it was a lot of conflict."
good,Empresa que visa o comprometimento em produzir  produtos de qualidade.
good,"Een typische dag bij Procter is er niet, elke dag is anders."
good,If you want to go far in P&G you must fall in line. P&G has a culture that breeds Proctoids. A Proctoid does everything he or she is told without question........If it doesn't make sense chances are management likes it and wants it implemented. They love paper work and redundant paper work even more.
good,You work through a temp agency and they won't hire anyone on some people are hard to work with. Only get one break not paid for. They don't treat people fair
good,Okay job good people stock and stack all day drive forklifts work with people good people 2 breaks good location can be fun at times but we work hard all day
good,"Points positifs:"
good,Very negetive environment with many employees just being plain rude and unwilling to work. Not a place i can ever recommend. Promised a evaluation for permanent staffing but was never recieved. After a year of working for 8$ an hour without a single penny of a raise i completely lost interest in the company as a whole and decided to leave. I would never in my life go back.
good,"very good corporate culture for full-time employee and totally feel awkward working as a contractor - you are not allowed so many simple things - feels very unnatural working in there - even simple plant exchange event - contractors are not allowed to get trees!!!"
good,"interesting corporate culture - everything is done to support full-time employees and contractors are treated like second class citizens."
good,They work way to hard for low pay.They will work you for 12 hours and only give you a 15 min break. I really did not learn anything from this job.There were no enjoyable parts of this job
good,Empresa boa de trabalho ambiente muito bom mais com poucas oportunidades PR portadores de deficiência fisicas
good,"Mas beneficios , mas oportunidades e mas valores para com os funcionarios."

good,protcer & gamble is a cool place to work. enjoyed working with my managers and co-workers.
good,"they needed help for the holiday season so I decided to give it a try, plus it was really good money."
good,Great place to come in learn the industry. It has been a great experience for me. It offers the opportunity to work on diverse things
good,not my ideal sort of work but got along alright with my co workers there
good,"I learned diversity,patience, how to work alone and unsupervised,and also how to be a productive team player. The toughest part of the job was not having the proper training needed to perform my job duties. I enjoyed being able to be part of a wonderfull team, leaving at the end of my shift knowing that I had made a difference, knowing that I had satisfied my customers needs. Making new friends. Being able to help my coworkers get through a tough day."
good,"Learned a lot. Wasn't worth all the added stress you have to take on. Forced to work every weekend, and forced to work with people who do not like to work."
good,"Discordo totalmente do modo como são escolhidos os profissionais, principalmente gerentes. Colocam recém formados logo que saem dos estágios em cargos de coordenação e comando, sendo o primeiro emprego, onde não tem a menor possibilidade de estar; em detrimento de funcionários mais experientes com conhecimento e formação técnica muito mais avançados do que o recém formado, e suficiente para assumir as responsabilidades intrínsecas. Gerentes com formação diversa à necessária para assumir linhas de produção e que o conhecimento deste de nada aproveita. Somente para manter tal funcionário na empresa por ser formado em tal Universidade Pública, ter morado fora do país, essas são os experiências que de fato a empresa valoriza, e não a vivência em fábrica e o comando ou coordenação efetiva, como deveria ser. Muito se perdeu em termos financeiros por esse agir."
good,"I worked for P and G 18 years, and I have never come close to making the money I make here anywhere else, and it is one of the easiest jobs I have ever had. MORALE sucks but that is just due to Management. Managers are actually Engineers who think because they have a degree they are better than you. The only thing about the company is that you can be anything you want within the company with enough hard work and brown nosing. especially "
good,"Empresa ampiamente conocida mundialmente, sin embargo los jefes tienen cero trato amable ni compañerismo para todo el equipo."
good,The first 10-12 years of my career were great. The last 8 or so were terrible.The new managers and cost cutting turned that place into a joke. They would make up violations to get higher paid employees fired and replace them with lower paid lower stock matched people to save money. P&G wont lay off they just fire.

good,"no hay ética y valores, mezclan lo personal con lo laboral."
good,I had to work with one female supervisor in particular who would often use profanity when speaking to me. Management  not good. That was  unfortunate.
good,Overrated... most employees have never worked another job a day in there life. They think P&G is the greatest and preach the kool-aid they drink. Would not recommend to anyone who cares about where they live and is not willing to wait 20 years for their dream job.
good,You have to be willing to quick and on your feet for at least 7 and half hours. I felt I was underpaid and not appreciated at all. Alito needs to be done and in a timely fashion.  All about the numbers
good,working for them was great at first that when i can time to move on i wasn't no motivation that really didn't want to see me grow. The manager was no help with teaching new works about the line ther was no team work
good,"Great opportunities for advancement if you can get beyond frequent layoffs; support for continuous professional growth; best to start here out of college, as an intern"
good,You have to like moving and bending a lot to work in this environment.  You must work as a team in order to complete the desired results and push out the quantity expected for that day.
good,Proctor and Gamble is your typical warehouse job. I wouldn't recommend anyone working here if they didn't have to. You make money and have some in your pocket. Long hours of hard work. Constantly moving. No benefits. Terrible at catering to their employees needs
good,Overall a good place to work but the rotating shift takes its toll.  The salary and benefits are excellent.  Management is terrible.  There is a lot to like and dislike

good,ok company to work for -not like it was 10 or even 5 years ago. Everyone is overworked and morale is down tremendously - causing talented people to leave the company (taking their expertise). Does not promote from within but the people are great to work with and extremely smart.
good,"I typically arrive early and begin my work which consists of inspection and data entry. Around midday I need to wear a half-face respirator for part of the job. After the inspections are finished, I ship what's left of the sample back out."

good,"I was employed under a 0 hour contract which is not great."
good,the hardest part about my job is the 12.5 hr expectation for the continental rotation  shifts. Breaks are not always implemented regularly based on the problems the arise. With the physical nature of my job spaced out breaks would be beneficial.
good,"A typical day at work would start off with a 30 minute team meeting explaining any unusual activities going on in our area of work ( IE. construction). Followed by a vehicle safety cheek lists. Then the day would involve driving to each production line to remove any and all recyclable materials, loading recycled materials into transport trucks for transportation and  unloading / loading any dangerous good coming in and or out of the plant.

good,"was a contract position, when recruitment could not supply, would not avoid clients inquiries. Adecco management was not open to being honest."
good,hi i have a good experience with some typical people in P&G company.There what i see is every one is doing there work as they want no one can follow the rules in market area and this is because management does not see what executives are doing in market they all are alert only when some one came to the company for inspection after all they r waste and they are not paying as the salary at time and number of conditions on insentives.And the wrost thing i can face  is that u has to be on time to the field but you never go home at time this is the risiculous thig in this organisation which directly effect on your health.
good,Typical day involved me worrying weather I would work or not.I learned to never put all my eggs in one basket.

good,how much work can you pump out with very little compensation
good,Started out good. Mandatory osha training was mundane. First year treated good w bonuses and food. Then college kids took over management. Swing shift
good,"Empresa ótima, gestão péssima."
good,"Bad culture, little to no life/work balance. the compensation for a upper managment role is alright but it is no chance of a raise or advancement within the company once you reach a certain level."

I would not have the retirement account that I have today without P&G."
good,"for the most part routine with some challenges, acquired various knowledge and skills in the fragrance industry, unfortunately management was not very knowledge and turn over was extremely high, workplace culture for me was not desirable and lacked professionalism and integrity, hardest part of the job was working continued rotating shifts, the most enjoyable part was gaining the exposure and knowledge about this industry."
good,"-falta de acompanhamento de campo para orientar o funcionário nos objetivos sobre atingimento de metas."
good,"It was ok but very unorganized and all over the place ,  everyday i would come in at 6am to get a spot on time and sometimes i wouldnt even get a spot because it was favoritism."
good,"During my time at Procter, I was challenged many times by the scope of my project and how to gather the necessary information. I had great colleagues and the social benefits were awesome."
good,Productive and fun workplace to work but without a permanent position nor benifits. The job of being a line supply was easy and fun.  Pros of it were that we had gotten paid weekly but the cons of it was that we were being under paid.
good,"Every day leave the late night. "

good,"Poor overall work environment. Work Mondays to Saturdays, long work days. Low compensation. Old technology to do the job. Should invest in equipment and work conditions."
good,"Trying to cut down staff on lines, to meet high tech facilities like the WV plant.  Need to realize that moral will get you more production out the door than cutting people on packing lines. Or spending money to update equipment for less touches."
good,"Proctor and Gamble overall is not a bad place to work, however they need to improve the overall work culture as well as hire more knowledgeable and experienced supervisors to run the overall shifts."
good,"Era llegar pasar ala mesa de control,para darnos cortina para empezar a auditar al montacarguista,lo que aprendí fue todo el proceso de auditoria y inventarios,mis jefes eran muy estrictos y duros, con todos los de la área eramos buenos compañeros y lo mas difícil fue para mi fue que eran turnos de 12 horas,la convivencia entre compañeros fue bastante unida."
good,nessun rispetto per i nuovi arrivati e nessun rispetto per le persone con poche esperienza troppe teste che comandano

I would not have the retirement account that I have today without P&G."
good,Not guaranteed work the hours are fine. They're just really unorganized . And the co-workers are allowed to do whatever they want. Use profanity etc.
good,"While the working environment is relatively stress-free, being in a contractual position means no paid vacations, benefits and charged lunches. It is time to move on in my opinion."
good,They would rather bring in new hires at lower pay rates than permanently hire the workers that have been there for the allotted time.
good,"P&G is a great company to work for. Working with P&G enables me to joggle with my busy life as a mother of two. A daily work is usually always surprising since we never know who we are going to meet in term of customers.  Working with P&G has enabled me to listen to people's needs and meeting them.  Also, I was able to utilize my people and organization skills in order to meet business goals.  My co-workers are generally warm and welcoming which unusual in the beauty industry. The hardest is often when I am unable to meet customer's needs based on stock shortage.  The most fun part is the flexibility"
good,"A typical day at Procter and Gamble was working on a fast paced production line doing a number of different duties and also going into the warehouse to dispatch goods. I have learnt a great deal about the manufacturing Industry such as team work, Individual work, working at speed and working under pressure. Management were very helpful. My co workers were excellent and made going to work fun and enjoyable. The hardest part of the job was the speed in which we had to do work but something I got used too. The most enjoyable part of the job was to push myself to be more productive than the rest of my co workers."
good,"Typical days starts with our signing out of forklifts. Easy enough, however the lifts we were using, albeit new, were uncomfortable and hurt my wrists. I left not wanting to prolong any medical conditions due to the forklifts. Supervisors were less than amiable given their position. I did enjoy it however. Aside from the obvious onus, I think the job had a lot to offer."
good,"Very routine 8-6pm job. "
good,"Não foi uma das melhores, não deram oportunidades de fazer o trabalho que deveria ser feito."
good,"Es una empresa muy buena en sus politicas, el problema es que contrata a otras empresas para contratar personal, la empresa llamada BEST COLLECT, que fue la que me contrato no tiene buenos criterios de contratacion, ni siquiera hacen examenes sicometricos, por lo que la estabilidad laboral se basa en la forma de ser con el jefe (lambisconeria), no en lo profesional. No tienen una buena cultura de capacitacion, por lo que Procter te exige sobre algo que no dominas."
good,un dia en p&g es llegar a trabajar seriamente con un mal ambiente de trabajo
good,Oferece poucos benefícios e tem um baixo salário para a função de Consultor de Vendas.
good,"One of the hardest jobs to keep, the environment isn't that encouraging. typical work day always had one unexpected event or the other. Hardest part of the job was motivation the work crew to perform. Most enjoyable part of the job was travelling to work host sites."
good,"No cotidiano, as máquinas correspondem bem as manutenções aceitando bem a materia-prima não tendo muitas intervenções da manutenção. Nesses anos fazendo parte da empresa aprendi criar documentação utilizando as ferramentas PDCA sendo treinado devido a necessidade do negocio trabalhando em um sistema de melhoria continuo das máquina de produção. A liderança não é leal na avaliação dos colaboradores, há muita informação conflitante entre gerência dos setores e RH."
good,"Gute Bezahlung, schlechtes Management und schlechte Live Balance"
good,I learned new things most every day when i was completed with my tasks i would go help other department with theirs.  Most of the people there were pretty good group of guys . It was a diverse group so i learner about things others enjoyed as well .  I was invited and went to their family  functions and some outdoor outings.  I did like the fact of being able to go to different departments to learn all i could i did that at every job I've ever worked at. They did let me stay late sometimes to teach myself with some help to tig weld stainless steal sheet metals.
good,"Was good to work with the full time employees they were great people to work with i learn to operate small machine for cosmetics. management was great also co worker was very cooperative and fun to work with, the hardest part was to able to grab all the product on the line i used to enjoyed going to work everyday was great to work with all those different type of cosmetics and the people."

good,"Una gran empresa, con fallas en su contratacion de personal"
good,"Run and repair sharpening lines,do all maintenace that is required. PM AM. I learned that sometimes its better to work in as a team. Management was poor at times but came through in others. I loved the people I worked with,they were really down to earth. I would have to ssay the hardest part of the job would have to be is just doing the same things over and over. My favorite part of the job would be fixing things."
good,"The overall experience I had was not the greatest but it was a good-paying job. The beginning of every shift was kind of off-putting, they had a list of all workers on the lines and if you were not on those lists you either got picked to work or sent home. which was the worst part of the job because most of the time you were not picked or sent home early and the pay is equal to the money you put in if you have to take the bus or cab there just to be sent home with no pay at that point."
good,Сильная корпоративная культура мотивирует работать до 12 часов в сутки.
good,I love my management it was the best I just felt like we should got payed more money we was getting payed less then normal warehouses we would only get a 50 cent raise
good,"I hardly got hours. I always had to wait until they contact me to go to work. Work was overall easy to do. Pay was minimum wage at $11, not much opportunities to move up."
good,Management is a revolving door of sub-standard influencers.  I refuse to call them leaders.  Petty jealousy and favoritism run amok in Albany.  I saw mid-level manages removed from their positions for inadequacy only to be returned to the same position on another machine.  The lack of leadership is a testament to the technicians that keep this place running.  Albany is still the worst plant of all the paper plants.  The only time they excel is when they manipulate the numbers.  Run your machine extra slow and they excel.  Then they get caught and act like they didn't know (6A).
good,"The hours were taxing and the difficulties associated with a startup were a bit overwhelming. Overall it was a positive learning experience, but the shifts left little time for life."
good,"I worked for this company for a number of years. As a 3rd party temp and as a Plant Associate(P&G Temp) which has  you on a 2 year contract, with a 50/50 of getting it renewed or not. Just like another review posted on here, the poster mentions that as a temp, you will be doing tasks that a Plant Technician (Permanent) will be doing. Just with less pay. You don't get much vacation time. You get benefits, but its basically a reimbursement. Pay first and get your money back 2 weeks later. You also don't get stocks unlike Technicians."
good,"It's a good part time job. The work is easy and repetitive,the works there are nice and friendly. Management could use some improvements."
good,"Très bonne expérience en 3/8"
good,"Enjoyable environment for the business sector I worked in. Gained a lot of hands-on experience working with various worldwide teams during the acquisition and integration process. Felt valued for my skills, input, and solution development."
good,Nie było zgrania w tej firmie i niedogodne były godziny pracy
good,"i was a contractor and the P&G people were ""not allowed"" to interact much with the contractors. Made me feel inferior.  Also my hours were inconsistent depending on how busy we were."
good,La sécurité d'emploi était très précaire puisque Protor and Gamble ont comme habitude d'engager et de mise a pied régulière

I would not have the retirement account that I have today without P&G."
good,Aprendi nessa empresa a logística de equilibrar e conciliar o trabalho  com as diversas atividades exigidas.
good,"easy hand on work, but ending as P & G is closing. Was there through a temp agency.  Very repetitive movements and standing for a long period. Wishing there was more work available"
good,"In experience management, no respect for seniority, horrible work schedule. A lot of wasted time and money. Favoritism for curtain groups of people. Seniors forced to work shift work."
good,Not a bad place to work if you're interested in learning and developing as a career move. A climate-controlled work environment  helps with the occasional fast paced work atmosphere.
good,"Bad workplace! Management doesn't know what exactly they need at the first place. Secondly, employees at P&G are very insecure about losing their jobs. New employees are left alone to face the war alone."
good,"The schedule changes ever 2-3 months, management doesn't care about your home life, too much extra work to earn a pay raise every 18 months, The infinity groups are the best part of the job even though they are just an extra curricular activity."
good,"Long extended hours no benefits. Temporary assignment, stressful high pace employment.   Working as a team is the most enjoyable part of the job.  The workplace culture needs improvement"
good,"Good place to work. I am a sodexo contractor working at sodexo.l for 4 years. The plant is closing down. They   are moving to Loma ohio, North Carolina and Delaware. Hopefully I will find a job here in n.j"
good,"A well intentioned project, Tabler Station P&G plant is headed for disaster."
good,"I feel as though my voice in the future of this particular site in our company is snuffed out by middle management that just wants to get their next promotion, by any and all means necessary."
good,"I learned a lot of knew skills here. Was a great place to grow as a person. Just not to grow as an adult. Temporary work was the hardest part not knowing when your last day was going to be or if they would want you in the next day, was pretty stressful. I did enjoy the work I did there for the short while i was there. But in the end better opportunities came and had to move on from this location."
good,I was let go from the company for a minor accident that I didn't cause but because I was new and put on a 90 day probation period I was let go. Decision was swift and unjust and I was the only individual that was let go. I believe disciplinary action should have went both ways. I was a week away from my 90 days with High marks and no accidents within that time frame.
good,I would continue to work there but the plant is closing and i am not relocating. The schedule is hard to live with 2 weeks of day shifts and 2 weeks of night shift.
good,"typical day nonstop order picking. When you would finish with one you would drop off your order to get shrink wrapped and shipping would pick it up."
good,"Typical manufacturing environment."
good,Moderate/ faced paced job. Management was poor. Little to no advancement in the factory as far as position wise. The place is like high school all over again
good,"Working 12 hour rotating shifts does not leave alot of time for a home life, The people I work with are good people and the job is not very hard for the most part. "
good,Working 12hr swing shift for 9.75 per hr is very hard. I have to drive a hour there and back. This leads to very little rest and family time.Being a single Dad with 2 little girls its very hard.
good,Worst schedule on the planet. Don't plan on having a family or life. You will be constantly fixing things. You will be stressed out all the time. You will be tired all the time. The benefits and pay are great if only the schedule was better.
good,"* upper management is poor and lacks people skills"

good,"Pour débuter, excellente entreprise offrant un cadre intéressant et des méthodes solides."
good,"the sales job at proctor and gamble was fun.It was my first job after high school.Learnt how to deal with customers directl and how to handle customer complains."
good,Many programs are reviewed and talked about. How to team employee interest and skills with the responsibilities. Employees are expected to take ownership of their advancement goals with little or no assistance of management.
good,Seguido habrá conflictos con tu marca y con la tienda en donde se surta mercancía

good,Que tienen que cumplir con los horarios de trabajo
good,"A good company to work for, but month to month contracts don't help.  Some permanent staff are lazy and get away with it."
good,"No common rules across the board. In one department something will be fine, if u do the same thing in another department you may be in trouble.  Management Is top heavy. But over all with the pay and benefits it's not a terrible place to work."
good,"Just unsure of the time we'd work due to lack of work and very unprofessional, hard work for very minimal pay, the work atmosphere is rough, and the job is not promising everyday..we get sent home if there is no work"
good,A company of good prominence and good management. Very advanced plant. High quality products.Financial capability.A remarkable attendance in the market.
good,Working with Proctor and Gamble wasn't so bad once you get the hang of things. Job is pretty simple and they don't stick you on one job. They rotate you to different positions in one day so everybody can experience a  different position.
good,"The culture of Iowa City site consists of a strong sense of ownership in equipment and processes, however this makes people less adaptable to changes. Additionally P&G makes a lot of noise about promoting from within, however people ""only"" make it to positions of management if they are directly hired in."

Em relação ao desempenho da minha função diária, procurei sempre trabalhar em parceria com os colegas, ás vezes ensinando, em outras absorvendo conhecimento e experiências vividas pelos parceiros; Como todo profissional que se preze, eu ficava chateado quando ocorria quebra no equipamento, decorrente de uma manutenção que era planejada,mas,não era executada corretamente,comprometendo assim, o trabalho de toda equipe técnica, e a parte agradável era ver o gerente reunir o grupo para nos agradecer pelo excelente desempenho das máquinas em relação á produção das mesmas."
good,Eu aprendi a fazer varios tipos de serviços e aprendi a conviver e respeitar as pessoas da maneira que são .
good,"This is a great job if you are in Converting. Anywhere else in the building you are a second class employee. I work in logistics where you get no training, pressured to ""own"" your job, and your pay raises at 9 months and so on will be at least 3 months late. Also they will try and get you to do a leadership role without any increases in pay.  12 hour rapid rotation shifts hard to get use to. And if you are a temp outside of converting be careful cause management strings you along"
good,"Same schedule on a weekly basis, learning as you work with fellow co-workers also with the help of management input to get through the days tasks and also through though challenges mostly on inspection errors or non compliance with customer requirements. Its pretty fun and interesting seeing yourself been challenged with difficult decision making process and still never give up but find a solution."
good,"Você aprende muito."
good,"It was a fun place and it was nice to travel a lot and meet lot of people/clients doing every days differents things."
good,"Controllo banchi"
good,ho imparato a rispettare di piu' la sicurezza sul lavoro colleghi tranquilli imparare nuove cose.
good,"I enjoyed the work, but did not like where the company was going. they had a good product that they insisted on cheapening bit by bit. they didn't give raises and never even considered it."
good,"A empresa tem uma forte cultura organizacional, estimula a diversidade, inovação e competitividade. O funcionário precisa ser bem dinâmico e ágil."
good,"provided salons with products, education and growing their day to day business. did not have the support from management."
good,"My experience wasn't a good one but in all fairness I don't think my experience is representative of what it's like for everyone who works there.  Like any company, there are some departments with not-so-great managers and not-so-great co-workers and I happened to land in one of those departments.  On the positive side, I did meet some great people outside of my direct group and it can be a source of pride working on quality products.  There are some nice perks, especially if you work in the Cincinnati area bc the whole town treats you like royalty if you work for P&G.  With any company, there are a lot of politics involved with climbing the ladder and some functions it's nearly impossible to get advanced past a certain point unless you're constantly playing manager's pet."
good,"Procter & Gamble is undoubtedly a place many people want to work. For many people, it can be a solid, secure career with great benefits. However, prepare to be reduced to a quantifiable unit that is paired to projects based on those parameters."
good,"	Engineer/Test/Document new security solutions to decrease security vulnerabilities within the P & G environment. "
good,"En los dos años que trabaje por ETT en esta empresa lo mejor que encontré fueron los compañeros con los que tuve la suerte de trabajar, incluidos los manager."
good,"Great to work with different cultures"
good,"Company culture is okay, it's a competitive world which is also good at times"
good,"I got the opportunity to work for P&G later in my life (over 30) but was the best decision I have ever made.  I achieved more than I ever thought possible; gained competencies and skillset that would not have been possible elsewhere.  Benefits, retirement plan is essential for retirement years.  I would not have the retirement account that I have today without P&G."
good,"too little pay, working environment was way too cold, but the people were nice."
good,"Uma boa empresa para quem está entrando no mercado de trabalho, pois tem uma gerência boa que nús fornece diversas informações da cia e te fornece diversos cursos de capacitação, realiza diversas palestras educacionais e entre outras.Acima de tudo é um lugar bem agradavél, pois todos os setores são climatizados e com e as pessoas que fazem parte desse senário são super dinâmica e todos se respeitam  a capacidade individual de cada um e isso nús ensentiva a trabalhar como uma equipe.O que o torna desagradável é a politica da empresa em cobrar muito e reduzir diversos custos o que leva desmotivação de vários funcionarios."
good,A great company but doesn't like engineers - they want people managers.
good,good environment to work for freshers and graduates..............................
good,Unless you like working swing shifts and 12 hour shifts. If you are in a day shift role or management expect 60 to 80 hour weeks in most operational roles.  There are some roles there that area normal schedule. Home life is hard with this schedule.
good,"1.During shutdown"
good,"The work causes strain on the hands and feet but some of the people you meet and get to work with are nice. The hardest part would be dealing with the uncertainty of work, but that is so with nearly every temp agency. I personally enjoyed being a part of the team and being counted on as a productive worker to get things done. A typical day of work mostly included folding cardboard to fit the product and adding the product to it, making nice little (or big in some cases) stands for product."
good,"Very pleasant colleagues,good working environment,I learned alot about mechanical activities. Resume morning shift by 6:30am and close by 2:30pm."
good,"Assembly Line Work "
good,"Rotating shifts make it hard to have a work-family life balance.  Last minute schedule changes throughout the plant that you are expected to not complain about because it is ""the business need.""  "
good,Es una empresa lider con sus altas y bajas.
good,A typical day at work for me was keeping up with the machines. I learned how to fill a machine.
good,"I got the opportunity to work for P&G later in my life (over 30) but was the best decision I have ever made.  I achieved more than I ever thought possible; gained competencies and skillset that would not have been possible elsewhere.  Benefits, retirement plan is essential for retirement years.  I would not have the retirement account that I have today without P&G."
good,"Procter & Gamble is a great company to work for. Work-Life Balance is a struggle, which makes things difficult. However, this company maintains great processes and standards, while staying true to its Personal Values and Principles."
good,"Procter and gamble is a nice place to work. the compensation is fair, but the idea of being promoted is slim to none. The company gives you plenty of skills that you would be able to put to good use at other companies."
good,"see ratings above which explains my 23 years with Procter & Gamble from 1991 - 2014  I don't have much more to say. I sure can't explain it in a short paragraph.  learned a lot of things in 23 years, some good, some bad"
good,I would've enjoyed working at Proctor & Gamble but the Premier employment agency I was through was overstaffed there and they had very little work. They sent myself and others home frequently. It was a waste of time and gas.
good,"Some of the management is a bit too down your throat,  I also don't think we get paid enough since the temps do most of the grunt work. One good thing is their flexibility with shifts."
good,"Aunque la empresa es muy buena, algunos jefes exijen demasiado, hay q trabajar tiempo hasta de más sin resibir ni una compensación por ello y hay mucho favoritismo con algunas personas."
good,"Interesting type of hard work is done in this warehouse. It was very hot, and the supervisor didn’t seem fair at times. However, it was the overnight shift which I worked."
good,"The working environment was great, everyone very friendly and helpful.  The hardest part of the job was reviewing numbers all day, which could be quite monotonous."
good,"I have nothing to add for this employer, the benefits are good and if you have a set schedule its normally Monday-Friday pay is also competitive for the positions."
good,"Has been a great place to work with lots of opportunity to develop skills in all aspects of manufacturing from mechanical and electrical to leadership and teamwork."
good,"The plant in Inwood, WV is still growing and short staffed.  Managers are under huge pressure, and that makes it difficult for them to offer mentorship and guidance to new hires."
good,"Formation et entrainement au top."
good,"Good company, average benefits, different treatment depending on which organization you are working in.  D&I is very valued at the company and will help all feel accepted."
good,"Get in and get out.  Understand who you are working for( family) nothing else matters.  Do your job and go home.  it's okay to show yourself friendly, but the associates are not your friend."
good,"What makes the Company stand out - people. People in PG are amazing. This druves a fierce internal competition that naturally forces you to stay current, up to speec in your domain of activity. "
good,"Depending on the position you take and the role you're put in. It can be challenging and at times rewarding. Sometimes stressful, although the levels are based on your own goals and desires."
good,"I got the opportunity to work for P&G later in my life (over 30) but was the best decision I have ever made.  I achieved more than I ever thought possible; gained competencies and skillset that would not have been possible elsewhere.  Benefits, retirement plan is essential for retirement years.  I would not have the retirement account that I have today without P&G."
good,"Technicians rotate on a 12 hour shift, some opportunity for a day shift job. Training is sufficient for the task  your are required to do and the pay is good."
good,"The job itself is not bad despite being highly repetitive. But the training is awful. My trainer was a really nice bloke and fun individual but because he spoke in such a low pitch and with a strong dutch accent, was not very easy to pick up what he was saying. This in turn hindered initial progress into the role "
good,Had a fun time learning new things at P&G. Had a great group of co-workers that help me grow in the company.  The medical coverage was awesome.  The atmosphere was a family type.
good,"There is a lot of work to be done and a lot is expected of everyone, but it is quite a fun environment to work in. Lots of lovely people and management know that treating their teams helps to motivate us! Unfortunately business need sometimes trumps personal preference for new roles (you typically rotate roles/departments every 18-24 months to keep things ""fresh"" and ""increase your knowledge"") so you may be shifted to do a job you had no interest in. Salary isn't great, claims to be competitive but is seemingly competitive with call centre work, however if you're interested in finance then they are willing to fund ACCA studies which can be quite expensive, so it might be worth it if that's something you'd like to do."
good,I haven't work there since 2013. I'm not sure of the culture there now. When i was there they was about to make alot of changes. Changes in they work hours. Also changes in the facility. They were in the process of relocating.
good,"A very detailed company with various sku's , a fast moving consumer goods company with cognitive staffs and a large networking solutions with state of the art warehouse"
good,The culture was very poor as everyone cared for themselves . Management was single minded and was not open to change. Besides that the work was interesting and challenging.
good,"The Plan is a great place to work with good people in it however the hiring criteria is questionable. "
good,It was good work and clean safe  environment . i really enjoy be out there at the time my work experience when out there on lines packaging and check any errors in product of the diapers that. I would pack into boxes.
good,"fast past production work, great people hard work stressful but motivating gave you goals to work torwards  ... Good place to work... plant shutting down.."
good,"Highly competitive and often too internally focused.  Your job s striking the balance with serving both your internal and external customer. Roles often blend into after hours, challenging work life balance."
good,"Busy day keeping equipment running, autonomous maintenance performance, meeting demands of team leader.  Strong safety culture.  Little time for training"
good,Enjoyed my P&G experience especially at the Cincinnati headquarters with good benefits.  The culture is highly competitive.  Would have like more opportunities for advancement.
good,buena empresa pero piensan aveses k uno es titere y eso no se ase
good,Bien gestionado y ambiente necesario. Buanos compañeros y buena organización.
good,A nice company to work for. Management treated their Territory Managers like adults didn't ride us. Learned that taking the lead on a project got you noticed within this organization's management team. Culture was professionalism at its finest. Logistical challenges from partners may be the hardest part of the job. Most enjoyable part of the job was being recognized for a job well done by management.
good,"bom aprendizado  experiencia, conquistas, beneficios"
good,"i have working project team,"
good,"I got the opportunity to work for P&G later in my life (over 30) but was the best decision I have ever made.  I achieved more than I ever thought possible; gained competencies and skillset that would not have been possible elsewhere.  Benefits, retirement plan is essential for retirement years.  I would not have the retirement account that I have today without P&G."
good,"No geral, a empresa tem uma cultura excelente, que motiva os funcionários e faz com que os mesmos dêem o seu melhor. No entanto, existe muitas ""panelinhas"" que influenciam na contratação ou promoção de alguém."
good,"Punch in"
good,"During my stay at Modern Products Company - Procter & Gamble joint venture i can say that it was a harmonious working place and very challenging in the sense that I encountered and learned state-of-the-art software like for example the Systems, Applications & Products (SAP) - Purchasing System in particular. I met people from other countries working in the company with different expertise. The hardest part of the job is that I am not paid direct from the company itself but to my manpower agency who supplied me. Despite of it, I still enjoy my job because I learned and experienced the advanced technology especially in the field of computers and internet and in some small measures, I feel my belongingness to my co-workers in Procter and Gamble - Jeddah, KSA."
good,"As a temporary general laborer I did line setups and take downs."
good,"Great, safe job.  It's very monotonous but if you show up in time and do what you're asked, you're almost guaranteed to have a job for a long time.  There were a lot of people there that had worked the same job for over 30 yrs."
good,"Empresa estável economicamente , com profundas lacunas em sua identidade gerencial devido a pluralidade de negócios( se procura unificar as estruturas de todas as plantas com produtos de diferentes segmentos e processos onde se exigem gerencialmente falando uma metodologia diferenciada) querem inventar uma sistemática de qualidade como a Toyota mas não possuem bagagem técnica para isso e ao meu ver falta humildade para incorporar sistemas de outras empresas e querem usar o chamado IWS como marca de sua qualidade afim de inspirar outras empresas , parece bonito mas é só market ."
good,"I worked for them a little over a year. it was rough at first with the supervisor over us but after she was gone things stated to get better, until the hostel take over began. I would have to work six days a week ten hour shifts and the pay wasn't that great. I had just come back from a traumatic situation and was shown no remorse when I had to go to the doctor or court about the situation. eventually I was laid off for this. after I was laid off they gave everyone raises."
good,"i was a hard core worker,i spend every day 12 to 14 hours,and i love my job because i live all my life in a trading climate, i like to work in rema tusen now to start again."
good,"regular de se trabalhar, a empresa faz muito marcketing, mas não é tudo o que se diz ser na integração"
good,"Es una muy buena escuela para aprender acerca de cultura laboral, manufactura y diferentes disciplinas, enfocada en el negocio, no muy people oriented y que ayuda al crecimiento y formación de líderes."
good,"It was a fast past job you just have to keep-up with the machine. I learn how the machine works. management not that good, they have you to come to work and then send you back home if they don't need you, they need see if there is a way to let you know before you leave home. Some time they did but a lot of times they didn't. Co-workers were good. A long walk to the entrance door from the parking lot, then a long walk and up two flights of stairs to the locker room/cafeteria and restrooms are on the first floor but a long walk from the work place. It was hard to work when its COLD outside it was COLD inside, and when it was HOT outside it was HOT inside. I Enjoy the job once I could keep-up with the machine."
good,One aspect that sets P&G up is their on the job training and confidence in you as an employee. From day one you are handed responsibilities and are measured against them whilst being constantly supported through relevant training.
good,"Bons conhecimentos, trabalho em equipe, os colegas sempre deram suporte, segurança sempre"
good,"I wish however, that the pay scale were much higher. The job, atmoshpere  and people are alright but the salary structure could be higher with benefits that would be great."
good,"Very competitive company"
good,"Dedicated to the daily direction plan for the work of the day. "
good,"P&G has been a great place to learn, grow, and exercise significant decision space over my career.  There had been an expectation that growing the company meant growing the people who report to you, and so on.  "
good,"in MEA region there are a lot of bad managers in this company who you should not trust."
good,"I got the opportunity to work for P&G later in my life (over 30) but was the best decision I have ever made.  I achieved more than I ever thought possible; gained competencies and skillset that would not have been possible elsewhere.  Benefits, retirement plan is essential for retirement years.  I would not have the retirement account that I have today without P&G."
good,Muy buena emoresa se preocuban mucho por el bienestar del personal
good,No chance to move up or to a different position once you are labeled as a Driver/Spotter. The hardest part pf my job is working in the weather and climbing up and down the stairs of the spotter for 10 hours.
good,Everything is organized and professional. I learned a lot here especially on Retail Design. There's always something to learn from them and so many you could offer as well.
good,"Not an enjoyable place to work. Unless you're in management, you don't matter."
good,"Production Environment - 12 hour shifts - has receiving, manufacturing, packaging, and shipping function areas.  Management tended to be be very us vs. them."
good,"1. i have learn how to : "
good,Plenty of good people to  work around.  I learned a lot of skills to use in a work environment and also personally.
good,This job gives you the freedom to work without anyone bothering you. You work with a team and it's low stress but can be laborious at times
good,"Like anywhere you work you will run into the people who are negative about their job and that bring you down.When i started working here i took that into consideration and then realized why everyone is down. You are overworked constantly with very little time to spend with family or on things you used to enjoy. When you start out they tell you how you will have so many days off, and they are right you will but what you don't know is that most of those days you have off you will spend working mandatory overtime or you will be trying to recover yourself after being worked so hard. Never in my life have i worked somewhere to be so under appreciated and seen as a number instead of a person. You go out of your way for these people only to be used and disrespected.  Also as anywhere you work you will discover the cliques or good ol boys clubs. But this place takes it to a whole new level. One department in particular, where people are given leader positions based on friendships and race rather than their work ethic and knowledge. On another note the benefits are good compared to other companies on the same level as Duracell and the pay isn't bad if you can handle being away from your family all of the time. The people you work with on shift are great for the most part, they are all just ran down all of the time but that is understandable considering what you have to deal with. Management in some departments is ignorant when it comes to the machinery that makes the batteries. They are only there to ""supervise"" and nothing else. So when it comes to making technical decisions they are"
good,"Career oriented, lot's of responsibility / learning opportunities, good school but need to resist to high work pressure"
good,"i joined after my college and i am a fresher, it is good company but the salary is low."
good,"Em geral a Procter me foi uma grande lição de vida, por ser uma multi nacional renomada aprendi muitas coisas que vou levar para a minha vida profissional por toda a vida, como lidar com pessoas, a ser organizado, como lidar com problemas, a pensar rápido e ser eficiente,  os colegas de trabalho em geral são bem jovens e isso facilita muito a comunicação devido a nos intendermos melhor.A gerência técnicamente é muito boa entretanto não visa muito a qualidade de vida dos funcionários onde acaba afetando muito na vida pessoal.Eu vejo como a independência que eles cobram como uma parte agradável pois o trabalho flui melhor, mas o fato de não conseguir subir de nível na empresa faz do trabalho la ser bem desagradável para quem pretende crescer."
good,"I currenty am on a rotating 12 hour shift and am ready for a job with less pressure and more normal hours. I really like mechanical work and am very reliable.I dont have a problem working with the public and take pride in getting my work done and complete in a timely manner.The hardest part of my current job is the federal rules and regs getting young new employees to follow rules."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job for me was the challenge of learning and refining their new system roll out of S.A.P. I also loved the analytical challenges the job brought. I not only was able to gain valuable knowledge in regards to P&G operations, but also Wal-Mart replenishment and distribution systems."
good,The work part is great! The management is driving the place into the ground.
good,A typical day at work consisted of calling on customers (pharmacies) to meet the terms of the contract. I learned how a contract position works. I had no real contact with management. I only saw my co-workers at training one time. The job was easy. The freedom was the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"I liked working there my assignment just ended really quick, wish I could go back. They would send me home whenever they wanted to or if there was to many people"
good,It’s a 12 hour shifts only. Either your not working and just standing waiting or your working fast non stop. You stand on your feet a lot. They provide transportation.
good,"I got the opportunity to work for P&G later in my life (over 30) but was the best decision I have ever made.  I achieved more than I ever thought possible; gained competencies and skillset that would not have been possible elsewhere.  Benefits, retirement plan is essential for retirement years.  I would not have the retirement account that I have today without P&G."
good,"I worked there for a couple weeks at first I loved it coworkers where friendly management was nice, but then they started sending me home almost every day cuz of work shortage and and not getting more than 15 - 20 hours per week was nit worth the 35 minute drive."
good,"Questions were answered about last employer. I’ve been out of there 4.5 years, I have no idea what the culture is like now as management changes every 6 months."
good,"trabajar a qui me genero estabilidad que es lo que yo buscaba el horario me permitía pasar tiempo con mi familia ,"
good,"salário e benefícios muito bons;"
good,A stressful place to work. not much advancement unless you are excepted and part of the ( popular click).Not much direction. Kind of left to the wolves left to figure out on own.
good,"Mal liderazgo, falta de apoyo a personal egresado para nuevos retos."
good,"I could not stand their hours, two days on then two days off then three nights on and two days off. Simple work, but they want you to learn how to fix the equipment."
good,"As a general rule, every policy should be reviewed every one to three years. But most experts recommend reviewing policies annually. Policy review doesn't have to be as daunting a task as it sounds."
good,I loved my job. I disliked how things were operated and employees were being hired left and right that were not qualified for security. I had to do alot of babysitting.
good,le poste est correcte cependant il y a une séparation promoteur chef de secteur
good,"Overall, working at Procter & Gamble was an adequate experience. The days were 8.5 hours at 5 days a week unless specified before hand. The supervisors were friendly and good leaders."
good,"Love the environment and the people"
good,"This is an excellent company to work for. They are constantly supporting their engineers, and have good salaries. However, it’s not overly interesting work."
good,They didn’t give me a lot of hours but it was only a temp service but it was alright it wasn’t to bad I just felt like I could have worked more than two days a week
good,Empresa en crecimiento que amplia expectativa a reestructurar el día a día de labores.
good,"Good employer, began working there 13 years ago. Currently the facility is closing or I would not likely be looking for further employment."
good,"You work 12 .5 hour shifts, changing from night shift back to day in the same week.  It is very hard to get used to.  You are on your feet, standing on concrete the entire time."
good,Very hot but u stay busy the people there are friendly for the most part but u dnt get a lot of time to be with your family while workin twelve’s but after a while u get use to it
good,"I got the opportunity to work for P&G later in my life (over 30) but was the best decision I have ever made.  I achieved more than I ever thought possible; gained competencies and skillset that would not have been possible elsewhere.  Benefits, retirement plan is essential for retirement years.  I would not have the retirement account that I have today without P&G."
good,It is a great job if you work for the actual company if your a temp its not that good they treat you like you are just there for their convenience. but if you work for the actual company they treat you very well and you get great benefits i only know this because I have a few friends and family members who work for them.
good,"Enjoyed working for this company, offered me full time travel, unfortunately unable to commit to cross country travel at that time. Autonomy and respected employee feed back."
good,When I was working at proctor & gamble it was a cool laid back job besides standing on your feet for 12 hrs which wasn’t the hard part because I was used to it. It was a very easy job.
good,"relatively good place to work, decent pay for the work required. long hours make it a tiring place to be after a third 12 hour shift in a row. when management provides feedback, it tends to be at the end of a 12 hour shift, leaving the one who is receiving the feedback in a tired state of mind unable to properly voice their opinion."
good,"I really don't have any thing to say about the job at the moment just know it's a good working place..................................,......................"
good,I loved working for Proctor and Gamble. This company really cared for their employees. They offer stock options for employees and also offer company product for free. Learned a lot working
good,Good workplace culture and lot of opportunities to learn and be innovative. A very good work ambiance and friendly colleagues. I would P&G recommend for my friends.
good,a typical day was standing on our feet all day working on an assembly line. The hardest part of the job was standing in the same place with short breaks. The enjoyable part of the job was getting to know other people but the hours made it less desirable.
good,"I currently Manage a team of 15 reps and work remotely and out in the field on a daily basis.  My territory consist of 3 states and I work closely with each Rep as time permits along with covering stores and working closely in stores with Management on working products OSA, display compliance and filling/stocking shelves for our Client P&G."
good,"Being here from the instant , I was very uncomfortable with my surroundings.. People was arguing, fighting in the the rest Area.. Just a scary situation to be placed in.."
good,"Company was good to me.  Great experience.  Including good and bad.  Teaches technical, leadership, teamwork and analytical skills.  The pressure can be a bit much."
good,As a whole the company taught me a lot about production and material handling. The forklift training was straight forward and hands on. And as a trainer I learned a lot on the business aspect of things.
good,"Es una compañía de alto desempeño,  en la cual se aprende mucho en todas las áreas de la organización.  Muy exigente y con una carga laboral bastante exigente.  Tiene muy buenos beneficios económicos."
good,You compete against your peers and are compared to them.  As a result it creates an environment that it not productive. Keep in mind they are one of the largest marketing companies and they are best at marketing themselves.
good,Its a productive fast-paced environment and must have efficient accuracy of products when picking an order and requires proper time management and ect
good,"En general la experiencia es retadora. Sin embargo, existe machismo y clasismo dentro de sus trabajadores."
good,"Would recommend to anyone who's just trying to make a living and find somewhere to start off at as they advance their life. Its a great job to advance in, they will you in whatever you need help with."
good,Procter&Gamble is a work place were you have to make sure you pay attention because they  have machines their so you wont hurt yourself. Just make sure you are ready and willing to work.
good,"Overall good company but, in the long run they didn't want to pay their people for what they are worth. To keep good people you need to hire good people and that will cost you more in salary but, they will take care of your business and not look for other opportunities."
good,Good working culture and better place to work for. ready to work for long hours and good support from seniors and every month last review meet and your score for the last month.
good,Good people and solid company got to say over all a good place to work. Id love to go back one day when things are different for me. Kind of hot in there but they have fans and good food
good,It prepared me for my future and paid well. I would still be there if they didn't shut down my plant and move to Greensboro North Carolina. They gave everyone a chance to relocate but I decided to move on.
good,"Aprendí a trabajar en un entorno multinacional, con colegas en todo el mundo, lo que me permitió empatizar y entender que existen muchas maneras de trabajar, aunque todos tuvieramos los mismos objetivos."
good,"basic tutorial on category management and other scope of work"
good,"Great job security.  Most never leave once they get a job.  "
good,Good company before our plant was bought. Usually you have weekends off and paid holidays. Start with 2 weeks paid vacation and sick time. Decent and fair company to work for.
good,Hard changing shifts every single week. Coworkers become your new family because you will have very little opportunity to see your own family. Probably why there are so many marriages within the company.
good,"Se puede trabajar bien, a veces bajo mucha presión"
good,"packing house hold cleaning items, hair care products, working on a assembly line, just a quick flowing job, fast paced, easily learned. nice easy pay"
good,i learned to respect other and to be positive at all times.the management is good and thoughtful. my co workers gave me confidence to do my job they are also have teamwork
good,If you consider yourself to be self reliable person then this job is good.  You know what you need to do and actually do the job.  It can get frustrating among the others.
good,"Acosta Sales hired by Procter and Gamble to manage the hispanic market in the Miami-Dade county area."
good,I was a contractor at Proctor and Gamble. I was employed by Fluor Industries on a construction project at the Proctor and Gamble project. I was not employed by P and G
good,This is an ok company to work for. Pay is pretty low for the type of work that is being done. Long hours and weird schedules with different days off. The good thing about this warehouse is that they off three different work schedules.
good,"I got the opportunity to work for P&G later in my life (over 30) but was the best decision I have ever made.  I achieved more than I ever thought possible; gained competencies and skillset that would not have been possible elsewhere.  Benefits, retirement plan is essential for retirement years.  I would not have the retirement account that I have today without P&G."
good,"Opportunities to learn, but be ready to relocate every 18-24 months.  If you're not ready to relocate often, you wont have a long career here.  A lot of bureaucracy & red tape.  By the time a decision is made, the opportunity has been missed.    Some of the brands are struggling.  Not what it used to be."
good,"proctor & game has a great work place environment, and a great staff all in all, it is a great company and I would recommend it to any person looking for a long term company."

good,very busy work. pretty much stay busy the whole shift. Very responsible job. Liked the job but I am getting laid off. Enjoyed the people that I work with and the people I worked for
good,Procter and Gamble had a very competitive environment. There was no collaboration among coworkers. Although there was collaboration with peers in other regions. Inside the company environment was very frivolous.
good,The work environment was good.  My co-workers were helpful and considerate.  The benefits were good as well as the pay.  There were many different aspects of the job that I enjoyed.
good,need to be able to move fast with hands. A good working environment with people is always trying to help. The management is fair and very understanding.
good,You learn to use pullys and stack a skid. You get to meet people from all over the world. You got to bring your own launch. The best hours to work for them are mornings or over nights.
good,"The hours was very long which is not a problem, but when you are packing the same boxes for 12 hours starts to become mind numbing. they should switch positions around."
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo"
good,Firm was as expected. Neither too involved with us nor helped at all.
good,Procter and Gamble is closing it's operations in Brockville. It would have been a good career if had stayed in the city. Very comprehensive and great safety training.
good,They only give us one 30 min lunch break an no other breaks. Sometimes the manager would let you work or if they didn't like you then you might not be picked for the line. I got along with everyone. Coworkers are great and so are the line leads. Some of the managers are messy and will try to get you in trouble.
good,"Everyone praises how great it is to work at P&G, but it's very cutthroat and competitive.  You will either move up at the expense of others, or you're out."
good,Loc de munca placut unde angajatii sunt bine pregatiti.
good,"I got the opportunity to work for P&G later in my life (over 30) but was the best decision I have ever made.

I would not have the retirement account that I have today without P&G."
good,"I liked the work I did and the people I worked with but the Management only looked out for them selves. they would bid jobs poorly, and under staff departments. Extremely hard to get a raise. Started me at a lower rate than what I would have liked but told me I would get a review in 90 days. 90 days came and went, 120 days came and went. I was told that that was never told to me in the interview. any and all bonuses went to Management. not to the people that actually did the work. Plus they were always looking over your shoulder to TRY and catch you doing something wrong and when they didn't they made something up."
good,I would go to work at proctor and gamble nightshift from 6pm-2:30am packaging products in the warehouse the hardest part of the job was lifting heavy equipment and the most I liked about the job packaging products.
good,"•Good Security"

good,"When I started at P&G, it was the place to learn the basics of marketing and Consumer understanding.  I learned so much about the basics of running a business, and how to step wise think about management.  "
good,"Great place to work if you get in early or have the stamina to work over 60 hours/week to get ahead.  Shifts are long but the work is pretty straight forward.  Some people in charge of things shouldn't be, but this is true for any workplace.  When things are going well, employees are treated really well.  When something goes wrong, IE a quality issue, you better cover yourself because the blame game starts."
good,"long days that would dread on when supervisors where stressed out, sometimes management would seem kind of lost and didn't know how to react to situations"
good,Good place to work with a nice environment all employees are treated equally and the site is an enjoyable place. The ethnicity is a diverse one with all types of race involving you to communicate and interact with everyone. a typical day at work would be clocking in and then having a brief team meeting as well as morning stretch to loosen up body limbs. afterwards everyone heads to the office to pick up their daily logs and head to the forklifts where work would begin.
good,I need a job where i should also grow with company. My effort to the company will be 100% i will prove myself with my work style. in any location i can work all over india.

good,"This company wants people to be available at all times to collaborate.  No time or place to relax and get rejuvenated.  A typical work day starts at one building with all meetings .  Then during your lunch hour you have to drive to another site across town for further collaboration.  "
good,This started as a very nice occupation. It slowly became too demanding! The amount of work that is needed is not compensated for. Long hours away from home and few benefits.
good,"I was not a fan of the advancement plan. Although this has changed, my group was locked into an entry level position for many years. It was often long hours."
good,"I got the opportunity to work for P&G later in my life (over 30) but was the best decision I have ever made.

good,Proctor and gamble was one of the jobs that I actually can say was a reliable job no matter what I knew I was going to get my 40+ hrs a week and overtime if I wanted I really liked the fact that we got paid every Friday but being that I worked third shift I got my check when I came in on Thursday night yes I loved working for them I worked all over that place it was face pace and I'm the type of person that hate to be bored I got my job done and who ever elses

good,working in this company is good but cant think about long term stand because of family needs I need a future secure based job.
good,"The job itself is rather easy as most of your work is just cleaning machines and rethreading them when they go down, or you are doing quality, or driving a fork truck, or if your line is down you could find yourself palletizing which really is not the most fun job in the world. "

good,"trés ouvert sur les interfaces internes et externes. Une certaine autonomie dans le travail, des missions claires et des objectifs clairement partagés"
good,"A typical day at work is basically all work and sometimes there is no room for anything else. I learned how to operate pallet jacks and some of the machines. The management isn't always around exactly when you need them, but they know how to handle the situations that go on inside the plant. The co-workers at this job are just like any other job, some days there's drama and other days majority of the day is peaceful. The hardest part of this job isn't the job itself, it's the pay because the pay barely gets you by. Getting paid every week sounds good, but when one check doesn't cover one bill alone so that makes completing the job difficult. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people I work with because they make every day a new experience and a life lesson."

good,"Good work life balance, fair benefits, and average salaries for most positions but your position (and salary) in the company is based more heavily on your degree and college you received you degree from than you actual value you bring to the company. Once you are in the door you are locked into a specific career track and there is next to nothing you can do to move up the ladder fast. All the training and additional degrees in the world coupled with stellar performance will move you up the ladder but only at the rate they have already deemed acceptable for people on your career track. They will also only grade you harder when review time comes. You are not evenly graded against your peers but instead against what you manager(s) expect from you."

Aos demais funcionários, que iniciam na empresa como ""A&T"", a possibilidade de promoção é bastante remota.

good,"Procter and Gamble is a good place for learning how to work under pressure. You have to be focus all the time in the line and to be so quick because it goes so fast. It's a good place to improve your experience as a factory staff. But for me the worst thing of Procter and Gamble is the timetable because your shifts are always changing between days and nights and it's so difficult to get used to this kind of life. For this reason I prefer to work for example in the nights but always in the nights shifts, and then you can organise better your time and going during the day to english lessons to improve your language or another activity."

Typical day was performing all job requirements, documenting that work and forwarding to the company daily via handheld computers. Work requirements involved general data work, setting displays, stocking and order recommendations. Assisted Dept. Mgrs. in all aspects pertaining to P&G's products. We took pride in our stores and maintained great rapport with Mgrs. and co-workers.

good,Working at Procter and Gamble was a good opportunity because i was easily able to begin working at the job site without much difficulty. They hire seasonally and many people from my neighborhood benefit from the fact that they are able to staff many people who need jobs. I left to pursue the next level of my educational career at CSU Cal Poly Pomona. I also realized that to ascend the corporate ladder would be very timely as there were many workers who had been working at the job site for 5-10 years and had just received new positions with pay raises shortly before I arrived.

I would not have the retirement account that I have today without P&G."
good,"College graduates will soon get exposed to verity of technologies and systems. Not much room to advance after you learned every thing, technical things getting repetitive and you start doing more politics."
good,A typical day at work would be to come in a just run the line as best as possible and react to issues as the arise. I learned how to adapt quickly as you need to think on your toes in order to do your job properly. I would say that the hardest part of the job would be finding things to when there is downtime for the line. The most satisfying part of the job would be the fact the you never stop learning and there are always new things to challenge you.
good,At proctor and gamble their were people that thought they were above me and said that they needed to tell me the way to do my job and I didn’t like that!
good,It was a great experience working at P&G as it was fast-paced and the role provided a lot of opportunities to grow within the company. This corporation nurtured my in a way which helped me move forward in my life.
good,You will need to compete a lot to get on. Pay may not reflect your abilities. You will need to push management to get on. If you keep to yourself you will be left in one position. Found their training not up to date.
good,"This location is still in the start phase and is in much need of improvement. There are still a lot of kinks to be worked out, which include the work environment (i.e. smells, non-working safety features (eye wash stations), leaks, chemical hazards, etc.). They definitely put the cart before the horse building this plant and took short cuts. It has potential but it’s not as great as they make it out to be."
good,"At the time of my employment, management need more qualified person on their staff. Since my time of employment i heard that management is under different structure."
good,"Ok place to work when not being forced overtime ."
good,"P&G is a good company with lots of benefits. During the current economic climate, they have lost their way. Cutting jobs and increasing work for newer employees who already make less than their senior co-workers. All of this exploitation to increase profit margin every quarter instead of just enjoying the profit, period. Too much stress for the work at hand."

good,"respeto por el orario de trabajo, ambiente amigable,seguro medico,capacitaciones constantes etc."
good,It was a cool place meeting new people and learning new things the workplace it self was like a gym that pays you. I got in shape from it. The place gave you freedom but still needs to be responsible on urban own.
good,"I got the opportunity to work for P&G later in my life (over 30) but was the best decision I have ever made.

good,I met forward thinking employees with a passion for success. I achieved to provide a balanced work life and meet every expectation given to me by my work mates.
good,"Great opportunities for learning many skills. Typical days are unpredictable and very busy making it difficult to occasionally plan after work activities. Management encourages a competitive, cost cutting culture."
good,"Pay does stay competitive and descent benefits and insurance along with cost of living raises. Your life will become P&G though, no life work balance. Needs better management."
good,"La tipica giornata di lavoro è interamente stabilita dai meeting che si svolgono la mattina, tramite i quali si stabiliscono le priorità della giornata a livello di piccoli teams, reparti e plant. "
good,"This is a company with very high principles and values which are not just on the company website, they are principles and values that almost everyone leaves by on a daily bases. I loved their system of promoting from within as it allows the company to focus on people's skills development. Unfortunately job security is not a big priority for P&G."
good,a lot has changed since I left. I held my position quite a while and was never offered employment with the company do to the amount of openings on the shift I worked. it is an excellent transition job.
good,"Great pay and benefits, but long hours and an Alternating Work Schedule. Working in a team atmosphere where the success of the entire team is dependent on the efforts of each individual team member. Getting along with others and multi-tasking is a MUST."

good,Market ar auditing by self - finance executive and teal work full supporting for sales all teams..........................................................
good,la empresa es buena pero el personal administrativo es malo
good,"Let me start by saying P&G is filled with great people and still many opportunities.  However in recent years, lackluster business performance overall has changed the culture of P&G, as separation packages are offered and benefits erode year after year the culture has shifted dramatically since I started.  The same great, hard working passionate, smart people are here by and large, but the culture is negatively shifting due to P&G's continued choice to play to the investors rather than continue innovating at a high level, being the leader of innovation in the market and taking care of their employees as they have in the past.  One thing remains, this is still a great company, great people and lots of opportunity to learn and grow yourself as a leader."
good,P&G was a great job when it comes to warehouse experience and working as a team to get the job done. the mangers was good to get along with i would work there again
good,"Depends on what you do but for the Supply Chain person, no one day is the same."
good,Alles in allem ok. Bei 7 Tage Kombinationsschicht ist nicht viel mit Familie und Freizeit.
good,"é uma empresa com cultura americana e ótimos conceitos, porém, alguns líderes se deixam influenciar por fatores extra profissional e nem sempre a meritocracia se aplica na prática. Mas uma empresa com ótimos benefícios e de certa forma, nos dá estabilidade"
good,"Ao chegar no meu posto de trabalho o gerente da Empresa estava a minha espera para me informa que o motor que estava para eu bobinar estava atrasado devido algumas peças ter atrasado, por isso, queria que eu terminasse mais rapidamente o processo de bobinagem do motor.Com isso, tive que aprender a lidar com pressão e  ter mais calma e tranquilidade para exerce minha atividade. Entretanto tinha uma agradável companhia com meus colegas de trabalho por sempre estarmos fazendo algo para reunirmos fora do local de trabalho."
good,Now stressful place to work. Unstable environment regarding job security. Doing the same amount of work with less people makes work life balance harder.
good,"I got the opportunity to work for P&G later in my life (over 30) but was the best decision I have ever made.  I achieved more than I ever thought possible; gained competencies and skillset that would not have been possible elsewhere.  Benefits, retirement plan is essential for retirement years.

good,"On a typical day unload and sort materials from dock, inspect quality of material then load product on to assembly line. Operate pallet jack to move large amounts of products and operate forklift to store and remove products from high level shelves, also when waiting on trucks to deliver product, had to clean up ware house and any scraps."
good,"I had a manager who got frustrated when I was stuck, so I might have been unlucky. However, other employees were very helpful. All the work is VERY structured and fixed, and I prefer flexibility and creativity. Out of that, I had access to very knowledgeable people and an amazing company's history."
good,"I would have a meeting to start my shift and I would have a meeting to end your shift."
good,Everyone was nice and people stay at the company for a long time. There is a very strong promote from within culture. The work is pretty slow paced and there are a lot of meetings.
good,"Everyone was nice and there was a great work company culture. However, it took forever to get anything done because the company is so big and there's so much bureaucracy."
good,"Honestly it wasn't a bad job, they tried to work with my schedule being in college but the timing when i started my internship was hard for them to cope with but other than that the pay was great the teamwork was awesome and i had no issues."
good,"Okay place to work. Rotating shifts can be harsh.Fellow employees are fairly helpful. As long as everyone pays attention to their job, the shift usually runs smoothly."
good,"I got the opportunity to work for P&G later in my life (over 30) but was the best decision I have ever made.  I achieved more than I ever thought possible; gained competencies and skillset that would not have been possible elsewhere.  Benefits, retirement plan is essential for retirement years.

good,"- Karriere wird im Unternehmen GROSS geschrieben"
good,It’s was a ok place to work safe good  supervisors  No clean places don’t work there no more but I like it when I did just want to more up I ain’t work there in over 4 years ago
good,"Great brands, great products and C-Level leaders are trying to change the culture and change it to meet the demands of the 21st century.  Sadly, a preponderance of P&G employees move at a snails pace, are stricken with analysis paralysis, are void of any risk taking ability and expect the company to reward them for time served and self promotion over the real accomplishments, ability and leadership skills."
good,It's the company xlc services that are contracted under P&G xlc is awful. Xlc Services management is the worst ever if someone from the Executive offices came  down to see exactly  how bad management is they will be very disappointed and understand why they're losing all of their accounts. And there is no absolutely no one you can complain to that will do anything about it in the corporate office8
good,P&G's processes are very defined and standardized globally. Pay and benefits are also very good. Employees uphold highest standard of professional behavior. sometimes though the drive for efficiency and cost savings can truly impact an individual's work load.
good,The most enjoyable part about the job was meeting and working with so many different groups of people. It taught me how to quickly plan to complete a task. And it also taught me a little bit more about leadership at work.
good,"I was impressed with the recycle/compost/trash bins..  They had a great cafeteria and small stores that sold decent food.  I did not like my supervisor and she did not like me.  She would scream at me at the top of her lungs when I asked her a question that she did not know the answer.   I went to management, and they were of little help dealing with an aggressive and short-tempered woman.  Otherwise, I loved the job."
good,"Awesome place to work, learning new things daily, great management engagement, lovely workplace culture with great autonomy with the work you do. This is a place to define your own destiny."
good,"The vacation time and benefits were amazing, but the rotating shifts from first to second and back again were brutal. If I had a family it would be very difficult. Recently they cut of transfers to other P&G locations and that was a big hit for me, as a recent college graduate who took a job as a Materials Technician. They want you to stay at that particular location and pay you 3 dollars an hour less than the top other Mixing centers in the Nation. They are pushing to be number 1, but aren't paying their associates for it. Pay is competitive, but could be better. I left because of the rotating shifts, poor management, and non transfers. I applied internally for jobs, but got walled by my manager. Good for resume, but bad for long term. Vacation time and sick days were really accommodating. Most people were great to work with."
good,"It is a typical working hours with shifting schedule. The management was very strictly to the product quality, enjoyed with this company because we we have many co worker in work area"
good,"My experience at Coty Inc. was short but very stressful.  Management only looks at the bottom line & there is no work life balance.  They do have great vacation perks - 7 free summer Fridays & the week between Christmas & New Year the office is closed."

good,"long hours and shifts - not much advancement  - skill blocks are limited in depts.  Career path ok but if you do not go into the maintenance area, you are limited.  Not many job changes do to cutting of staff and support roles.  Team concept ok but managment make the final decisions - just now ask for imput so we do not complain we were not involved."
good,"contente dans cette entreprise,mais pour des raisons de déménagement j'ai du quitter,les journées de travail ce passé bien"
good,P&G is a great company for training people how to be savvy business leaders and gives employees a huge spectrum of experiences.  P&G has struggled to deliver expectations of Wall Street in recent years which has turned the focus of the company on eliminating jobs to deliver the bottom line.  This has made advancement nearly impossible and has negatively impacted the culture.
good,I enjoyed working with others and learning about car parts and talking to different customers
good,Learning new skills and meeting a great group of people was a pro for this job.  Working the swing shift was hard on employee and family both.
good,"It is required to face different kind of problems, from technical to pure economical and administrative problems, be able to manage money, time, people and resources. The company invests a lot of time and money for all the employees, at every level."
good,"On a typical day at work we kept an efficient pace going to meet all the requirements that are needed.Throughout my work experience I have learned so many things with job training others, learning a team leader roll, taking responsibility with writing up data sheets for certain stocks. The management cast was a little bit shaky due to different team leads and managers either resigning or just up and leaving due to the lack of employees work but other then that everything else was great."
good,"Excelente empresa para trabajar, ya que se conocen diferentes procesos para la fabricación de los pañales y toallas sanitarias, uy vas conociendo cada etapa."

A parte mais agradável do trabalho era o relacionamento que fazíamos nos lugares que visitávamos. O mais difícil era percorrer longos trechos  para visitar 01 cliente. Aprendi muito como profissional  e dentre outras coisas."
good,"The work can be challenging especially since they have down sized teams to the bare bones minimum. Tons of mandatory overtime.  We take an innovative system like IWS and cherry pick parts then disregard the rest.  Half measures, smoke and mirrors. All to squeeze every penny out of costs.  We then spend small fortunes on tour preps for company big wigs to tour the plant.  Looks good on paper therefore it is good leadership mentality.  Decisions are often made by people who have no clue. Experienced techs are silenced in favor of the head nodders.  Top heavy with dayshift ""support"" that is seldom supportive.  Look at the parking lot on nights and weekends and that tells the story.  The back stabbing rumor mill culture, which is too often fueled by leadership is appalling. I wouldn't recommend a friend or family member work at P&G Mehoopany.  I have met Techs from other sights and their culture is completely different."
good,"Management should work closer to the Technical Team, lack of direction affects daily decisions and overall performance of employees."

I learned that depending on company and whose running it determines equipment, resources and concern of stressful work area. Management lacked the compassion of its workers so on e has to ""sink or swim"" on their own. this culture has shown me what now-a-day workplace operation is like. The hardest part of the job was lack of motivation of being there and lack of feeling like team player. It was more like humping and hustling on the mean streets where no one knows you. The clock is the main focal point. The most enjoyable part of the job was know that your shift was about to end. I guess I enjoy more person to person interaction and an       occasional laugh/smile."

good,"Great place to work! Great coworkers! Onsite work out center, meals fresh made in lunch room, excellent benefits and stock options! Wish I could get back there!"
good,"Need stronger leadership and disbanding the boys club.  Poor managers that are kept around for years, HR is useless, and harassment is acceptable.  Work life balance is a myth."
good,"I got the opportunity to work for P&G later in my life (over 30) but was the best decision I have ever made.  I achieved more than I ever thought possible; gained competencies and skillset that would not have been possible elsewhere.  Benefits, retirement plan is essential for retirement years.  I would not have the retirement account that I have today without P&G."
good,"Great paying job of course, but no job in stress free. They take great initiative in making great product but at the end of the day, you'll need an aspirin."
good,"No clear career path"
good,"The position of warehouse associate at Procter & Gamble was great. It was easy, fun, and my coworkers and managers were wonderful. I would definitely recommend working there!"
good,"I worked for P&G in Kansas City KS for about 7 years.  It was a pretty good job with advancement opportunities as long as you're a dedicated worker and are liked by the higher-ups.  Advancement is through a ""best candidate selection"" where they interview people who are interested in the position and select the best candidate.  I've seen some of the ""favorites"" picked over and over again for certain roles / jobs.  The schedule will pretty much suck the life out of you and take about 10 years off your life.  You will work rotating 12 hour shifts and every other weekend (it's 60 hours one week and then 24 hours the next week) - two weeks of day shifts (5am to 5pm), then two weeks of night shifts (5pm to 5am), with MANY forced overtime spots where you'll have to work a day shift in the middle of your night shift stretch or vise versa.  You'll feel like a zombie almost every day of your life.  I always felt groggy, moody, and tired.  I witnessed several people passing out while sitting in a chair just from sheer sleep deprivation.  You'll also have to work some of the weekends that you're supposed to have off due to people calling in ""sick"" or several people going out on disability for months at a time because of surgeries or ""injuries"".  The workers ""play games"" with the schedule and you'll end up getting forced to work your days off.  Trust me.  You're also expected to find and fix defects, logging them into a spreadsheet.  Management will ram it down your throat until you can't stand hearing the word ""defect"". "
good,"P&G was a great place to work.   It challenged you every day and I loved working on the ""High Tech"" equipment.  The pay was good also with unlimited OT"
good,The one problem i really had was they hired alot of us and did a first come first serve type of schedule to see who worked so id have to show up 3 hours early to get on the clock
good,"A typical day was filled with operational tasks and planning meetings. Working on auditing and compliance tasks took up considerable amounts of my day. While with P&G, I did get to volunteer for United Way giving campaigns."
good,Okay place to work. Learned management skills and teamwork.  The hardest part of job is the distribution of work.  The most enjoyable part is learning of others.
good,"The problem facing P&G is a slowing customer base in the US.  Due to this issue, upper management is moving large portions of the company to ""emerging"" markets such as China.  They don't have to pay as much in salary."
good,"thanks for the opportunity to work here. caotic and doesnt run smoothly at times, too many ""cooks"" in the kitchen telling others what to do and the lead doesnt know how to run breaks...... not always but at times the confusion is too much. KNOW what your doing and things will run smoothly."
good,"A P&G é uma excelente empresa para trabalhar, Porém quem estraga a empresa são as próprias pessoas que administram que seguem um má cultura antiquada que usam punho de ferro para tratar as pessoas."
good,The schedule was consistent. I worked for a contractor and he job advancement at the plant was good. After you reached your plateau the job became stagnant.
good,Trabalhei por um bom periodo e adquiri uma otima experiencia profissinal Sai para Entrar na Nestle
good,Very interesting converting line work where we were given engineering standards for a new product and we incorporated said systems into the converting process to create viable test pads for data accumulation
good,"I enjoyed my time at Procter and Gamble, it's just a shame that the hours were not guaranteed. If it was a stable place to work I probably would have still been there."
good,"P&G es una empresa enfocada en desarrollar líderes, proceso que comienza desde la etapa de practicante. Los objetivos son claros desde el inicio, la compañía aporta todas las herramientas y apoyo a los empleados para lograr los objetivos."
good,"I got the opportunity to work for P&G later in my life (over 30) but was the best decision I have ever made.  I achieved more than I ever thought possible; gained competencies and skillset that would not have been possible elsewhere.  Benefits, retirement plan is essential for retirement years.  I would not have the retirement account that I have today without P&G."
good,nice envoriment to work along with staff everyone helps a job that has a team will always win this company will help as much as you need to become very sussesful
good,"This is a top company who cares very much what the publics perception is of them. A great company to retire from however if you are lucky enough to experience the manufacturing sector of it's many businesses you really begin to see another side to the business altogether. A lot of behind the scene activities and relationships to compete for the much more desirable office jobs, which almost ALWAYS was predictably awarded to whoever had the best campaign manager pull for them. Hard work here without utilizing any other dirty tactic to gain advancement only served to assure you would get more of it...more hard work.  Never have I seen a company operated in this manner and I hope I never do again. Still....the manner in which the Augusta, ga plant was operated and the abusive environment that many of us endured is in no way the Procter and gamble that the corporate world is familiar with. I am firmly convinced that the unethical, mistreatment of those at this plant was never made known to the sources who would have really cared at the home office in Cinncinatti, Ohio."
good,"This was a good place to work and it was a typical day at work. Worked in manufacturing and overall it had good benefits, work life balance. I would say the culture was okay too."
good,"Overall, a great place.  Advancement can be difficult as they do not value mastery of subject matter in supply chain roles but push for breadth of assignments. Do not believe if hired as an A&T that moving to management will happen.  They continue to make it more and more difficult to move through that process. Once you reach the top pay for A&T, your raises will stop."
good,The work there was easy just the management wasn’t good they didn’t really know how to run the place right and there was at lot of young aged people running the place at the time
good,You have to always be careful and in proper protective attire at all times. You can work as many extra shifts as you want but be prepared for a loss of hours during holidays. If you are ever injured be prepared for them to try to persuade you to not seek medical treatment and expect to be fired after an injury if you seek workmens compensation.
good,Good atmosphere to work in. Steady pace and productive workers. Labor is divided evenly and fairly. Ample breaks and flexible on bathroom usage. Management could do better with voicing concerns before they become dramatic problems.
good,People looked out for themselves.  Promotions depended on the personal relationship with mgmt.  The company overall is a great company to work for.  Everything just depends on WHO you work for.
good,This job is as a apprentice ......but very knowledge full....and many types of machine......all person and employe are helpful and friendly or good enviroment....
good,"Company that involves useless meetings, useless conference calls, inefficient administrators, inefficient sales information and time wasted on reports and activities that do not add value.  People are underpaid versus industry standards. Lots of blah blah let's go team but a lot of useless layers of administration and management with accounts."
good,"Its through a temp service called Manpower , not the best , but has good people and the actual Procter and Gamble employees are very helpful, the job changes . one day I may be a machine operator , the next day I mean be stacking pallets or in packaging"
good,"The company promotes work, life, balance, but they don't always practice what they preach.  While they say they value their people, that's not always the case and that was the outcome of the survey of the employees.  They don't feel as valued, or felt that they were compensated accordingly.  Also, they don't usually promote within.  Within P&G, you have to be willing to relocate if you want to get promoted, so if you're not willing to move, chances are, they'll bring in someone else from outside to be your next boss, instead of promoting you who's qualified to take on the leadership role.  Due to this reason, P&G loses many qualified employees."
good,I would like to say they want need to improve salary and handover to Good agency thank you for the oppartunities for this company Thanks to who all are supported me .
good,Não tenho nada a reclamar eles cumpriram tudo o que foi dito para nós cumpriu com o seus compromissos da melhor maneira possível

good,Temel pazarlama kurallarını öğrenmek için harika bir çalışma ortamı
good,"Procter and Gamble is a large company who prides itself on taking care of it's employees. In the smaller sub-set of organizations within P&G it is sometimes difficult to do so. At the Brantford CDC there is a good team environment, but no room for advancement unless you move to Toronto or the US. The work is nice, and I like working in the QA environment it creates a lot of opportunities to learn in dffierent areas."

good,Very productive to have the work load to supply employees other than that you will not have no work to do. name of our main goal of workers work together to make sure production line is moving that part of your ship on time.
good,Just be prepared to learn a lot and never rest. training is very thorough. very good benefits and good people to work with. very stressful job and very physical.
good,"No space for promotion or new tasks"
good,Processed approved requisitions in SAP systems for 8 plants. Prior to working we received  2 weeks training which included company policies. Positive culture open and honest. Hardest part of the job was working weekends on special projects. Most enjoyable part of the job was working on the most advanced SAP system I've ever been exposed to. Will explain more in interview upon request.
good,"Responsible for technical support on the service and equipment side of the cleaning products and programs, for various type of customers such as, national and regional food service, quick and full service restaurants, hotels, and retail stores."
good,"Decent place to work, staff makes the job better and senior staff doesn't care of you know what your doing would rather you mess up to get laid off which wasn't an issue for me with working for a temp agency."

good,"Good typical dat at work, learnt a lot, management was good, good culture as well, hardest dealing with few poor managers and most enjoyable developing people"
good,"The particular location I worked in had a very complex and physical work environment. The hours rotated three shifts switching every week. Because of demand there was always overtime which consisted of an additional four hours to the normal eight hour shift. It was a union plant which had it's benefits. Rewards and recognition were frequent and spread evenly. Some management was biased which made for an unhealthy culture. The hardest part of the job was the working hours, it made family life hard. The most enjoyable part of the job was how fast paced it could be and the feeling of accomplishment at the end of the day when production was met safely and with perfect quality."
good,I enjoyed the work environment but management staff were very impatient with me and other younger members of staff that were also students. The pay was good and there was lots of opportunity for overtime.
good,"As a contracted laboratory assistant, I was able to get a good view of the culture of P&G and the laboratory environment. As in any contracted position,  know what you want to get out of the experience or you might find yourself there longer than you expected."
good,"the most interested thing is how the management was organizing works. it allows us to rotate to the task assign, that gives me the opportunity to learn how to operate different production machine."

good,"La empresa es buena, sin embargo los centros comerciales complican el trabajo y puede haber cierto tipo de explotación. "
good,"P&G is a nice place to work but just like any other company, there are downfalls as well.  Their overall compensation package has been declining over the years but the profit sharing is nice.  They are very committed to their engineers and engineer hiring but could show equality improvement for others that don't have an engineering degree.  Cases out the door is their focus and other things seem to be subpar compared to that.  Favoritism is very visible and there seems to be a struggle with supporting growth within the plant I am positioned in.  I can not speak toward all P&G plants, I've only worked in 2 of the many they have."

I would not have the retirement account that I have today without P&G."
good,"A great place to start your career as you will develop on the job training that is world class among global organizations.  Still a very good company, though I would no longer call great on account of the current leadership who is no longer visionary, but reactionary.  This brings a lot of short-term focus at the sacrifice of long-term, with the many repercussions including overwork (50-60hrs/week is now the norm), lack of dedication to career growth (at the early levels, this is fine but at the mid-higher levels lateral transfers are harder and harder to find), emphasis on politics and individual rewards rather than business growth (as people have become scared for their careers), and a lot of wasted effort (focusing on internal maneuvering rather than value add).  The company certainly needs to change and will do so, but as can be expected for one of its size and legacy it will be a slow moving process.  I can't discourage anyone from P&G, but certainly go in with the right expectations both for the company and your career development."

good,"Really not hard work regular line work in a factory "

good,I spent 28+ years at Procter & Gamble Co and GBS.  I retired from there and I would recommend this company to someone who wants to be challenged in their career.
good,Its a good job its not hot in factory or its not hard work i loved the job. It has two 30min paid breaks and its a nice and quiet work environment and the people are very friendly and polite that work there
good,"This is a great place for security; well at least until you get that one boss that just makes you miserable.  The last year I worked there was longer than the previous 16!  I saw some really talented people leave the company because their boss just didn't like them.  It's a shame that a poor performing manager can run off a high-performing sub-ordinate but there's no protection at all in the company from this happening.  Looking back, P&G forced several long-time employees out at the same time.  I think they did that to avoid having to give out packages.  But I learned so much; if you want to take on other responsibilities, most managers will let you.  I had some of the best bosses; but unfortunately, also the worst ever!"

good,"Overall working at P&G was great. If you did what you supposed to do you were fine. There were only 2 shifts at P&G, either you working 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. or 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. ."
good,"Management is kinda clueless most of the time."
good,The typical day was hard work yet enjoyable. Working together with a joint efforts from coworker made the work environment run smoothly. The work day could be long at times it made things difficult for planning outside of work.
good,"bien rémunérée en tant que jeune diplomée."
good,"Sales account coordinator, fragrances  "
good,"It was a good place to work.  You learned how to make paper towel and tissue.  Worked 12 hour days with lunches and breaks.  Working holidays were hard.  The culture was ever changing and the moral was low at times.  Management changed almost every year but the production was high at times.  The hardest part of the job was you really couldn't trust the people you were working with and that wasn't so good.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the Holiday dinners that they gave you during the holidays, but some of us still worked the holidays."
good,"Clock in, team meeting. Then report to supervisor for daily objectives. inspect equipment an go right to work. lunch was 45 minutes. Inspect equipment before leaving."

good,Work place was nice the people were very helpful when it comes to the job its pretty easy. You count the product stack and go on with your day. A very simple job.
good,"Responsible for of telecommunication equipment (PABX and lines)"
good,I believe P&G will struggle as it tries to reinvent itself. Until it does I believe all roles are open to being outsourced and all business units are open to divestiture.
good,"I  am only applied for a forklift operator position and I had to work a different position first  ,but a nice place to work  and  I work for a temporary situation"
good,"staff are kind and friendly, fair and flexible shift patterns. generous beak times, decent hourly pay rate, overtime always available. A good temporary place to work."
good,"was an interesting time, they need more people. the people were not that nice in the warehouse. looked mad all the time and did not care about the people who worked in the lab doing all of the lab testing. were all a team, and they need to start implementing that."

I would not have the retirement account that I have today without P&G."
good,I learnt working in a fast paced working environment in a multicultural environment. Working for P&G in London was the most enjoyable part of my life.
good,Strong Company that promotes from within. Learned a lot. Excellent benefits. Only draw back was when with the company at the site the quality director was a little over the top.
good,"A typical day was long and dreadful. i didn't learn very much working here. management was almost never involved and when they were they almost never helped. For the most part the job was very relaxed just exhausting from the shift change, most of us walked around like zombies. hardest part was the constant change from nights to days and days to nights."
good,Rotating shifts of 12.5 hours and switching from nights to days is extremely hard and tiresome. I worked through adecco which they treat poorly and do not care about the line they draw between the workers.
good,It was an ok workplace just needed more money and stability . I just wish the top out pay was more I have a family to provide for. The Pros are it has 401k and Dental Insurance.
good,"P&G was a good company to work for. They were very willing to promote from within and actually encouraged advancement. However, whoever thought up the weekly rotation program was a masochist. It was no wonder that every time they tried to force the management to rotate, instead of the technicians, it failed terribly."
good,Well kept up facility' workers we very thoughtful and freely helped you if you needed help my first day people should me what to do and what not to do just to keep everyone happy
good,"Overall, it is a great place to learn marketing as there are lots of best case scenarios and case studies. The culture depends on the brands and the leadership within each team."
good,"Dokud nepřevzala distribuční firma vedení nad ČR, tak to bylo výborné"
good,"Great company to work for, really interesting and talented people, quickly assigned with interesting projects. Really good atmosphere. Lack of organisation in general."
good,The manager was cool and would work with you. I cant say the same for the a supervisor. The team lead or (manager) was down to earth and not caught up in the politics of the business.
good,"Na P&G era um ambiente muito bacana para se trabalhar. Sempre gostei da minha profissão. Aprendi diversar atividades que será uma bagagem muito grande para o meu currículo."
good,"Working at P&G was very different to working in an oil company. "
good,I knew lots of people who had worked there and it seemed like decent money. The only downfall to the nice cheques were the long hours and continental shifts. The constant changing of shifts created a little time in between to maintain any normal social or much of a personal life. The people at this job become your social and personal life. The job itself was easy and almost mind numbing but at the same time rather relaxing and it was quite a fun atmosphere to work in.
good,Before P&G switched to 3rd party merchandisers I very much enjoyed working for them.  They showed appreciation during christmas with gifts to staff.  My supervisor was amazing and always there.  This is the company I grew and learned the most from early on in my field.

Toda a atenção está voltada para a produção. Estudantes não recebem oportunidade caso estejam em cursos que os direcione para uma futura vaga de gerência. Para esses casos eles preferem pessoal com vivência internacional, inglês fluente e universidades como Politécnica (USP), FEI, Mauá, Mackenzie ou Universidades Federais, ou seja, se você é um estudante e não foi bancado pelos pais até o ensino superior todos os seus esforços foram em vão."

I learned a lot about the way they market their product, and the many stages they must go through to introduce new products/technologies. My co-workers were very kind and easy to work with.

good,P&G was a really good place to work and the only negative I can say is at times they were more concerned about being politically correct than putting the right people in the correct position  I enjoyed my time there and the compensation was excellent as well as the benefits  I retired from with P&G and I am now noticing the health benefits are steadily going down  one would think a company of this size could help the people who spend so much time making them consistently profitable

good,"I should not have left when I did. It was too early. I was there 8 years and got to a point of where the red tape was strangling me, in hindsight I should have just steered my way through it  as I had in the past, though I felt tired and stale.

good,"If you make it here, you'll make it anywhere..Great benefits,  safety is first, good salary but they make you learn as much as possible, I say learn cause the it's hard to find someone to actually want to teach you, and then they have you doing multiple roles/task at the same time but the wages aren't at par to all this work.  Favoritism amongst peers is big here so it's difficult to progress professionally"

good,"To work in a team"
good,"Good pay, but you have to review yourself several times a year, need to fulfill standards testing routinely, and the company does not really promote from within, as most managers(99%) are hired from right out of college, or elsewhere.  Very few regular roles allow for advancement to management.  Very competitive environment, and you better be good at playing the game of selling yourself."
good,".É uma boa empresa, porém, com poucas chances de efetivação."
good,"Hi, "
good,"P&G plant life is definitely tougher than the corporate P&G in Cincinnati. More training is also provided in Cincinnati, less for other locations.

I typically work from 6 AM to 4:30 PM at the plant."

The hardest part of this job was the amount of stress that was put on our bodies, but overall it taught me hard work and dedication get the job done quick and right."
good,Decent place to work if your co workers like you. Pay is ok. Hours are good once you get used to them. Lower and middle management is good. Upper management is horrible.
good,Was good company but redundancy has take  us to minimum staff. Long hours but always enjoyed time at work and teams were were all easy to get along with
good,"Good company to work for if you value stable, long term employment with very good benefits. Even if the site you work for at P&G closes, they will give you the opportunity to relocate to another facility."

good,"The plant runs seven days and twenty four hours.  It is a fast paced production environment. Often from the moment after shift turnover and calibrations completed the work flow would commence immediately and steadily until the end of the shift. Because of this, time seemed to pass quickly because there is always something to do. Managing shifting priorities and multiple tasks and responsibilities became second nature."
good,"Procter and Gamble was a great place to work, develop new skill sets, and build great relationships. The day to day activities vary on role and phase in project.  A typical week consists of 40% meetings (e.g. multifunctional teams check in to make sure project is on track), 50% job execution (e.g. lab testing, consumer research), and 10%training (e.g. forklift training).  I learned how to listen to consumers and develop solutions to improve their lives.  I've had both good and bad managers.  In certain cases, people are really good technically but struggle when promoted and required to manage other people.  The most challenging part of the working at P&G is working on projects and moving on to new projects before completion.

good,"On my first day of living in Saudi Arabia,i am not feel homesick because there is a lot of Filipinos who also working and also the other nation are also truly friendly so adjusting my daily life there is so easy.In the Company wherein i work is also okay because you need to be trained before doing your job eventually you already know this position because Safety and Assurance of the Product are the main subject of my Employer,"
good,"Proud to have worked for such a wonderful company!"
good,"I got the opportunity to work for P&G later in my life (over 30) but was the best decision I have ever made.

I would not have the retirement account that I have today without P&G."
good,I had to make sure that all the product was correct and built the way Procter & Gamble wanted. I learned want to look for as in bad product. The hardest part was working nights and not spending time with my 3 year old.

good,"vey good working culture,I  love  my workplace, every body get together to complete the job etc"
good,"Ich arbeite gerne dort und wäre auch gerne dort geblieben aber durch das neue Gesetz mit der 1800 Stunden Regelung muss ich das Werk Ende 2014 verlassen und kann dann schon wieder von vorne anfangen.Zwei Jahre arbeit umsonst.Diese Einführung kommt übrigens aus den Vereinigten Staaten aus Cincinatti und wird Global eingeführt.Das schwierigste an diesem Job war das Schichtsystem mit einer 7 Tage Woche,dann kam man aus der Nachtschicht hatte 1,5 Tage in dem Sinne frei und dann ging es weiter.Die Kollegen waren super und die Bezahlung war auch gut."

good,"Coordenação de Equipe, atividades desenvolvidas como: Liderança de equipe , e criação de campanhas de melhoria da visibilidade da marca e empresa. Direção da empresa democrática. O mais difícil era localidade da empresa Cotia -SP. Oportunidade de aprendizado muito grande."

Permette ad ogni lavoratore di apprendere nuove conoscenze, la collaborazione tra i dipendenti ha un ruolo fondamentale nel buon andamento della ricerca. Le direttive aziendali sono un pò rigide, ma ti permettono di crescere culturalmente e partecipare attivamente al business plan."
good,A Manufacturing plant with online and offline roles
good,Normalmente os dias de trabalho eram trânquilos.
good,P&G is all about continued learning. The jobs can be very challenging and often interfere with work life balance. There is a team atmosphere that allows you to form strong relationships.
good,"uma empresa que zela pelo patrimônio, porém fica a desejar na parte de reconhecer os funcionários em remuneração"
good,Generally interesting work and challenges and opportunities to expand your capabilities. Managers and co-worker are all of the best at what they do.
good,"P&G is a consumer packaged goods company. Although they have other functions, at the end of the day P&G is about marketing and selling consumer packaged goods. Therefore, if you are in another function (particularly IT), you will not get the exposure/recognition you would at a company that's more focused on that particular industry."
good,I have a mixed review about working for P&G.
good,"Working at Buckeye (formerly Procter & Gamble) taught me lots of discipline, structure, safety awareness and teamwork. The people who worked here were the reason we all loved coming to work, which is the part I enjoyed the most along with customer service duties that I performed with clients all over the world on a daily basis.. The hardest part of the job to me was a time the computers were upgraded but after very thorough training it improved so much. Also a few times when I was asked to take inventory on the weekends, which was out of the norm for my job duties and very hard for me to get a babysitter on the weekends or times required to travel when my child was small."
good,P&G was a great experience. I was able to explore many areas and learn a great deal of information.
good,"The perception is different from the reality. It is a good place to work, but they pride themselves more on the name of the company than they do offering a fair and competitive compensation & benefits to their employees."
good,The company had great benefits for part time employees immediately after hiring and after a year of employment. We were able to accrue holiday and vacation pay from the first day on the job. We were offered insurance after a year on the job. There was a raise every year for the employees.
good,They have excellent benefits and pay for this area. Unfortunately dont ever get hurt there as that will end your job as soon as they can.
good,i work from all this company to learn and to have experience and most of all to earn money
good,"Those in upper management positions often have zero idea how to apply what they are expecting their workers to actually do. Causes lines to suffer and get behind trying to do as they are told, but it's a damned if you do damned if you don't situation."
good,"Good place to work for goal driven person. If  you are a person that can work to meet target, then it is a place for you. You have to learn team work as a Procter and gamble employee because every role is very key in operational process."
good,"You need to be ready to relocate to several places and out in alot of hours but a great great company, very solid training and management standards, Lots of good leaders"
good,"The job itself is fairly simple and straight forward. However the politics of the company are difficult to navigate. You are entirely responsible for your own advancement, and no one will help you. Being late due to weather or car problems will cause you to lose your job."
good,"I got the opportunity to work for P&G later in my life (over 30) but was the best decision I have ever made.  I achieved more than I ever thought possible; gained competencies and skillset that would not have been possible elsewhere.  Benefits, retirement plan is essential for retirement years.  I would not have the retirement account that I have today without P&G."
good,You work 6 days out the week sometimes u might work 5 days a week  overtime is always available but the benefit is great could use some more time on break
good,Great place to develop variety of skills.  You are considered an owner of the business and empowered to solve your own problems.  With such a large company you can try many different roles as if getting a new job every 3 years keeping you fresh
good,Cambiando alcuni dirigenti del reparto sarebbe un ottimo ambiete di lavoro.
good,It is a good place to work with great benefits. The people on the line are just like coworkers everywhere. The work is decent. I really have no complaints outside of the crazy schedule.
good,Good place to work with great training and progression. Steep learning curve at start but supportive structure to guide you as you progress. Very well perceived externally.
good,Great job work shifts were just to long structure was kinda everywhere. I drove a fork lift and pulled product for the line. I also worked on the lines on days forklifts were unavailable.
good,Bonnes opportunités de développement dans un environnement propice et une culture d entreprise forte
good,Site is closing and everyone is losing their jobs. A great place to work until the decision was made to move production to the United States. Very unfortunate!
good,"If you don't mind the politics of working for a huge corporation it's an awesome job, I started at 15 an hour and left at 32 so a lot of scheduled raises plus many opportunities for advancement"
good,All in all it was great working for them for the time I was there and I had a great experience and met a lot of good people that really thought me a lot of different skills.
good,"En lo personal, colaborar para P&G, es una forma de aprender estrategias de comercialización y aplicar la experiencia adquirida en esta área,"
good,Interested in accuracy over quantity. Working with products for consumer use if materials were not dispensed in proper amounts could result in injuries.
good,"Stable Place to work.Limited knowledge in supervision, Construction division has a working knowledge of processes and what it takes to operate engineering needs to study environment and climates"
good,"R&D jobs are relatively low stress and offer good flexibility. Organizational structure can often lead to new hires having several ""managers"" that can affect work plan and performance management."
good,I loved working at P&G. The long work hours and constant change in schedule was something I couldn’t deal with. I would work there longer if it wasn’t for the 12 hour days.
good,"I got the opportunity to work for P&G later in my life (over 30) but was the best decision I have ever made.

good,"trabajo de produccion"
good,Buen  ambiente flexibilidad de permisos buenos pagos a tiempo
good,Procter and Gamble is a great place to work. I have nothing negative to say about the company. It's the leadership that changed and stopped respecting the teams who run the day to day operations.
good,"I was a part-time employee You are generally limited to 1020 hors of work per year  while working 5 days per week  and 4 hours per day with some flexibility on the exact hours."
good,i havent worked for this company in over 20 years and they where an opportunity thru a recruiting agency... the experience was very nice and if i had the chance i would go back
good,"Have worked in numerous locations and departments at P&G on a contractual basis.  Each area is different with a different culture for the departments.  However, all departments were really good to work in but the last department was by far the best experience.  Management Great! Workplace culture pretty good. You go in and get the job done and ask questions if you need assistance.  Managers trust that the work will be done, no looking over your shoulder.  No micro managing. Treated with respect. Overall a great place to work."
good,"Blessed to have a job. I have coworkers that complain about management and the shifts, however, I am blessed in that I love my job and it outweighs the bad that I have experienced."
good,I personally learned a lot working there it was hard at times but I got through and I recommend this job to anyone that likes to be on the move  Or stay busy
good,great place to work I hate that it closed in augusta  going to work was a good feeling everybody was friendly. The hardest part standing up on night shift.

good,"A great company to will make sure you are engaged.  Lets you learn how to succeed, by giving you the responsibility and opportunities.  I would recommend P&G."
good,Great company to learn and grow with.  Collaborative company culture with a great team environment.  Competitive environment but no back stabbing or below the belt issues.
good,"I liked to work with proctor and Gamble but I was on payroll of Distributor so that I left from there, otherwise Proctor and Gamble is one of the most favourite Place where I learn Sales and Distribution Skills"
good,"Good Company decent benefits, Work Life Balance is Great, Management looks out for favorites, Not used to Experienced Hires. Doesn't like to pay overtime for non exempt employees."
good,Bueb trabajo cualqier tipo de tiempo extraordinario lo pagan muy buena empresa y muy buena escuela para los que van a empezar en la industria farmaceutica
good,"A typical day would start at 0630 meeting with the off going shift and the oncoming shift to discuss issues the last 24hours, develop countermeasures and plan for the next 24 hours."
good,"I enjoyed my time with Proctor and Gamble. It was a great starter company that lead me into big Pharma, GSK. P&G focus was on people and making sure there was work/life balance. Diversity was the main focus with Proctor and Gamble. Mixed culture was big with this consumer company. Best time was the great  teamwork and diversity groups within the company."
good,"I got the opportunity to work for P&G later in my life (over 30) but was the best decision I have ever made.  I achieved more than I ever thought possible; gained competencies and skillset that would not have been possible elsewhere.  Benefits, retirement plan is essential for retirement years.  I would not have the retirement account that I have today without P&G."
good,My time working at the Art of Shaving (Proctor & Gamble) was great. The only sad thing was the company location went out of business and there are only two locations in the state. I learned a lot in a short amount of time.

good,"Very busy company that has much job security.  Everyone is able to keep busy, even during slower times there are things you can do to be productive and beneficial for the company"
good,"Empresa excelente para trabalhar, todos prestativos."
good,I worked with many of there companies but was never satisfied with the organizational abilities. It’s was always all over. There were times where you would go in and the supervisor would come in with a hangover and disappear. Therefore you would have to take over.
good,"Overall, P&G offers a traditional learning environment,  making it a great place to work. The plant that I worked at offered training courses to further skill set and understanding of equipment."
good,muy buen empleo para crecer y hacer carrera. en mi situación personal me tope con una muy mala jefa encargada.. de pelicula de terror. Pero estoy seguro de que ha de ser un caso en un millón.
good,I am a contractor to Procter and Gamble and the work was fun and exciting.  I am given the ability to design freely to meet expected needs while meeting with the engineering team to finalize and approve designs.  I have reached a point where I feel I need more responsibility and they do not direct hire my position.
good,"P&G bietet flexible Arbeitszeiten, die super mit der Familie und dem Privatleben zu vereinbaren sind."
good,"It was challenging, though exciting. The learning opportunities were endless. Great people, very diverse. Management did not always listen to feedback."

I would not have the retirement account that I have today without P&G."
good,"I was considered part-time/call-in but in my case I worked for four people one of which I reported to. I filled in for the Purchaser, Invoice Approval, Shipping & Receptionist and was allowed to work 1500 hours/year. I could earn vacation & sick time according to how many hours I worked. I was given the opportunity to participate in all P&G activities and I was able to teach my co-workers a few things on the computers and believe it or not they bragged to other employees about what I could do...they were great people with lots of love. If I could have gotten a fulltime job I would have stayed forever."
good,"They give you the chance to develop strong leadership skills and develop on the job experience. They hire the talent and a specific profile, rather than a person for the specific role."
good,"Un día normal era llegar y checar lo que dejaban y continuabas con la misma tarea"
good,Decent place to work provided you have  good internal drive and are willing to make choices around work life balance. In order to progress you do need the capability to manage expectations.

good,Must be competitive and work at a level above your current level in order to move ahead. Do not expect to remain in the same job for more than a couple of years. It is expected that you obtain experience in as many areas of the company as you can. High level of diversity. Reorganization is common.

good,"•	Excellent communication and negotiation skills at a very high level"
good,"Over the course of years, especially in the past ten years, P&G has turned into a slow and lumbering giant. I agree with Train’s Nelson Peltz in that the management is just talking to itself, and go to add that the current P&G management is far more concerned with staying at the job rather than helping the company get ahead. I think P&G should be broken into its parts and much of its management replace to focus on ROIC."
good,Clear systems and structure in place with a clear and detailed expectation of what is required from you anf your position. Clear annual goals and targets to be met.
good,"Empresa bem estruturada, multinacional de grande porte, dinâmica."
good,"The benefits are decent. Flexible hours for day time workers and a pretty decent time off policy. Pay isn't dependent on contribution or merit, everyone in every level gets the same pay. Path to advancement can be difficult to understand."
good,company pulled all merchandiser work.tried working for broker but did not like working for the broker they sent the work to.Thsi job is not availabel with P&G .
good,"Trabalho duro com bastante responsabilidade e stress mental, porém muito satisfatório."
good,"P & G has many benefits and is a great place to start your career at. If you are willing to relocate you can advance up the company ladder. The problem has been that many managers come in from other areas and take a long time to adjust."

good,"Awesome colleagues, amazing and fun work place, challenging work environment."
good,"I loved working with numbers, and increasing the on-time payments for the Duty Free clients.  Another aspect that I enjoyed was managing office events (internal and external), and partnering with persons to accomplish goals, translating documents, and utilizing my language capabilities (Spanish, French and Portuguese) to assist our clients was a pleasure. "
good,"In Procter and Gamble, the result you achieve counts a lot as you are given the chance to plan your work according to what you feel fits you. playing table tennis in the afternoon is always fun and help to take work stress off."

good,"una delle mielgiori aziende per emplloyee care, ottimo equilibrio tra flessibilità e raggiungimento obiettivi."
good,"The management are helpful and try to help you in anyway they can do, they care about their employees. The only cons are that it is minimum wage in the factory."
good,I enjoy the learning aspects of the company.  They are willing to teach you if you are willing to learn.  They have a lot of extra benefits for their employees
good,"The 12 hour continental shifts throughout the days eventually got too strenuous and I couldn't focus. The breaks were okay but it took half of the time given on breaks, just to get to the break room. Sometimes the security at the gate to the parking lot and smoking section would not be there to let us back in, making us late after breaks getting back to our line."
good,Great environment to grow and excel in. Good learning environment to learn about the equipment. Great coworkers to help and learn with. the fun part of the job was driving the forklifts.
good,"Very large company with a lot of growth and travel potential. International scope of work, ranging from R&D to product launch, distribution and marketing."
good,"Firma bardzo dobra z bogatym pakietem socjalnym. Troszkę zbyt duże rotacje, kadry przez ten fakt nie były odpowiednio przygotowane. System kwalifikacji tak szeroko rozbudowany dla techników czy kadry że stał się nieadekwatny(martwy). Pracownicy nie znali procesów działali na wyczucie i ostrożnie co powodowało że procesy często nie przebiegały sprawnie lub wymagały dużo więcej zaangażowania osób i czasu. W Łodzi znacznie bardziej procesy dostosowane do możliwości i kwalifikacji pracowników."
good,Great place to have spent 22+ years.  Only drawback is that tenured employees who try to work their way up the ranks are overlooked by the hiring of interns/new hires straight out of college at Management level who have no working knowledge of the company or how to manage others.
good,Very stable company to work for with tons of inspirational leaders. A bit antiquated and hard to ignite change from old practices. Location is often a challenge to recruit and sustain top talent.
good,P&G MFG is a challenging place to work as there is always a new product that needs to be designed.  The documentation foundation is minimum and this causes the company to rely on the employees.  All in all it is a great work experience and a good place to work.
good,"Un dia normal de trabajo cumplir y esforzarme por mas de lo solicitado."

good,"Aprender a manejar máquinas y trabajar en linas de marcas importantes "
good,The people of P&G are amazing. The recruiting and testing process is very rigorous and I believe it always has been.  So you have the opportunity to work with the most amazing people.  People are able to make significant contributions at every level.  Most employees are very driven to succeed so the work environment can be both challenging and inspiring. Overall P&G is a great place to work!
good,"A typical work day would be me signing into my forklift so I can begin picking orders. I learned how to manage my sleep with working 12hr shifts 7 days a week. Management was not strict enough. Co workers, they were pretty cool. The hardest part is the process of learning how to adapt to working that long everyday."
good,"When you come to in you never know what you will be able to work on in the day. Priorities are ever changing, which is a bit frustrating. Management is not very visible and there is always talk but hardly seen actions. Something that is 'hot' takes president over everything even when that 'hot' item is not so important the next day. No one wants to take responsibility for anything and if they don't have to do it then it will not be done."
good,"I got the opportunity to work for P&G later in my life (over 30) but was the best decision I have ever made.  I achieved more than I ever thought possible; gained competencies and skillset that would not have been possible elsewhere.  Benefits, retirement plan is essential for retirement years.  I would not have the retirement account that I have today without P&G."
good,I enjoyed working here as the people are nice. I was very busy everyday working on various projects. there was always an opportunity to better yourself. new ideas were encouraged
good,Probably the best training I had ever gotten for a position.  The atmosphere was great and the people we exceptionally good at what they did since they developed the programs themselves and proved that they worked.
good,"É ma das melhores empresas que trabalhei, sempre buscando novas tecnologias para manter sua qualidade no produto final assim dando satisfação ao consumidor final."
good,A typical work day for me is just being humble and coming in focus on the job at hand and learning not to bring your outside stress to your work place and working hand in hand with management and your co workers so that the quality of whatever product comes out with team work and professionalizsm but the hardest part of my job is standing on my feet for nearly 9hrs a day but with faith and determination for a better life I work it through but the most brightest part of my day is seeing that finish product from team work and that it was a safe free day and that a work smile doesn't harm anyone
good,"P&G was an easy place to work at. I got full time hours and was off on the weekends. I liked getting paid every week as well. Since you had to work in a team and the work was so easy, some of the employees would tend to slack off and nothing would happen, which was frustrating when you are trying to meet a certain deadline. I enjoyed working there and would absolutely work there again."
good,"- Large company able to provide tremendous training, and competitive compensation. "
good,"ambiente agradable, buenos servicios de comedor, vestimenta y protección personal, excelente obra social,  mal compañerismo"
good,the rotating schedule is a little rough to get use to but the pay and benefits are great if you don't mind not seeing your family
good,muy buen lugar de trabajo contrato por 3 meses sin efectivacion

good,"cada día se trabaja para alcanzar los resultados siendo muy flexibles a la demanda de trabajo realizando lo que solo agrega valor al producto,teniendo una colaboración de 100%de trabajo en equipo teniendo diariamente retos para salir adelante."
good,"- Dias sempre corridos"
good,"La empresa da muchos beneficios, pero el ambiente de trabajo es demasiado cometitivo. No tienes colegas, tienes competencia."
good,"P&G has a good culture and good long term benefits. Honestly, whether or not it's a good choice for you is dependent on what you're looking for and what you're entering in as. If you're going into R&D and you're ambitious, you have to be an Engineer to get any clout. B.Eng vs. B.S. degrees are treated VERY differently within R&D (even if they're recruited for similar roles). If you're a Scientist and you like lab support work and don't mind making a decent wage forever, P&G is comfortable."
good,Great Co-workers.  12 hour rotating shifts can be hard after awhile.  Change in progression model has created a negative environment that used to not exist.
good,"I got the opportunity to work for P&G later in my life (over 30) but was the best decision I have ever made.  I achieved more than I ever thought possible; gained competencies and skillset that would not have been possible elsewhere.  Benefits, retirement plan is essential for retirement years.  I would not have the retirement account that I have today without P&G."
good,"Very respectable brands, great place to grow and learn however being that P&G is such a huge corporation, not all careers will be prioritized."

good,"For most employees its all about production, meeting your numbers or quota for the day in whatever task you were assigned. Management is tough but fair. There is no cap on what you can learn, if you are willing to work they are willing to teach it. The hardest part o the job is the 12 hour shifts, i didn't like that."
good,"P&G is a great employer especially for young graduates. Very quickly one is given responsibilities and can have a project to own directly. People and culture is excellent : they push on trust, respect, diversity and inclusion. Despite the execution of it is far from perfect, they are above any other company I know. "

good,"A P&G é uma empresa com uma ótima cultura empresarial, com um reconhecimento e respeito pelos funcionários das diferentes áreas de atuação."
good,"I got the opportunity to work for P&G later in my life (over 30) but was the best decision I have ever made.

good,"Empresa proporcionava treinamento especifico para alguns funcionário visando atender a necessidade do negocio. O sistema empregado pela empresa proporciona para o funcionário ferramentas de conhecimento e crescimento profissional. O ambiente de trabalho agradável, parte mais difícil do trabalho era adaptar as cobranças do dia a dia com os resultados a serem entregues. A parte desagradável era o crescimento profissional que possui uma curva salário que depente da entrega de resultados que são avaliados por lideres/gerentes que não consegue corresponder as necessidades dos liderados em termos de motivação."
good,"This Job Location was a great job location. The only issues I had with this location was that the supervisors were not too organized when it comes to lack of work shifts or not handling or dealing with some employees that do not follow rules such as coming back from their breaks on time or not working as much, having others to do their work as they stand around. I was very disappointed in a way on how they handled things but the job tasks were no issue depending on who you work with whether they are working with you as a team player. Other than that, this job I would recommend that's if the supervisors are organized and handling issues and concerns."
good,Good assignment & exposure to People Management. High respect for individuals & creativity. Most enjoyable part is the daily interaction with people from all walks of life.
good,"Es una empresa donde desde el primer día te dan responsabilidades, se aprende muchísimo aunque quizás no de una manera formal, con una organización muy horizontal donde hay un claro respeto por todas las personas, donde el desarrollo de la gente es realmente valorado y donde los resultados de negocio no se logran de cualquier forma o a cualquier precio."

good,"Visitar los clientes en los  puntos de venta,  y solucionar los requerimientos del portafolio de la empresa.Pude aprender  mucho mas sobre mercadeo  y el apoyo  por parte  de mis superiores siempre fue  oportuno; y el ambiente laboral era  bueno  lo más difícil fue el tener que hacer  esfuerzo físico  desmedido  en ocasiones y lo que más me gusto  fue la experiencia que adquirí  y la  posibilidad de ascender  en la compañía."

good,"unload trucks, and bring raw materials to production lines. inventory raw material. "
good,working at P&g was pretty laid back as long as you did your job. The hardest part of work was the walk to the work site.

good,"I worked there many years.  It was a comfortable place to work.  There was some flexibility in work hours that was helpful.  Most of the people there are very capable and good to work with.  But lIke a lot of large companies, sometimes can get a little political and burdened with processes that are made for global application (so too complicated)."
good,"My review for this is not available at this time.  It was a temporary position and everyone that worked at the facility started in that position.   There was no talk of ever bringing anyone new on board as a full time perm, and that is why I ended up leaving."

I would not have the retirement account that I have today without P&G."
good,"The company is good on paper, but your career is dependent on your manager.  If you have a great manager, good for you; a bad one and you can end up out on the street. I had a lazy one and he took credit for everyone else's work.  Got kudos for him but nothing for his employees."

I would not have the retirement account that I have today without P&G."
good,"It wasnt the worst place to work for, constantly being followed by supervisors and being called into the office for talks about things you may be doing wrong or taking 1 extra minute for your break. Constantly stressing if you were going to have a job when you walked in there the next day."
good,"Great Job Culture, a good place to start your career but after a long time I wanted something more challenging. Great experiences in store and head office."
good,O dia na P&G é bastante corrido e trabalhamos sobre pressão onde a temos que nos adaptar as diversas mudanças de produção e planejamento. Todavia possui uma gestao de trabalho clara e objetiva onde todos estão integrados e com o objetivo mutuo de entrega de resultado para a companhia e crescimento.
good,"Everyday you will be challenged to do your best to come up with a good production result."
good,Great company to start your career but it has changed recently in terms of bringing outside people vs. promote from within. it's hurting the strong and great culture.
good,"I worked for the Prestige Division of Procter and Gamble. Brand responsibilities included Gucci, Dolce and Gabbana, Lacoste, and Hugo Boss."
good,"I loved my time at PnG, the people I worked with were great and the work was rewarding. My only fault with the company is the management, which I believe changed once I was no longer employed there. I believe PnG to be a great company to work for and where hardworking people will not only enjoy their job but thrive in the environment."
good,"Kein Kommentar, da es sich hier um gesundheitliche Aspekte meinerseits handelte. Alles in allem gute Konditionen und Weiterbildungsmöglichkeiten."
good,Great company going through struggles. Too much red tape and meetings. Middle management likes to slow things down and micro manage instead of enable employees. Good benefits
good,"The best part about working for P&G is the extensive investment the company makes to train it's employees.  As a new hire I received formal training and had access to amazing mentors and coaches.  I learned so much about consumer insights, project management, and the CPG business.  If you have the opportunity to work for P&G take it, because you will learn so much!  P&G, however, should update it's hierarchy and career track in order to attract and maintain millennials in their work force.  P&G also strives to provide equal opportunities to all of it's employees from benefits, training, and diversity programs."
good,"Moving into P&G as a new starter with experience of working elsewhere is a bit of a culture shock. However, being willing to take on new experiences and to learn a lot will really help."

good,Es una empresa  que constantemente nos da capacitaciones y nos hace tener más conocimientos en lo que estamos haciendo
good,"Good company with many good people.  Unfortunately the 'built from within' culture which has served the company well for many years is now keeping the company from being innovative and creative - the employees who have been there for decades believe the P&G way is the only way which limits creativity and outside the box thinking.  Also many employees are scared to try or think about new ideas as they just want to protect their jobs.  Again, a great company with solid ethics and business foundations but leadership would better serve the company (and shareholders) if they encouraged new thoughts and were more accepting of mid level employees brought in to add new ideas and break up the group think."
good,"P&G is a great place to work.  The salary is somewhat competitive.  However, if you have a degree and did not get hired on the management track it is very difficult to get into management. Very few break the reins of this."
good,"I got the opportunity to work for P&G later in my life (over 30) but was the best decision I have ever made.  I achieved more than I ever thought possible; gained competencies and skillset that would not have been possible elsewhere.  Benefits, retirement plan is essential for retirement years.  I would not have the retirement account that I have today without P&G."
good,"Being on the sales is hard but instead of the challenges that they are giving on us , i may say that it is worth it. because i have the personality that every mistake or challenges that they've been trowing  on me i take it as a big deal to perform better to my work to give satisfaction on the company. i put in mind that when they hired me i'm responsible to do my task, then i show them that i'm the employee that cares on the company and to help to grow and to success."
good,"Buena experiencia en general y empresa seria, si no estuve más tiempo fue por una reorganización en la empresa."
good,"Good compensation (stock bonus) and exciting projects. Work environment is collaborative but also competitive. Very bright people, well-known products, good management. Cincinnati is a great city to live in."
good,"Working at Proctor & Gamble was long and exhausting, but it didn't take long to get use to the long hours. Working at Proctor & Gamble you learn how machine operators and others do their job."

good,"I love P&G!!!"
good,"Great experience and amazing place for a young engineer to get his feet wet, especially at this location. I had an incredible manager who cared about the work and taught me necessary skills to succeed. Unfortunately, the impression I got from the company was that everything had to follow a standard structure and conform to the management systems espoused by the company."
good,"Sin dudas la mejor empresa para aprender la importancia de cada uno y de los demàs en el àmbito labora. Respeto mutuo, polìticas claras, manejos cristalinos"
good,This is a great company to work for that offers a variety of positions and encourages their employees to take advantage of training classes offered. The culture here is top notch and can easily be seen by the fact that we were told the doors are closing and there are about 500 people losing their jobs and we continue to come to work everyday and make great quality products with safety being the top priority.
good,"Large Company. leading brands. Sophisticated systems, processes, and procedures. Very good at training and building leadership. Good, collaborative work environment."

good,"I learnt a lot- very diverse and high level of professionalism "
good,"When I first began working for P&G, they had recently opened and the start up was not very organized.  I worked as the Team Lead for the 7pm-7am shift in the case pick department.  At this point in time the work load was minimal and we found ourselves doing more cleaning than picking for orders.  The hardest part of my job was keeping my team focused on the tasks at hand."
good,"I had to ensure the facility was staffed.  Developed training plans, Conducted community job fairs. Reviewed all terminations and promotion requests. Terminations were the most difficult part of my job.  Had to work with the Union Executive Committee on all terminations.  I had a good working relationship with the Executive Committee which lead to a productive work environment."
good,"P&G is a good company, secure, well managed and strong culture for safety throughout.  The higher you go, the less likely you are to advance (as is the case in most companies) and you need to be willing to move, most likely to Cincinnati, OH."
good,"Esta entre as melhores empresas para se começar uma carreira segundo a revista exame, e isso eu pude comprovar de dentro desta empresa."
good,bonne encadrement du personnelle régles d hygiénes et de sécuritées respecter

I achieved more than I ever thought possible; gained competencies and skillset that would not have been possible elsewhere.  Benefits, retirement plan is essential for retirement years.  I would not have the retirement account that I have today without P&G."
good,"The only reason I left P&G was because on opportunity opened up to get back into business for myself.  P&G was a great company to work for, lots of support and communication. Great people."
good,"la burocracia para poder ejecutar trabajos en interior de la planta, lidear con personal que no acata sus responsabilidades y roles a ejecutar en la obra."
good,I love working for Proctor and Gamble. The only issues I have is the scheduling. They changed it to 12 hour swing shift and changing from days and nights constantly made it hard to get any rest or have a balanced life.
good,"P&G has always been a great place to work.  It's a great company to get your basic training and then move on.  For those that choose to stay, advancement is always encouraged.  I enjoyed the culture and the work environment."
good,"I was a general labourer contracted through Adecco. I was hired for packaging. But I also cleaned lines, assisted full time associates with certain procedures. I watched for defects in packaging, as well as assisted in manually bagging product off a line. Working with a lot of great people on the lines made the job a fun one. And time passed quickly."
good,"P&G has a very respectful culture, people are very nice and welcoming. It has also a clear career path."
good,"Amazing company for a person starting up in Marketing and Sales, with the latter coming more into focus in recent times. Company pays competitively, and usually there is great space for career progression."
good,Work days changed. Line may run well with long runs or run bad. The line I was on ran not as good as the others. Maybe no changeovers or many. May be planned changeovers or not planned. This was controlled by planners. I learned ability to be diverse. Expect the unexpected and go with the flow to get the job done safely. Management was fair and not overly involved with team issues.  Teams made themselves or not. Team content important. Teams ability to work together reflected in production. Work culture was overall good. Hardest part of job was running with a minimum staffed team with short runs and a lot of changeovers. The most enjoyable part was running well making a lot of good product safely.
good,"Uma ótima empresa , com um bom salário , benefícios ótimo  ,  com muitas participação na empresa  , oferece um futuro excelente ,gerência muito boa com ótimas pessoas ,"

good,"buen ambiente laboral y con beneficios como por ejemplo, comedor, transporte, regalos, premios, buen sueldo."
good,"P&G is a decent place to work if you thrive in a competitive environment and don't mind some fairly consistent work/life priority violations. People are smart, over achievers, and you learn something new every day in a complex and fast paced environment. You also get paid very well for that stress. The downside is...that mentioned stress and work/life balance. The culture is antiquated (circa 1980's forced bell curve performance management) and turnover with millenials is high due to these culture challenges. It could be a five star place to work if you align with those values, but for me I'm ready for a new chapter in my career with a more moderately paced small or medium business environment and culture. More flexibility, more like family. Note this review is about P&G Pet Care and this segment of the business has since been divested to Mars Inc."

good,"Procter & Gamble, is a great place to work.  I really can't say too many things that weren't great while working there.  During my time I was always busy and working hard on a variety of projects.  The only thing that was a little tricky at Procter & Gamble was often times being led in the wrong direction/ and an unclear definition of the goals myself and team were working towards.  I also enjoyed the company culture however at times, it was a little too serious.  An example of this was when asking a manager what he liked to do in his free time, he responded with ""I don't have free time, I prefer to never be idle."""

My area manager was great in assisting when work piled up and any other work related matters. P&G took care of their part time workforce every year. We got raises, got paid gas mileage and gift boxes every Christmas. I loved working for P&G. I had to leave because my full time job was getting too hectic, which it did not leave much time to work for P&G. I would recommend this job to a full/part time student."

I achieved more than I ever thought possible; gained competencies and skillset that would not have been possible elsewhere.  Benefits, retirement plan is essential for retirement years.  I would not have the retirement account that I have today without P&G."
good,"Starting out working at P&G, it was the best job I ever had.  I loved how they treated me, as I felt valued and appreciated right away.  Their training program was excellent.  I learned quickly how to prioritize tasks, and how to ""flow to the work"", as it was called.  A typical day was very busy, on my feet for over 11 hours, and stressful if equipment wasn't running well. Management was always positive, and helped engender a fantastic workplace culture.  However, the shift schedule created an issue for me with work/life balance.  The shifts would rotate from days to nights, every 2 to 3 days.  For example, I would work day shift 7:00 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday.  I would have Tuesday and Wednesday off, then return to work 7:00 p.m. to 7:30 a.m. on Thursday and Friday.  This flip-flop type of schedule repeated over and over, and this severely affected my ability to have a healthy sleep schedule.  I took this in stride though, and learned to somewhat deal with this issue.  Over time, most of the high-level managers left the company.  The culture and morale began to decline.  I began to feel unappreciated, and my work seemed to scrutinized at every turn.  In the end, I knew I needed to leave P&G.  I needed to relocate from Brigham City to Salt Lake City, but also I felt my career was not going anywhere.  I knew my skills and abilities could be much better utilized somewhere else."
good,"Procter and Gamble offered a nice, clean work environment with many people willing to help with any questions that I had. I had not worked in an office environment prior to this job and it took a lot of getting used to, but well worth it. Excellent company to work for."
good,"This was a great working experience.  I started at the lowest level and was able to work my way up quickly.  However, the rate of pay is low.  Along with driving an hour to work, this was my only issue."
good,"good company to work for. different culture. good environment . productive and fun, fast pace environment. good safety environment. seasonal work. temp to hire, give u a chance to learn different work position."
good,"Top-notch CPG company that employs talented, collaborative leaders; invests in its people; provides flexibility in work/life balance. Career progression in sales depends on ability to relocate."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Procter and Gamble, due to my amazing supervisor and other friendly co-workers. My supervisor was very nice and taught me the job well. I had a great relationship with her. I consider her my friend. The typical day at work was pretty flawless. I understood the concept of the job very quickly, and would eventually learn more about the process in order to help my supervisor along with it. I enjoyed learning more of the process in processing invoices. I would go back to Procter and Gamble if I could."
good,"Great place for advancement if you are willing.  It doesn't seem to matter about gender, race, religion which puts this far above all other companies I have worked for. The pay could be better starting out."

good,"In my last assignment with P&G, each day presented new opportunities to demonstrate mastery of acquired skills.  As a Team Leader, I was responsible for ensuring not only my shift was successful, but also to set up the incoming shift for success.  The art of multi-tasking was essential in overseeing successful production runs.  Our unofficial motto was ""One Team, One Dream"".  The culture dictated that if you was comfortable watching a co-worker struggle without offering assistance, this workplace wasn't for you.  I estimate 97% of the managers I worked under was effective leaders, who knew when to lead & manage and when to stand aside to allow Team Leaders to do their jobs.   The most difficult part of the job was working in a 24 hour operation.  Some of the technical and logistical resources needed was only available Mon - Fri, 0700 - 1700 hrs.   On night shift and weekends,  there were many times when it was necessary to think,, not just outside the box, but to design a new configuration for a box.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the successful completion of a complex production run.  No two production run was the same; even when you ran the same product.  With each successful production run, you could see team members' pride in their work increase.  This variable made my job easier and my stress level lower."

good,"It really depends on a manager. You may be very lucky to get a one challenging and advancing you, or it might be a nightmare. Fortunately, managers change very frequently as the company rotates everyone to build their skills. The company is so big and complex that many jobs have a pretty narrow scope. It's a good life time employer though. They often pay below the market but act extra supportive during maternity leave or special family needs, open to flexi hours etc. P&G provides an on-going training. Sticking with them usually pays out long term very well."

good,"P&G is a great company that treats its employees with the utmost respect and dignity and pays fairly.  But don't be deceived, if you do not enter into the company in a management position, you should not expect to advance very far.  In order to keep the company running lean and mean, they have trapped all of their skilled technicians behind a reinforced wall and will not let them apply for promotion.  They will say they have a promotion to management process, but the truth is that the requirements are vague, the communication on timing is non-existent, and they only allow a few people per year in the entire country to get through the process.  They hold steadfastly to their recruiting process and would rather let great talent leave than admit that it could be flawed.  If you have any designs on achieving greatness, but can't get into P&G as a manager, you are better served taking your talents elsewhere."

I was able to quickly advance once I moved to another department in my business unit. Overall, my managers in R&D were supportive and pushed me to development my skills. I worked with a lot of smart people, and can say I learned most of what has helped me be successful in my life while working at P&G. The culture can be a bit cloistering and overwhelming, especially if you thinking style is more independent and you tend to be more creative in your work style. My co-workers were varied in their personalities and there were many competitive people trying to advance their careers; I was no exception. Yet, there was an unwritten stigma in the event an individual did not want to continue moving up the career ladder. This kind of climate may make one question their abilities and priorities may be shifted to 'fit in with the crowd"", so to speak."

good,"The company does a great job of taking entry level people, developing them (almost no promotions from the outside unless you already worked there before), and creating an army proctoids. It is a great place to learn about a variety of different functions and how everything comes together to bring products to market. Great people and great benefits come along with this. The downside is the need to move to advance. So don't expect to set roots - the best you can hope for is a prolonged stint in Cincinnati."

good,"Everyday we had a team meeting where we discussed the precious shift and came up with a plan for the day in order to be successful. Sometimes it does't matter how much you plan things out of your control like incoming like raw materials and down stream flow may cause a bad day. All we could do is our part. If you communicate and train it makes things a lot easier on everyone, plus it doesn't hurt to ask about someones weekend or how they are feeling. Of course sometimes people need space so its important to give it to them and understand the people you work with...after all your a team and you need to get along.

After 30 yrs at the same location it was getting old. rotating shifts weekly on a 24-7 schedule became tiresome . I fully understand as we all did that the sector I was in was to be stream lined and sold off. There is of course stress involved in that kind of environment. The company was great and any dislikes were more to do with me than them. The hardest part of my job was being pulled in so many directions by different managers. This issue didn't develop until downsizing and work load increased in areas that were not related to my skills. The heat was artificially turned up on all of us...

good,A typical day at work involved controlling inventory. I learned how to use accounting to control shipments. The co-workers were like family. the hardest part of my job was swinging shifts.
good,"Bueno, como mencioné anteriormente, yo era auxiliar. Si mal no recuerdo yo ejercía ahí desde 8 de la mañana hasta las 2 o 3 de la tarde. Yo no pasaba a apuntar mi hora de llegada como lo hacían los demás promotores, yo ya ingresaba directamente a la puerta principal de Chedraui y por lo general ahí siempre me quedaba de ver con mi asesor. Y de ahí a lo típico, a ponerme un cinturón de esos para el cuidado de la espalda  y enseguida a trabajar en lo que me pusiera a hacer mi asesor. Y como había dicho, hacía varias actividades durante el transcurso de mis horas de trabajo, pero especialmente merodear frecuentemente los pasillos y cargar/acomodar los productos de la compañía, como poner hasta atrás las bolsas de detergente que estuvieran rotas, ponerles etiquetas, etc.). Y en la hora de la comida (que ahí si no recuerdo cuánto tiempo nos daban para la merienda) comía con mis compañeros de trabajo en el restaurante dentro de Chedraui, y en raras ocasiones salíamos a comer a las afueras de Chedraui."

Management are very supportive but hours can be long and the higher you move up the ladder the more demanding and pressurized the job becomes. No shut down for holidays therefore plans have to be made early in the year as holidays are given on a first come first serve basis. An enormous amount of red tape regarding safety, which can slow down the production process, but better safe than sorry."
