rating,review
bad,"Over worked, understaffed unappreciated, bullying in the workplace from people in positions of authority. Stay well clear of this place. Very long hours"
bad,A review would do no good seeing as the location is no longer in business. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the time there but when the contract ended the location closed.
bad,"Cold calling people can be difficult, especially when you dont have proper training. This job was fun when you were in the right group of PEOPLE. I dont think i could have made it here with out the positive vibes feom other co workers"
bad,management did not have the time to help anyone that was not friends with them.  management spent a huge amount of time on breaks.
bad,Poor.  They treat employees really bad.  Management thinks that employees are disposable.  I left because I could not stand the treatment managers gave team members.
bad,No clear guidelines were ever given for a good or mediocre performance.  No bonuses or commendations were given in the five years of employment.  Lots of innuendos and questionable comments made about the quality of work and the correct cleaning processes.
bad,Honestly working at West corporations was an experience and I can not say it was a good one. This is by the far the most unprofessional job I have had. I would not recommend anyone to join or fill out a job application for the line group Frontier because being an agent and having supervisors and people above you not act in an professional manner was just absurd.
bad,"High turnover rates, management are liars, customers are dissasitified with the company and insist things chance, but company policy won't allow it. System froze frequently. Hated that place. Call centers are the worse."
bad,"The job is ok, the customers are ok, but the management is not."
bad,"This is a call center so of course the work was very repetitive. With better management this could be a very successful program, however it was very de-moralizing day in and day out. No one was on the same page and it was a constant struggle to please management and the client."
bad,This place is no longer there anymore. No opportunity for advancement at all. Too much favoritism. 
bad,answering phones and talking to different people not having to break a sweat for working and its easy
bad,West is not a company I would recommend anyone to work to management is very poor benefit only benefit if you work in the office or if you become a coach not a very injoyable place to work because everyday their is something new nothing stays consistence management does very poor job on letting you know the changes
bad,"After 9yrs and 7months, I never revived a raise or sip. After giving them almost a decade, they fired me. There was little to no management help and no hope in site. Maybe getting fired was a blessing in disguise."
bad,"Terribly negative environment with extreme micro-managing, poor training and unrealistic goals. "
bad,"A typical work day will be clocking in"
bad,"This is a very difficult place to work. While training is extensive, I still felt entirely unprepared to start actual work there. There was very little support for new employees with very high expectations and no realistic learning curve. The company expresses how important customer service is to them, yet only the newest employees perform certain duties including billing issues. Several times daily I heard that employees are fired regularly for various infractions and often pn a  very subjective basis."
bad,the pay is good but not having time to yourself and family is the worse they have you working mandatory overtime and and crazy hourse no time what so everto yourself
bad,"So many supervisors were trained in a short period of time, they didn't know their job position thoroughly. The head person of the company didn't affiliate with workers, nor did he keep the company fully updated with well needed knowledge. He didn't have any knowledge of most policies as well."
bad,I learned how to work with customers over the phone to help them order there medicines. I worked with some helpful people at times. Hardest part of the job was a angry customer.
bad,The job itself was awesome you got to help customers all day which made their day. Downfall it was the absolutely worst ran company i have ever been apart of.
bad,"This place is a call center and not everyone is on the same page at all times , can be unprofessional. I think that this place could be better if anyone would get on the same page. At first it was a great place to work for."
bad,"The job was ok, it paid well. The management was horrible and did not want certain people to advance. They only cared about production."
bad,I would rather not give any account on this matter. If I had known what this company was like; I would have never accepted a position from them.
bad,"Was not enjoyable. The management was poorly ran, the rules and regelation were never the same for all employees."
bad,"erly operating under Allied Mills, the Poultry Division of ContiGroup Companies, Wayne Farms LLC is the sixth largest vertically integrated producer and processor of poultry in the United States. Since its spin-off in 1965, Wayne Farms has grown its processing capacity to 250 million chickens annually. Wikipedia"
bad,This employer was extremely difficult to work for because they do not value their employees. You are sent home without compensation if business slows down. They don't offer health insurance. Their dress code is inappropriate for the type of job. They tend to single people out for scrutiny and do not reprimand immaturity.
bad,"Try hard to make life difficult for workers, cant bring purse into building. Have to place it on floor when allowed to bring it into building. Change rules daily. Do not have classes to inform you of new coding with system, just expect everyone to know."
bad,"Working at west was ok untill alorica took over. They cut our hours and pay."
bad,"No one is the same page. One manager tell one thing, and another day another manager change to a different rule. It's hard to get hours."
bad,"Blackout days even if you have PTO, poor management, and hostile work place."
bad,"It's a great job for people that's in school, but that's about it. It's hard to advance in the company. The benefits are extremely weak, the pay is not great, and the job security is the reason why I am currently not working there because I was laid off. Other than that I was extremely grateful of the opportunity they gave me and they were very flexible with my school schedule."
bad,This place is a call center. It offers less pay than many other in the area.  It offers little chance for advancement.
bad,Easy job to get if u need something temporary until u find something better with a company who cares about there employees
bad,WEST is your standard call center. I don't have anything bad to say about the company and I don't have anything good to say either. Very high turnover rate makes the job security almost non-existent but it also provides the opportunity for overtime.
bad,"no room for advancement, good pay, little work, repetitive, high school environment, friendly people, drastic changes"
bad,"A typical day at work at West was very repetative. Saying the same disclosures and asking for the same information from every caller. I learnedalot about credit card working there. My co workers were fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was learning everything there is toknow about a credit card, all the fees and explaining it to the customer so they can understand. The most enjoyable part of the job was training."
bad,"This job was mentally exhausting.From getting fussed at,and disrespected by customers to too many daily changes in the programs.Every week you were getting trained in something different when you hadn't got a hang on the last thing."
bad,"The corporate culture tried to promote organizational health, but then made so many changes, management and leadership couldn't keep any focus on retaining people.  If leadership didn't like you personally, then you were terminated no matter how well you preformed in your role.  Resource constraints and multiple projects all with the same timeframes due made it impossible to succeed."
bad,It was very metric oriented.  Training was minimal.  I did not work there for long but it seemed to have minimal focus on actually helping the customer.
bad,Not a good company to work for. I had to fight for hours. The system never worked properly. The other staff members did not really provide the support.
bad,"Senior manager try to make rhe environment friendly, but the othet staff don't. What the old say your as good as the people under you!  One of the other managers wrote me up when I had a car accident. I was out 4 days. Anothe employees w has been out a lot, I mean a lot more than I have and nothing has happened to him. I was even yelled at by this same manager for sending him work related emails to him and he did this in front of everyone."
bad,"A typical day at work never changed. Special tasks where a rarity and always given to the same people. Job advancement is rare. The people are fun to work with however upper management shows extensive favoritism. It is made very clear through company actions that you are not important and that every one is replaceable. I liked the job becuase it was easy, and it paid above minimum wage. The hardest part about the job is finding the motivation to do it."
bad,"not room for growth, only collectors allowed to communicate among one another, specialist are to communicate minimal, office vibe is uncomfortable, and policy and procedures change daily. tightly scheduled breaks & lunchs, occurances for one minute late, no overtime or way to earn extra money. No health insurance."
bad,They dont care too much about their employees. Didnt really teach us the materials we needed to be successful on the floor. hated this job.
bad,"The company was decent until it was bought out by Alorica. Things started to go downhill from there. "
bad,"Your request suggests that I have a choice. So my choice is that I prefer not to comment. Other than the pros and Cons, I plead the 5th."
bad,west would have been a good job to grow with but most jobs there are only temporary
bad,This company provided me an opportunity to gain knowledge about important things to look out for when choosing healthcare benefits for myself.
bad,I helped customers review their accounts. I assisted with the promotions team.
bad,"Great job for older ppl. My job duties was to answer phone from customers who where trying to pay there bills, needed help with there bills,set payment plans or needed more time. Also I had to answer questions if customer didnt understand why there bills"
good,I enjoyed both my West@home and my local office positions with West Corp.Friendly trainer and good training class at the office and comfortable working at home.
good,"Back to back calls which isn't an issue, but the management was not always easy to work with. Some did try and scheduling attempts and trades were rather fair. Easy to swap/give away/pick up shifts."
good,nothing to say one way or the other. Company hires during peak and lay off when slow. Very high turn over rate
good,"decent hours and decent pay, management is a mess. unorganized, unprofessional. not very much room for moving up."
good,"Management is very unorganized, along with no benefit and no incentive or anything going too keep their employees. Also, treat employees like their are elementary along with assign seating."
good,"Well I was still in training at WEST(AT&T), I learned a lot about the different phones that AT&T provided, the different service's. It seemed like they really cared about there employee's, witch I thought was great until towards the end of our training a lot of people were getting sick and it was like if you leave or call in during training you were fired even if you gave a doctor's note. Now I do understand that Nevada is a right to work place, but so may people were sick. Well then one morning around 3am I had a saver ASTHMA attack, I was takin to the ER by my husband and was admitted to the hospital. I called my supervisor 5 hours before my shift I explained what was going on and he didn't care and said that I was fired. I was wrongfully fired from that job and since then I have been looking for work."
good,I came in at a time where management was feeling the pressure of not making goal and applied a lot of pressure on agents. Some days it was borderline bullying.
good,My experiences with the other employees were very favorable. I enjoyed the majority of my co-workers. Company was fine.
good,too man daily changes that was expected to be meet in little time.
good,"I was young working there, so it really didn't appeal to me because I really didn't take it seriously at the time. Now that I am older I can show more appreciation for the company. I can't really review on it because I didn't give the company enough of my time to truly give it a review."
good,Great work experience
good,The work you did and certain other situations that you shouldn't of had to put up with didn't reflect your pay. The attitudes and favoritism and being treated unfairly wasn't worth the stress.
good,"During my 8 yrs at West I was disappointed with the lack of employee appreciation. The company doesn't have a structure that allows employees from smaller market areas to advance within the company. The most valuable lesson that I learned at my time with West is that as an employee I should be primarily concerned with my personal needs as it was apparent to me that putting the companies needs before my own were not met with much appreciation. Many of the members of management are allowed to make decisions that service them better than the needs of the company.  The hardest part of my job was working under an ""Associate Director"" that had never had a direct report before accepting that position. That led to a poorly performing office in which many issues took much more time to resolve than necessary.  I also believe it was a primary reason for the project being relocated to an alternate office."
good,"I took inbound customer service calls for several companies, such as Virgin Mobile, Directv and Home shopping network. I learned how to teach myself everything and how to deal with angry customers. Since it was a work at home job management was only via chat or email. I still talk to some of the people I met through these jobs. The hardest part of the job would be when you get someone who is screaming at you and calling you bad names. The most enjoyable part is when i get the satisfaction in helping someone."
good,"Um dia típico de trabalho eram os constantes atendimentos, normais para este ramo."
good,"calls complaints anger customers not happy, middle man. going insane"
good,"This was a Call Center for DHL an AT&T. Learn how to take calls an troubleshoot fix problems with phones,internet, cable an etc.."
good,"I played a lucrative roll in the day to day functions which included but not limited to supporting various lines groups to asking employees with payroll, time clock or system issues, etc."
good,"It is a fast paced workplace, there is always something going on. I loved the people I worked with. Made lots of friends. I worked long and hard for not very much praise or benefits."
good,"I enjoy the schedule flexibility offered at West. However, some of management lack leadership and soft skills. The workload is extremely high. Customers are kept in queue for at least 30 minutes waiting to talk to a Customer Care Professional."
good,"A typical day at work is productive,interactive,and fun. I learn new ways to handle calls everyday as well as getting to interact with customers over the phone. My co workers are very helpful we all help one another when in need, The most enjoyable  part of my job is being able to help my customers in every way possible by resolving thier issues. The hardest part of the job is when i feel as though i cant help the customers using all of my resources ."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of 98% of time spent with headset/headphone on and engaged in telephone conversation with client, addressing customer billing concerns, explaining bill and assisting in lowering bill.  Little to no interaction with co-workers and management. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the occasional irate customer, also knowing that the focus is meant to be on Sales/commission more than customer satisfaction which is my stronger suit. My most enjoyable part of the job is when I am able to convert an irate customer into a happy customer by the end of the call."
good,"Relaxed Dress Code!!!! Very laid back environment. Goals were reachable, management was always there."
good,4 many this is the go to place to come when in need of work. Moving forward is hard to do when upper mgmt are not professional
good,Benefits are not very good. Wages are not comparable to work being done. Some managers care about their employees some do not. West as a whole I feel does not care about our hardships as far as wages
good,This job was nice to work for the over time and the pay but the company was a joke when it came to the way they treated their workers. They would give you over time and not tell you and then write you up because you did look at the time card one hour before you had to be there to find out you had to be there already. Then if something medical happens to there staff then things get even worse.
good,"Working at this company, there were a lot of young people that worked there and the management was not that good. Great starter job to make money but not good to make a career out of."
good,nice place to work hard to move up in the company because employee and something like temps but contractor would be a better word
good,Since I worked at home It was important to be able to work unsupervised and sometimes the supervisors were not available to assist when a customer wanted to speak to management. You had to be able to use instant messaging while speaking with customers and making sure that all your notes contained all of the conversation you had with the customers.
good,Management team not so great.  They decided on how to punish employees based on the employee and manager.  They didn't reallly have any system in place.
good,The managers are not very consistent with all employees. The do lots of give away and prizes. Will give lunches and gift cards but need better communication.
good,"So far so good.. But the leadership isn't that great. I have learned a lot from this company. Things like how to be more social, data entry , and knowledge with computers."
good,"They had poor planning of  work schedules,ie went to work as scheduled and they announce there will be a Mandatory overtime and if you had a previous appt that you scheduled that afternoon and had to leave they would lock you out the next day and you have no job. It happended to numerous people I didnt think that was right. I like my job received and kept my several customer comments about my performance but it was stressful because of management team and their practices.The hardest part was working with supervisors that had attitudes."
good,"good company"
good,"In my last job it was strictly inbound call customer service. Mostly involving unhappy customers. I deescalated and resolved billing, payment, activation, retention and any customer concerns successfully while being timed per call. I learned to read and deal with every type of personality and find a resolution."
good,Used time as a great time to gain some more experience.  Merger with new company not going as well as hoped. Takes way too long to get answers and resolution to issues.
good,Take incoming calls from customers. The hardest part of the job was the turnover rate.
good,"Atypical day at work would be none stop working, from the time you stepped in the door to the time you clocked out. I did learn a lot from working at west. Customer service levels are exceeding now and I love it."
good,Taking refill prescription orders over for a 90 day mail service named prescription solutions
good,everyday at west is basically the same management tried to make the day fun . learned many customer service skills .  .
good,Taking on customers issues
good,"maintained the call queues to ensure that all calls were being answered in a timely manner, coach and develop team associates, document all coaching and meeting. Work with different personalities was the hardest to do. Learned how to overcome the difficult personalities."
good,Ambiente favorable pero solo tenia media jornada y quisiera jornada completa con un pago .
good,The job itself was ok. the duties was easy the only thing is there is a lot of racism. the pay rate should be more because you do so much.
good,"I handled customer service via phone and email for Toys R Us. I assisted with placing orders, moving orders out of allocated status, and communicated with financial institutions and stores in order to meet customer needs."
good,Spent over 10 years with company. Lots of great people to work for and learned a lot over the years.   Great company to learn the ins and outs on customer service.
good,As in a lot of major companies there is a enormous gap between management and employee resulting in utter chaos whenever a policy is changed (which is frequently). But amazing job making scheduling flexibility very possible for all employees.
good,simple job description with adequate paid training. highly relaxed work atmosphere. management always helpful but not always friendly and co-workers are pleasant.
good,"I worked for Intercall, a Subsidiary of West Corporation for 11 years.  It was a great place to work until a couple years ago.  Quarterly and end of the year bonuses stopped.  No more Holiday parties!  We got a raise every 3 years, which was only a quarter.  So as the cost of living went up, the company was not very considerate.  Next health premiums went up as well.  Management in my department worked remotely from the primary call center, which was good in teaching me the skills of self management.  But became a downfall as I felt used and unappreciated. It was if I was talking to strangers.  But the most enjoyable part of the job was satisfying customers and coworkers."
good,It's a ok place to work with the customer's and people not a lot of incentives still never got paid for incentives earned a lot of turn around
good,"I worked on a big dawg project for AT&T client of Citizens Bank on the East Coast. Was a lot of work. Dealt with AT&T provisioning technicians, AT&T sales managers, AT&T Technical Support personnel, Citizens Bank project managers, Citizens bank personnel local in their bank branches. All of this was to provide low speed data T1 communications to enable bank branches to communicate with the corporate office central hub in Providence RI. Overall I liked working there. Worked a lot of OT hours, but got the job done."
good,My typical day consist of watching cameras and patrolling the facility building for 8 hours straight (no breaks) although we may leave the office to attend personal needs as long as we remain on site. I assess any and all emergency or hostile situation and alert the proper authorities while keeping a cool head.
good,"i liked the training i went thru and people i met thru west the thing "
good,This was nothing more than a job that paid more than min wage. This is a lot of younger kids and not taken very seriously.
good,"Will be on the phones all day answering to customer about their prescription drugs. Having to explain the benefit they will be getting with OptumRx, and what kind of money saving they get with their prescription medication."
good,"Day's at West are full juggling the various staffing positions,  I've learned the criticality of the what appear to be small behind the scene procedures. I appreciate upper management, however middle management has a lot to learn.  I work well with my co-workers and prefer to keep the interaction on a professional level.  The most hard part of the job is not being acknowledged for successes. The most enjoyable part of the job  is the variety of characters I interact with every day"
good,"West has been a good company to work for. There is limited room for growth to executive level without transition to Omaha, NE."
good,"people really cared about their employees and was easy to work around however, the job itself was a little overwhelming at times"
good,"Answered inbound calls as well as assist customers who have specific inquiries, helped build customer’s interest in the services and products offered by the company. Provided personalized customer service of the highest level in a pleasant and friendly mannerism"
good,"Most enjoyable part of this job was helping customers resolve issues.  I was given a number of programs and tools in which I learned to navigate well in order to search for answers as oppose to a script and that makes it authentic to the customer being important, but also kept me learning as new developments were made to technology and the company. Hardest part was restricting time spent with the customer."
good,The job was very stressful. The rules kept changing. I never seemed to feel like I was accomplishing much
good,Nothing to say about the company it was a good place to work in.
good,"Call Center at its best! Cranky Customers, loud and obnoxius co-workers, people in power positions that have no clue what is going on...crazyness!"
good,Trabaje en esta empresa donde mis colegas eran muy amables con ganas de enseñar y tambien el ambiente era relajante.
good,"It can be a slow or busy day depending on the time of the year. When it is busy the phones are ringing nonstop, scheduling appointments for gas to be turned on or off. We were steady learning something new every week. We were constantly training for a new method of helping people that needed our help. The staff was pretty large so I didn't know that many people upper management but the few that i did know was pretty cool."
good,"Billing agent for Comcast customers which was a very fast-paced atmosphere that experienced high call volumes throughout the day, especially during the lunch and after work hours. I learned many things about the cable industry, troubleshooting, and how to calm down irate customers through shear empathy. The management and co-workers were all willing to help handle special situations and requests by the customers. The hardest part of the job was trying to up sell to customers who were trying to save money (which was required on every call). The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to explain and fix a customers billing issue with complete understanding."
good,basically inbound calls technical support and bill management
good,I liked this place because I am very much a people person. They always offered overtime. The people there were very friendly. Always different work to do.
good,The hours I worked was 2:30-11:00pm. I went to school during day so working a full time schedule was hard.
good,"I liked working there, but there were't enough hours. I kept getting switched between projects."
good,This job was probably the base of what I want to do with my life. It was fairly easy for me to get hired and from my experiences there I would say that it was decent work. It wasn't something I was incredibly excited about but was rewarding enough.
good,I enjoy my job and interacting with the customers.  this is a call center - I'm as high as I can go on the floor and looking for more opportunities.
good,"I learned different departments of the corporation, but most of all I enjoyed working with my co-workers and assisting customers by phone"
good,"Very relaxed place to work. No micro managing, you are  left alone to handle your accounts. Really liked working for this company but pay was low and never received a raise."
good,"Although I love the idea of West and there are many avenues to take for career placement, there is not a lot of security that a program will be attained and you are not guarenteed placement to another program. "
good,Only lasted one week at this job.  Training was difficult for me because of my vision. Trainer would lose control of training class. No one on one guidance.
good,"A typical day consisted of answering phones, multiple patrols of facility and grounds, checking both employee and visitor id's, and monitoring video cameras.  The management at West did not seem to care for the non-staff employees, only for the staff.  In general my co-workers were easy to get along with and to work with.  The hardest part of the job was to escort terminated employees off site, especially the ones that I knew to be single parents.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the diversity.  Was able to meet all types of people."
good,Your typical day at work was always the same dealing with the same people everyday.
good,"Definitely a place you could get comfortable at - stayed there till they left. Same rules however, mind your business and stay away from drama"
good,"Great People, Great Job, Great work life balance, Position Closed due to a merge with Medco, and Express Scripts it is that simple."
good,training on the computer on how to process credit card applications. sometimes there would be fun training games and prizes given out. there was about 20 people in the group. most of the time you had a partner. after the class training was training on the floor where you listen in on a call.
good,"answering phones and dealing with customers all day, ive learned a lot of computer, phone and communication skills, the management was good they just did not provide help when it was needed, my coworkers were the best part of the job, the hardest part of the job was keeping up with the heavy call flow and the most enjoyable was talking to the customers and listening to some of the awesome things they had experienced in their lifes."
good," West was  a great place to work if your a people person, you have to be a very patient person because their times when get an upset customer, But i gotten used to it with help from my coworker,and supervisors. The hardest part of my day was to get a customer and you've tried your hardest to help, but you couldn't just transfer their calls. Overall i loved my job the good out weigh the cons "
good,"Everywhere has it's good & bad West was an ok place to work and depending what project your on you may have fun things done for you, i really enjoyed the people i worked with, even considered going back a few times"
good,West is a good company if you feel comfortable with earning pay off of commission. West has a very strong culture and makes it very enjoyable to be apart of their team.
good,"take calls   for billing - new service - returning customers . Give great deals to customer's And help them customize  there plans to there needs "
good,"The job itself was awesome but the management wasn't any help at all, and will throw you under the bus for their own reasons."
good,"Telephone based customer service with a large amount of calls, listening and understanding customers current needs and fulfillment of requests.  "
good,"Previous employer. Enjoyed managing the line group I was assigned to. Awesome time meeting Clients we serviced. Great benefits. Developed awesome friendships with other line groups in the building, lasting friendships."
good,It is a fun place to work being around great people but the management is horrible. Co workers keep your day going because their are some good people there. The Hardest part about the job is just sitting in front of the computer for 8 hrs with short breaks.
good,the company paid ok and the people were great .the company just didn't want to work with me wen I started intern ship.
good,"Going to work answering phone calls,having people fuss at you for no reason. The co-workers was never on time and could leave whenever the place had downtime in the system."
good,It was enjoyable work. Need an eye for detail these are Medical parts. Knowing the importance of the parts made the job nice to know you had a hand in helping.
good,"We waited for years to get a raise because of merger, then once merged, they said it would be another 3 years!  That was completely unacceptable, not to mention benefits got cut and several other perks."
good,At West it is a Job. There was no benefits or anything when I was working there you did you hours and got paid.....At the time flexibility is what I was looking for and they had it.
good,"I really had great co-workers and we worked well together creating new strategies to help customers maximize their company profits.  Most of the associates went the extra mile to make sure that we could all get the job done as a team.  Working with the customers was great fun, even when they were upset.  Helping analyze the customers finances and the best way to maximize profit was very rewarding, particularly when it was required to build rapport with the client sometimes finding interesting information on many business fields."
good,"inbound calls from customers "
good,"I enjoyed the job and I loved the flexibility I had with my schedule. Working on the sales floor always had high energy, a fast pace, and interesting conversations."
good,It was a cool place to work but we were promised to make extra money off of sales and I never got that until after I left the assignment
good,"What I learned while working at this job is the importance of credit. A typical day at work is seeing how many applications you can process, its keeps you motivated"
good,answering phones customers playing on the phone always having fun looked forward to going to work. co workers were great. management worked with you.
good,"This was a call center environment and if you don't mind sitting down all day, then I would recommend this job.When I worked at West I was taking inbound calls from Harris Casinos customers. Guest would call in wanting to make hotel and event reservations. Overall it was a easy job. There were times when it would get really busy and you couldnt leave until you were out of Que. But for the most part there was a lot of down time . So there would be times when you're just sitting there. I would bring a book, homework and different things to help the time go by. There is chance for advancement here. I knew several people who started off on my team that became PTL's. "
good,"really enjoyed helping customers, training was good but no substitute for experience"
good,"gestione della commessa secondo iso 9001 e del team di lavoro, stesura report e infìterfacciamento col cliente."
good,"Lunches were too short instead of breaks do 1 hour lunches,   My managers was great.   Others I hear gave you very little room for error............................................................"
good,Un ambiente cómodo y a la vez exigente!!! Cumpliendo con las exigencias pautadas
good,At this job I took calls for Cingular Cellular Company and telemarketing calls. During hurricane Katrina I took sensitive calls for the red cross. I also was a team lead which was basically a supervisor that didn't get paid for being a supervisor .
good,Enjoyed interaction with older/ middle school kids. Did not put in a lot of hours in recent years. Hard to learn attendance system when there so little
good,"I loved my job at west my fellow colleagues were great to work with west just had bad management i learned alot about customer service , how to talk to people and gained plenty social skills"
good,They added additional benefits for their employees.  Depending on the program your with they will work with your school hours.  Their hours are great for a family person with kids.
good,"I joined West Corporation at a young age in an entry level call processing position. During my time I have learned a lot about the business to business to world. The company provides many opportunities to advance in different departments and promotes the aspect of ""promoting within""."
good,"I loved my job and the people I worked with. I could work all the over time I wanted. The best part for me was being able to help people, especially the elderly who would be calling in for days and not getting their equipment hooked up properly and activated, because they had been given the run/around before, or rushed off the phone, or an agent in China took their and the Customer could not understand the agent."
good,ok place to work if u just want a job...providers call and get claims status and benefit info...not super busy. The hardest part of this job was taking calls from clearing houses out of the country and understanding their broken english

good,Es un instituto con una historia muy sólida en la zona. Respetado y muy convocado. Desde el principio te proveen guía y materiales para que cumplas con los objetivos de las clases. Muy buen diálogo con la Dirección y con los profesores como grupo. Excelente clima laboral. Se nota que se apoyan en la trayectoria más que en las técnicas de docencia lo cual hace que sea difícil compartir tu experiencia e ideas individuales. Hay un poco de temor a probar cosas nuevas que no se salgan del molde típico de instituto de Inglés.
good,great place to work and grow also the team and management were their for you every step of the way it wasnt easy but you were coached on things which helped make you more of an great employee

good,"I absolutely love my job, but I'm also 28 years old and about to top out pay wise in my job title. There is very little turnover in management, so the potential to move up is slim to none. I work with people who have been in the position I am in for 10-15 years, and I am not content staying at this level that long."
good,I started as a customer service agent on the phones and advanced quickly to Employment Specialist in Human Resources and the coworkers and management were great and understanding.
good,All my workload was computer generated on a daily basis. I was assigned a varying number of cases each day that remained in my control until all the corrections/adjustments of information were made and approved by the initiating department. I increased my proficiency in using excel because I was required to keep track of the progress of each case assigned to me. My supervisor was one of the best I have ever had and even though our group was together for a relatively short period of time we became a close-knit group. The hardest part of this job was all the fine details we had to learn to do our job effectively and accurately. The most enjoyable part of this job was being able to do non-work related things when we got caught up and there was not enough work to keep us busy.

good,"I loved  my job and would most definitely go back if or when I have the opportunity.  I loved my co-workers and some team leads. Management are some what friendly. The hardest part for me was dealing with rude and uncivilized customers. You couldn't ""go off"" on them you had to keep your composure even if they were calling you out of your name and threating you. I loved going to lunch and cooling with everyone in the break room. I also loved the events we had on site like, customer appreciation week, cook/bake-offs, coloring contest, and team cubicle decorating contest. There was also a lot of nonsense between agents and team leads. There was a lot of favoritism and jealousy."
good,The pay was great.  You could post any hours you didn't want on their online website and people could pick them up and add them to their schedule.  It worked out really well.  You could also get paid more for certain pick up hours.
good,"i went to try something new as a call center being that all you do is answer calls. Traning was good and it somewhat prepares you for the incoming calls. i pays good for a first job,"
good,"While the demands of such a high volume business can be stressful, the sense of fellowship and willingness to lend a hand among most employees is remarkable.  Days can be long; breaks can be short, far between, and sometimes missed altogether due to customers needs. Agents and management alike all feel the stress of overwork from time to time, but on that same token, I've seldom seen teammates allow an agent to fail because he/she felt overwhelmed. Experienced agents tend to take newer agents under their wing and guide them when they seem to be struggling, even if it's as simple a task as fetching a script or double checking a setup."
good,"Una empresa totalmente grata para trabajar tanto de la jefatura hasta el empleado ."
good,"A typical day of work was busy with various situations to deal with. I learned how to handle customer questions and objections in a fast paced environment. The management team was very easy to ask questions if there was an issue. Also they were great to help their team members if there was a problem. "
good,"West has mostly been good to me and my immediate management has been quite understanding of life happenings- but I cannot speak for other programs though. The benefits package leaves something to be desired and the company has been making massive changes in management, which has created a lack in consistency in management. Some people got promoted too quickly and it shows that the training wasn't there to support the change."

good,"Great company to work for, taking inbound calls assisting various customers with an array of services."
good,"Great environment"
good,"West was a great company to work for & highly motivated to helping you to have ""All 5's"" on every call that you received. All the supervisors were helpful & most co-workers were positive. Because if you don't have a positive attitude in a call center, you probably wont last long. Despite all the helpfulness & tools that one gains at West it is still a high stress environment & multiple tasks must be looked after in detail simultaneously. Its a great job, but beware of the stress."
good,When I worked for West I really enjoyed it. Everyone was nice and helpful. The only reason I left was because I was laid off.
good,West unfortunately closed down while I was working there.  They offered flexible work schedules and you could pick up hours as well.  It was a fun place to work and I learned a lot.
good,"This job is definitely harder than I had expected. The objective is to have a conversation with a Card Member and find a business card that will better fit them, since their point of calling in was to cancel their current business card. There are plenty of opportunities to move up within your program, and tons of other programs to choose from. I originally started taking phone calls as a sales associate, and 8 months later I became a Supervisor."
