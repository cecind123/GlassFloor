rating,review
bad,"Horrible job.  Do not work here.  The pay, culture and management were awful. I’ve since worked for smaller companies and made more money.  So glad I left."
bad,Not a great place to work. I had 30 home in various stage of construction plus the were all different models with different finishes. Most supers only had one build model. I had 4 build models
bad,Cheat you out of your money want you to work 60 hrs a week. They don't take care of there people. They do not pay for gas and no reimbursement program. They are the biggest home builders in the country
bad,"Everyone is pulling for themselves. Nobody is pulling for the company, nobody’s pulling for the customer. Total chaos. They make promises and don’t keep them.Management seemed clueless at times. The company direction and motivations were never clear."
bad,"Full of empty promises.  Everyone loves to play the blame game and management will curse you out and talk about the other sales agents. If you go here, you won't stay long."
bad,"no advancement or pay raise, worked sun up to sun down company looks at numbers not buyers. I enjoyed making customers happy and see a smile on there face"
bad,"Loaded me down with an impossible number of homes which could not be adequately carried by 1 superintendant.  Makes it almost impossible to make bonus.  Found out I was looking and fired me 2 weeks before Christmas.  If that is the corporate culture you want, then this is your employer."
bad,"Worked for Dr Horton for the past year in New Smyrna Beach FL. Cut throat company, low skill labor, and bottom of the barrel material. Company only cares about quantity, quality is not their concern. My recommendation is don't buy one of these!"
bad,"The reason HR rules exist is for companies like this. It is the model for toxic work environments. The new Construction Manager Assistant in Austin is on his way to becoming the head of construction and it is going to be even more toxic."
bad,"Take into acct people who uproot their whole lives accepting a job that was supposed to be permanent, on our own dime moving our whole home 5 hrs away and kiddo to a new school to work at your Camp Horton Ranch in West Texas busting our butts 14-16+hours 7days a week not giving us any corporate paperwork/benefits as promised when told we were hired after our probation period (2 weeks) and then your Camp Horton ends and we get notice and our last paycheck a week later (not even been there 3 months) that we are No longer needed nothing to do with our work it was great they said and corporate is telling the ranch manager to downsize and tell us we have a week to move out.... Yeah thanks a lot Mr. Horton & Corporation for destroying our lives now we are having to move back home thank God we didn't sell our house. Nice way to run your company and real slick to screw us out of recouping any moving expenses either way or probably unemployment too. Way to confirm to us all the stories on how your Company treats people is actually true."
bad,Awful place to work. No life balance. Expected to be on call 24/7. No support from management. Always had  to look over my shoulder to wonder who was next to be fired for no reason. Was a manager and never could make decisions on my own. Always had to run it by my manager and would take weeks to get a response from my manager. Overall a hostile environment.  Worst place ever to work at.
bad,"I worked for D.R. Horton in the Seattle Wa area in 07-09 so things may have changed a little but I doubt it. As a sales rep (their word for realtor) you are expected to pounce on customers the second the walk in the door (which is their floor model house.) They even asked us agents to follow customers out to their car to try to get them to view a home. Creepy, creepy creepy management style."
bad,"No worklife or career advancement. Management makes many promises but in the end they don't keep them. They expect you to work 24/7 literally...while others work whenever they feel like it. "
bad,Not a good company to work for. Did not learn anything. Some co-workers were ok.
bad,"This company is going to try to sell you on culture, be sure to get examples of this “culture” and know it’s a farce. This is a company where it’s not what you know but who you know. If you are not well liked, there’s no amount of knowledge or skill that’s going to be of aid to you. If you go in knowing you’re going to be over worked, underpaid and just a number to management then you can’t be disappointed."
bad,commissions are capped and you are expected to be constantly available to management. DP shows off multiple high dollar vehicles while employees struggle to make ends meet
bad,Margin driven company that doesn't care about their employees. Sales people are treated like children...they are talked down to while they bring in the majority of the revenue.
bad,"Originally this job was great.  Morale was high.  Management was stocked with talented people, the sales team was amazing and full of really high quality pros (most of which have left and are performing well on their own.)  Neighborhood locations were excellent, ranging from the southeast to Henderson to southwest.  The Division seemed to get all the good spots and its locations were the envy of other builders."
bad,Area manager in WCFL is lazy and don’t know anything. Rides around to only the sub division where the flirtation sales ladies are and the other ones he just call to see what’s the progress is. And if you challenge him he will write you up
bad,"Nepotism runs rampant in the Woodland Hills office, plus ..."
bad,Worst builder to work with.  Product is shoddy . No loyalty in the company . Seriously poor sales management . Sales continuously have dropped this year. Because their sakes manager can’t run or hold a good team. Can’t make their numbers and have not made numbers in 3 months due to poor agents/sales management . Huge lack of leadership in the nashville division .
bad,Nashville division has a Toxic environment full of people that don’t really know what they are doing . Management was VERY uneducated . Land acquisition is shifty at best. Constantly purchasing land on sink holes and telling agents not to disclose it (which is illegal.) sales manager is one of the worst in the industry that I know with all the builders in town this is the last one I would recommend working for . Company holds no loyalty towards employees. Everyone is replaceable . Their sales numbers have fallen since hiring their horrible sales manager .  Numbers have not been met for over 3 months straight and have consistently dropped .
bad,"When i first started their it was great, it was a little frustrating because my supervisor didn't know her job well enough to train me. The old supervisor left and the new supervisor didnt know anything as well....i felt under paid, with the most jobs to keep track of 807 homes. I Had the same amount of experience as one of the permit coordinator (20 years) and she made alot more then me ( with less jobs to track)...the new supervisor was very very rude to me ( only me!!!) I never worked for company that had clicks and groups to be apart of. Overall this Division need help from the corporate division because they have no structure AT ALL!!!!"
bad,"Chew you up and spit you out culture. Turnover rate is through the roof. Worked for them twice, once on East Coast once on West Coast and they bully their own people to the point of burn-out. Too wrapped up ""in being the number one builder"" and constantly over-extend their vendors' capacity. They pay as well as any other national builder, but if you are looking for some kind of pride and satisfaction from your career, stay far away from DR Horton."
bad,"I worked as a Marketing Coordinator in DHI's marketing department with the understanding that this was mostly a creative position (I'm a graphic designer by trade). Since this seemed like more of a copywriting/coordinating position than a creative one, I probably wasn't the best candidate, and was miserable the entire time I was there. Upon being hired, they knew I had no experience with designing for this industry, so to be fair, they gave me a little time to learn the jargon and the MULTITUDE of rules for creating marketing materials for a mortgage firm by giving me fewer, easier jobs to begin with."
bad,Was a Field superintendent they don't explain every thing about the job in the interview. Over load you with work and no support. Beware of the construction mgr. salary pay at 60 hrs a week.
bad,"I would never tell anyone to apply to this company, it would be better to starve than go to work for DR Horton!! Or at least under the current self absorbed management team. "
bad,Only interested in quantity over quality. The employee doesn’t matter and neither does the customer. They only care about profit margins and meeting sales goals. Lacks good management and leadership. They are constantly changing things to fix what they changed before and still can’t get it right. They’ve had 3 different sales managers in 3 years.  Turnover is high!  You are expected to achieve unrealistic quotas with little to no help. Not a family oriented company whatsoever.  The only positive attribute is being able to help the customer achieve their dream of homeownership.
bad,Its unfortunate. I had high hopes for it being a good job. I enjoy the field I work in but management is extremely lacking and a very high turn over rate. And they want the deadlines met but wont accept any overtime when they know its necessary.
bad,"Its a great environment if you want to change software and hardware every 2 years!"
bad,"I worked for a company that DRH bought out and the old ways were preserved. I was an newbie, an outsider and was eventually railroaded after a witch hunt. The compnay culture was awful and no changes were made to make it any better after the buyout."
bad,"Great co workers, fantastic division president, terrible reject dominion homes sales manager, and lack of land opportunities. I think if they could fix these two issues quickly it would be an amazing place to work!"
bad,"New management is a joke. No one knows what they’re doing. Morale is the lowest it has ever been, they stripped our commissions, capped our earnings and drove a Division into the ground. This used to be a great place to work. This Division used to be one of the top producing Divisions year after year. It’s now an embarrassment! Bring back the former management please!! Management needs to stop intimidating and demeaning its people!"
bad,They would load you down with a lot of houses (45-60 houses) some in other communities. You would have to train your Assist Superintendent because he had no experience. It was about  getting the houses out and not caring about the quality and warranty on homes D R Horton also favors people if you not in the click you don't get promoted.
bad,"Corporate political politics exist in this industry. No avenue to address grievances. Women is traditional roles, i.e., administrative and clerical. Tokenism in diversity and female management positions."
bad,"Just don't do yourself the disservice of seeking a position with the Houston South division if you are looking for an employer whose culture fosters the growth and development of its employees."
bad,"When initially hired as an assistant superintendent, I was assured that after a year's worth of gaining experience, assistants are promoted to ""lead superintendents"". This could not have been further from the truth. It seems management likes to promote their ""favorites"" even though these individuals do less than quality work. "
bad,"Treat their employees like machines,  not people. Corporate culture was just horrible,  cut throat and back stabbing. Customers came first and could speak to employees however they liked and even cuss you out,  it was acceptable.  Management didn't care about people,  just their bonuses and they usually weren't available;  too busy with hair appointments,  obgyn appts, flying their plane or hunting."
bad,Salary and benefits are good.  Management is all about themselves.  Very little positive reinforcement.  Much better homebuilders to work for in Houston
bad,"Disrespectful, they tell you to ask if you do not know, but when you ask, they talk down to you like you are stupid.  They come in with a bad attitude most days, but if you are having a bad day, you should have called in sick, but calling in is frowned upon."
bad,"Poor management, broken promises and non existent managerial support. Will throw you under the bus in a heart beat. Good bonus structure and nearly unlimited resources"
bad,"Don’t sacrifice yourself. Hours are Monday through Friday 8-5, but if your pouring concrete at 3 am your still expected to work until 5 and only salary so no overtime."
bad,"Vice President of construction has no management skills and is miserable to work for.  People advanced who were buddies with upper management "
bad,"Don't work for DR! They are shady. Do your research before agreeing to work for them. Their ""office assistant"" runs their entire MLS listings and puts her name on them. All the leads through the MLS are ran by her. Its VERY unfair and pretty shady. I had to report them to the DBPR and the NAR. You will be promised things that never happen. For example, they will tell you that you will make lots of money, that they will put you in a community with a lot of traffic and leads.... its all lies. They have really bad turn over, they are overstaffed. They have some good agents working for them its a shame that a great agents are wasting their time with a dishonest builder. They will ask you to lie, and cheat your way into deals... its really bad. Like for instance, they are offering 10,000 off on a home, they have fees that they have to pay (as a builder) however, they tell their agents in sales meetings that you have to tell the customer that the customer has to pay the fees(that the builder is supposed to pay)! Its really shady to the public!"
bad,If you do get a job on their help desk don't become comfortable because you will be fired they have no value in the employees they have on the helpdesk. The management doesn't care about the employees the team leads don't know what they're doing the manager has no idea and the upper management people don't seem to notice or don't really care. So if you do get a job there be careful.
bad,Construction manager will lie and scream at clients to save his own hide. not a place I wanted anything to do with. Clients hate the experience and upper management cares about only the bottom line...
bad,there are many advantages with working with a large company. The many locations and benefits are great. the pay was competitive and the structure was within industry standards
bad,"Extensive amount of overtime, most with little notice given. Very hard to have a family/life balance here. Management does not apply same rules to everyone. Prepare to spend most of your time in meetings then be reprimanded for not moving fast enough."
bad,"D.R. Horton is good if you want a lot of experience and responsibility fast, but they burn out talent by being understaffed and not compensating appropriately."
bad,Constantly changing rules to benefit few.  Making it difficult to excel overworked. Management complained and you would even get reprimanded or moved if took time off
bad,"They want you to work 50 hours weeks with only pay for 40. It is just not worth it when the stress carries over into the weekend, don’t recommend for anyone"
bad,"Responsible for 30+ Homes at minimum"
bad,"Worked at the company for 6 years. Applied for multiple transfers yet other technicians with less certifications, experience, or service with the company were promoted ahead of others as well as given raises. There was a lot of nepotism and cliques in the department as well."
bad,"Worked 10-12 hours daily for 2 years, never received a raise, was paid for 40 hours every week. they are turning out unsat homes from the Phoenix Division. I asked for help for 5 months due to the speed of the build and homes not being correct, I was fired for poor organizational skills. The management here does not care about the employees. The mandatory meetings they have are useless nothing ever gets accomplished."
bad,Expected to continue to push the bar higher with increased productivity while compensation lags behind. Difficult to get subs to perform at a high level when their bids are continually pushed down. Do not pay auto or fuel allowance and there are great demands covering wide geographical areas.
bad,Typical day is always stressful.  We have a manager who has no experience in forward planning/project manager.  Manager is an architect who micromanages and is a narcissist.  Ego is through the roof and constantly puts people down.  Never satisfied with the effort or work performed and makes sure people know they were close to being fired.
bad,"Though I had consistent success with the company. There is a very real chance of burn out very quickly. Apart from working every weekend (if you have a family it will very difficult to balance both Job and home) I was expected to drive from Montgomery to Birmingham a 60 min. drive very Friday for sales meetings (which was not told to me prior to taking the position). It is also 100% commission only 2% not the standers 3% you would get for being licensed, even though most of the time there was not a buyers agent. I also found management to be untrained and inexperienced. Sell, sell, sell is the mantra and little to no regard is given to the sales team, even though that is what holds up the company."
bad,"Since I am currently employed, I reserve my right to my opinion.  At this time, my earning  potential is limited due to overpriced product."
bad,"Very toxic environment.  No communication. Management are all very immature and petty.  If they decide they don't want you around anymore, they write you up and/or demote you then terminate you. Employees are scared.  Many have left after being demoralized.  Their motto ""We build people too"" is laughable."
bad,"If your in management and good at your job, it is not if, but when, you will be stabbed in the back by jealous coworkers. Sad because you should be a team, but everyone is out for themselves."
bad,"This company/division in Portland, OR treats you as a number"
bad,"Stressful, extreme lack of communication from management,"
bad,I spent 14 years here. The first few years were good and then we got bad management in. It really changed the culture. It was time for me to move on and pursue new dreams.
bad,This company cares more about the fast paced production and hitting numbers than they do about the customer or the employees. This is why there is so much turn over and no longevity here.
bad,"Just not a good place to work there, especially for a temp/contractor worker. They look down on temps and treat them badly. No respect for temp workers at all. A horrible office coordinator that didn't like the hard work that was done by a temp, once word got out that the temp would be hired on for a promotion, the office coordinator showed complete disgust towards temp worker, even as far as to go and have the staff turn on that person, possibly with lies or exaggerations just to make the temp worker feel miserable enough to just walk out on the job."
bad,High ratio of turnovers. Employees are overwhelmed which give little to no work life/balance. No yearly increases or bonuses.
bad,"Their's to many reasons to list as to why they have so much turnover with the Superintendents. "
bad,Management will release well qualified sales/brokers with proven track records WITH HORTON... then turn around and hire new brokers with no proven track record or success? Years of great results then a bad performing quarter and you'll be released. This is poor management and a great example of being treated as a number with no employee appreciation.
bad,No work to life balance. It is all about the sale and not the customer. Buying a home is the biggest purchase in someone's life and they are not treated with the respect they deserve.
bad,Some superior people but some bad apples. Great homes and designers and warranty/customer service. Appalling  work/life balance. Excellent benefits. Great PTO but pressured to never use it because of company’s ambition to reach  #1. Morale is low.
bad,"D.R. Horton is about as typical of a publicly held company as it gets. The numbers handed down from the corporate office are paramount. As a homebuilder you won't find another place where you can garner as much experience in as little time and earn as much bonus money. The people in the division offices are generally good people and I enjoyed my colleagues greatly,There is a tremendous amount of freedom in being able to call your own shots and decide how you want to run your subdivision. but that's about where the positive stops.  You will be forced to close homes that are not ready, no matter how fast you build, they will want it faster. Every month they scramble to pull more closings up in order to meet over inflated budget numbers which results and unhappy customers and over worked supers. you will not be promoted past a superintendent unless you have been there for over 15 years and are in good with the current managers. merit doesn't mean a whole lot here, you can be the fastest builder with the lowest amount of warranty and it's likely the slowest guy that builds a terrible home is only paid a little less than you. you will be a number here, they will try to tell you otherwise, but stay long enough and it will be apparent."
bad,"Started out good and went downhill from there. Micromanaged, treated as if you couldn't make decisions.  There were favorites who always got the recognition. Co-workers not very happy but stayed because the money was good.  The customers loved their product and the attention they got from agents.  Surveys given to customers and agents were blamed for things they didn't have control over, like construction issues or design center issues.Offered good benefits."
bad,"The Huntsville division where I worked lacked proper management so lazy people hardly worked and got paid more while hard workers just worked harder and were paid less. This division lacked a ""team"" mentality, instead people talked about others behind their backs, HR talked about private business around the lunch table and the stress was high for those who worked hard. The attitude of DR Horton is to sell cheap and not worry about ""doing the right thing"". Warranty issues were out of control at this division! I don't think other divisions were ran like the Huntsville office though. I sure hope not!"
bad,Upper management not capable of managing under the conditions of the economy.
bad,"This company is one of the best corporate's I have worked for in terms of benefits. Management needs some improvement. For some this is a perfect fit, if you get along with the right people."
bad,"Real Estate industry on the whole, is very cut throat. Many people who lack the skills to function within the organization. Very little direction. Don't miss a meeting, because you can feel the BUS running over you.  Wall St. beware, books are usually COOKED!"
bad,Too many employees talking negatively about one another. My manager was extremely stuck on herself and did not seem to have confidence in me. She talked to me like I was a 5 year old.  I think we were pretty much the same age.   It was disappointing.
bad,"Strong ,motivated company. Moving in a new direction."
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of Data and Market Analysis to identify the profitability of potential residential developments. This aspect of the job provided the opportunity to manipulate variables and was the most enjoyable. However, the majority of this work would not be looked at nor would management acknowledge the work being done. Tasks were rarely delivered and goals were never set. Significant turnover occurred during my stint with the company."
bad,"Typical day: wake up at 4am, open the job site by 5am, hire crews, walk site and supervise construction, eat on the go, host city and county inspections, walk throughs with homeowners, debrief with boss, meet up with security, secure and close construction site for the night, go to office for paperwork."
bad,Fat pace environment dealing with all levels of management and other outside individuals to process the workflow accurately and effectively
bad,Hours are 7-5 mandatory. You are told you are on call 7 days a week 24/7. Vacation time is nice when you don't have to work during it. If you take off no one covers for you and if they don't (and they don't) you lose money for not hitting your build times. You are told it is a privilege to work for DR Horton.
bad,Great group of people and excellent benefits. Hectic days and unrealistic goals. High turnover and low pay. Houses are thrown together and rushed to close. No quality time spent in the homes before closing. Cheap built houses
bad,I did not like working here. The companies work life balance in order to make sales was horrible. Shady agents who would take clients and not care. I left because i couldn’t take it. My manager was pretty ok though.
bad,"It is Americas largest builder and there is opportunity to make a great living. The health coverage is good.  However, your income relies heavily on the community you are assigned to. If you are in a community out in the boonies you will suffer financially. You will work EVERY SINGLE WEEKEND. While they claim to be family and customer first, it is really numbers first. You are tied to your model all day and may only see one person. They will not even let you leave to get a sandwich at a drive through. A set/formalized training program is non existent. You will shadow someone for about 2 weeks and then you are off."
bad,"I cannot judge DR Horton as a whole by my experience with the Melbourne Florida Division. The actions that took place at the Melbourne division were surprising. This includes management actions, training, support, and product. The most enjoyable part of the job were the many home owners I was privileged to meet and build for."
bad,Initially it was a great work environment-supportive management and team players.  New management brought in with a different work ethic that basically seemed to pit all sales against each other. Lack of support from management saw a huge turnover in staff.
bad,"Managed vendor communications and information files by maintained purchase order flow, updated projects vendor lists, coordinated paperwork for vendors, processed and changed purchase orders."
good,This place is only about the production of how much gets processed. If you don't meet those levels of what is expected the job isn't for you. There is no work life balance only work.
good,90 day temporary agency used to get staff started. Management extends probation indefinitely no matter how many goals have been achieved. Some personnel have been extended beyond a year! Management will tell you whatever to keep you on through the temp agency as long as possible.
good,"No reviews or advancement unless you are just chosen or you have spoken up. No raises unless you are working (as they call it) a different task, not a different position."
good,"I worked in the DFW West division as a builder.  Great benefits.  Decent pay.  No training whatsoever other than watching someone else work.  If they do it incorrectly then you learn how NOT to do something.....but you don't realize that until management writes you up for poor job performance.  If you like to be managed by fear and intimidation, then this is the perfect job for you.  If your last name is Horton, then this is the perfect job for you.  Finally, if you enjoy being a ""yes"" man and kissing the rear end of your manager even if you know they are wrong about something, then this is the job for you.  I loved what I did and enjoyed my co-workers, it's a shame the management is so difficult and belittling."
good,"I learned a lot from this company that I can carry with me through life and I am thankful for that."
good,"I enjoyed the fast paced work and heavy work load. There was little to no down time.  I work best multi-tasking and this position provided that.  However, there was internal discord with employees and a high turn over rate.  That made it difficult to settle into the position."
good,"I am grateful to this company for giving me a start in being able to prove my capability to work for and build for a national construction company.  However, I found them to be cut throat in about every other way."
good,"I was hired to work on the new system which was due out when I started, Encompass, instead they never rolled out that system, I struggled bc there were two managers and one never knew what the other was doing. As a result, my files suffered, I couldn't get help and I was let go, It wasn't a bad place to work but I wasn't given the opportunity I deserved. I tried reaching out about the issue but no one would listen. I eventually lost my job due to poor management. I was forced to work on a file that was cancelled. I wasn't given the opportunity to improved and they grade your files through the system and most of the time its was a glitch so you couldn't change your score."
good,"It's still ""old"" school in some of it's policy & procedures. Little 2 no rm. 4 advancing and mngmt can and will hold you back & they only focus on how NOT to give u a Raise."
good,This is a male dominated industry. Not really room or flexibility to grow within this company. Most position we should be aloud to work from home. Overall okay company.
good,"No room for advancement.  It is who you know not what you know.  The environment is friendly depending on the location of your office.  Also, this can be detrimental to your self confridence"
good,"Sales department is out of control, Sales try's to dictate and rule over Construction.If the sales agents do not get there way they will try set up construction managers with lies to have them fired."
good,"Prepared to meet and greet new prospect buyers and show properties. Handed out information regarding new community."
good,"Great coworkers but poorly guided management, hire and fire, sink or swim with no training, good homes but management lacks direction. Working every weekend isn't healthy"
good,The stress level would send anyone packing. The insane hours and requirements are enough for 2 people. Dealing with 5 or more bosses at the same time was too much!
good,"Most people within DRH are laid back and great people and great to work with."
good,I have more than enough experience to run a good residential housing tract. Unfortunately the processes they have put in place to achieve a well built home takes up so much time and effort I am more concerned about the processes than the home.
good,Work with home owners to fix issues with in the new home for the first year of buying the new DR Horton home. Calling back venders to correct issues and seeing the jobs were done correctly.
good,Working at DR Horton was not the best experience.  Management is sometimes willing to help but sometimes they can actually hurt your business.  I cannot recommend working here.
good,"Family life, quality of construction, and customer satisfaction do not matter much anymore. Management choices are poor and the love of money and power have taken over. Should be as responsive to buyers as they are shareholders."
good,"Women there are very ghetto and confrontational. A place towork until you find a better option. The manager screams and yells at everyone, without asking verifying questions, then says things to belittle you. She's totally unprofessional. The customer service representatives are rude to the customers constantly."
good,Little value for employees.  Rush to build.  Customer satisfaction is not a priority for upper management.  Bottom line is the only driver for management.
good,Multi tasking is a required skill to work for DR Horton. Multiple projects and unrealistic due dates. Trying to keep up with plan changes and subdivision specifications is the biggest problem running the purchasing department.
good,"There great people who work here and I enjoyed meeting each and everyone of them.  I just need a job with more benefits. Also feel like I am not being used to my full capacity, I"
good,"Demanding work, bad work environment liked the work but management showed favoritism.  The company needs to look at turn over and why it is occurring in certain areas and take steps to improve the work environment,  I felt when I spoke out that if I didn't agree with their way then take the highway.  Corporate management needs to review the workers and find out where the problems are."
good,"Starting salary and benefits were very good, but there is a lot of pressure to perform with little support to succeed. "
good,Typical day at work was a 12 hr day 7 days a week. Large workload closing loans in ten day time period a must.
good,"Very stressful, highly competitive, same people sent to neighborhoods that sell well then praised for selling out neigh orhoods that sell themselves. You have no influence which neigh orhood you are sent to. You are expected to produce regardless of the neigh orhoods issues ie, competition down the street sells homes for thousands less. Management tries but is stretched thinly"
good,I worked in the accounting department for approximately 2 years I really enjoyed my job. At times is seen to take a toll on my health my mental statement.
good,"This company gave me the opportunity to advance my career by teaching me numerous skills in residential production building. Every division has its faults and has room for improvement. Politics always play a huge part in a large company like this, unfortunately. Immediate management plays a large role in every experience at any company. They play an important part in these experiences."
good,"so many flaws from my past experiences and no one willing to allow me to fix them,"
good,"A day at work in the office is stressful because management is unpredictable with the amount of house project they want to release, and they constantly change their minds on the kind of homes they want to build. So in the Purchasing department it causes a lot of stress."
good,"One coworker described the workplace as a ""dysfunctional family"" which is fairly accurate. I would say overall I enjoyed my time working there- I learned a lot and was given opportunities to advance in the company, but it took a lot of time. I feel the division is going through some growing pains and could use a better Human Resource department and some more management training."
good,"National company with longevity, but management turnover in my area.  Learned new programs and procedure and marketing strategies. I enjoy helping with the American dream of homeownership."
good,"Unreasonable expectations with contractors and schedules provided."
good,"I enjoyed working for DR Horton, I found my job enjoyable as well as stressful at times. I was downsized due to budget cuts in our division"
good,Sold new homes.  Learned about city regulations.  Reviewed other home builders products.
good,"Arrive at the building site and do a drive by at your houses that are under construction, then to the trailer to check the production schedule."
good,There's a lot of give and take here and its basically of supportive the stereotypical construction culture. Benefits are good but you may be expected to do things way outside of your job description (not an issue for some people).
good,In the beginning the company was about helping develop employees so they could have a good morale and deliver excellent service to buyers but that changed over time. Everything and everyone just started becoming a number.
good,"I thought that such a large company would be progressive and forward thinking."
good,Working at D.R Horton had its ups and down.  My division had poor management and the entire construction department had a full turnover after a year and a half.  Too many houses for each superintendent and closings were pushed through on houses that were not 100% complete. Lots of unhappy customers.
good,"I learned a lot working here, but there is no room for growth. There is changes about every other week. You are continuously busy so the day goes by fast. Lack of leadership other than my manager she is pretty cool. Workplace culture is relaxed and cut throat at the same time. Hardest part of the job is keeping up with all the changes. Enjoyable part of the job is lunch."
good,I had the opportunity to learn a lot and train others. It was very busy at times and slow periodically.  The people were nice and management was hands off.
good,"If you're looking for a ""Quick Move-In"" this builder may be for you, however; you have little if any choice in interior features and home site locations. If you're just starting your home search and prefer more flexibility in interior selections you may want to consider looking at other local, regional or national builders in DE."
good,"I worked for DR Horton for over 3 years.  I enjoyed my time there for the most part.  They had a division picnic every year which included a softball tournament with only people that worked in the division.  I was fortunate to have won several monthly, and every 6 months."
good,"Starts off very early in the morning. Started off cleaning around our work area then moved onto actually doing the construction after a few weeks of learning. The hours are long and the pay is very poor for the work that we do in the hot sun. I'm thankful for my friend Luis getting me the job but I need better for my family, and for myself."
good,"I loved meeting people who were purchasing their first home. My typical day was arriving early to open up our model homes and make sure that everything was pristine. "
good,DRHorton is a company that allows for the agent to maximize their income earnings.  The agent is allowed to work in an environment where they develop their own skills to establish working relationships with other realtors and brokers outside of the company.
good,Great starter company to work for to learn the ropes of construction. Enjoyed my time there and the management team are always looking to please the customer.
good,"D R Horton Inc. is a great company to work for anywhere but in this division. As the company expanded, they did not hire enough field representatives to handle the customers. When I separated from D R Horton, I was responsible for over 10 active subdivisions with no gas allowance.This was a 3 hour round trip drive with over 300 active request for repair."
good,Did not work there long enough to critique company.  Large company that merged a lot of smaller companies and dissolved the division that I had worked for at that time.
good,"This company is an average company to work for. Driven only by profit and did not put customer service as a priority for the new home owners. Good people worked for the company, but the corporate mission was driven only by quantity and profit."
good,"I worked there for over ten years in both sales and management the market was both good and bad, I liked working for the older management team but not the current team."
good,"Overall, seems like a great company to work for. Majority of the people are great.  There are a couple employees that do the bare minimum that bring the overall morale down. Management seems to be aware but doesn't do anything to remedy the issue."
good,"very fast paced, always plenty of work. Department understaffed and very dynamic. Areas of responsibility would change monthly, and management trying to change culture"
good,"Good place to work at good work environment, I do recommend this job to others. "
good,I have not worked for this company for over 10 years now and would not be able to give a review of their current work place culture or any information regarding them now.
good,"Good short term experience, the people there are not to die for. The management there is not good, and the people in charge play favorites and are not fair to others under them."
good,"The company needs to take a step back and see how it can take its current reactionary business model, and flip it to be more proactive. On top of that, hold your sales professionals accountable for the way they conduct their business. Stop having the back office staff clean up their mess. This in turn pulls them away from their productivity, thus putting them behind the 8 ball at the end of every month/quarter. I could go on and on, but the fact of the matter is it will never change unless it's a directive from the top. I love the people that work here and it is truly a family atmosphere. However, sales needs a swift kick in the tail and held accountable for their mindless decision making."
good,Enjoyed the people I worked with. Management was very inconsistent in the way my job title was supervised. The hardest part of the job was receiving help when you really needed it. Learned a lot about the home building process.
good,Great company to work for had a lot of fun here. Most all the foremen were good and taught me a lot. Would work for them again.
good,You will know if you belong.  Their is a specific type that will fit in.  Hard working and strict to stick to the rules.  Most were wary of recent lay offs before I got there.  Made everyone on edge and anxious.
good,"This is a challenging position in which my responsibilities extend beyond sales.  I'm responsible for writing contracts, choosing the right lender/loan product for the buyer, ensuring the buyer turns in all relevant mortgage documents on schedule, running construction meetings, ensuring the project is always in its best professional appearance and coordinating closings with the title company."
good,"Supervise construction of up to 50-75 homes at a time all at various stages of completion."
good,"•	Layout, designed, wrote and coordinated advertising for/with various media channels."
good,"Opening model homes and making sere them were ready to show, contact customers and agent of specials, write contracts, Follow up on contracts. close contracts."
good,Performance based bonuses were high while the economy was good. The reason I left was because they were shutting down the Sacramento division offices.
good,"Good company but very bad management and made things very stressful. Was given duties that didn't belong to me and expected 100%. Mistakes were tolerated but only for a certain amount of time. Got barked at for not staying late. "
good,"Base plus commission position. Low base pay and commission didn't start for approximately 6 months or more. I ran a design center for another builder prior to this position  for about 7 years. Commissions were paid much more timely. I asked to transfer to another position within the company that was salary, but I was not there long enough. It was rewarding to help customers design their dream homes."
good,"Ok place to work.  Casual working environment with casual office dress.  High turnover on superintendents, office staff. & managers."
good,D.R. Horton provided a steady job and income. Located wihin a reasonable distance driving from home. Provides company shirts. A company commputer and phone provided.
good,"I Worked for DR Horton the East division. This location ran more like a mom and pop shop. There was no real growth here, unless you were a favorite and were handed a higher position."
good,i worked in the mid-rise condo construction area. being a site supervisor there is very minimal supervision and a great deal of scheduling and knowledge to consume. if the market turns around take a look at this company to make a strong come back
good,"Most managers are great, but there is a chance to receive a bad manager that makes it difficult to work. Most days are started with paperwork and reviewing houses. The rest of the time there will be issues with houses that need to be fixed, parking management, scheduling trades, writing purchase orders, picking up trash, helping/doing closings, and customer service for houses that have already closed. The bulk of the stress will come from trades not showing up and the customers misunderstanding the house is a production home, so it will not be perfect. Customers ruin the experience."
good,typical day was hectic I came in when the market really ramped up but the bonus  money we were making was worth it. they did cool things like awards shows to recognize individual achievement.
good,"Growth is very hard to obtain here.  Sometimes competent internal employees are overlooked.  Also, the company does not do enough to increase employee morale. More concern regarding upper management."
good,Great place to work with a somewhat laid back attitude. Great benefits and not very much micro managing however the pay if not what was promised or expected.
good,"The Capital Division has one of the best sales team that I have worked with. The sales people are great to work with, and we keep each other going thru the tough times."
good,Large builder where you can be put on the fast track to management with hard work and dedication
good,I had a great experience with DR Horton. I learned to manage three different subdivisions and 500 subs at one time!. I built 40  houses at a time and 90 homes in one year! I did a lot of online scheduling for all my projects. I met with clients daily and help finish punch list items so the new homeowners could move in and enjoy there new home. I helped estimate new jobs and assisted real estate agents. The experience was this company was great on how to be pro active in a fast pace business.
good,"I absolutely love the managers at DR Horton. However, I was in an office away from everyone and just doing scheduling.  It was not enough for me. I found another job."
good,D.R. Horton came to Cincinnati with a package that was going to blow the doors off of every Drees home! The only problem they refused to hire quality subcontractors and refused to accept the fact that new home buyers wanted the better home with the Drees attention to detail and follow up. Poor local management and inability to adapt to local needs and desires of the buyer doomed D.R. Horton in Cincinnati. It was a huge blow to our local market!
good,"Productive, fun, fast-paced place, with a wide variety of products."
good,"The worst part is the incompetence of the area sales manager, maybe because she is ""overworked"". "
good,"Ok Job, good commission structure. Work life balance not the greatest, time off is not encouraged. Management not concerned with growing the employees."
good,Typical started with maintaining your work environment inside and out as we were selling homes from a model home. Most days ended later than the 6:00 o'clock scheduled time. Most enjoyable was helping first time home buyers with their purchase. The hardest part of the job was working every single weekend without a pause.
good,"new home builder, payables include utilities, construction and land development po's, utility bills, process check runs twice a week, process building permits, zoning checks, payables up to and over 3 million dollars"
good,"Great company and benefits but mega stressful. Good systems, but non-stop and no breaks causes burn out."
good,"Job is very busy, not much room for advancement, no job reviews or pay increases, manager claims that they do not believe in annual reviews."
good,"Very busy schedule, good benefits and bonus program, great people (for the most part). Not always given the necessary tools to receive a common goal, or with the urgency needed. They produce a good comparable product against other large builders .... overall, very good company !!"
good,A great but very challenging place to work. It's not for everyone but if you want to help build homes for future people looking to have positive and rewarding inpact on other's lives then its for you.
good,Things progress based on who is liked or not liked.  Pressured selling tactics.  Management has no respect for the employees that work hard for them. Not good
good,The last two manger over the division have been abysmal. They each tried but ultimately I found them to be over their heads.The purchasing department was the largest issue there and for some reason the manger couldn't seem to remedy the issue. The problems in the purchasing department ultimately caused issues for construction by not having the proper materials available and for sales because we had to stop offering as many options to our buyers to make life easier on the purchasing department which discouraged buyers.
good,"Engaging environment that has helped me grow professionally. Culture of company is great and co workers are amazing. Everyone I worked with was willing to help and very friendly. The company culture is wonderful, the employees generally seem happy to be working there! I think the energy of the environment drove everyone to do their best, at least for me it did! I learned how to work and prioritze multiple tasks at a time. I also was able to improve my research and presentation skills."
good,The children were awesomely unique.  They were very intelligent and hard working children.  The counselors were awesome as well and really understood what kids were going through.
good,"Largest Home Builder in the U.S. Builds affordable homes.  The HQ is located in Ft. Worth, Texas.  Most of the interaction with the corporation is via phone.  The company's management does not reflect the diversity of the population and the homebuyers.  There appears to be few if any African Americans in upper level management or as Sales Consultants positions although there were some Asians and Hispanics."
good,"Very busy company but also very fun."
good,"Very busy days, all departments have to offer help to one another. Systems are easy to learn."
good,Highly skilled professionals well trained in the art of aquiring and making the best use of fresh ideas
good,Great people and good challenges to help you grow/develop in home building/development.
good,I enjoyed learning about the duties of in-house counsel at this internship.
good,Long hours but rewarding work. Audited their A/P and found many double payments which were collected. Worked on their payroll system.
good,overall great place to work .. Market hurt the company but a great place and compnay to work for.
good,"Manage day to day operations, marketing & Sales. demonstrate model home and all inventory homes in new home connuity potential buyers."
good,"This was the first place I worked once I located to Texas from California. I thoroughly enjoyed my tenure at D.R. Horton. I enjoyed my co-workers and ""most"" of the management team."
good,"Great company to work for. My review for D R Horton is 5 Stars. Its just the industry itself and the nature of selling homes on site. Long hours by yourself, no weekends off, limited vacation time. But the compensation is incredible."
good,"Since it is a publicly traded company, performance is everything. However the stress of working with home buyers in a market where the sub contractors are sub par is very difficult. The job itself is not complicated. Dealing with the stress is a whole different story. This company is not for the thin skinned. You will be yelled at and cussed out over the smallest stuff. The culture however is great. The team and co workers you are with will have your back."
good,"Honestly not a bad place to work. Decent pay, above average benefits, good managers (where I was). But the whole place is inundated with this constant feeling of fear from the majority of employees."
good,Juggling all responsibilities put upon you and carrying other peoples load also. Training was very minimal. Left on your own to navigate information for your position.
good,loved the people i worked with but demanded what was not possible. you cant hold the subs accountable because the corperate would side with them
good,Typical day to day is boring but at least you are getting a pay check. I think that I enjoy working her because I can come and go as I please.
good,Typical day at work is dealing in customer service helping customers with their warranty issues regarding their new home/condo purchased.  Co-workers are friendly and get along well and willing to help out one another.  Hardest part of job is dealing with customers who are upset and angry regarding repairs on the newly purchased home/condo that have not been fixed or has lengthy repair time.  Enjoyable part of this job is that everyone is a team player and can count on co-workers to help out as needed.
good,"Average of employees has worked there 15+ years.  Family-oriented environment that fosters training, support and stability. Small company with strong values and pride."
good,"Write the schedule, manage 20-150 people, read blue prints, customer service, final walk thru's"
good,"A typical work day for me at D.R. Horton consisted of planning, scheduling, and managing marketing campaigns for our new home communities."
good,Despite being a national leader in home building each region of DR Horton operates with a degree of autonomy thus allowing the regions to operate on a local level to meet local demands. The teams are professionals and act as such. A big focus is customer satisfaction and tight cost control.
good,"I, unfortunately, worked for a newer branch that could never seem to get organized since the corporate office was located in another city. The vendors tended to have outdated P.O.s so mistakes happened often and building took too long for most clients to wait out the process. I'm sure this has improved since they have grown more in this area recently. Pay was decent, but weekend work was required."
good,"Good company to work for in Metro Atlanta, their marketing department and management team gives you the necessary tools to be successful. Neighborhoods always had spec homes to sell, therefore you're not waiting 6-9 mos for a spec home to sell."
good,"First experience working in a corporate environment."
good,"Good solid company to work for.  Not for everyone.  Need to be efficiently, organized, and productive - and you will succeed and be rewarded for your results."
good,It was a good place to work.it is big company so if you are not at the top you are not going to get the notice you want. they have good benefits and 401k.
good,Small office where staff is real close. Business Casual M-Th and causal Fridays. The work flows with the market. The more homes and communities in the pipeline the busier you are and vice versa. Management is real understanding when days off are needed or any emergencies happen. Work-Life balance is great.
good,Great company - leader in the new home construction business. Relaxed work environment with growth opportunities. Coworkers and managers have the same goals and are very driven.
good,"need better leadership in the field, superintendents need more power to make decisions based on day to day operations with regard to sub-contractors and better vendor lists for work"
good,I thoroughly enjoyed my time with DR Horton. I had a excellent Management Team and great coworkers. I came into this position without any prior project management experience. During my time there I learned to manage the construction of multiple homes in a timely and efficient manor. It was a very stressful job with lots of problem solving. However that was something that made it that much more interesting and fun. In the end i was moved to a different division of the company which was not a good for me.
good,Good company to work for. Cannot list any other comments. Typical superintendent position. Review work of sub-contractors and working with the City of Killeen
good,A company with excellent benefits and a great structured system for production building.
good,"Great place to work, employees work closely with each other to maximize the efforts to complete the job as a collective effort. The company does an exceptional job at taking care of their clients."
good,Long hours but worth it. Great people to work with. Management does its best to keep you close to home. Occasional free lunches and team building exercises.
good,"You typical day at work, come in run your report and  work from oldest to newest dates from the uploaded work. you have a 48 hour turn around time to process work."
good,"Overall a great company to work for.  Lack of training program is an issue, however, if you are persistent you will get help with processes and procedures."
good,"Overall, DR Horton is a great company. "
good,"- I had to manage a lot of projects at one time. I really had to learn how to multi task and know how to deal with different personalities."
good,they did not have to the sub base for the amount of homes they wanted completed at any given time
good,Enjoyed working for the company. Very upset when the company had to downsize due to crash of market.
good,I was on a sales team that was required to make calls to individuals who previously  visited new communities and did not purchase. My job was to get said individuals to come back out and purchase. If need be I offered incentives to that individual. I absolutely loved this position and my team leader. DR was a fantastic company to work for in Las Vegas. I moved to the East Coast and left the position unfortunately. This was my favorite job of all time. I always made my goals and was the top sales associate because of the support and teamwork.
good,"Worked there for 9 years in various positions until my last position was eliminated."
good,"D.R. Horton was a great company to start out at straight out of college. They helped mold me into the professional I am now. There are definitely "
good,Awesome work culture. They take the time to train you and make you feel at home. I truly enjoyed my time there and the company had a great training program.
good,"The managers are grate keep you involved in all discussions, work with you train you and help you to advance your career sales and construction work together"
good,I had a great opportunity for advancement. My first boss there really supported me and wanted to see me succeed and mentored me. I am actually still friends with her and often use her a reference. Homebuilding is an up and down industry to watch out for lay-offs through time.
good,Busy office. Corporate atmosphere but fun to work for. The President and Vice President were good people. The company provides many incentives and rewards their employees.
good,DR Horton provides a good that everyone needs.  Working for a company that provides home and hearth type products is rewarding.  The challenges of construction accounting are worth taking.
good,"Great company to work for. Very professional. Sales persons not getting paid, only by commission. You don't sale you don't get paid. Need to attend weakly meetings and needed to drive about 70miles from our office to theirs in another city and they wont pay you for gas."
good,"The work isn't hard but it comes in large swells, and can be a little overwhelming at times. The people are generally really grate to work with. At the time of my employment there was a merge in the company, and there wasn't enough people there to do the job. But know they were in the process of fixing the issue."
good,Good company to work for and they have many employee activities to help all employees get to know one another. Great upper management.
good,"A typical day? Showing up on site opened doors, Dealt with construction workers of lofts to coordinate home inspections, dealt with closings, hoa, clients questions and much more."
good,"Managing Construction processes to consist of scheduling inspection, Deliveries of materials, Homeowner orientations and Customer service "
good,I would come in the office and ask my boss what he wanted done and he would expect it done before he left. I learned to work in a fast paced environment and how to manage my time. The hardest part of my job was getting it all done in time. The most enjoyable part was getting everything for my boss.
good,DR Horton is a great man to work for and I recommend it highly to hard working individuals. If you don't like to work 50 hours a week then this is not the place for you.
good,This was another job that can't be done until you are a very detailed person. This is a 12 to 14 hour a day job so you'll need to be dedicated to it to be successful.
good,"Lot of work, but some of the manager were not up to par.  City manager was not capable of performing all the task he was supposed to.  Had a very quick temper.  Was a womanizer."
good,"I learned so much during my time at D.R. Horton. I feel blessed to have worked with the people I did. It was dynamic, fast paced and you constantly had to multi-task and prioritize."
good,"I have known the Horton family for many years, and they build a good home. Management was good, company culture was good, and products used in the construction of the homes was good."
good,Work is doing whatever cleanup is needed around the job sites. Sweeping is very typical. Outside in the weather a lot. Very flexible with schedules. Management was great.
good,Very good company to work for.  Advancement options were plenty or an employee could just stay in the same job - no pressure.  Lots of incentives for management and owner really cared about the quality of the product.
good,I enjoyed working for this company.  They had good people working for them that were willing to train new people..  Enjoyed showing buyers the beautiful new homes.
good,"Good office to work in. Team culture. Committed to providing outstanding service. I would recommend working with this company. Overall, it is an excellent company to work for with managers that are approachable and understanding."
good,I was support staff in the Sales and Escrow department.  I learned a vast amount of information pertaining directly to the companies procedures on processing sales and the facilitation of the closings of these sales.  The management is intense in their pursuit of excellence and growth of the company.  Coworkers seem well placed in their positions and enjoy their jobs.  The hardest part of the position was the lack of interpersonal interactions I'm used to in previous jobs.  The most enjoyable part of the job was learning from the best!
good,It's a well oiled machine in productivity. You work hard to be rewarded with more hard work. Which is great if your a workaholic.
good,At D.R. Horton you have the freedom to work the projects how you see fit.  This freedom allows for you as an employee to set your schedule to best meet your outcomes.
good,Great environment to work and grow in. Lots of room for learning about the industry and getting promoted to many different departments. Cross-training happens on a daily basis.
good,"I will always speak well of this job. They pile on the work and let you have at it. Whether it be because they want you to sink or swim, or they just don't have the time to train, you're forced to teach yourself a lot and in a short period of time. I will forever be grateful for that. I learned so much!!"
good,ran construction management company providing general contracting services and providing construction expert services
good,"Very exciting company to work for. Very competitive pay. If the housing market didn't crash, I would be still here."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was being a part of someone's dream home being built.
good,"Great company with great benefits.  They pay salary plus bonus getting started in a Jr. Sales Rep position (or at least they did while I was employed) Overall, I recommend working at D.R. Horton."
good,"Maintained relationship with all vendors and accounting department.  Created, revised and updated all residential contracts and purchase order for jobs.  Initiated start-up billing for all model homes' utility services.  The hardest part of the job was the fast-paced environment.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the feeling of accomplishment when finishing tasks."
good,"I learned a lot from D.R. Horton, and thoroughly enjoyed my time there. The team in the office is friendly, and very helpful when dealing with issues collaboratively. Benefits are great, and the management team is wonderful, and understanding. Career advancement is a little stagnant, but the best are duly compensated for their work."
good,a fun place to work with good fellowship among departments but the cut throat finger pointing of different departments left a void in the total experience being enjoyable
good,"Procure new home buyers"
good,"Great place to work, love the management. love the opportunities and the growth."
good,It was a great experience working for the number builder in the USA for 12 years and going. They are the best hands down. I have worked for them twice in Arizona and Oklahoma
good,I built townhomes for D R Horton. Several different subdivisions .The jobs were fast paced and ran very well. I enjoyed the company and the people while I was there
good,D R Horton was a good place to work. There was a lot of teamwork between superintendents. When someone needed extra help everyone stepped up to help and it was reciprocated.
good,Enjoyed working for this company and miss working there.  I was hired as a Assistant PM and was promoted to PM.  There was a bit of turn-around in the higher management dept. but all and all it was a great company to work for along with the co-workers.
good,"I was in charge of a multi-million dollar new home development.  There is quite a lot of responsibility in managing schedules, selling new homes, coordination with construction, customer service, mortgage lender, title company, design center."
good,"I enjoy working here and the company is great, but I am looking for better opportunities for my MBA specialty, I would definitely work for them again."
good,"Phones, phones, phones. Many calls daily, corresponding to contract modification requests from attorneys, Working with other departments on problems with each customer's file (if any), working closely with the closing department and the accounting department to verify that all documents relating to the home were accurate AND present. Handling customer complaints with errors that occasionally occurred during the building process. Acting as mediator between the sales personnel and the construction superintendents."
good,"All-around a good company to work for. Job responsibilities and pay are commensurate. My manager was very communicative in terms of expectations, goals, vision, etc"
good,"Managed 13 superintendents and 18 job sites as Area Manager when Emerald division opened they moved me into a Superintendent position to build custom homes from $800k t0 $1.9 million ,enjoyed the job very much."
good,"This company taught you how to work fast and smart. They are a high production company so making sure the job it done correctly, the first time, is essential."
good,Largest builder in the US for many years. They have lots of communities selling at the same time while they work on future locations. They try to get you to work at a location close to home if possible.
good,"good work environment, good leadership, well built homes, must be self driven and good with outreach follow up and sales, commission based no salary, .."
good,Great place to work prior to the housing crash.  housing market is up and down so the income for sales people varies as well

good,I enjoyed meeting potential homeowners and finding the needs of their family and matching a home that fits their needs.  We were able to customize the colors of their home that made their home feel unique and special to them.
good,"you work 7 days a week, every weekend and every holiday. 12 hour days. they don't care if you are doing a sale at midnight and have to dive for a hour to get home. get the sale and get the check. your safety means nothing to them. the turn over in this company is huge. some how they manage to build a good house that's good quality."
good,Customer support for software problems with application system recommendations for software improvements. 3rd party correspondence for scheduling for housing development. Project support for time and schedule.
good,Awesome opportunity to be a blessing to others
good,Was an excellent experience stepping out of College. D.R. Horton Worked great with my schedule and family life. There were a lot of extra opportunities and events within the company. Very Hard to advance as management seems very set in there own ways. Very limited design opportunities. All in all The company has decent benefits and can understand Human beings and that sometimes things happen in life like family!!!
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is working with the users in the field and solving their issues they are having. I like working with the reports and queries within PeopleSoft solving and correcting problems before issues arise for the user's.
good,"D.R. Horton Homes builds a very nice home.  I worked for them In Tucson, Arizona as an independent contractor and as an employee.  I really enjoyed my employment with them."
good,I love working with the clients. Nothing better than helping make your clients dreams come true through home ownership. The only downside is the management team.
good,"Great company to work for, just not for me. Very fast-paced and high-volume. There is a lot of work that goes into each home, and it is very difficult to maintain quality and production on over thirty homes at once and keep up with all the extra paperwork and honestly complete the required checklists on every home."
good,"Every morning is started by getting the office ready for patients and making it  a comfortable environment.  its like working with a family here and we are always happy, even on bad days you couldn't tell. We love each and every patient that comes in. We make sure to take time to know what their troubled areas are to make sure they leave happy. "
good,it was a pleasure and great experience working with DR Horton despite no room for advancement or transfer to another region after working as a top sales agent for 10 years
good,company is good to work for. Offers excellent benefits and compensation. Offices are centrally located. Quarterly bonuses are dispersed. Family friendly work place.
good,"Worked on a multi-family units, did buyer oreintations and was buffer between owner and contractors"
good,I learned a lot from Horton. I loved working there. Wished it could have been longer but still a very good company to work for. They treated employees like people that had lives outside of just work.
good,Absolutely loved my job! My managers were awesome and understanding. Really encouraged my growth and curiosity. I will always be grateful for this position and everything I learned from it. There are a lot of very intelligent people and I really learned alot from my coworkers.
good,"Good place to work, they like to promote from within, quartely bonus.  Management is good however sometimes too lax when it comes to poor employees and can appear bias"
good,"Good people to work with, the CEO is a great person. The atmosphere can be laid back and they are not strict to manage you. I've overall enjoyed my experience."
good,"Calling clients that had made offers on builders homes"
good,"It was a great company to work for. They are definitely willing to hire recent college graduates. My position was great at the beginning and the pay was adequate. However, they may ask certain employees to cross train in other departments where help is needed and most likely won't get an increase in pay. The managers are nice to work with and are more than willing to help you."
good,Great job great knowledgable people willing to teach and mentor young people just starting out careers I feel very fortunate and furthermore proud to say I have had the opportunity to work for the D.R. hoton family

good,Dr Horton is good place to work. It is the largest builder in the country and you need to be very focused to succeed. Meetings are reasonable and not much training was offered except occasionally.
good,Was a great company and place to work.  The San Marcos division was the best with family friendly staff who always considered to be a part of something.
good,Great culture at DR Horton.  Loved meeting the owner and CEO.  DR Horton knows what they do and they do it well.  Top quality manager and co-workers all around.
good,good company to work for
good,I enjoyed the time and experienced I receive. It is mundane but a great way to step into the corporate world. I was not expecting anything overly awesome or fun.
good,"Repetitive training process is effective but you can get unsensitive to the process, It would be more effective if other trainers could be brought in for a change of pace."
good,"Open Models and office follow up with clients "
good,Arrive at 7 am meet new home owners go over all warranty information. Walk them through the house taking note of all h/o concerns and show them how everything works some days 10 homes a day then contact the sub contractors and schedual all repairs and fix minor things myself. Also aid h/o with anything that should happen within there warranty period
good,i was somewhat of an intern and was treated like a full time permeant employee. The department was very structured and organized.
good,Worked with homeowners and subcontractors building new homes. Was extremely busy all day.Dealing with new home buyers was hard at times.
good,"Performed the new homeowner orientations and the follow-up warranty claims; scheduling appointments between the homeowner and vendor/ sub-contractor.  I learned all about the aspects of a home (i.e. framing, foundation, LEED certification, utilities, plumbing, landscaping, painting, cabinetry, appliances, counter tops, HVAC, etc.).  The management team was stellar!  They were always supportive and provided guidance when needed. The most enjoyable part of my job was the ability to be a part of ""The American Dream"" for my customer, owning a home.  It was my pleasure to help a homeowner learn about their new place and be excited with them."
good,As a contract adminisitrator I was always striving for knowledge.  On the job experience was great and necessary for me to continue with my growth with the company.  As in Western Pacific Housing I was an accounting assistant and felt I was learning different ways to pay bills through the JDEdwards system we used.
good,There was a quota to meet but you were not penalized if you did not meet it.  But the goal is to over exceed the quota. There are bonuses. Everyone is super nice and would help if needed.
good,It is hard to find a division of a large national builder where employees who sell are treated with respect and their work/life balance is important to the employer. I found this to be the situation at DR Horton as well as working in a very ethical climate. It starts with Mr. DR Horton and includes my division President and City Manager who care and are transparent when communicating.
good,"It was a very proffesioal place, fast paced for gwttin gthings done. All the employees were helpfull and kind. The managment was well done and organized. I enjoyed ecerything, the hard part was the 3am hours."
good,They offered me the best opportunity and I would never mind working with them again. At times it did get pretty difficult but for the most part it is construction after all
good,DR Horton is a leader in innovation in new home constructions offering the best product and neighborhood for the customers dollar. DR Horton strives to be the home for customers for life.
good,"As a sales associate at DR Horton, I was responsible for marketing and selling homes in my community. It was one of the best places for that to take place."
good,"I have been with DR Horton for over 12 years now and did leave for a couple other opportunities, but find myself back here. A great culture if you have self drive."
good,"D.R. Horton Portland Division is America's #1 Builder. It is an exciting, fast-paced company whose mission is building great homes. I've never worked for a company where there was no politics, there are no hidden agendas, The only focus is on building great homes. Everyone is very focused on their work but the moment you approach anyone, they are just as focused on you and your question. It is definitely a team environment with plenty of opportunities to work independently and prove yourself."
good,"You work 80% outdoors 20% indoors, overseeing the building of production homes, looking over the build of each home and insuring everyone is working cohesively. Talking to inspectors, and planning new inspection of home. You can learn how to build a home from the ground up. Its a high pressure and fast pace environment with lots of communication with management and field reports that are done on a daily bases. The hardest part of the Job is when you fail a building inspection, this can delay the building of the home. the Funnest part is when the home is build and you talk to the new home owner and walk there new home."
good,"Great staff to work with. great IT support willingness to help co workers. fast pace company and under dead lines all the time."
good,"I enjoy my time with DR Horton, my co-workers and clients. The most enjoyable part of the job was to see clients satisfied with the final product of their purchase."
good,"Workload is pretty heavy, but the staff treat each other like family with employee trips and lunches. All help each other to get deadlines met weekly."
good,"Typical day at work is answering 100+ emails, maintaining the delicate working balance between trades, supers, and office staff. I constantly brainstorm and problem solve with the field, learning from and communicating with each of my trades. Management is firm but fair. The Culture is one big family; humorous, festive, and fun. The hardest part of the job is the pressure to turn things around quickly, and more important, accurately. It is an amazing feeling when things go right, and people are happy and productive. Taking ownership over tasks, while daunting at times, is also reassuring, knowing that the harder (and smarter) I work, the outcome is entirely up to me. The most enjoyable part of my job is learning and growing with a steadfast company in a booming industry, that remains critical to our economy. I'm respected and appreciated. I enjoy finding solutions, milti-tasking, and seeing projects through to completion."
good,"I have worked for builders for almost 10 years and DR Horton is the best one I have worked for.  They are organized and fair, good to their employees, build a great product, and stand my their warranty.  Management is great too.  They leave you alone for the most part and let you sell homes."
good,"Arrive at 6:00 am. An hour an a half before required and walk houses. Adjust schedule on houses, contact subcontractors with schedule and issues. Meet with sales associates about any concerns, upcoming closings, schedule walk thrus, address homeowner issues. I learned that I wanted to be the best. Whatever it took. I never wanyed any other builder to come in my subdivision and say he did this wrong or look at that. I thrived on making things happen and getting the job done when others said it could not be done. I succeded because I knew that I was only as good as those who worked for me. They must be treated as I would want to be treated. Communicate the job that is expected of them and what I am responsible for to make that possible,  respect and consider any concerns they may have, appreciate and acknowledge their skill and pride in their trade, and exemplify these things by setting an example. Hardest part was not beinging able to garuantee compensation for subcontractors that did extra work for me when I needed it. I loved the pressure, the more pressure the better I did. The challange of trying to anticipate what could go wrong and prevent it from happening ; knowing something will not be anticipated and being able to overcome the issue because you have the support and loyalty  of those who work for you."
good,Great place to work. The management is very hands on. The salary and raises is on par with the industry. I would recommend this company to anyone who is looking for a career path. DHI offers an environment where success is encouraged and provided.
good,The culture at DR Horton is very positive. The manager are always available to help early morning or late at night they are always responsive. The strive for you to succeed.  The benefits are endless. Overall I will always recommend this company for anyone who wants to grow in the new construction area.
good,"My typical day at work was normal job duties.   I enjoyed my work there, but it was just so far from my home.   I happened to find something closer to home, or I would have stayed there."
good,I loved DR Horton.  I would have stayed forever but they moved to Corona which was too far from my home.  Great culture and environment.  Team Work was great as well
good,"Fantastic company to work for. Great people, great benefits, great pay. Thorough training. Excellent opportunities within the company. Just a fabulous place to work."

good,"D.R, Horrton is a fantastic organization.  From top-to-bottom, people care about helping the customer.  Each day was a new learning experience, and the freedom given to be entrprenurial was motivating."
good,D.R. Horton is a great company in which to work.  The experience I gained in working for this company was invaluable.  The structure and management of this company was top notch.  The appreciation by the company of its employees and the recognition of their work is stellar.  While working for this company I was given the opportunity to transition from an accounting clerk position to an accounting management position.  I was also given the opportunity for training in many areas in order to improve my management skills. The management team I had the privilege to work with gave a new meaning to teamwork. I learned so much while working at this company and had many opportunities for advancement and was allowed the freedom as a manager to improve and expand the structure of my department.  Working for D. R. Horton was one of the best experiences I have had in my working career.

good,"This was a great place to work. Every employee was treated with respect. There were team building events (picnics, lunches, grand openings)outside of the office. Benefits were good."
good,Community offices were spread all over the Austin metro area and outlying cities. Eventually I only spent about 10 hours a week in the office and the rest I was on the road headed to individual sites.
good,"I worked as a new home construction sales person. I loved selling to both the first time home buyer and seeing their excitement as well as the seasoned home buyer who was down sizing."
good,"A day in new construction home sales consist of caring for a community, reaching goals, following up with potential prospects, showing and closing sales. I have really gain a lot of knowledge on customer service as well as how to maintain a community. While gaining experience with new construction I have built a great business relationship with my partner in the community where we share equal responsibilities to make sure that our home sites are beyond standard. New construction can be challenging at times due to the rise and decline in the market, but it is worth it all to see the gratitude on the faces of the buyers as they clos on their future homes."
good,"In 2005, I was offered the position of a Jr. Sales Counselor in the Houston division. It was the best career choice I could have ever made! Over 7 years later, myself and many of my team members are blessed to be a part of this amazing company in the face of a thriving market!"
good,If you have a chance to work here take it  you will not regret it  i moved to another state and had to quit and i regret it everyday  i miss it so much

good,I wanted to be busy and I am very busy. I have been given the opportunity to learn and receive growth development. The turnover is very low. D R Horton is even getting better because of the change in management.
good,"Fluid, versatile and unlimited opportunities for the person who is a self starter & willing to apply initiative, diplomacy & inspiration.  There is no training, no formal development but the employees drawn & employed at DRH are all above average and seek the autonomy to succeed individually as well as a whole."

good,"Enjoyed going to work every day. Everyone from the division president on down was like family and still are. I learned how to do many roles with in the organization, managing, purchasing, billing, safety, and more. Going to work was like going to a family reunion with one goal in mind, customer satisfaction. The hardest part was not being able to make all the customers 100 percent happy 100 percent of the time. A difficult task with any company but a goal worth achieving. Knowing that at the end of the day my customers were smiling made me smile and got me off to a good start the next day."
