bad,The culture of Abercrombie is like middle school. You have to be pretty to work there and if you show up and do not look your best then your entire shift is you getting bullied. There was zero flexibility and if you tried your tasks following would be punishment tasks.
bad,The pay and risk is not worth the pay. You go home stressed every night unless it’s a slow day. Boosters threatened you on a daily basis and upper management don’t care
bad,"I learned a lot about customer service, register, sales, and working in retail. The hardest part of the job was the poor scheduling. The most enjoyable part was making long lasting friendships."
bad,"Although management was poor and very immature."
bad,Te ofrecen algo que no cumplen. Te Dan dos dias o 4 POR mes. Tienen 300 o mas estudiantes anotados y juegan con eso. A dar dos a 5 dias de trabajo al mes a cada uno. Realmente una verguenza
bad,"The store manager and assistant manager are unprofessional. To work there is depressing because of them. Probably the worst place I've ever worked in, the work is simple yet difficult because of them."
bad,"When it comes to Abercrombie and Fitch, it defiently isn't a job placement that I would recommend. Yo are not guaranteed hours, are overworked when you do have hours. One unisex bathroom that is also a supply room (rarely ever cleaned). There is no break rooms, typically a 6 hour shift gains you a 30 minute break, 8hour+ shifts you get 1hour. The microwave and mini fridge are places right by the bathroom door and also never cleaned. "
bad,the store manager was awful but i think she's gone so it might be better. i was constantly discredited by management. the employees never knew what was going on in the store until after it happened.
bad,"Wow, working here was so miserable and probably the worst place to work as a young adult seeking knowledge and independence. One girl and myself were the only ones of color at this location and were always given 4 hour shifts, and 5-6+ hour shifts were given to everyone else. Working here only gave me the ability to gas my car to get to and from work. Managers are so degrading and simply put, racist. They tell you to follow customers of color and stay nearby to keep a close eye. Don't you dare get sick or try to stay home in agonizing pain, managers will give you attitude over the phone. If you're not enrolled in college, you are forgotten because you're not working toward becoming an assistant manager. Shame on us right!"
bad,This is one of the most difficult jobs I’ve ever worked in my life. Certain days I wouldn’t be able to make it home because of my transportation routes they didn’t care at all their exact words were “we don’t care about that we just care about you getting here and working”. After I seen that they didn’t really care for their employees I quit on my own terms and just finished on with school.
bad,Would not recommend this company to anyone no respect managerment almost non existent have to di to many jobs cant depend on getting a 40 hour week had to go get modt of my filling your job covers half the weaveroom or more was told 8 looms but you run whatever have to continuously start looms wheone goes down you have to pick one up
bad,Just a job i took in college. Easy work and basically is customer service. However i would never work thier again. More like a college job or part time work.
bad,This culture is very passive aggressive and the company allows the leaders to pick and choose favorites. The favorites is usually picked by how well you can play corn hole.
bad,Honestly do not ever expect to make anything . All the managers schedule so low hours you might as well not even work there honestly. The discount isn’t even worth staying there because you don’t make enough money to spend .
bad,DON'T WORK HERE AT ALL. They are very size aware of who can work in there store. You have to have a certain look and it is very obvious what that look is. I felt extremely uncomfortable working here.
bad,The manager is horrible at doing everything and the management team is completely unprofessional. The manager doesn’t know what she wants and is very indecisive and mean.
bad,"Typlical day at work:"
bad,"No job security, it is very likely that you can be relieved in a day. And it can be done for any reason as the manager or lead doesn't like you. if you are fortunate enough you might get a good team but the management still sucks"
bad,The hours are bad and you only get a good amount of hours if the manager favors you. The store is usually dirty and in shambles and there isn't enough staff to cover the floor.  The higher-ups don't care for the growth and improvement of their employees and only care about numbers. Working here will only give you stress.
bad,"This placed sucked to work at, you had to call first to see if they needed you and it was usually a no.  I've gotten like 2 claims from them though.  Thanks!"
bad,"managers insulted their employees. Not enough time for lunch during breaks, They worked us like slaves. Kept all the minorities working in the back like a sweat shop while all the white employees were on the sales floor modeling"
bad,Home office initiatives were very strict and didn't take into account actual daily traffic coming into stores. Upper management support was non-existent. Recruiting requirements were ridiculous. Company doesn't seem to care about loss prevention.
bad,"this was the most stressful and fast paced job i’ve ever worked at. it was absolutely terrible. the pay is basically minimum wage, which is not even close to enough for the work load put on you. the customers are very rude and you’re there sometimes til 1 am helping doing what the managers should’ve done. management was always yelling at you while they did nothing to help. also you’re not guaranteed hours because it changed every week. one week you could work 5 days and the next 2 days. it was almost impossible for me to balance work and school with these ridiculous hours. the only reason i stayed so long was because of my friends that worked with me."
bad,Boring and not nice people that surrounded me. They were rude to the customers and not patient with them. Hard to watch. They didn’t care if they were working or not.
bad,Applying at Abercrombie is a set up. Don’t do it. Some of The managers there are unprofessional except for the general manager. They work you harder than they paying you. You basically become their slaves. No hours.
bad,The company didn't pay well and over worked associates. I didnt feel appreciated during my short time there. It did however help me learn valuable management skills.
bad,"This job only works if you are a teenager looking to work for part-time, sadly you need to be 18 or older where you are either out of High school or in collage so the pay isn't all that cut out to be if you need something to leave out of. This company only cares for their managers only and stays away from the brand reps."
bad,The worst place I ever worked. The looks at this place do matter if the company doesn't like the way you look they will be put to work in the back where no costumers can see you.
bad,There is absolutely no separation between work life and personal life with this company. They will call on your day off. Either to be called in or ask you a question that could have waited.
bad,Management plays favorites and does not treat all races fairly. They will terminate you from your position and not even tell you about it. They talk to you like you're beneath them.
bad,"A typical day was the same everyday. Most enjoyable part was making friends and getting along with people. Management was good until she was let go. Based on attitude, it was pretty good, but pay isn't good."
bad,"At minimum wage with little to no room for advancement, I wouldn't recommend working at A&F or any of it's sister companies. Generally speaking, every manager I've encountered has been pretty snobby and looks down on their employees, plays favorites, and is unwilling to work with you when there are issues pertaining to work of non-work related things (i.e. family or illness)."
bad,"Decent pay for a retail clothing store; however, most people there are shallow. You will be treated and judged on how you look. Avoid if possible. Discount is not great either."
bad,This isn't a job for someone to make a living out of. if this is your first job as a teenager then ok but if its for paying bill please do not waste your time
bad,I worked for about a month and a half. I did not get paid during the time and had to basically quit to get paid. Then the manager picked people to get more hours over the others.
bad,"If you are a frat boy, sorority girl would love working here. Working here is strictly based on looks. You want to get promoted you better be attractive and sleep with management."
bad,"Abercrombie and Fitch was my first job ever, I remember applying and going to the interview and getting the job. I was an employee there for 5 months and I only worked 4hrs within those 5 months I needed to find another job that would actually put me to work and allowed me to make money so i applied elsewhere and decided that this job was not going to put me to work or give me any more hours."
bad,"If you want to be blamed for things that you did not do or be belittled by co-workers, then this is the place for you. I would not suggest anyone work there unless you are a female and then you will be just fine."
bad,"This employer places so much importance on physical appearance and subjective characteristics such as attractiveness that it actually fosters a toxic environment. "
bad,overall my experience working for abercrombie was a big waste of time it seemed like management was just as fed up with working there and provided no motivation to it employees
bad,"I worked at Abercrombie for only one day, Black Friday, because they don't put you on the schedule. They expect you to call in and see if they need help before they begin putting you on the schedule. This doesn't make much sense to me because new employees need more time to learn the way of the job and that is not possible if they only schedule you once or never."
bad,This was the worse job I ever had. The company did not have any respect for their employees. Pay was below cost of living standards and there is no work/life balance.
bad,"I worked at a flagship store several years ago for the model position. I was offered free employment, didn't seek them out. Terrible environment , I hope things have changed."
bad,"If you want to be an associate, it's pretty simple and straight forward, you just do the tasks that you're given. Being in management is much different, and I will say that it depends on which location you work at and who your coworkers are. Hours aren't the best, the line between personal life and work life is nonexistent, and you're not always given a break even when you're supposed to have one. There's always a pressure to look and be dressed a certain way. There is a lot that could be said but again it depends on who is on the management team."
bad,"Poor hourly payment"
bad,"they were racist Company, had every black person working in the back. made everybody feel like slaves. hours were not properly given out. lunch breaks and mandatory break were never giving. not a company that was handed well."
bad,"They did give me the proper hours at all. I was employed there an entire summer and only worked about 3 days. That's not only illegal, but very inconvenient for me because I did not have a lot of money at the time."
bad,Abercrombie was a place where we were being managed by young kids who had no idea what was going on.  It was super laid back until you got written up for nothing at all.
bad,"Die Arbeit is okay, nicht schlecht bezahlt. Die Arbeit ist für mich aber langweilig und das Team is nicht so gut. Ich habe nicht gerne mit meine Managern gearbeitet."
bad,"While being a full time student and working here, this was one of my first jobs to work at. It was good to experience the retail for the first time at this store to get a sense of how retail world is like."
bad,This job was the slowest job I ever worked. There was little to no hours per week. Asked to get more hours but they needed to hire more employees for that which meant no hours for you again. Worst experience as an employee.
bad,Managers are rude. No one has respect for anyone. They schedule you when they feel like your on there good side. Everyone talks about each other. You have to do a lot of work. Managers are rude to customers when they are returning something.
bad,"My employment at A&F was very short lived. I was a very easy job but things also got boring really fast. I would usually work 4 hour shift and I would be bored out of my mind the entire time. Even though this is the stereotypical list of A&F tasks, there's really nothing for you to do there besides stand around, fold shirts, and look cool. Sometimes they would make you put things away in it's proper places or steam clothing in preparation to be put out on the sales floor, and you would occasionally be expected to ring up people's purchases but that's about it when it comes to working there."
bad,you get paid minimum wage with no career advancement or raise. theres a lot of staff for no reason so hours are scarce and may only work twice a week for 4 hour shifts. very busy and has a high demand and reputation so most keep store A1 at all times.
bad,"it was a horrible work environment.  The management was terrible, the staffing was unbelievably horrible and the work load was intolerable.  They expected the stock associates to get so much done in so little time."
bad,i worked for Abercrombie for the work experience as it is really hard to move up. they rarely if ever promote with in so the only way to get full time is to be hired on as a manager
bad,"This job will teach you a lot of skills, I do not recommend it due to low pay and a lot of stress. Find a better job and try working harder for your position."
bad,When I worked for them they had lots of budget cuts which put tons of stress on the managers who had to work harder in order to cope. It resulted in a lot of bad decisions all around.
bad,"The position of Abercrombie & Fitch floor model entails a number of job duties. In addition to showcasing fashions and accessories, floor models assist customers with sales and answer questions about products and merchandise. Some A&F locations may require floor models to operate cash registers and organize stock shelves and clothing racks, as well. Fashionable and personable workers typically perform well during the Abercrombie & Fitch hiring process. Training takes place over the course of a week or two and involves verbal and visual demonstration."
bad,This was maybe the worst working experience I have had. The managers put me on for one 4 hour shift a week. When hired I was told I would be able to work 20 hours a week.
bad,"Only a seasonal employee, they expect the world from you, management is a bunch of young adults who just gossip all the time, and I had things stolen from me at this company. "
bad,This job good for someone who is still in high school or college because they're flexible with hours and it's a very easy and positive work environment.
bad,You would never receive your full hours without getting sent home since they were slow. Management was terrible and things were run so unprofessionally.
bad,working there was no where close to successful. there were no benefits at all. the environment was not good at all. place was always a mess and had to be fixed.
bad,"Abercrombie barely gives any work hours at all, and they're always hiring new people. Job training is terrible because they barely teach you the proper way of doing things, you just have to figure it out yourself. The last store manager was so rude to everyone, including customers."
bad,"I worked here twice, thinking things would change overtime, instead they got worse. Management changed which was a step up; however, the associates didn't make it look that way."
bad,Terrible place to work. They were very in inconsiderate i made friends there but over all the workplace was a terrible place to work at. My manager was very rude
bad,it was a very stressful job to keep. they would keep us after until 2 in the morning sometimes. the managers would take advantage of they're employees. the pay was horrible.
bad,a typical day of work was nothing to look forward to. the managers were very rude and everything was a competition. i did not enjoy working here whatsoever and would not recommend it to a friend.
bad,"Alright position. They expect you to purchase their clothing which is required by your own money with only a 15% off, which is not very much..............."
bad,Managers will take shifts from people simply to be vindictive. They also spend a lot of time talking and ignoring customers while associates are sometimes left alone on the sales floor. One manager will leave the store at night and go with her favorite associate to TGIFridays to drink during their shift without clocking out.
bad,"This was my first job at 16. I always loved shopping at this store so this was a dream come true for me. When I started I was super nervous, but got into the groove of things. The managers were kids it should of been ran by actual adults.  But it was a good first job to have while finishing high school"
bad,Every year the standards at this job went down. No room for advance and management was very arrogant. I would not recommend working with this company.
bad,"Management was horrible! The managers would hang out with associates outside of work, fire people without telling them, there's no such thing as promotions, under appreciated, the managers talk bad and gossip about everyone, paid minimum wage, little hours, sometimes they would also not even give you a break and rude international customers."
bad,Working for this company was very stressful and the management was very unprofessional. There was a very high turnover rate of new hires because people were constantly quitting.
bad,"My time there was seasonal, so there really wasn't any room for experience and improvement. Began with not many hours and ended with the same low hours."
bad,"**Was able to further my life experiences by bringing me into the world hat Ann Arbor has to offer. "
bad,"•	Responsible for offering technical solutions for a global company that focuses on providing support for clients"
bad,"I started this job as a model/cashier. I disliked a lot of things about this company. I strongly disliked the manager, CEO, and all of the supervisors. They mistreat their employers on a everyday basis. I folded clothes, ring up transactions, and greet customers as they were walking in. The managers would give the employees (including myself) a very unfair lunch break. The company itself is a very judgmental."
bad,company did not care if you were dedicated and hard worker. You only got promoted if you looked the part. I worked 16+ days and had no support from upper management.
bad,"It was my very first job and I can't believe I lasted 3 year at that place. They are very good with working with your school schedule, but if you're not the managers favorite you won't get days. I was never officially fired/laid off, they just stopped giving me days."
bad,"Absolutely no work life balance"
bad,i have nothing to really say about this place it was nice while i was here and i only stayed for six months but it was ok i guess .
bad,this company is racist and only cares about looks. I have been placed in the back of the store when high officers come in. Also women make about 50 percent less than men in that store
bad,i didn't really like the job only because i wasn't there long enough because i was focused on graduating high school. I couldnt stay long because it was a seasonal position.
bad,"The backlash that this company has received over the years is truly saddening, and to make matters worse, they are all true. This company pays its workers the lowest possible wages, while requiring them to abide by a 'look policy' that is extremely discriminative."
bad,"I was hired on as a seasonal employee when I was told it was a full time job, so right off the bat HR lied to me. Management is horrible. Your supervisor gets paid way more than you to check emails and sit at a computer all day. The lead that I worked for was extremely lazy, another email checker. If you call off 1 time in 3 months don't expect to get hired. They tell you the schedule is 7-3pm but its actually 6am-4pm, but rarely do you work past 1pm now, so you wont get your hours. This place DOES NOT LIKE you talking to other associates while youre working. Just do yourself a favor and skip this job offer, its not worth it. I am a veteran and everyone I worked with was shocked that I was let go. Just a bad company."
bad,"come in, help costumers when they needed help, fold clothes when they were messy, run the register for a little while, and leave about three hours later, very boring job."
bad,"this is by far the worst company I have yet to work for. minimum pay, have to work extreme hours for a decent paycheck. the managers are unprofessional"
bad,"Poor management, lack of understanding, and the duties that they give you at this place isn't worth minimum wage depending on where you work. I worked here for almost 3 years, and honestly, the management has gone down hill. You get no hours, you get paid 7.25 an hour to do a job that should be paying you more. Honestly the only good thing about this job was making new friends."
bad,"passes judgment"
bad,They dont care what you do as long as you fold clothes and where their name. The pay is horrible and for as much money as that company makes they should pay at least minimum wage
bad,"bending over backwards for customers, but no appreciation from management."
bad,"very boring job didn't do much just sat on a crate pressing two buttons all day, pay was low, very slow paced boring work environment."
bad,""" Get something to do"". You can't just greet customers, it is not enough. You have to FOLD clothes and clean the floor help the customers every single minute. That means they want to multitask with only minimum wage."
bad,"It was okay to work there, they don't pay you that much, and plus they never give you hours when you are looking to work more."
bad,"Its a great place to work at but only if you want to make a little cash, don't expect to get a lot of hours, the workers are nice but the pay is really low.."
bad,"A typical work day, if you got one would be to fold clothes for your whole shift, and give customer assistance only if they asked. I honestly didn't learn anything from Abercrombie. Management was very inconsistent, and didn't allow anyone to pick up extra hours. Co-workers, you usually only met one or two, because hours were so scarce. Hardest part of the job was just staying engaged in such a slow moving, slow paced environment."
bad,when it comes to the work being deliverd there is no good communication there with the dispach they didnt want to take the blame on things the mast up on
bad,"I did not get that many hours, the management were girls that were in high school and only scheduled their friends to work. My coworkers were cool and felt the same way I did. The job was easy I just didn't like it"
bad,I HATED working here. The only managers i liked eventually left. All the people that worked their were spoiled little rich kids. In order for you to even be put on the schedule you had to kiss the managers butt. You got overworked for less than minimum wage.
bad,"Bad management, managers frequently do not allow their employees to take breaks. Many class action law suits have been filed against the company for this practice."
bad,"A typical day at work, if you could even get decent hours, was like being thrown into a dirty teenager's room with a checklist. Not saying the store was dirty, but it was a bit dusty. The managers are picky with workers, rarely allowing actual growth within the store's ranks. The co-workers were very nice, and respectable. Little can be said about the managers though.  The most enjoyable part of the job, was actually being able to work."
bad,"expect a lot in very little time, managers are rude, favoritism exist very much in there."
bad,"Not a good company for continued career. Great company to ""start off"" out of college."
bad,"folding clothing "
bad,"A typical day at work for me was uncomfortable, to me it seemed hard to fit in. I did learn a lot about retail in the short time that I worked there. Management was alright, I didn't get a chance to really get to know everyone individually and that goes for the co-workers too. The hardest part about the job was working the seasonal hours. The most enjoyable part is that I was able to get my duties done and had the retail experience for jobs that I would apply for in the future."
bad,Stay away!!!! Terrible everything bad pay un professional managers stuck up coworkers
bad,"The management only pays minimum wage and only gives one employee a raise once a year."
bad,"Very slow, not many hours and get ready to fold alot of clothes"
bad,Never let me off when it was time to go home. Co-workers never acted with a sense of urgency
bad,Folding clothes and working the cash register would take place. I learned nothing and hours available was bare minimum; 4 hours max.
bad,"I worked at this job during college because it was very easy and the schedule was somewhat flexible.  The work environment was terrible, there was no room to grow unless you had a bachelors, and most of the managers were questionable.  The job was never hard. I folded clothes all day and greeted customers.  The most enjoyable part of the job was that it was social.  Some of my coworkers turned out to be very nice people."
bad,"Working 12-13 hour days with 3 breaks, not exceeding 25 minutes maximum. Management moved around so reputable evaluations were slim to none. Boxes are covered in pesticides and it sometimes become hard to breathe in the warehouse because of the thickness of the air."
bad,Very much disliked going in and pout of the back room to replenish clothes and deal with aggravating customers on a daily basis.
bad,it was an ok first job. bad pay. very loud store. good training and friendly coworkers
bad,"Day 1: Fill out paperwork "
bad,"Not enough hours, only recieved one 4hr shift a week, managers are young, constantly highering new people. Constantly folding clothes and they are very picky about how to fold and how it should be aligned."
bad,Was under bad Management and I reported her. But nothing was done.
bad,"My manager was a kid in an adult body, plain embarrassing. He picked favorites regardless of effort he would help those he liked and trash the ones he did not despite hard work."
bad,I found out that I do not do well in a retail setting. I need a little more action in my daily routine than folding clothes.
bad,management is unfair and not respectful. This place is full of drama and is not a good place to work.
bad,"There was no compensation and had to work very long hours. They did not care about your well being at all. They were very judgmental on how people looked and that made matters very awkward and uncomfortable at times. The associates I met from there were great and amazing people. Management was not understanding on your health issues, personal issues, etc."
bad,"A typical day at work is fun and there is always something to do.The only thing isn't great is the hours, and the pay. I've been there for 4 years almost, and the pay there has still stayed the same and never got a raise. The co-workers were great, but the manager always showed favoritism towards his favorite. I learned to be a better sales associate and how to deal with customers and the different situations that come within."
bad,Folding company clothing. Co-workers was friendly. Most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers.
bad,I would not recommend working here unless you are filthy rich and just wanna get a job to prove to your parents you work but you really don't care about the money because your parents provide it for you...
bad,"I was told to hire based on looks alone, and had to listen to loud blaring music all day.  This job was neither challenging nor fulfilling."
bad,"Worst Company to work for, they treat you like complete trash. Worked there for 4 years and never got a raise, even though I worked my butt off by working 60 hours a week and did a better job than 3/4's of the managers. Met my best friend there though. "
bad,"Way too much demanding labor and not enough pay."
bad,"Management was very poor. People were being let go without being notified. The work schedule was badly organized. The job was vague and undefined most days. The pay was terrible; $7.249/hour, when minimum wage is $7.25... Do not work here. "
bad,"I had a terrible time working here. My co-workers were very rude to me and barley ever helped me. They seemed to get annoyed when I first started and needed help with certain things. One of the managers didn't feel like training me so she just threw my in the front and told me to fold, without even knowing how they fold their clothes. I was only given 15 hours a week, tops. It was also only 8$ an hour. I ended up quitting within 2-3 months."
bad,The management was very racist when it came to minorities. It was difficult working around all the tension.
bad,One of the worst places to be employed. To many young people with no knowledge of how to manage a store or treat people.
bad,"And no cameras , really bad place to work , better off getting out of there ,as they are doing horrible in sales, only snobs go there, overpriced merchandise and for very superficial people with no soul,."
bad,"I was only employed with A&F kids for the winter season. the only day they scheduled me to work was black friday. I worked nine hours, then they never called me back in to work. after new years, i got a text message from my boss and asked if i was coming in that day. i told her no one called me and told me to come in so i had no idea and that i could still come in. she replied back ""nevermind"". then the following monday another boss texted and said my employment ended."
bad,"Minimum wage, little opportunity for advancement, management is not considerate of lower-level employees."
bad,"My experience was terrible. No one new how to train properly, they just throw you out on the floor. If you don’t do everything right you get scolded, even though they don’t train you. Management was terrible. Hours were terrible. I was supposed to be a stock associate but was forced to be a brand rep. I was always forced to be on the floor on my own, newbie and all, while management stayed hanging out in the back. I was so excited for this job, too bad it wasn’t a good experience."
bad,"Everyday you're gonna be folding clothes, restocking, refolding clothes, talking to people, looking out for ""Suspicious"" customers, dealing with managers that don't care how you feel just that you work and keep the store clean. It's all about the customers and the store."
bad,utterly poor management. low work standards and work culture is ugly. you'll have no job security. i didn't every a single day of working here. It sucks.
bad,I guess this is a good starter job after or before high school. Not much growth there every employee that worked there more than a couple years still received the same pay. The environment  is very superficial.
bad,For the amount of time and effort put into the store I did not feel like the pay reflected what I was required to do. The store I worked at was not very high in volume so often would stand around waiting for customers or following around known shop lifters. Deadlines for projects like floor sets and marketing updates were very time consuming and sometimes would have to work 12-14 hours into the next day.
bad,"I hated working at Abercrombie Kids. It was impossible to make everything look perfect.  Unless you have O.C.D, I don't recommend working here.  After spending an hour folding piles of clothes the customers would destroy it in seconds."
bad,"Things have probably started to shift in the right direction in this company. But, when I was an assistant manager at one of their stores the wages were not fair. The expectations were unrealistic. But I'd say it's not everyone's cup of tea/coffee at this point."
bad,"Customer service, making sure the customers are happy, Sales representative any big sale going on in the company I'd have to get some products sold and after the customer has the product I would also be a cashier to get the customers quickly serviced."
bad,"A&F was a place that overworked their employees  They do not respect  their staff nor do they care to help them. It's a cutthroat company that only cares about themselves. They are normally understaffed and expect you to play all roles in the store. You are a cashier, you are a manager, a security guard, the cleaning service. Anything you can think of,  they made you do it at the store, it doesn't not matter what position you are. The DM won't allow you to take vacation. She says there is not enough coverage. As a result, you end up losing all your earned vacation days at the end of the year."
bad,"a typical day is filled with pointless tasks, constantly redoing the sales floor displays, folding the same shirt 5 different ways. Management tries to make you buy AnF clothing and won't schedule you if you don't"
bad,"I'm a former store manager of this company, and to be honest you're better off finding a different company to work for if retail is what you're looking for. This company is one of the lowest paying companies to work for, you could become an MIT for any other company and you'll be paid twice as much, easily. The work/life balance is horrible, you're guaranteed to work more than 40 hours a week, which means you will never have a life outside of work. The upper management is not motivating whatsoever, they constantly tell you what you're doing wrong and rarely give you any good feedback. I will never work for this company again."
bad,Not fair with giving hours out to people didn't work that long there didn't give that much hours rude co workers not frendly
bad,"Between the bosses yelling at you over the lack of folding clothes, having to learn amateur parkour to meet their demands, and drinking so much caffine to keep up that the local starbucks has to make a waiver saying that your health is at risk.. it isn't worth it.  And God save you if you try to make a joke."
bad,"I worked as an ""impact"" employee for all of three weeks.  Management was terrible, too much to deal with for minimum wage.  The brand just oozes cockiness and you must be a part of it.  The uniform is ridiculous and incredibly uncomfortable, at least for a male.  Some co-workers were very nice and helpful however tasks were often monotonous and boring.  I'm glad I had the opportunity to work here to understand how bad a part-time job can actually be.  Very fortunate to have left."
bad,"cleaning and folding is your job."
bad,"as impact team member you job is to process shipment, execute floorset, pull markdowns and maintain a clean stock room."
bad,It is a good place to work for your first job. I learned a lot of different things that I can definitely put in my resume for future jobs.
bad,This is the only retail company that values recruiting a good looking staff over making sales. They work the managers to death with no compensation. Upper management (district manager/regional managers) are ugly and soulless. They get a weird enjoyment out of calling teenagers ugly. 
bad,"Abercrombie & Fitch appears appealing from the outside: a cool atmosphere, laid-back dress code, fast advancement into upper management, and an awesome benefits package. That was my thought when I first started less than one year ago. Over the next few months, I found that almost no OSHA rules, labor laws, or even company-implemented rules were followed; I covered at other stores and it was the same everywhere: if it sold more clothes, everything else fell to the side."
bad,"I worked at Abercrombie and Fitch as an Assistant Manager for about a year and a half. Before, I worked there for about 5 years as a regular associate. Coming into the manager position I knew what to expect, low pay, grumpy customers, loss prevention issues, poor upper management, really bad work-life balance and working with college students."
bad,Management Program is beneficial to learn various aspects of retail and people management
bad,"The flexibility of this job is great for students. The shifts are short, and you can easily pick-up or drop a shift because there are so many associates."
bad,"Working for A&F was a great job at first. How ever the upper management is so disorganized and ruthless, that it destroys the moral of the people working in the stores. I helped out all the company stores across the state, and it was the same issue across the board. They do not care about there lower level employees and Management is required a College degree, which wouldn’t be bad if they paid actually paid accordingly. I wouldn’t wish this job on anyone! Do NOT work here!"
bad,"Management are manipulative and unprofessional in the workplace and out of work. Any personal issues told to managers in confidence does not remain confidential and are used against you. If managers dislike you on a personal level (regardless of your professional abilities), they will reduce your hours, not give out breaks and set impossible tasks designed for you to fail."
bad,"The reason I enjoyed working for the company as long as I did was the people I worked with immediately. My team was great and made the day to day stuff seem fun. However, I had two managers who were biased towards and it showed in the way they managed me compared to the rest of the team which made me feel singled out. There were inappropriate comments made that a manager should never say to an employee. Also the culture of the company was not very diverse and reflected in how certain employees were treated."
bad,"Truly enjoyed my time leading stores, but the company and upper management were driven by unethical, bottom line driven policies. No concern for legality of hiring, promotions or firing."
bad,"Pay was as low as it was legally allowed to be, employees are forced to adhere to strict guidelines involving physical appearance, employee discount was only available at the full price retail store and not the outlet that I actually worked at. Pace of the job was often wildly inconsistent, excessive number of employees led to schedules constantly changing week to week and the complete lack of advancement opportunities helped to create a high turnover rate amongst low-level employees. Every three months the company release a new ""style guide"" which instructs employees as to what Abercrombie & Fitch clothing they are now supposed to be wearing and what clothing they are no longer supposed to be wearing; e.g. the style guide that came out around the beginning of the summer stated that employees were not to be wearing long sleeve shirts (unless the sleeves were rolled up) or pants that were not jeans. You are also restricted to wearing either Abercormbie brand flip flops or ""chuck taylors"" as footwear, apparently nothing else is acceptable. Having said all that, the managers were really quite good despite being constantly dragged down by the ineptitude of the company at large."
bad,It was an okay job but my manger always tried to hit on me so it made the job suck. and they pay min wage that was another reason I hated this job. PAY US
bad,"Went from being full time stock, to key holder because i wanted to leave because the pay was that horrible, then became a key holder and was worked like a dog. the new store manager was horrible so i got a better job so i stepped down to part time associate and i hardly get any shifts now. and now it’s defintely not worth the $7.25"
bad,"management wasn't the best favorited people a little racist too.. the pay was horrible but I guess if your just out of high school and need some movie money its ok, the hours are horrible unless you are in your managers face 24/7 your probably wont be getting any hours."
bad,Folding clothes and stocking the back room as well as setting up scenarios to send out to stores around the world. The people were very friendly and would generally keep to themselves.
bad,Typical day at work had us interacting with customers. Maintaining neat and folded clothes on counter. Store was always offering sales on most products.
bad,"When I first started working for Abercrombie and Fitch the manager I worked for was amazing and I stayed for him. However he eventually resigned because he was getting in trouble for not meeting their hiring quota for the month, and he wanted quality in an employee, not quantity. My overall experience was poor because after my first manager left his replacement was rude and mean to myself and others. Honestly, the company itself wasn't for me and there are many things they do that I don't like."
bad,"I was there for almost 2 years, the only reason I stayed so long was because I was in school and I was able to make my own schedule. But everything sucks about working there. The manager literally will fall asleep while we were working overnight and they just didn't really care about us. We could not advance. I was assigned to do manager assignments while I was just getting paid to be a sales associate. Not fair!!!"
bad,This management program is a waste of time. They will drain you of your personal life. Your whole entire life will become this company. Even once you work hard and become a SM it could take years to become a DM.
bad,"Stock is nice because you can listen to music in the back. After every shift, they check all your bags and jackets to make sure you aren't stealing clothes/money. I never had a problem, with it because I do not steal but I always felt that the managers never really trusted their employees everytime I left. For your own good, do not work holidays. It gets absolutely crazy. Staff is kind of stuck-up and arrogant (especially the ""models"" that work on the floor)."
bad,"Run by children, no structure or regulations. Internal employee theft was overlooked as long as you were flirting with the manager. Unless you look like the size 0 models plastered on the walls you were treated like dirt. Was required to wear specific outfits from a cookbook that you were given every month-flip flops and short shorts in the middle of winter. Weren't allowed to deviate from the lookbook at all or got sent home. Was required to buy at least 3 items a month from the lookbook to wear even though you weren't even guaranteed to work. Schedule was done on a weekly basis, most shifts are ""on call"" unless you are a manager."
bad,Majority of the coworkers that I worked with I built lasting friendships and relationships with and overall everyone got along well. What stood out and what really disappointed me about working here was the management that we had for our specific store.
bad,"very interesting work environment, managers would try to be friendly but would also get frustrated when they were not taken seriously. Also other associates are not very friendly."
bad,this store was my first job and I'm glad i got a sense how the work life is. all i did was go help people if they were needing help get the jeans they wanted.
bad,not family oriented if you dont fit in they will not hire you on and you have to really act all uppity when you are only working in warehouse its just not a job for people who like to just work and not really socialize
bad,they do not treat all their employees fairly. they also do not know how to schedule or communicate with employees. a typical work day is hectic because no employess ever show up on time. i didn't learn anything and was kinda thrown into my job with no training. the coworkers are stuck up and full of themselves.
bad,"don't even try to apply there, the management sucks, they have everything messed up, i didn't get payed for about 3 months because they lost their stuff, it was just a mess."
bad,"My experience as a manager at Abercrombie & Fitch was very short and not o good. I didn't have time for personal life since I use to get my schedule for the following week one day before the week start, my general manager was very immature in life and in business, making the work environment extremely difficult and confusing. The store i worked was always a mess and I had to do extra hours every single day, getting paid just half of the hour (yes, this is illegal). At the end of my 3rd month there I got sick and took one day off. My manager wanted me to work another day to compensate that day that I spent at the hospital. For all this reasons i decided to leave the company and I don't recommend Abercrombie & Fitch to anybody who is looking for a job."
bad,management was racist seeing that i am an African american woman. from the time i started i was never given a schedule. i was only called in for the hours no one else wanted. i always had to work in the back.
bad,"the company was very unorganized. Had trouble with receiving my payment , which it took about a week to get the money i was paid back. Company did not call me to tell me i was fired."
bad,Abercrombie & Fitch is a fast paste challenging work environment. Each day I learn the importance of adaptability. It is important to keep a positive attitude in an ever changing retail environment. The importance of keeping the lines of communication through Store Management and the Loss Prevention Department can sometimes prove to be difficult with the high turn over rate within retail management. The best part of this job is the ability and encouragement to be creative.
bad,"I stood at the entrance all day and said hey wassup ,  and see you , have a good day. The co-workers never took the time out to get to know any of the new people and the girls were really snobby."
bad,"A typical day consisted of back stocking items, answering phone calls, refilling sold items back onto the floor, keeping the back stockroom organized and mainly customer service."
bad,Abercrombie & Fitch was a horrible experience for me!
bad,i was a stockworker who ran clothing to the sales floor. also did alot of shipment sending clothing to another store. i also learned how to be a good leader and work as a team. the management taught me how to lead by example and how to finish your job in a timely fashion.my co workers helped me get things done quickly when i needed help on important projects. the hardest part of the job was patience just wanted to get things done on my time and the most enjoable part was the atmosphere
bad,"great place to work if your in high school, and you want the discount. i work there many years ago don't remember much about the job."
bad,I hated working here the only good thing that came out of it was the friendships. customers and management was awful- ask any previous employer of Abercrombie and they'll say the absolute same thing.
bad,Work life balance sucks! Plus management is always stressed out. It was unbearable to make it through a work shift. I don’t understand how the company is doing nothing about the work load and unfair management practices.
bad,Almost every day my manager would sexually harass me. I wrote to his supervisor multiple times after declining his advances. Nothing was done to stop this and I felt forced to find a new job.
bad,"There is no work life balance and there is constant competition between teams and even between managers and their reports. I work on average 12 hr days and always have to eat lunch at my desk to get through all the projects and assignments in time for director reviews and due dates. The department is unstable and leadership doesn't know how to maintain a team. People are quitting every other week because there is no support and breaking the 2 year contract HR has you sign when you start. HR clearly only cares about the company's money and not the people working for it, but it won't matter soon since the ones that have quality work to offer are planning to leave or already has."
bad,the first thing is the staff wants you to be their yes man they don't have any respect for others also they don't let you  think for you self. Very biased towards minorities.
bad,"The saving grace is having a really fun team of people with you through the terrible hours and incredibly high expectations with no help. Otherwise, the in store experience is one of over worked and underpaid. It has since changed upper management, so it may be much better now."
bad,The worst place for anyone to work especially if you’re not in high school. You’ll get paid minimum wage and you’ll be forced to buy their clothes. If there are any still standing don’t work there. There’s no growth in the company either.
bad,"Pros:"
bad,"The associates you work withh are extremely friendly which creates a great work environment. However, the management is disorganized, some of them target certain people with no basis which is not motivating at all."
bad,"Everyone in the store I worked in were absolutely clueless. From the sales rep, to the MIT, to the actual management. I havent reaped one good benefit from working in this boring company. Greatest thing that happen to me was leaving."
bad,"My typical day was putting sensors on clothes all day long.  I learned they had a price list of which sensors to put on the clothing.  I took the plastic off the clothes, put the plastic in big plastic bags.  The hardest part of the job was too be on your feet all the time.  "
bad,"The job isn't very hard, you get a list every morning that details any specific things the home office wants you to complete that day and once those ares done you walk in circles around the store ""Floor Supervising"" which in an empty store on the weekdays really means -do nothing and in a busy store means - try to keep the register line short and the store from being destroyed. I haven't learned much at this company but it did provide an example of everything i did not want from a job. The pay is terrible. its salaried at $28,000.00 when you start as an MIT and you cannot get a raise until you are promoted to Store Manager and they give you your own store. Getting your own store is much harder if you are unwilling to relocate. Recently they gave a store to a brand new employee right after he finished his MIT program because he got really good recruiting results. they didn't care that the employee in question wasn't really otherwise qualified to run a store on his own and overlooked the other 5+ Assistant managers who had been with the company, in some cases, for more than 2 years. You co-workers are great often times and so are your part time employees. if you need a paycheck while you look for a job more suited to you or just after you graduated from college and you're abercrombie and fitch ""Pretty"" than this is the job for you. If you are looking to start a career with a company you can advance through that this is not the company. Abercrombie and Fitch has a very high turnover rate, in the Dallas area especially. The company is much more concerned with bringing in new employees"
bad,"Not enough pay for the work you do"
bad,"-It was very superficial"
bad,"When working with Abercrombie & Fitch, I had one store manager, who was great.  However, there was no connection between management and staff that created the strong bond that I encountered with Gap.  Abercrombie and Hollister both have a rather cold atmosphere, when looking at the relationship between associates and managers.  This disconnect causes a certain awkwardness off the salesfloor.  As a ""model"" I was responsible for greeting customers with taglines, or scripted phrases that had to be delivered to every customer word for word.  I also processed sales transactions and maintained visual presentations"
bad,It was a flexible job but had no growth opportunity. Management was bad and hours and pay got you no where.
bad,discriminate employees and potential employees
bad,"This is a good place to work part-time if your in HS or college and just want work experience, being a manager is a whole other story. One year with no raise (as a manager...with a degree--you DO NOT need a degree to run a store at this company) asked to work off the clock by upper management, not take lunch breaks (working from 6a.m. to 6p.m. with NO breaks), have to hire based on looks...basically I knew I would hire you the moment you walked in the door before even opening your mouth, bad hours, schedule changes weekly, forget ANY weekends off unless its ""vacation"" which is still blacked out the WHOLE year anyhow, expected to stay until 5a.m. when you have been there during a floorset since 6a.m. the previous day to impress a Regional Manager, that is incompetent and obviously couldn't find any other job to do with her degree except stay at Abercrombie for ten years) This place is awful, you'll seriously need a Xanax to even be able to deal with this job on a daily basis. It is a waste of a degree. I would NEVER work for this company again. People only tell you it's agood place to work because if you recruit good looking people or anyone with a degree you get PROMOTED. Forget hard work and putting in long hours to make your store look amazing, if you don't recruit hotties you will not move up. I will never spend another dime at this company, it was seriously the worst experience I've ever had. I would rather work for way less then work for a company that doesn't care about their employees. Doesn't any company know that making their employees mad is the WORST thing you can"
bad,"A typical day at work was generally slow unless there was a lot to do and not too many people working. Hours weren't consistent with other roles, but you got to pick your own schedule and hours which was very nice and relaxed. A lot of people worked other jobs as the hours just weren't enough to get by. It wasn't worth it long term. The work culture was essentially non-existent. Managers changed so much and so did employees. The most enjoyable thing was when it got busy and fast paced and there was a lot to do."
bad,"I enjoyed working with Abercrombie in 2011, and I enjoyed working there again this year; however, their guildline & policy now greatly discouraged me & several others I worked with at A&F in 2019. I can't say it was the company as a whole, but I will say that about the store I worked at."
bad,ANF has a lot to offer for new associates however long term associates are not offered too many incentives. Management levels could be stronger and knowledgeable.
bad,i think that the company should at least raise the pay i just trhink the employees there dont get paid enough iun myopinion minimum wage is rising in other places why not here
bad,flexible hours although shifts were only 4 hours long and if you're lucky you get 6 hours. did not receive proper training as a new employee and management is very poor. most of the employees that work here does not speak much English due to the fact that they hire international students.
bad,"Acceptable part time job for young adults currently focused on a study path. Not acceptable as a career path or place to seek development. Very unstable environment, staff changes often due to the companies way of handling employee shifts."
bad,The management was poor and I felt like I was treated very unfairly. They were very organized in scheduling and made me feel very unappreciated and disposible
bad,"Depends the day I worked (throughout the weekdays it would not be busy). On weekends it would be super busy. Uniform isn't provided so we have to buy the ""uniform"" which was the clothes (brand). The discount isn't enough nor the pay is good neither. The manager at the time was professional and easy to get along with."
bad,"Learned a lot from great leaders I had along the way and quickly developed a Passion for the brand and culture. I quickly learned from a few mentors ( who quickly jumped ship in my first year) that I was really great at sales mainly from having exceptional people skills. I gained promotions quick at first mainly just by watching around me what poor jobs others got by and called acceptable. "
bad,"Very difficult place to work in. Company culture is focused on the products and the sell, no where near about how well the employee is doing. My experience was negative. No incentive to do well, training was extremely lacking, and the workers rarely followed established regulatory protocols."
bad,"My managers were the opposite of aw-inspiring. Unorganized 20 somethings taking out their full time stress on part time workers (usually struggling students.) I showed up for a 9am opening 10 min early and usually had to wait, for one female manager in particular. Lack of management communication training resulted in a high employee turnover rate as they often felt disrespected. "
bad,I was hired here two months ago and have only worked three times. Basically dont even have a job only call ins im never needed for. Awful place to work.
bad,"Days spent greeting customers, replenishing the stock on the shop front, and finding clothing for customers."
bad,"A typical day at work was folding, preparing, and storing merchandise. I learned how to follow strange rules and correctly fold clothes. The management was okay. Co-workers were shallow, materialistic and very immature. The hardest part of the job was working with such unprofessional people. I remember being told that people who weren't physically attractive weren't hired. How terrible is that? The most enjoyable part of the job was actually helping people trying to put an outfit together for a special day like a date."
bad,"The work environment is very toxic. Management and employees act unprofessionally by forming cliques. A typical employee will receive a four hour shift once a week at best. A typical day at work is refolding the same overpriced t-shirt over and over again. And God forbid if you leave your post in the front of the store to use the bathroom. One positive outcome from working at Abercrombie & Kids was learning how to deal with rich white moms who treated the store as if it was Saks Fifth Avenue. One scary fact that I learned while working at Abercrombie & Kids is that if a gunman hypothetically came into the store, we, as the employees, should begin throwing coat hangers at the armed person and save the precious merchandise. That's the thing. Abercrombie & Kids only care about is their products and keeping revenue at a positive. I had to teach myself how to fold each article of clothing correctly because the introductory video that they show new employees does not show how/what an employee must do, instead, the video talks about how if we the employees ever try to steal from an Abercrombie store, they will make sure to send us away to prison. 0/10"
bad,The hardest part of this job was dealing with the employees. We clashed sometimes. The job was one that was very discriminate. You had to have a certain appearance to work there.
bad,"The company does not value its employees and celebrate in employee successes and achievements. It does not recognize hard work and dedication, but it does promote those who kiss the most you-know-what."
bad,Greet customers or fold clothes in the back. Minimum wage pay
bad,"Had a bad experience, barely received any hours. Managers at the time showed favoritism. Certain rules weren't enforced store wide. Co-workers were fun and open however."
bad,"Somewhat a good place to work. Sometimes it is fun. You meet great people and make friends. But specifically in the store in McAllen, TX, my Impact manager was the worst in the world. She was so unprofessional and gives most of the hours to the people she likes and that chat with her whenever they come instead of putting effort at work. There was times when I would only work 4 hours a week which doesn't really make sense because this store is one of the top selling stores in the nation.  Never have a consistent schedule and always waiting for call-ins which makes you very uncomfortable when you go and do other things. Usually would get call-ins when when I was at the wrong place, at the wrong time. I'm pretty sure the Impact job will get a huge boost on my rating and probably other people's rating, if they replace or just fire the current Impact manager."
bad,"I barely got any shifts, therefore I give it a low rating. A typical day at work was, standing in the front and greeting people as they came in. Keeping the room organize and clean. The shift was only five hours long. Sometime they just leave you in the same room for five hours instead of switching you to the back. So being in the front sucks because you can't leave the front room. Dress code is really strict. You have to look natural for them to hire you."
bad,a typical day at work is very long and unpleasent to work at the company
bad,"Once you hit your ceiling there is very little room for advancement. Training program is very comprehensive, and you do learn a lot."
bad,"Schedules are irregular, providing no time for family or life outself of work. Pay is extremely low for the amount of time given and for the education required."
bad,"a typical day at work involved maintenance of the stockroom, folding clothes, receiving and providing shoppers with help and replenishing clothes whenever necessary. The learning curve extends to how the logistics of a retail store are supposed to workout and how to work as a team to accomplish goals. Management was extremely unproductive and could not be counted on to make fair and sound judgement on most calls. Employees generally were expected to out perform and do more then ever asked by a manager in order for the store to remain viable. Co-workers definitely improved the experience to a point of tolerance but it does not make up for poor management. The hardest part of the job was discerning what priorities mattered the most as managers generally had differing opinions on what to do. The most enjoyable part of the job was the simplicity and fluidity with which objectives could be reached when employees worked as a team."
bad,"while the job assistant manager job is fun at time, the hours and pay is dismal, to say the least. the higher management goes up, the more ridiculous the people become. naked people are used to sell the clothes."
bad,You’re only there to make managers look good and you get criticized every minute by management. Workers are cool though since we all agree management suck! It’s a commonality take good with the bad
bad,"The managers that work act like high schoolers, they party with the workers off the clock and have cliques at work, the man and woman who work there act like that."
bad,"I was given little training to be in management"
bad,"Very shallow culture but overall nit a horrible place to work. The culture is what bothered me to work there. If you dont know going into it, it is definetly something you should Google."
bad,"They expect you to clean what it’s clean, and fix what’s fixed. "
bad,"Hours are flexible so its a good job for college students who only want to work part time and make minimum wage. To move up in the company you need to have a bachelor's degree. A typical day at work would be helping customers find clothing items and letting them in to fitting rooms to try them on, answering the phone, folding clothes, keeping the store neat and orderly, ringing customers up on the cash register and running go backs. I had the opportunity to work with many different people with many different personality types.  Management is terrible and the turnover rate for management is terrible. Assistant managers don't take their job seriously and will not help out on the floor. They are on their cellphones constantly. Workplace culture is okay. You will meet many fun and outgoing people you have the pleasure of working with and you will meet many lazy people who will make everyone else pick up their slack. The hardest part of the job is working with frustrating customers and coworkers. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with amazing co workers."
bad,Handled daily procedures for Inventory Control department in the Distribution Warehouse. General problem solving and troubleshooting skills.
bad,"I had worked for Abercrombie for over a year and the management was terrible and got worse.The DM, RM, and the rest of the people that are in offices think they are too good to talk to the associates and they would talk to us as if we were nothing to them, or they wouldn't talk to us at all. The whole company is drama, even managers participate in the gossip and it was really childish. They also need better associates because the ones there now are young and have a terrible attitude all the time. Lastly, the clothes are WAY to expensive and working as a brand representative and a stockroom manager, I feel the pay could've been well over $7.25 per hour."
bad,"typical day is slow and borig"
bad,"It was my first time working in retail and i had got along with all my co workers and they were super friendly and helpful the only reason why i left was because manager that just got there was not training me properly and letting me down on things i couldn’t do properly, i guess they don’t have patience"
bad,worse policy: I was forced by the company to buy A&F triple A cloth( their top advertising line)every month. feel like i just got my paycheque and give it back to the company
bad,The managers at Abercrombie Kids in the Glendale Galleria are very disorganized. Half of them got fired and half of the employees quit. They schedule minors to work more than they're allowed to. The scheduling is horrible. You'll get scheduled back to back for a month and then for 3 months you won't get scheduled.
bad,"Definitely good for a 1st time job. Folding clothes, cash register, and fitting room were the main jobs other than inventory or being a manager. The customers would be very hard to communicate with and I am against abercrombie's culture. An employee would have to pay for his/her clothes every season from A&F (with discount). You cannot wear A&F/Hollister clothing (a shirt for instance) that is out of season."
bad,"This company was fun to work at due to the amazing team we had in the stockroom however, working there led to being overworked and underpaid. I, among others, was working 40 hours a week doing managerial work while receiving no benefits and minimum wage."
bad,The balance between having a life and working here is not a thing. Upper management demands very tedious tasks in a time span that is not possible. If their was a corporate visit it would be expected for you to stay 60 hours that week.
bad,"Abercrombie and fitch company do not care about their workers. All they care about is making money. They do not give us hours to work and then offer us benefits that we cannot afford because the amount of hours is given to us is petty. They also do this thing where they add a call in in your schedule so you have to call them to see if you can come to work. Last time i check a company suppose to provide the workers hours for the week so we can come and do our job. They expect us to put our day on hold because we do not know if we are working or not.They told the works that we are not important and we can be replace anytime they wish to do so. That shows you how the company do not care about their workers."
bad,"A&F is the most demanding of any retailer and also the lowest paying. Promotions come quick due to a 50% attrition rate. People are hired based on their looks and happiness rather than merit or intelligence, so productivity, professionalism and attitudes are lacking."
bad,It diverse there they good to there employes you not stuck doing the same thing n there room for growth here most of the people I work with was very nice n helpful
bad,"Working for the company is a waste of time. You would think it’s a big company you'll get good hours but you don’t. You only work like 1 or 2 days out of the week for 4 or less hours, sometimes you won’t work at all depending if it’s around the seasonal time. I was there for 4 years and never got a raise.The managers are fake and don’t take their job seriously. Once newly hired they will have you do everything while everyone else stands around. Don’t recommend"
bad,Abercombie is a very stressful place to work. They require that you do a lot with very little resources. I would not recommend it to anyone. After working a stressful day the district manager would pretty discredit all of your hard work.  The pay sucks and so do the raises and you only get 3 weeks of PTO and sick days combined no matter how long you've worked there.
bad,"The employees were great, management were awful, they had favorites treated people differently. Wouldn’t recommend anyone here... management acted very stuck up."
bad,"Would sit in the back all day and do nothing but put tags on all the clothes."
bad,"A very laid back place with down to earth people. A nice part time job for a high school senior, discounted clothes to wear to school but that’s it. I seriously doubt you could make a lively working there."
bad,"paperwork, clean, walkthrough salesfloor, open, manage the floor, clean , fold, close, repeat.  Very limited change in your typical workday after going through the MIT program and becoming an assistant manager."
bad,"When they first said i had gotten the job i was so excited i told everybody, but as time went by i was never put on a work schedule. And when i finally got to work it was because someone took off for the day and needed someone to replace them."
bad,"This is a terrible WORK experience. Endless hours of folding and spraying strong cologne, but by far the best staff I have ever encountered. Abercrombie is more than a company to those who work there. It becomes a way of life. I met all of my best friends here. It makes late nights, early morning resets and minimum wage worth it."
bad,Loss Prevention Supervisor
bad,"A competent management team is one of the few reasons I stayed at Abercrombie as long as I did. A lack-luster staff and generally apathetic environment between customer and rep are just a few qualifying factors for why I would not recommend working for this organization. The corporate nature of the business will guarantee steady pay, but the attitude behind corporate motives makes this business a less than moral option for employment."
bad,"The Escondido location provides great service for the customers, but internally, treats their employees poorly. They have extremely high expectations for their employees, and if not met, severe consequences."
bad,"Inconsistent hours, not enough pay, very understaffed, HORRIBLE GENERAL MANAGER 😒."
bad,"ive already rated this company. If i have to give anything, its one star because i made some really great friends here... but not because the company was great."
bad,Nice starter job if you like talking to the public pay was fine at the time cause I was young not too many hours tho but overall good job teenage recommended job
bad,During my time at A&F managers had no life and any hours worked over 40 were paid at half their normal hourly rate. the deadlines were unrealistic especially given allocations couldn't get the product to the store on time.
bad,They do not treat their employees like human beings. They use you and if you don't wear their clothes or buy the current season's clothing then you will not be put on the schedule since they can't technically fire you for it.
bad,Bad company that does not care about their employees. Workplace was very judgemental. I would not recommend working here to anyone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bad,"i worked here in high school and it was terrible. the environment sucks, nobody trained me or helped with anything. the customers were slobs and rude."
bad,Experience working here was really negative. They only care about how you look. Very shallow company. If you look a certain way they won't hire you. Was very disappointed by the way they chose associates.
bad,"The store was never really too busy because the clothes were really expensive and totally not worth it. Although, it did give a new view on how retail stores ran. The management team was really friendly and flexible with your schedule."
bad,They discriminate based off of looks. The store is run by a bunch of children that have no idea what they are doing.  A typical day is coming in and changing into their smelly clothes and trying to get people to purchase them.
bad,people would come in and would love the store but the place was so dark and dim They could barely see what they are shopping for. They are very good people.
bad,"Horrible hours, hardly could understand tourist, and theres too many new hirers. The only good thing is the fact that you get to be yourself and its sort of fun."
bad,"My least favorite job. Way too loud, and management staff had you working way more than what you were being paid for."
bad,retail is once a again not a job for me. only did to make sure my bills were paid and I had money to buy my essential items.
bad,"You're basically paying the company to torture you. You end up spending more money than you make on the required uniform every season, its seriously the worst job I've ever had in my entire life. You're better off collecting coins on the street as a reliable and reasonable source of income. Unless you are already friends with people there from school or something, nobody interacts or learns each others names, its cliques and dirty stares. I have nothing good to say about working for this company. Oh and you listen to like 5 of the most obnoxious remixes on loop all day, and you're slowly poisoning yourself with all the perfume, the air is thick and has a taste to it....The tasks are easy....but its just not even worth having as a temporary job while looking for another, just seriously don't bother."
bad,"Treats employees like slaves, customers like yesterday's garbage, and the CEO gets to fly around in a jet making $8 million a year."
bad,If you are an honest and hard working employee you WILL be taken advantage of while lazy manangers and other part time associates stand around and do nothing.
bad,"A typical day at work I will either greet costumers when they come in or I will mange the backstocking room. I learn social skills, I learned how cashier work, I learned how stores stay organized. My co-workers all had beautiful personalities. The hardest part of the job was standing up for hours. The most enjoyable part of the job are helping the customers."
bad,It was a fun environment when i was a teenager but they judge you a lot on what you wear and how you look
bad,"The work is nice and easy, sometimes boring.  I liked the people I worked with and the management was good.  The pay was low but the job itself is mostly best for students in high school or maybe college students."
bad,I wouldn't recommend no one here ... no room for advancement ... no benefits ... hostile work environment ... barely make 40 hours a week ... soooo it was a experience
bad,"Helping customers with any questions they had, working cashier. Most days at work are very relaxed and slow paced, except around the holidays. Management team is great, willing to work with you and what fits your schedule best. Working here helped be more social and its always fun getting to meet new people and getting to talk to them."
bad,"Working at Abercrombie was awful. There was little-to-no training for the job, minimum wage pay, and awful workers. The environment was very cliquey and there definitely were obvious favorites in the workplace. For the price of their clothing, workers should not be paid minimum wage. People barely came into our store."
bad,"You get to know people, people is what get you through your day. Learn a lot about lots of culture and where people are from. Share experiences with others."
bad,"I did not enjoy the staff nor managment as they were very picky & rude . The hrly, wage was terrible & my job placement was not even enjoyable so I quit"
bad,very relaxing job I every had. it may seem like time is runnin slow because its after tem p.m. but you only work for five to six hours and the pay is not that bad.
bad,The staff were very nice and friendly. The managers were fair and unfair in some occasions. Holidays were always extra busy for the company. Stressful work place.
bad,Was a good place to work but pay was bad and hours were bad. I learned a lot about working in a fast paced environment (mall of America. I enjoyed the people I worked with that was about it.
bad,"Working there for a few weeks was fine. Until we got a new manager started being displeased with me and how I can't say ""Thank you, come back again"" to customers at all. Terrible planning on schedules, like I asked for my next weeks schedule to see if I could adjust it and logging in to the kiosks it wasn't even on there. Just the current schedule that we were just in. I tried so hard to work with the manager just to be like Teamwork, but it's not teamwork when you are the one getting screamed at the entire day."
bad,A typical day at work consisted of greeting customers at the door. I didnt quit like managment felt like they were a bit racist. Didnt quit enjoy working at this specific location. The co workers were okay
bad,"customer service, folding clothes. back stocking. price checking. maintaining a clean space. assisting customers with anything and everything."
bad,"This job is the pits. Everyone just cares what you look like. If you gain weight, they put you in the stock room without explanation. Constantly telling everyone they have a brand image to maintain. I personally witnessed a girl being switched from a floor brand rep to stock room because she got braces. The managers are all super young and talk to other employees about the people working beneath them."
bad,"A typical day at Abercrombie consisted of being criticized as soon as you walked in the door. ""You have too much make up on, you don't have enough on, your shirt looks weird, etc."" Everyone who worked at my store was unwelcoming and called me poor and ugly. The customers were nothing short of terror and when I attempted to help customers my managers would yell at the customer and then yell at me. I worked very hard to maintain the store and other people would reap the benefits  by getting extended breaks, and being favored, simply because they were friends with the managers. There was nothing enjoyable about this job. Everyone was rude, there were no benefits, the pay was minimum wage, and no matter how hard I worked it didn't matter.There was no schedule consistency. There were many 'call-in shifts', meaning, you had to be prepared to work, but you probably won't be called in to work but you call an hour before you're scheduled to see if they want you. Some weeks I had 30 hours, some 4 hours. No rhyme or reason to it.  When I put in my two weeks notice, after six months of working in this cruel environment my manager said, ""I'll take you off the schedule, don't even bother coming in anymore. What's your name again, so I can take you off?"""
bad,"Be ready to Fold! A Typical day at abercrombie is very tedious. From the moment you walk in the door to the moment you leave your folding clothes or giving a customer ""a great store experience."" Management always varies. You can have the very laid back manager but gets work done or the super uptight manager who takes their authority to seriously. co-workers are always great. the hardest part of the job is that over time it gets very tedious. Its none stop folding. The most enjoyable would be working with fun loving people."
bad,"I was talked down upon often and many things were said behind my back by my own bosses. I learned to keep quiet always and do my best. Management had so many issues with their employees, Many should have been let go. The hardest part of the job was finishing the store on time because of the disorganized staff and uncooperative co-workers. The most enjoyable part of my job was break."
bad,Being that I've been there for 2yrs I was able to see a lot. Customer service is part of my life
bad,"their management is amature, and not entirely a fun work place"
bad,"Personal, I didn’t like it I thought it would be a cool trending place to work as a college student, I was died wrong. Very very little hours, a lot of drama between employees for no reason, the workers there were very sassy, very little pay (minimum wage), the smell is super strong in there I had a headache every day after work. I got accused of stealing $9 and my boss searched my pockets which was a huge violation. It’s a very boring job your literally Just folding clothes all day, NO JOKE! I would bring a bottle of lotion because your hands are gonna be super dry by the end of your shift. And this is just me but I am not really a mall person and most Abercrombie’s are in the mall it’s super loud and crowded."
bad,"The general manager here was terrible to other managers and employees. Her attitude is ridiculous. The hiring manager was pretty rude as well. When i first got there i encountered a few rude employees as well. Most customers were mainly foreign and would treat me and other female employees with disrespect. The job had it's perks . I made new friends with SOME co-workers , and I had regular customers. Training is something you have to keep asking for. If you're a minor like i was they will take advantage of you. The GM only worked me 5 hours or less and would lie about available shifts when i asked about them. I recommend the job just not at Jersey gardens."
bad,"I was forced to buy my own uniform, they did not provide it for me. Had to pay for our own parking. Management was young and didn't provide much information. Decent job for straight out of high school students."
bad,Not a recommended job! If you are not a manager or key holder this is basically a one day kinda job. You also get paid minimum and biweekly. I DO NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL
bad,"You tell the manager before hiring you that you are currently enrolled in 15 credit hours of college classes. The manager responds with a ""perfect"" and a month later gets scheduled for 35 hours of work mon-fri."
bad,"The values of the company are lacking. There aren't benefits for its workers to use in the even of sickness or any extenuating circumstance, and if there is, the company highly discourages using it."
bad,"Horrible place to work. They hire you right around the holidays, and after, your hours are cut dramatically. Horrible managers that are barely out of high school with no experience on how to run a store."
bad,I really didn't like this job. My co-workers and I made the best out of it. Management were cool depending on who were managing that day.  Hardest part of the job was picking up after customers after you just took an hour fixing shelves. Most enjoyable part was lunch time.
bad,"Horrible hours, irresponsible managers, very unprofessional and immature. The olace is very disorganized and the employees stereotype everyone that walks in."
bad,"The company started at great I liked the environment, but then I started to notice things I didn't really agree with, overall I am grateful for the opportunity I received but would not return to the company."
bad,Hectic hours during peak and holiday. Crummy Pay. But the prestige of the brand and employee discounts keep's the staff in place
bad,"Typical day included rowdy managers, and poor pay. The hardest part of the job was dealing with corporate and the computer systems for the registers."
bad,"I worked at the Home Office in New Albany. What you will quickly find is how cultish the place is. They all think the world lives and breathes A&F and the way they do business. It does not, obviously. No matter how hard you work or how much you contribute, at the end of the day, the place is like many corporate environments and you are not really valued any more than the last thing you've done. It's hard to fully describe or to give great examples without naming names and incidents, but suffice it to say that the place is just in a world of its own. And this is not a compliment. It is stressful, expensive (constantly having to buy their stupid clothes) and not very rewarding. I do not recommend A&F in any way."
bad,I strongly disliked working at A&F.  I did not get enough hours at all.
bad,"Management was terrible, only hire people up to ""their standards"" overpriced clothes, pay is not worth it."
bad,Don't do it unless you absolutely must. Favoritism plagues this company.
bad,"retail is retail. but if your looking for a beginner mgmt position, you can get some experience here."
bad,"The management is ok, depending on the district your in. The hardest part of the job is the hiring process."
bad,One of the worst companies to work for. The one positive thing is that I built many great relationships with former co-workers.
bad,"Inflexible to ones time and needs."
bad,"Fast paced, lots of people who are rude, managers do nothing to help out. They say they do a bunch of tasks, but all I saw mine doing was complaining, AND being on their phone all the time. Don't work here, I had all closing shifts, opening shifts, and would never get to leave in time. Managers here will ""accidentally"" schedule you incorrectly, then text you to come in an hour early due to their ""mistakes"". I left because I had to do a floor set, and had to pick up the slack of 3 other people because they did not show. I had to do all the markdowns MYSELF for the entire store! Then, I got yelled at because I couldn't put all the clothes back in their places. Don't work here, you will go insane. Also, I worked a TON and got one break the whole time I worked there."
bad,"Terrible experience, they will work you to the bone and replace you the same day.  That business needs to care of their internal issues because it has become a inhospitable place to work."
bad,"You have to dress in a way that you are not accustomed to. You have to shave all your facial hair, can't wear name brand clothing, and you have to beg for hours otherwise you won't get them."
bad,"Working at A&F, made me realize that I needed to prepare myself more in order to get a better job."
bad,Workers were always stressed to make quotas and timed for every task. Management had favorites and made others do all of the hard work. Mandatory breaks were hardly given.
bad,"The work place is fun sometimes. Managers and associates are young and we all get along. The downsides of working here are that the managers sometimes don't know how to set aside being our managers and friends, pay is terrible unless you get good hours, but hours decrease after the holiday season. Also many associates are unreliable and don't really come to work and the managers at my store don't make them work.For the most part if you're a reliable worker you'll pick up the slack of the other associates"
bad,"The paid is not fair, you do not get enough hours but during Christmas they do overtime, it is not worth it because there is not a career raise chance"
bad,"Abercrombie & Fitch is only a job i would recommend if you don't have bills to pay and are still in high school. Very low pay, No benefits and poor management."
bad,"I appreciate the opportunity, but I wasn't getting hours like the rest of the staff. They would Most likely give hours to the ""white kids."" Once i gave my two weeks the managers said they needed me and would give me more  hours but, I quit because I needed to make a living."
bad,"No balance between personal life and work, also almost never promotes. Although I know how working retail is, any days requested off even for doctors appointments or anything like that was considered monumentally annoying."
bad,Retail is a lot of work but this store was pretty laid back just had to make sure the customers were satisfied and that all cloths racks were stocked and neat
bad,"This was a good first job, while I was in high school. You get to learn about business and sales. You are exposed to multiple types of cultures and individuals with extensive backgrounds."
bad,"AnF is a rough place to work because they don't pay competitively and in the year i worked there, i never had more than 8 hours a week and many of my co-workers could say the same due to extreme overstaffing."
bad,"I worked here when i was in college or so, so i don't remember much, i just remember the cologne being overwhelming and hard to work with. Everything else and everyone was really nice though."
bad,Honestly the job was stupid. All we did was fold clothes and stand there. we weren't allowed to sit or move from our section. we were also not allowed to eat or drink. the most annoying thing was the fact that you couldn't wear anything u wanted. we had to wear Abercrombie clothes. ANY THIS ALL FOR MINIMUM WAGE!!!
bad,Typical day involved making sure store was presentable and customers were satisfied. Most enjoyable part of the job was that it was easy while the hardest part was that they had terrible management.
bad,"Great first job for someone coming right out of college.  Every district is different because each district manager runs their stores differently.  There is no work-life balance and you better like to suck up to your boss and his/her boss.  Advancement is unlikely, if you are lucky you may get promoted to store manager, but then you would get locked in at that position.  Those people who hope to get into home-office are completely out of luck, they don't promote to Columbus from the stores.  Instead, they bring in outside hires, which creates a huge disconnect between home-office and the stores.  This creates a big problem when it comes to budgeted hours and other operational information.  The paid-time-off days are nice, but if you work at a high volume store, there is a good chance you won't be able to use those days before they reset.  The associates and other managers make this job somewhat worth it.  Management from the District Manager all the way to home-office is flawed, and thats how you can tell that this company won't be around for much longer.  If you are applying to this company at least be sure to apply to a Hollister store.  Hollister is does better business and is managed more realistically."
bad,Abercrombie is not a company that you want to spend a long time with. It has few incentives to do well and it creates a culture of laziness and high turnover. Its operations are too centralized and it leaves no room for employees or lower management to deal with situations in its own stores.
bad,the job was alright. The pay was horrible. My coworkers were the only thing that made me enjoy this job. the hardest part of this job was dealing with a horrible upper management team.
bad,Was not given many hours to work and they did not work with your schedule. The managers didn't care about the employees and were rude. The company didn't provide any benefits for employees and there was no chance of moving up in the company.
bad,"Ensured guest satisfaction though suggesting complementary products during sales"
bad,I enjoyed the environment but I would had appreciated if management had taken time to introduce employees one another. There was always new people and little time to introduce each other. Management was never communicative. I dislike having call-ins which usually meant they did not needed you to come in to work. Typically employees were given  day to work per week.
bad,"No hours to work.  Allocation of working hours seems to be heavily biased.  Even with very high availability, I averaged something like 5 hours a week.  Then there's the call-in designated days where you're obligated to keep a free schedule at that time just in case when you call in you're required to work.  Chance of actually being used on your call-in days is something like 5% or less though."
bad,"At Abercrombie & Fitch, I pretty much learned everything there is to know about retail: Marketing, mannequins, visual merchandising, stocking, standardizing, amongst other things."
bad,"A typical work day was stressful. I learned how to sell people on items, work the cash register, and how to better communicate with Spanish speaking customers. There were many different managers therefore there were many different personalities and ways to do your job when with certain managers. Co-workers were nice and helpful when I started out for the most part. The hardest part of the job was being scheduled. The most enjoyable part was the costumers."
bad,"The management was mostly people who hadn't worked for the company long and it was very hard to move up within the store. The job is geared towards good looking young people looking to make a little money. The best bet for getting hired is to know someone who already works there. There were a lot of personal issues being brought to work and the way you were treated by managers was highly based on how likeable you were as opposed to how hard you worked. It was a fun job at times, very lively and interesting people."
bad,try to sell more than what you sold yesterday greeting people as they come and go
bad,I stocked the shelves and made sure items on the floor had a certain amount of clothing on display. my co-workers were very  about knowledgeable about the store which made me want them to mentor me. the hardest part about the job was working late night shifts and then coming in the next day bright and early.
bad,"There is nothing particularly stimulating about this place.  Management is okay, but they do not consider anything about a person, besides the fact that they are mere pawns in their store.  It consisted of hours of folding clothes, saying hello to customers, and ringing them out on the cashier.  This was the routine every single day and they do not consider anything that an associate says.  I scheduled my courses on certain times and told them when I would be unable to come in.  First thing they did was schedule me during my course hours.  Although the management was different according to who it was, it was usually very thorough about the store and they were all incredibly nice.  There were just so many people working there, it was hard to keep track of who was a veteran there and who wasn't."
bad,"The job is not very hard to get, only requires you to dress according to the standards they provide. Job description is simple, but very repetitive and gets boring after a while. Management sometimes expects too much, as with most retail jobs. Hours are terrible, usually one to two days a week working. Only thing that could be considered a benefit is 50% off a few items at the start of every season. No room to grow in the company without a bachelor's degree, which even then the management positions don't pay very well."
bad,"This was not a serious job. Was fun being in retail and looking good in expensive clothes, but surely isn't worth the pay. Not much room for advancement really."
bad,"·Typical day was just plain boring. Customers were rude. I learned to apply electrical alarm systems to clothing, the value of the company's clothing and the company's high-end inventory system. Management was very sloppy and unfair. There was just not enough hours given the amount of employees. The hardest part of the job was when I received my Paychecks.The most enjoyable , when the customer's asked for my opinion on their potential purchases."
bad,A typical day at work consists of a lot of clothe folding and customer assistance.
bad,"A&F offers a challenging job environment where young professionals are able to develop leadership competencies; however, compensation is well below average in retail industry. Opportunities for corporate advancement are mostly given based on time spent with the company. Work/life balance is terrible for upper management. Some may find their moral principles jeopardized while working for A&F."
bad,"Typical day consisted of folding clothes constantly, keeping the store in order, assisting customers, monitoring dressing rooms, and working the register. I learned how to handle customers in a retail setting. Hardest part of job is staying busy. "
bad,"Critical staffing based on appearance rather than work performance and qualifications"
bad,"They blackball and don't allow you to be promoted if you work in certain departments. If you are well qualified for certain positions they rather hire outside individuals then promote associates they already have, that's if you even get a chance to interview for the position. Most of the time you are ignored and get no response. On the rare occasion you get an interview, they treat you like you don't even belong there and they will never follow up with you. I interviewed for a position only to find out they hired someone else two weeks earlier but had no professionalism to let me know. Individuals in management positions are too young and have no experience. Managers are only in it for themselves and have no desire to improve associate morale."
bad,This was a fun place to work. Management was really strict with how you had to look but other than that it's a piece of cake. Folding and refolding that same pile is a typical day to make sure everything is absolutely perfect.
bad,"I learned a lot about customer service for this company, but the pay isn't good. It is a really good part time job for a student though."
bad,"A great first job but I would Not recommend staying in the company for more than 2-3 years. Not a great work life balance, upper management is not concerned with their employees well being or advancement."
bad,"The location I worked at the management was not good. They played favorites there with employees that have been there longer. We got yelled at if we didn't finish a task on time. They don't schedule enough people to open the store. I got called into work, even though I told my manager ahead time it was a family emergency. My hours got dropped for no reason and fired with no explantation. I tried contacting HR still no answer."
bad,"The amount of foot traffic was fair... the variety of people was an amazing part of it! One I miss a lot. Clicks within the employees was a huge thing. I got along pretty well with everyone but, clearly cared more for the job than others and some didn’t like that..."
bad,Will overwork you and has terrible culture. will try to control everything you do outside of work. no work life balance at all. only positive is they promote quickly.
bad,"A day a work goes by slow, depends on what you are doing. What i've learned is communication skills, talking with and to people with more confidence and upholding. The workplace is comfortable but then again, depends on what you are doing. The hardest part of tis job is to deal with the managers, they can sometimes give you hours are just give you a hard time in general. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting different people who does and doesn't work there."
bad,"The people are great to work with, but the job it self is terrible. The hours are horrible and you can barely get a weekend off. You may have to close at 11pm or do store updates until 2 am and then have to open the store the next day."
bad,You are left to learn the details of the job on your own. The store itself is very difficult to clean up and organize due to the fact that there is almost no space for the amount of merchandise they have. The best part of the job is the flexibility they have with work schedules but it is also a problem in that on average people are scheduled for a single four hour shift a week.
bad,"This company essentially involves around a high and fire basis. If the managers are fond of you, they train you in every aspect of the store. If they do not seem to like you, they take very long to train you or they simply give off negative attitude, which ultimately pushes oneself to quit."
bad,"I worked for this company about 5 years. It started off great and was actually a place I didnt mind to going for work. However, over time things started changing a little too much. The work and standard kept increasing while the pay stayed the same until city employment laws concerning minimum wage mandated them to raise it. They uphold you to unrealistic standards at times and write you up even if you follow procedure for calling out. At this point I wouldnt recommend anyone going for a job here at least not when it comes to stock. The best part of this job is probably the people you meet here. I would say flexibility but that's a little iffy at this point now."
bad,"I didn't get much experience while working a Ambercrobie&Hitch. A employee asked me too cover his shift but the manager denied me covering the person's request because she thought I didn't ave enough experience,."
bad,it is a dead end company with a dead end attitude towards everything from their business plans to how they treat their employees. I highly recommend to not apply to this company.
bad,"I worked in the Tampa area for A&F and honestly, it was the most stressed I’ve ever been in my life. I’m not sure if I just wasn’t made for it or what, but during training you’re pretty much left to you own devices and good luck moving up the ladder if your DM decides they don’t like you. Heaven forbid if you and your SM don’t get along, don’t plan on having this job for a long time."
bad,"Abercrombie was pretty calm, every manager kind of had a set of their own employees. older employees sometimes wouldn't get along with new management and management starts letting people go and hiring their own crew. other than that, it is pretty okay to work at for a part-time or side job. for the most part, everyone is pretty friendly and a lot friendlier than they have been in the past."
bad,This environment was very rough.  I was a highschool student when I started working there and never enjoyed a day of work.  The culture was toxic and the managers were childish.
bad,"There is a lot of back-biting,gossipers and lairs who always plans to get people fired for no good reason. It is one of the saddest things I encountered; all the way from the warehouse settings to the home office and certain people thought I did not deserve it."
bad,"Colleagues were enjoyable, but as usually, any customer service position can get very stressful especially dealing with rogue customers who think they can take advantage of you. Pay sucks. Not a recommended job as a college student. Management was okay. I could tell they were stressed out at times as well."
bad,"Terrible pay and management, no benefits, no advancement or appreciation, and almost no potential for a raise. You can work really hard and they will still treat you like garbage."
bad,"The work place environment,  culture, and management at A&F was lacking significantly. The management was unfair and the hours that I had to put in at times were unfair. There were times where we were short on management staff and I had to cover two stores at once without a lunch break."
bad,"I worked a maximum of 4 hours a day, usually a morning shift which was 9am-1pm. The slowest work days ever, barely had customers come in, many rude customers. Paid $8.05 an hour wasn't worth it. Manager was rude."
bad,"Managers are constantly on top of your work, can be hypocritical and only show a genuine interaction with customers and hardly ever with their associates. Aren't the kindest of managers"
bad,When the store was slow it was slow. Upper management would complain all the time. CRAZY dress code for staff. have to have a college degree to be a manager.
bad,Working as the doorman or the greeter at abercrombie at the mall gave me a unique experience in the retail industry. From folding clothes and changing floor layouts it was very high maintenance.
bad,"A typical day at work is opening the store or closing the store for management. Everyday, tasks are sent over for management to complete to drive business for that day. Hardest part of the job is that  some days you'll work with a brand new person on a busy day and they are your only person for that day. Job is very easy and straight forward other than that."
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of folding, hanging, and stacking clothes as well as tending to customers. I learned the importance of not being late. Management was young. The workplace culture was laidback. The hardest part of the job was remembering the backroom photo info. The most enjoyable part was having satisfied, happy customers."
bad,"Working at Abercrombie was a good experience a typical day included folding clothes, organizing, unpacking shipments, cleaning, working the register, helping customers,"
bad,"No room for growth, management as well as co workers were hard to get along with not very friendly. Only worked 4 hour shifts and only about 2-3 shifts a week"
bad,"- Only folding clothes"
bad,"There no hours. I went a month without working. No one spoke, it was almost a waste.                                                                                                                                      h"
bad,With the experience I've had at other jobs it had made me realize just how chaotic the management really is. My first day was Black Friday and I received no training as to what to do!! There was a lot of us there just standing there trying to figure out how to do our jobs. When you try to ask a question as to where to go or where to be management looks at you as If you've been working there for months and the attitude I caught from them was ridiculous. If you're hired and if you find the job tolerable more power to you
bad,A typical day at work would be to greet our costumers with a friendly face and bubbly attitude. Keeping the items or clothing always in tact and our work area around the register clean. I learned to work in groups and be more open and speak freely. The management were very negative. My co workers were always nice and friendly made me feel like I was working with my close friend even if I had just met them. The hardest part of my job would've been dealing with negative managers but keeping a smile on your face. The most enjoyable part would be me helping a customer but a cute outfit together as a gift for someone.
bad,Do any people of color work here?  Seeing all the federal lawsuits its highly questionable!  They currently have a federal lawsuit around religious accommodation pending.
bad,"they hardly give me 3 days a week."
bad,This work place was one I chose to give a try. It turned out it was not meant for me. I am glad I had the opportunity work there.
bad,You have to review and rate your entire staff based on looks not work ethic or skill set. they would rather have 50 mindless attractive zombies opposed to 10 stand up employees who work hard and genuinely care about their job.
bad,"its an easy job. definitely. "
bad,"This company is a bureaucracy and over works their employees, should be getting paid more than min wage, i would not work here the rest of my life unless corp. Be careful. fun place but will make you a lifer."
bad,"This company cares more about image than competency.  While they strive to protect their image, management consists of almost zero teamwork understanding while their ""models"" are young and lazy people who are used to always getting their way and despise a good work ethic.  There is also a big theft problem with no cash handling policy that enables this company to know exactly who is stealing from them.  Complete incompetency from top-down."
bad,Did mostly sales/retail work. Most enjoyable part was interacting with other co-workers.
bad,"A typical day was cleaning tables, refolding clothes and greeting customers. The hardest part was constantly having to refold clothes and paying close attention to detail . The most enjoyable part spending time with other coworkers discussing various topics."
bad,"I would work at least 8hrs/day with MAYBE a 15 minute break. Folding clothes for at least 8hrs straight. Co-workers were very cool consideing I get along with everybody. I learned that life is more than just looking good, its about helping people. The best thing about the job was that my manager gave me a chance to work there and I appreciate that but I jus didnt want to do that for the rest of my life!"
bad,- 3 hour shifts were awful
bad,"The typical work day would be to greet customers, and make sure that they are happy with the clothes that they purchased. Management and the co-workers are all down-to-earth and are willing to work together on anything to get the job done. The hardest part of the job is seeing the customers unhappy. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with other employees and getting to know great people."
bad,Racism still exists in this organization particularly in the overnight crew. Employees are treated like sweatshop workers rather than employees!
bad,A top 5 retailer that really pushes individual strengths but has no business goal incentives and doesn't promote based upon experience duration. Promotions are political and not 100% based upon performance. Very low pay grade starting out and after promotions. Benefits are similar to any other fortune 500 company.
bad,I Greeted every customer with the company tag line and assisted any customer with any request they had including stock checks and reffering them to other stores. At times I would cashier. The hardest part of the job was keeping the displays absolutely perfect while assisting and greeting customers. The best part of the job was working with energetic co-workers.
bad,"You find yourself working with people that have low values and morals, are not challenged, are not motivated or encouraged by supervisors. Company culture is based on looks alone. You can lose your job if you do not succumb to hiring and firing based on what they tell you is attractive. It was the worst career decision I made after graduation and paid terribly little. You find yourself competing with coworkers to look better than they do, not to work harder for promotion in harmful working conditions."
bad,Not the worst job in the world but not many opportunities. Management is all college kids. I’d say look for something better unless you like the high school scene.
bad,This is a good first job. The pay is minimal which is ok if you still live at home. Hours are slim so you can live. And crew is young. Not a permanent job. Always look for other opportunities while you are here.
bad,"The previous managers lacked communication, he did not work well with the employees schedule. Limited works hours were given to few people, other than that employees worked well together."
bad,Working at Abercrombie & Fitch was not an enjoyable experience to be a part of. The work load was unevenly distributed and the lack of management was a big contributing factor. When I was scheduled to work (which was hardly) I would be required to do loads of hours of folding and organizing in a matter of the few hours that I was given.
bad,"We were very reactive to business in the marketing design team. Each day was very busy, often not having enough time to think through each project completely, or to have enough time to take a break. Design feedback from leadership was inconsistent so you might spend the time you had to work on a project designing it the wrong way without knowing it. Leadership planned more projects than we could complete with the number of people on our teams, and would kill the projects after they got started.  The culture was ""It's crazy here"". The hardest part of the job was knowing what your job was. The most enjoyable part was working with your team members. Your peers at Abercrombie & Fitch will be your best friends, but the leadership and HR will be confusing at best."
bad,Abercrombie was a poor experience for me. i had low hours and low pay. I drove 17 miles to get to work and i barley made enough to pay for my own gas.
bad,"My experience working for  there company overall was okay but they are horrible when comes to manager, they were not good at there jobs at all, and there hours were horrible I couldn’t even get at least 12hours a week working for them"
bad,Most days at A&F were very boring. The employees weren't that friendly. The customers always had attitudes with the staff. Overall I felt that it wasn't a fun place to work at.
bad,This company does not pay enough to be called management. Great job to get your feet wet but don't stay longer than a year. Total waste because they do not pay enough
bad,Not the best place to work for a college student. It gets very very very stressful almost every single day and the management does not care about you they just make sure the work is done to their standards and that is pretty much it.
bad,"When I was hired here, there were about 50 other people hired. I don't think I ever worked with the same person twice. No one would talk to me either, I tried to be friendly to my co workers and start conversation, but no response. It was like all of the ""cool kids"" in high school and then me. The shifts were generally pretty short, but it was very slow and all you did was fold clothes over and over and over. The scheduling was a little weird. They ended up hiring so many people that eventually the original people who were hired were no longer on the schedule. It's been like 6 years and I've still never officially been fired!! What a joke."
bad,"low hours, childish employees, and its very boring. You have to buy the clothes to wear to work they do not supply you with an outfit. I spent $150 on my start up outfit."
bad,"A typical day, is walking around for 5 hours in leather flip flops and very tight clothing folding and servicing customers and staying diligent throughout your shift while the “model” team gets more pay to stand in one sectional nd just greet a customer passing by with no knowledge of the the product or brand history"
bad,"Customer interaction, cleanliness, cash register, Enjoyed the music, hardest part was there was NO room to grow unless you are good looking. Management was great"
bad,I worked here for about 2 months I asked manager to put me into a more advanced position but was ignored I started as a handler for 11 an hour after 2 days they put me on a different position that paid 10 without explanation just care about numbers not what you are capable of
bad,"Abercrombie and Fitch is a good place to start working but there is not a lot of promotion opportunities. Work life balance is extremely difficult because schedules are not made very far in advance and are erratic, closing one night to open the next morning to closing again."
bad,Majority of my work schedule would be on call. I would inform my second job I could not work those hours due to being on call and would end up not being needed 90% of the time.
bad,"I have worked at Abercrombie on and off since I was 18 and have witnessed a great amount of change in the company. "
bad,"good experience if it's your first job, but overall it needs better management or maybe just at the store I worked for. There's a lot of gossips and maybe it's just not my environment to work for."
bad,"Standing and faking your enthusiasm for overpriced clothing can be hard, especially when listening to the same 5 songs all day.  It was loud and smelled very strong all the time."
bad,"Working at Abercrombie has its days. I twas fun at times some days it was very boring, I wasn't too fond of the management, we didn't get enough hours."
bad,"I've worked for both Abercrombie & Fitch and its sister company Hollister over the past few years and I have gained very valuable management experience. However, the day to day work was very boring and I feel like I didn't utilize my business management degree. Every day, there would be different tasks that the company would assign to either the opening manager or the closing manager. It was frustrating to me personally because I would go into work not knowing what to expect. There was not much consistency in this job and the schedule was very difficult to work with, which is typical for retail in general. Our schedule for the following week wouldn't come out until Friday so it was very difficult to plan out our week, whereas other retail stores created their schedule weeks in advance so it would be easier to accommodate personal schedules. For the most part, however, my co-workers were the best part of the job. They made it a fun environment and throughout the years I've worked for this company I have enjoyed most of my co-workers. I have really learned a lot about how to manage people effectively and how to communicate with people who have different communication styles."
bad,"You're a slave to the job and for absolutely nothing in return. "
bad,"Not very people oriented. When I left I felt as though I was just an expendable employee. In the nights, I would just fold and the leads would tell you what to do and just talk to their friends the rest of the night."
bad,"The workplace was boring and systematic. No one could be themselves and bring personality into the store, everyone used the same punchlines and no one wanted to be there."
bad,"Although the environment was really laid back and the other employees were easy to get along with,  this is a very unstable part-time job.  You don't receive many hours.  The only ones who do are full-timers.  4 managers only.  The rest are just replacements.  No matter how hard you work,  don't expect to get more shifts.  I've gone 2 weeks without any shifts, and when I did after the 3rd week,  I only received ONE...  CALL IN.  Don't waste your time here,  pay isn't good either."
bad,"Hired as seasonal; at first, it was fine. I got a decent amount of hours. Then after a few weeks, they started cancelling my shifts and eventually only gave me call-in shifts in which they never need me for. After the season was over, they kept me on but I never get any hours. They only give me about one call-in shift a week that they never actually need me for. They are always behind on scheduling. I was told schedules would be out Wednesday or Thursday so there would be one day to fix any scheduling issues. The schedules were not released until Friday and if there are any issues, they won't fix it. You have to ask people to switch with you and then let the managers know."
bad,they only give four hour shifts and its against company policy for typical employees to be allowed much more than that. they don't want anyone getting close to full time pay or benefits.
bad,This company allows for a casual work day vibe that contributes to  maintaining and running clothes while from the stock room while providing great customer service.
bad,"Poor management, you never get the hours you want. Literally, you just walk around trying to find something to do and act as if you're folding cloths."
bad,"This place was like a ""kids job"" could not be taken seriously with all the foolishness and bad management."
bad,Overall the expectations were very explicit and clear for what was expected during the work week. Hardest part of the Job was working with property management to allow technicians onsite to fix the store when damaged.
bad,"Assistant managers don't make nearly enough money for what they have to put up with. Overtime hours can get really stressful."
bad,"- Learned to be very patient"
bad,"A&F company is a place to work at as a second job. The company is horrible. Sleazy work environment, however very easy job. Just keep a level head and do not get frustrated. A lot of miss communication. Not worth the trouble working here."
bad,This has to be the most unprofessional job i have ever worked at and it was my first job in general you didnt get not even a 15 min break when working 5 hours or less.
bad,The work environment and the job itself ask too much for the employee and can be very stressful. In most cases the amount of work I've put into the job has not nearly added up to satisfaction of the company expects. With poor management and unenthusiastic workers made it very difficult to do job without feeling overwhelmed.
bad,it is a outstanding business but the pay isnt so satisfying.
bad,I learned how to do inventory and make sure all the clothes on the sales floor is at its stack height also learned how to process our shipment boxes as in senor the products and backstock them where they belong. i also learned how to scan in shipment boxes and how to do transfers. There is not hard part about the job and the most enjoyable is the we do charity fund raising games. The co-workers are the ones that keep the place going we joke around but at the same time we get what we need done.
bad,Hard to get hours. Unreasonable expectations for hourly pay.
bad,Summer retail at a minimum wage position. High employee and management turnover
bad,The managers are nice but it is definitely not a stable job for a student. It is a small store with many employees so unless your a manager or have been with the company for years you can expect to be on call for the duration of your employment with them.
bad,"I currently work for Abercrombie Kids. A typical day at work includes getting a 5 minute meeting with a manager (they quiz you on what's on the bulletin board in the stockroom). Management is okay at first, but then they show their true colors. Co-workers are alright but really no time for socialization. The most enjoyable part of the job is probably that they are flexible and understand students have other responsibilities. There's nothing really hard about it, it can just get annoying. One time my manager got upset with me because my sleeves were rolled up and another time because I had my arms crossed while I was listening to a customer."
bad,"Company tries too hard to be perfect - based on one persons point of view, CEO. Culture gets old after a while, then most people start leaving."
bad,Managers at the Seaport location are horrible
bad,"The company as a whole likes to work their full time employees to the bone, requires overtime and barely gives annual raises. Promotions are based on the district manager's favorites and you could be transferred, fired, or promoted with only a day's notice. Day to day you work with rude customers, and rude teenage employees. They only give part-timers a maximum of 8 hours a week so they never get enough time to be trained to do their job well. Hiring is done weekly so you are always training a new hire. They are crazy about hours budgets and must stay within them even if it means cutting shifts when there is a ton of work to do. Luckily a majority of the managers are really cool people which makes this job tolerable."
bad,"Fun environment to work, extremely stressful for the amount of pay."
bad,"It's a good job if you live at home or if you're in high school. You will need two jobs to bring in decent money. Hours are not stable at all, the managers have favorites, lots of drama, and you are expected to do a lot. The pay is not worth it at all. If you want to be in retail, apply somewhere else."
bad,You will be scheduled anywhere from one-hour shifts to 4 hours and its all you get except for holidays. Management just sits in the back and eats and goes on their phone while telling everyone what to do.
bad,"no air very hot, poor management, short hours no work orders,"
bad,There’s was tons of drama between coworkers on the job. Instructions were poorly given resulting in an excellent coworker being fired. Manager created favoritism within the workplace.
bad,The pay was horrible because they think their clothes should justify compensation for hard work. Hours are tough especially during the holidays. Great people to work with though.
bad,"This job will be good if you're in high school. They don't give much hours, but gets you started in having retail experience for any future jobs. Not the greatest"
bad,A typical day here would include organizing and folding clothes or restocking the backroom. I learned a lot about customer service here but the management was not very helpful. I had to figure out a lot on my own without help from my superiors.
bad,a typical day you go in check if there is a long line if so get on second register and help . If not so busy then go to the back and sort out clothes and online orders
bad,I was fresh out of high school working at A&F and I was short lived of working there. It was a nightmare for me and I left because the pay was low and they hired new employees and gave them the most hours.
bad,Place is a joke. Trying to get promoted was like pulling teeth. Had nothing to do with experience and more with how much you were liked. Managers seemed to have swelled heads about being managers. AS if they were CEOs of a company and they were here to dictate our every move.
bad,Fun first job but not much to do doesn’t get much business always empty very dark environment hard to see things especially prices workers not very pro active when colustomera enter
bad,"This was my first job and it wasn’t a very good experience. I would work 2 hour shifts and 3 days a week, this went on for the first 2 months. Management was not very good they would schedule me when I was at school."
bad,This was a very good job for someone in high school. They worked well with my schedule. The pay was not all they great but it was fine for when i was a student.
bad,It was a very big warehouse with not much central air. The breaks were short since some as spent getting to the break area. When slow you were still expected to achieve your numbers if the work was present or not.
bad,A&F was a fun environment to work in. Talking to customers about the latest  trends and fashion icons. The discounts were a plus to working as well. And overtime pay during the holidays.
bad,"job consisted of helping costumers by offering a variety of options of clothes, while also working the cash register, and making sure that the store is presentable for the public"
bad,"I pretty much stayed in the back and/or folded clothing with the girl who was slightly overweight.  They wanted a certain ""look"" for the customer service people who worked up front."
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of balancing between customer assistance and store maintenance. I learned a lot about sales and how to pitch to customers. There was a lot of diversity in the workplace. The hardest part of the job had to be the physical demands of being on your feet all day and the strong fragrance smell, the most enjoyable was the good friends I made there!"
bad,"Time management is key with being in this position. You have your responsibilities in the stock room and also on the floor so you are spread a little thin. If understaffed, you will need to open/close the store as a manager and also supervise your stock associates in the back doing shipment. It can be very stressful some days and others can be slow. It all depends on the tasks that you have for the day and if you have associates that are available to help. I worked here for about 3 years and pay increased by only 50cents."
bad,i was paid minimum wage and worked in high school. it was a good first job for experience but besides that i wouldnt work for the company. it was an overall bad experience
bad,the pay here is horrible there is not goals noting that pushes you to do more no communication on anything products no training and the hours they give you are awful
bad,"Greeting Customers, Stocking and Shipping orders out. The Hardest part was doing floor sales reducing prices, and changing the entire store around. Multitasking along with checking customers in and out."
bad,Everyone would get upset to no hours being given to employees. They only gave us about 5-15 hours a week. Other than that it wasn’t  a hard Job. We just had to greet people and help them around.
bad,i dont bad talk anyone but this is ridiculous they hire entirely too many people to even work your lucky if you get a day week to work. you can pick up shifts to work but on facebook group. no way you could survive with just this job alone.
bad,"I felt like the company did not get put together well it was hard to work for them when no one knew what to do or what they should do or how to do it, i was stressed there and not happy with my job where i saw myself going with this company"
bad,Working at Abercrombie was not an ideal work environment for me. Some employees did not show up to work (i.e. they quit without any kind of notice) Left the other employees to cover shifts of people who did not show up. Manager left work once without any word and never came back (quit her job without a notice).
bad,You can find yourself stuck here in the same position. They will make it look there is room for advancement when there isn't. There  a lot favoritism.
bad,"it was okay as far as gaining experience in customer service and retail, but the people were fake, the hours were terrible, and everything about it felt wrong. i wouldn't recommend working there unless you want to spend hours folding clothes and standing and being the yes-man to everyone you speak to."
bad,"Current management lacks communication skills and creates a passive aggressive work environment when an associate does not complete tasks up to standard. There is minimal training for new employees so they do not know how to fulfill their tasks to said standard. If an associate has worked at Abercrombie & Fitch long enough to know the job duties, they will be treated better than new associates."
bad,"I am a very upbeat, welcoming, and level-headed individual, but the environment at Abercrombie can wear on you after time. Working in a fast pace store with loud techno pop music blaring, flashing multicolor lights, and nearly intoxicating perfumes and colognes for hours at a time. may or may not be for you. The store I worked at was overstaffed and hours were hard to come by. Working 20 hours a week for $8.25 just isn't optimal for anyone, yet alone for someone looking to save up or take care of a family. Cannot complain too heavily about management and coworkers, because that is an extremely subjective matter."
bad,"It can be fun, but it all depends on management, and I think that is the key thing to what will make or break your experience. Personally I loved Abercrombie until I had a recent manager that I did not agree with or like."
bad,Work atmosphere is excellent and cooperative and always information is available on the SharePoint. Team is very interactive and helpful. Management communicates all the updates on time
bad,Good clean environment very slow pace at times but however work environment can get very busy at times. People there where generally helpful and wanted to help me as a sales associate
bad,"When I worked at Abercrombie and Fitch, I was constantly yelled at and respected poorly. The management I had when I worked there favored the employees that worked on the sales floor way more than where I worked in the back receiving shipment and stocking the store."
bad,"I would never go back to this company for many reasons. First of all, and this might just be retail, but when a customer is on their phone of in the middle of a conversation, it is rude to interrupt them to tell them about the store promotions. Second of all, the managers are fresh out of graduating college and can be very petty. I left this company because I found out from the one assistant manager, the the other assistant manager and the store's manager were talking rudely about me and other employees behind our back. They were also cutting my hours and planning on doing it more because they didn't see me talking to customers, even though I did and did everything else they asked of me. They did this even though to my face they told me I was one of the best workers that they had. It was just rude and childish in my opinion."
bad,The staff is very friendly and you receive a great discount. The schedule is very flexible but do not pursue a career from this place. This is also anther job that is only for college students or models.
bad,"This company gives a very relaxing environment to work in. Everyone is very welcoming and generally nice. However, working with this company can be stressful as they do not give enough hours to their staffs."
bad,We didn't get paid enough for the people I had to help. Staff was fun but overall bad place to be working. I had good hours. There is no room to move up. you need a degree to be a manager
bad,"AnF sounds like a good brand because they are good at marketing themselves. however internally, this job you do not want. too much of you is required for little pay. you will soon feel like slave working here their expectations and some of the people that work in the higher positions are not the best."
bad,"We do hard work and get no recognition for it , the managers blame us fellow associate for their mistakes and its like no matter how hard you work it will never be enough to satisfy the management"
bad,I got hired at Abercrombie as a seasonal employee for black Friday and they had hired way too many employees and they didn't have enough tasks for everyone to do so we were told to go unfold the clothes on display and refold them to look like we were doing something productive.
bad,"Un journée type : 5h max sur la surface de vente"
bad,"Abercombie & Fitch from a sales associate perspective is mostly for students who need a part time job. However, with a bachelors degree one can be promoted to management."
bad,"Its a great company, to start you're retail experience. "
bad,"Managers were not professional at all. The managers I had working at this job were racist and vulgar. Zero care of the associates, as we were just used as slaves to retrieve them coffee and lunch. Managers never held associates responsible for getting work done. The job itself was very boring and easy. Basically stand around and greet people, and clean in the mornings and evenings."
bad,"this is a great job for someone starting off, especially people who can not work many hours. the ceo makes it customary to have a degree in order to manage the store which is awful because you have managers that have not experienced being on the floor as a sales associate/model."
bad,"My day of work with A&F consists of cleaning the back room, organizing shelves full of clothes, and helping customers. I would work for 5 hours a shift and help customers shop for clothes."
bad,"A&F in Ala Moana is one of the most visited retail stores throughout the mall and is rarely not busy."
bad,A typical day can be very fast paced. However we cater to all of our customers needs while going above and beyond for them.
bad,"Not enough hours, would need two job when working at this place. some of the people are ok to work with and some of the management is ok also"
bad,"Working at Abercrombie and Fitch, because of the diversity, I met a lot people, and learned about others culture. The employees were friendly, and the store had a relaxed vibe to it. We also received free clothing once every two months as brand representatives. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with customers who were very inpatient or dealing with managers who were too swell- headed of their position.  A typical day at work would be clocking in, and having our five minute meeting before our shift started, we would then be assigned to a specific area on the floor, and we would have to maintain that area while providing customer service."
bad,"During my short time with this company, I was required to ensure that the store was always in pristine condition. I learned how to push product and how to analyze body language to determine if I was truly ""selling"" the product. It was also my responsibility to showcase the new clothes each month and exhibit the company's image and brand. The management was very hands-off and the culture between staff was very open and social, which was probably the most enjoyable part of the job."
bad,"The pay is questionable but travel time out ways greatly, company policies just arent realistic or far for that matter one minute late same  equals same ocurrance as one hour, no pay increase from seasonal to associate bottom line the people are nice and job is a good source of secondary income."
bad,"bad working environment. its all about the numbers and sales. I thought it would be a fun place to work . my co workers are all very nice . I am a person that focuses on the job and always follows directions , never asked for a 15 min break in all my time working there. one time I asked cause I was working 5 hours straight from school to work and they didn't give me a break. so the company doesn't focus on their employers needs, they just cared about the numbers. Its very boring , I had to stand for hours just folding and hanging clothes."
bad,"Overall, Abercrombie was a really cool place to work. I just worked in a bad district. I didn't the culture of environment of the store I worked in. Since they have a new CEO I don't know how the company has changed."
bad,"no room for advancement"
bad,"Abercrombie and Fitch was my first experience with customer service. Day to day tasks would include greeting customers as they walked in the door, cashier services, and answering every and any question a customer would have. It was a great learning experience and prepared me for my future employment and endeavors."
bad,Every time I went to work I was working with new people. Just never worked with people twice. You never get the chance to get comfortable when you are working for new people every other day you are at work.
bad,"The job was fine, i learned lot about the warehouse system. the management was not great. I think they need better leaders that actually care about there hard workers and want to see them move up into different positions. The co workers aren't very friendly, and they have a real large turn over."
bad,"Very loud workplace with high turnover rate.  Hours are unpredictable and often few, but it is relatively easy to get shifts covered or swapped.  Very fast paced with a lot of pressure to perform, provides a gppd learning environment.  Management is often inexperienced and changes quickly."
bad,"The people I work with are great. Fun, sweet  group. Store managers at my store are really nice for the most part. They can only work with what head office gives them. "
bad,"less hours"
bad,"bad hours "
bad,Ideal for young person seeking fun workplace with loud music and tons of clothes.
bad,Loved the people but did'nt care much for the hours due to  to many workers to give hours
bad,"a typical day at Abercrombie&Fitch would be for me as i was a stock assistant . Making sure we had all shipments , checking for any damaged merchandise , assisted to employees looking for a certain item that would not be displayed . making sure displays  were well presented and able to look through . Assisted with fitting rooms making sure any customer that wanted to try on items had the opportunity to use a fitting room . giving advice if asked for opinon with customers trying on clothes . I learned working at Abercrombie&Fitch to not get distracted , always finish an assignment given to you first then attend to what else is needed . always smile and never argue with customers ."
bad,Customer interaction with marketing and goal oriented. Job that kept you busy at all times.
bad,"Group interview, very little hours, mostly 4 hour shift only, have to buy there clothing every month to wear to work"
bad,The hours are not consistent. Barely any work to do. Very prejudice about appearance in the hiring process. Management ma trick you into buying uncomfortable clothing. The wage is minimum. It's not the ideal job.
bad,I hated this job they worked you like a dog for a small paycheck
bad,"fold clothes and greet customers"
bad,"i enjoyed it for the most part, It was a job that enjoyed going to but I didnt know anyone there so that was a bit of a bummer."
bad,"The company at first was a great fit for my over all schedule. I am a student and also have another job. So the hours they gave me at first were great. But then as the end of my first semester classes approached, I needed to change my hours and now I have ended up with 0. I enjoyed most of my co-workers. Management was great except for the store manager. She tends to be very disrespectful and rude. I didn't learn much other than to fold a shirt really nice. The most enjoyable part of my job was the upbeat environment. The hardest part of my job was the ""look policy""."
bad,"a job that helps me make basic payments."
bad,I learned how to deal with customers on a daily basis and how to gain great customer service while handling situations where the customer is unsatisfied.
bad,"Long days, mistreatment from upper management and non-realistic expectations from Home Office."
bad,"One of the best things about Abercrombie is the fact that you get to meet and work with a lot of cool people who share the same hobbies and interests as you. But other than that, I would say this isn't one of the best jobs you can get as a student (and thats me putting it in a nice way). I didnt learn anything new here but I would say I enhanced my customer service skills while working here due to large volume of complaints you have to deal with everyday while working. Management can be good and can be bad, because of the fact that many managers are always using the company as a stepping stone into their careers and as soon as they find something better they're gone. But generally the management is okay at its best. Co-workers are great and im sure any person can fit right in as soon as they're hired. There isn't anything hard about the job but I would say the hardest thing would be to not get bored of the job within a month of being hired. Most enjoyable part of the job would be the socializing with customers and co-workers."
bad,"typical day includes folding and 'tagging' customers, very easy job, co workers are cool enough, but the work is really really boring, the management are pretty useless and only care about themselves and hiring more 'hot' sales rep. you'll probably only get one shift a week since they usually hire around 250 at any given time"
bad,"- Good job for business majors right out of college"
bad,"It was a good place to work at, but there were no raises within the company. I know people who had worked there for 2 whole years and continued to be payed 7.25. The working environment was meant for that of high school students and the management is not trained well nor very professional, treating their employees like trash at times. Although the hours are flexible I would never work there again."
bad,"On an average day I would have to open or close the store depending on the shift I had. That included being a key holder, opening registers and leaving a sign off with the business for the day. Customer service was the top priority of the experience. I was trained in Loss Prevention and how to keep the standard of the store."
bad,"It's a management position in retail, be on your toes. This job requires floor supervision, multi-tasking, and close attention to detail. If you like challenges this job will be ideal for you but this isn't a job where you expect to sit around all day and do nothing."
bad,Learn to work more with my co-workers . They didn't have good management to many personal feelings towards the employees.
bad,"Most of my daily job tasks involved handling new shipment, organizing clothing racks, folding merchandise, and assisting customers. The environment was stressful at times but taught me how to handle situations under pressure."
bad,"I did not like working here. The hours were very bad. It was poorly managed. The pay was horrible, I stayed for two years and it was like that from day 1."
bad,It is a fun easy going environment where everybody gets along.
bad,expanded my atttention to detailand the art of being a visual merchant.
bad,"They send managers to roam the malls and recruit pretty people to work in their store. They also take pictures of their employees to send out to regional managers for approval. Customer service is non-existent. Employees are only there to look good and fold clothes perfectly. Managers were scheduled for a minimum of 50 hours a week but only got paid half time for every hour over 40, instead of getting time and a half like other places. Turnover is ridiculously high, so if you actually manage to stick it out there, you can be promoted rather quickly. The benefits were decent but the pay was a little lower than what a lot of other retailers offer, especially for the amount of hours worked per week."
bad,"I’m fairly satisfied with Abercrombie. However, every associate gets paid the exact same (literally minimum wage) regardless of how hard they work, the only benefits are getting clothes for a discount. The work environment is okay but it’s upsetting when I see managers sitting around not doing any work while the associates slave away for 7 hours and earning their $50."
bad,Poor hours given. The some managers are not qualified for the job. Fun and nice environment but there is a lot of preference between managers and brand representative. Very poor salary.
bad,You'll be doing a lot of nothing whilst the team lounges around on their phones and chit chatting. This job is perfect for a high schooler trying to make some bucks while in school. That's all.
bad,"I wouldn't recommend working at this retail establishment. It isn't the best work/life environment for those within the management field. Had some great memories but also some awful ones, and the pay for the amount of BS you have to put up with isn't worth it at all. Not to mention the petty drama that comes with it from upper management."
bad,"Abercrombie was my first clothing retail job. Working on the sales floor was very noisy and somewhat hard to endure due to the lack of lighting and dark furniture. After working on the sales floor for 2 months I applied for a stockroom position, which after getting I felt was more suitable for me, because I could see and was able to hear my colleagues if they needed help."
bad,A typical day is just making sure you interact with all customers. Not a bad first retail job but not recommended for those who don't like to be in customer service.
bad,"Good for temporary job.  The work is often redundant and management is poorly executed.  Fun work environment , but much time is spent standing still at a table."
bad,people are nice with different backgrounds. people are super friendly and helpful. you will become like family working here. sometimes work can be stressful
bad,"Hourly pay low, short breaks, and they hold grudges against employees. Need to treat employees better and raise the hourly pay in order to keep people. Get paid for breaks but the walking distance to the break room and the time they give you aren't worth even going to break. Might as well keep working."
bad,"very flexible, great customer service skills learned communication with all managers. customer service is a huge asset, easy, social, laid back, make new friends. working at home can make things boring and run out of things"
bad,It's an overall easy job but they are notorious for not giving you hours unless you have a completely open availability. I learned a lot from this job and Hollister as well. Both run the same way.
bad,"the management was very unstable, the coworkers were very friendly and the environment was very relaxed I just was getting my hours cut so much it was horrible.the hardest part was making hours. I enjoyed working with my co-workers especially if you were closing it was nice to conversate as you cleaned and folded the entire store down. I was able to work on multitasking and working with customers from all types of backgrounds which exposed me to cultures and understanding of different rational"
bad,"If the SM cares and no one under her does, such as the GM and Assistants then it doesn't matter and the store is a failed work environment, and business. Its very unfortunate when lemons are continued to be hired instead of people who actually care and want to improve the business. Its ultimately the SM's fault for not firing the people who are causing the employees (HALF)  underneath Management to quit. Been brought up various times with chances for improvement."
bad,Abercrombie and Fitch is a good company to start off after college.  It gave me experience in a lot of different areas.  I liked my time with the company and learned a lot.
bad,"Dying Company; jobs cut, lower pay and expect 55+ hours a week.  Store manager position is about $20-25k lower than any other brand. Company culture and friendships were the only thing keeping me there.  Would NEVER recommend to a friend!"
bad,This job is a joke. They tend to hire too many people so you really will never get hours or have a consistent schedule. The store is a disaster and management is terrible.
bad,Environment was fun and easy to learn.  Good way to get in and learn management and leadership skills.  Pay was not great.  Hours were awful.  Advancement was not there.
bad,Not a great work life balance. Hectic. Managers are on the floor like associates doing the same work. Not what I thought it was going to be like.
bad,"if you're not used to the retail working culture, it's very fast paced and the holidays are the worst. weekends are the busiest so as a manager, it's hard to get a day off at those days. there is also no communication with the management team and everyone is in it for themselves. You have to wear many hats that are not in your job description a lot of times and usually understaffed."
bad,"After my hiring manager got promoted the store received a new manager who was extremely unprofessional in my opinion. I've received so many complaints from customers on her. She made customers feel uncomfortable and also most of the employees. She favored the males employees more than the females. She was immature and gave employees hours based off of who she likes the most. Therefore, i didn't receive many hours at all. I stated on my schedule that i am available 24/7, literally and only received one day a week and it was a four hour shift."
bad,"Processed all sales transactions and balanced cash drawer with accuracy"
bad,"Retail Manager is on the top ten worst jobs 2016. I will agree with this. The customers take the life out of you. The managers point at what they want to get done and they rarely help. Just ask anyone that works in retail period. How do you feel about your customers. I guarantee they will say whatever its a job, or I hate them."
bad,"Very good job to work at if you love clothes. The pay is terrible. Made you do things that was ridiculous for $7.25-$7.50 pay, in store management was awesome!!! Outside management like DM's only think about themselves and their business with Abercrombie, not caring to the employees. Terrible company to work for."
bad,"How i precieved this store was to be very snotty adn not very welcoming to customers, BUT it smeeled very good, wok place stays clean, the music is not famillar but very upbeat and enjoyable."
bad,"enjoyed the people i worked with, fun environment,work space was great, management was good, most enjoyable part of the job was working alone sometimes"
bad,Fine to start at but that's pretty much it. The company does not support their managers. The customers are awful and the company does not really care. No balance at all.
bad,"- job can be very monotonous and boring"
bad,"I joined A&F August 2014 , great management with wonderful coworkers,everyone just left high school or was in college. That's when they gave out hours,  very carefree /hardworking staff . Let's  fast forward to August 2015. You are lucky to get scheduled for a day out of the week. The new manger is very nonchalant ,  sarcastic,curses like a sailor and always responds with a attitude, like you owe her something. Unfortunately many  coworkers (6)/assistant managers (2) left because of her. Her work ethic could use Improvment and she should humble herself . Um..the store is nice, the clothes are fine, but I wouldn't recommend working their if you're someone looking for hours. 😊😊😊"
bad,"This job was a learning experience to say the least. It opened my eyes to what I need to look for in a future employer. There was a lack of job security with this company as they brought people in to the company to take over current employees jobs. They had the current employees train the new hires on their job, then after the current employees trained the new hires, they let the current employees go. Instead of offering internal growth in the company to the current employees, they just let them go after a year or more of service. Also when it came to management, when a problem was brought to their attention, they would ignore any issues lower level employees brought to them. There was also a lot of favoritism that was demonstrated with the new hires, compared to the current employees. There were 20+ people that were let go after they trained the new hire employees. That seems to be a large number of people to be let go at one time.This is why I felt there was no job security with this company."
bad,"It was a unique learning experience for being a young adult working in the retail world. However, the company did not support their employees and management was never very helpful."
bad,I spent most days stocking shelves and folding clothes in the inventory room.
bad,"nice people and co worker ,"
bad,"I did not like working at Abercrombie & Fitch. Mangement was very unorganized and not very nice. On the other hand, co-workers were very nice and friendly. The hardest part of my job was having to clean up a huge mess of clothes with very little help, as well as, trying to keep up with my work schedule that was always sent late. However, I did learn retail experience, as well as, customer service experience. The most enjoyable part of my job was the friendly co-workers and customers."
bad,This is a good temporary job for those who has many other obligations in life. Not a permanent job or possible career move.  Overall most of the management team are cool and down to earth hard working people and the part-time associates as well as the leads are terriffic hard working people. The job is very much self explainatory. The hours are not really good or abundant for that matter.
bad,I received international and business management experience and met a lot of great people.
bad,"It is an amazing post-graduate opportunity to gain industry experience. "
bad,"A typical day at work was very redundant.  There was little room for management advice within the company.  I learned the importance of recruiting for certain companies and who is the right fit for particular companies.  It really taught me to have confidence approaching random people and helped me with my customer service skills and overall confidence in the ability to run a store and be in charge.  The hardest part of this job was to adapt to the way the company is run and to me it seemed more task oriented and less customer service based.  The most enjoyable part of this job was working with my co-workers, I really enjoyed who I was working with."
bad,"A fast paced environment that requires a lot of energy, patience, time and mental strength. Some days were very intense especially when someone from corporate headquarters came in or when the store was bombarded with a lot of customers. You would spend 10-12 hours the night before trying to make the store perfect. And then there were other days were it was relaxed and calm, but sometimes you would get bored. The hardest part of the job was dealing with associates that would not listen when you had to get items on the sales floor in an urgent manner and customers destroying the store. The most enjoyable part of the job was hearing customers saying, ""thank you"" and ""you helped me out a lot."" However, I learned how to deal with different personalities, and to try and bring up issues right away so they do not escalate."
bad,"I packed clothes in boxes ."
bad,"AS long as you do your work right and don't have a bad attitude, working at A&F is okay.  As an impact team member we were responsible for getting merchandise out on to the sales floor at a constant rate, so on any day your duties could range from running clothes from the stock room onto the sales floor, preparing clothes to be stocked away, or be put out on the sales floor, marking merchandise for clearance, or discontinuing items and so on.  Each day started with a 5-minute-meeting where we would go over the sales goals for the day and the manager would let you know what your tasks for the day were."
bad,"The hours are flexible and can go around with school very easily but if your looking for a place to be yourself and grow the way you want to grow in the company then it's not a really good place for that. The workers (part-time, leads, etc) are great and really fun to work with but the managers (asst.,Dept., GM's) are somewhat a buzz kill (some not all). Overall it's ok but not a place you want to stay with long term. "
bad,"abercrombie is a fun place to work when in high school. Its a friendly environment when not being remembered of how you don't meet ""cast off"" standards."
bad,"It's a suck hole, the place is shallow and superficial, and I have hated every day I have worked there. "
bad,"its hard to understand how this company is still around when there is no outside influence coming to challenge the obnoxious CEO. Corporate has no understanding of the store level and have one of the highest turnarounds I have seen, "
bad,"Providing customer service and maintaining presentation standards. Passion for the brand, multi-tasking, adaptability / flexibility, attention to detail, product knowledge and customer focus."
bad,"It's retail. Obviously that comes with bad hours and working with public. After that though, wearing the uncomfortable clothes and being forced to buy new ones every 3 months gets old. Listening to the loud music gets old. Work is dependent on if you have a good SM or a good DM. Unfortunately both of mine were bad."
bad,"One of the good things about the job is that I get to interact with different kinds of people. The most enjoyable part is that it's a laid back environment. The hardest part of the job is that is not challenging enough, it's the same thing day in and day out when it comes to the tasks at hand."
bad,"A typical workday consist of greeting customers, restocking sales floor and organizing stock room. I learned the true aspects of retail because customers can be either really nice and patient or angry and in a hurry. Management was horrible. The manager was way to young and immature for that position. She didn't like to give people hours. We never went through any training everything we did was pretty much on our own. My co-workers were really nice. We helped one another with task and taught each other the best way to do things. The hardest part of this job was everything and the most enjoyable part was when I left."
bad,"I was working there for about a month and only worked one shift. They payed lower than minimum wage. Makes employees buy their clothes before they start working. ""pay money to earn money"""
bad,This was a fun place to work. My team members were fun and it environment was high energy almost all the time. Its a good place to get some experience as a teen
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that you are working with young people. The management is awful and they create a frat-like atmosphere. Most of the managers were incredibly immature, dishonest, and selfish. There were some nice people of course, but overall the company culture is exactly the stereotype. It is shallow, ruthless, and the company associates are underpaid compared to other retailers. The hours are also terrible and if you work overtime as a manager, you get paid half your hourly rate, not time and a half like most companies. I do not recommend the M.I.T. program to anyone."
bad,"managed 60 plus employees. used a lot of loss prevention techniques, and maintained a neat shopping environment"
bad,its a regular retail or clothing store that has new management changes all the time and when new manger came they hired new people to work
bad,"Great place to learn how to be a manager, the pay is horrible, you work long hours, nights and weekends."
bad,"The job is fun because of the people, but it can get very boring and repetitive"
bad,This company is a good company to work for the get retail experience. It’s a nice clean store to work at but I’d say it’s a place to work if you want to add experience to your resume.
bad,"I am not sure if it was just the Abercombie and Fitch I worked at or all of them but it was a bad experience. The shifts are only 4-5 hours you can work doubles or triples but the HAVE to be 1 hour apart. You don’t get any breaks, my store had 6 floors and they got mad if you took the elevator but it was ok for them to take the elevators. Managers were extremely rude"
bad,Every employee except management worked about 6 hours a week. They would expect t associates to go above and beyond while giving terrible service to costumers themselves. Two of the managers were racist to the point of costumer complaint. It was one of the worst job experiences. But it was easy.
bad,"This was a flexible job to work part time. Pay was not good, and little chance of moving up in the company. The managers were usually nice and understanding."
bad,"ENSURE business strategy and execution is informed by and sensitive to the countries & cultures where we do business"
bad,"Many hours, management understaffed always. High turnover among employees. Upper management not helpful with training. Unflexible hours. Loss prevention team does not care about anyone but themselves."
bad,"At work, I would do the usual like be on the cashier or be on the fitting rooms. I learned to take things slow and pay attention to details like counting coins and money. Some managers would be rude when you ask a question or simply give a lot of attitude to the workers and customers."
bad,"Management cannot make decisions - constant spin and rework on everything that we do.  Leadership has been changing every 9-12 months for about 5 years leading to constant unknowns, reporting decks being redone and very schizophrenic decision making."
bad,"Working 10 hour + days, only 1 weekend off a month. A few times a month you will work till 2am or 3am for updates. Shifts are usually 9am-6pm or 2pm till 11pm. You are responsible for 30 college students and a team of 4 managers. Do not expect help or assistance from the company. You are all on your own."
bad,"The time being at Abercrombie&Fitch was a great learning experience. My communication skills was fantastic, and making sure things were in order from top to bottom was one of the easiest task. I didn’t approve of the vast spending of my pay check just to wear the company’s clothing. I also didn’t approve of the way hairstyles had to look. While working I didn’t like the fact that I had to have a clean cut face."
bad,"Really good experience overall, really learned about the retail world and how brands work. A typical day at work would be running the clothes from the stockroom, taking care of customers. One good thing about this brand is that they really put their customers as their top priority."
bad,Abercrombie overall is a decent company but I feel as if they have too many employees and that cuts alot of hours off for so many others and just overall makes the pay rate lower.
bad,Sales associate. Not much to say about position. Job for young people (High School or early college). Minimum wage and no raises ever. Not a good job. You greet people and fold clothes.
bad,"Abercrombie and Fitch does not have the best reputation for a good reason. While this job was very chill, it was not something I will ever be able to thank for developing me in anyway."
bad,I was most of the times working alone with no supervision and no one taught me how to do the job properly. I just had to learn it by myself and I would not recommend working there.
bad,"Originally, I started out with a bad management team before being transferred to a different location. The management team was great at the next location, but the number of staff/part-timers dramatically decreased. No help was offered from anyone as it was expected of the managers to convince people to apply to this job/location. Something to keep in mind though: minimum wage, difficult location to get to and from, no parking, lots of foot traffic. It was near impossible to hire people, much less keep the ones who did apply for long. Without a decent part-time team, managers had to compensate and over-work themselves."
bad,Working here sucks. I got paid minimum wage and never got a single raise. It was easy to get shifts but managers were bad and did not allow overtime at all.
bad,"Work here while you're young. Not sure if there is much advancement once you reach a certain age. The MIT program was very helpful to learn about store operations and recruitment but management is concerned about numbers, not about individuals."
bad,"you clock in and the manager will tell you to do something. For example, they ,might ask you to put away the go-backs (clothes that people leave in the fitting rooms etc. They would also ask you to fold any clothes pile that was messy. Typically, they only schedule people for only four hours shift.  Hardest part of the job was when you were understaffed and you would get a ""rush"" (when a lot of people come in at the same time). Most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers, we would all talk and the environment is very relaxed and slow."
bad,"Abercrombie is the place you go for a first time job. They're always looking for friendly faces, but the downfall of that is that they hire so many people that they barely have hours to schedule all of the employees, so you end up with minimal hours and small paychecks."
bad,Une entreprise qui hésite dans son management et la gestion de sa marque. Ils donnent leur chance aux débutants et les forme. Plus un tremplin pour les jeunes qu'une vrais perspective de carrière.
bad,"Its a lot of politics, thus you don't have to be great, just be great at kissing tush. They overload you with tons of shipment, but cut hours, making it impossible to get caught up. The people that work there are the best part, but no one below management has incentive to stay when they're only making minimum wage. Very high turnover rate, but easy job overall."
bad,"Frankly I don't remember much about my brief time working there. Although I did have a romance with a fellow employee who was working with me there. She was cute, and for that I am grateful to Abercrombie."
bad,"Very professional , flexible, but the management has to train their "" Bachelor ""level managers what legal and illegal in the united states. "
bad,This job was fine for college and the pay was in line with what i could expect given my expertise. Culture was light and fun but i can not imagine working there as a seasoned professional. it was excellent for what it was.
bad,At Abercrombie & Fitch there was a diverse group of individuals. It was a friendly environment. I worked with co workers who challenged each other to grow and exceed.
bad,"Great atmosphere and workforce, low compensation and almost impossible to maintain work/life balance. Ok as a starter job or when in between jobs, but definitely not a ""career."""
bad,"There simply just wasn't much to do, or a lot of hours to work. You are given 2 to 3 shifts a week to work, each shift lasting 4 hours. This is because of the nature of the job being one that is over staffed so they can keep ""fresh faces"" in the store. You also have to buy the clothes to wear as a uniform so the first week you'll spend more money then you'll make."
bad,"Abercrombie & Fitch has a lot of pros and cons. (Speaking as a manager) The best being working with fun, outgoing, cool, and friendly people. This was one of the things I enjoyed most about my time with the company were the great group of fascinating people I got to work with everyday. Laughing together made it feel like less of a ""job"" then it really was. A&F also offers one of the best insurance coverage plans in the industry - if you are a new recruit into management TAKE ADVANTAGE of the health benefits.  They are comparable to signing on with a Fortune 500 company. Personal providers of mine were shocked when they saw my level of coverage considering I worked for a retailer. If you are recruited to work for the company right out of university (management requires a 4 year degree) this is an amazing platform to jump off and resume booster as well. You will be given a lot of responsibility from your first day and this will impress potential future employers."
bad,"Overall it was a relaxed work environment. We would open the store by cleaning and setting the marketing. Before the store opened I would check the program and task out the associates. My weekly tasks included generating a schedule, confirming shifts, tasking out managers and associates, and recruiting people to work for the brand. Recruiting included campus visits and mall walks. "
bad,Great people and management but horrible benefits such as never receiving a raise for the whole two years I worked there.
bad,Standing all day with a strict clothing requirement and a not so friendly manager.
bad,"Employees were good to work with and there was always a fun environment."
bad,"The management program was very organized and informational, however, the pay was extremely low for a college graduate. I enjoyed the work environment, the people were all very fun and friendly. They are all about working as a team."
bad,"The discounts were great, if you were well liked by the assistant mangers they gave you a lot of hours. Hours were all based off business needs as with any other retail job but if you folded your butt of more than likely you would be the associate getting those 20 hours a week the other part time employees are dying for."
bad,Typically fun and lots of work to do throughout the day. People are great to work with. Hardest part of the job is not having weekends off and enjoyable part are the people.
bad,"Greeted customers entering the store"
bad,"I would fold clothes in a specific way and stack them on a self to later place on the floor. I could barely talk to anyone. "
bad,"On a typical day we restocked new items, take out old. Assigned to a specific area in store for the whole shift usually and have to fold clothes with boards and make sure stickers are all aligned."
bad,Did not like the job becuase they did not give me any hours and they are really strick on what you can wear and the colors you can wear.
bad,"This is not the place to work if you value people, education, or a career. "
bad,"Good experience for beginning management to learn in a fast paced environment. Good training program for introduction into the field. Requires Bachelor's degree and a certain level of attractiveness to get hired. The character of the organization is questionable at best, often asking managers to make moral compromises in hiring employees based on physical appearance, not performance. Little to no creative control with no structure to provide the corporate office with feedback. Long term employment requires constant relocation. Expect to work in an environment permeated with cologne and perfume that is misted into the air every fifteen minutes and loud music."
bad,"I had previously worked at Hollister Co. in Lexington, KY & loved it. The management and coworkers were great; they knew what they were doing. So I am in no way rating the company as a whole as this low but this branch in Portland, ME is not at all what I had hoped. I was extremely spoiled at Hollister our stock room was immaculate and the store mainained a stellar rating and rocked our secret shops. Once I came to this Abercrombie my world was turned upside down! The stock room had no organization to it, poor store rating, customer service was subpar, secret shops were rarely a success, and management was so out of touch with what they were doing and in no way knew how to communicate with each other. I did not stick around for long with this store unfortunately. It really is great for a college stundent though as they usually have over 50 eymployees and allow a lot of flexibility with scheduling!"
bad,"During my time working at Abercrombie Kids--I made some life long friendships, and enjoyed the social and friendly environment; it was very upbeat and uplifting. From folding clothes to cashing out guests who shopped us, I learned a lot about what it takes to work as a team at this company. The hardest part of the job was remembering that it was a job because everyone was very personable and friendly. However, the best part of the job was being able to work at a flagship location in one of the biggest cities in the country--Chicago, IL, and being apart of such an amazing team."
bad,-Managing associates and handeling customer issues
bad,"Monitor CCTV, Cater to store side management, Responed to safety incidents and issues. Apprehened shoplifters and conduct LP awareness workshops."
bad,I would like the job if the hours were the same everyday. The management team is terrible when it comes to correcting issues and they do not treat us like adults more like they talk to us like childen! The work is fine and the only real benefit to this job would be the benefits that they give the employee's!
bad,"They didnt train me, just threw me on the floor when absolutely needed. Management refused to listen to the staffs needs. Terrible experience, i ended up quitting."
bad,"A fun company to work for. Managers were very fun and very laid-back. Enjoyed working for them, although the pay and chances for advancement is low."
bad,Managers and coworkers were nice for the most part higher ups however didn't seem to care about employees they only cared about how well the store was doing pay was garbage it was $7.25/hr probably still is no room for advancement and when I worked there they had me doing the full time stock position without the pay of a full time stock for like 6 months before giving the actual position to someone else
bad,"Working at Abercrombie was a lot. Typical work day of regular management duties. Like store operations, recruiting, hiring, visual merchandising, delegating, etc. I learned a lot about people working here. The management was not good at all. They did a poor job at training the employees! Very unrealistic expectations and pressure with not enough resources. Very slow career advancement and promotions also. Workplace culture is somewhat fun but often turned into a lot of gossip. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with unrealistic expectations with not enough people/coverage. The most enjoyable part was the clothing discount and full time benefits like PTO/insurance. This company lacks inclusiveness and fairness and the turnover rate is terrible! This job should only be a starting point to gain experience in the workforce. Definitely not a good long term job/career."
bad,I worked at A&F for a couple of summers and I made some great friends and learned important customer service skills.  I learned the basics of working retail and had fun talking to customers
bad,"Abercrombie was my first job, I learned a lot there. Scheduling wasn’t the best, there were times when i didn’t receive a lot of hours. Other than that I definitely enjoyed my time there."
bad,"*Restock shelves "
bad,"A typical day of work consisted of attending to guests' needs as well as keeping the store organized, clean, and up to standards. The hardest part of the job was dealing with managers that had a negative attitude, but the best part was learning how to socialize with guests as it helped for jobs that I worked in later on and in daily social situations in general."
bad,"The hours aren't that great and are only meant to give you a little spending money. It's not that intensive to work there (until it is, but very rarely) and the management is very lackadaisical and lenient until they need to cover their own butt and throw you under the bus."
bad,"The job itself was boring and slow, the pay was minimum wage, and the schedules were inconsistent and hard to plan around. The schedules were based on who the mangers liked the most and we didn't have much or any time to plan because the schedules were released one week at a time often the day before we were scheduled to work."
bad,Abercrombie & Fitch is not doing well like much of retail limiting any advancement opportunities for the most part. Poor merchandising and questionable leadership have doomed the company for the past few years.
bad,"its been years since I worked there but its the perfect job if your in high school. or at least it used to be, and getting discounts on all the new clothes was fun"
bad,Looking for new opportunities. Hollister has been a stepping stone to get me through my college career and provides management and customer service experience.
bad,"Working at Abercrombie & Fitch was a good introduction into the retail business. The store was never to crowded and work was always manageable. However, if it is your first time working in retail, be prepared to spend lots of time teaching yourself how to do the job as management and experienced co-workers were never happy to help train newcomers."
bad,"No breaks, 14 hour days, mass lay offs, and a work environment that fostered people blaming others for there mistakes.  People acted like it was high school and constantly gossiped about each other."
bad,A company with high emphasis on work life balance. Provides many on campus events and encourages a healthy lifestyle through discounts to local gyms.
bad,"get to work clock in and start shipment or back stocking items."
bad,"Good place to work for the holidays , but other than that. Hours here are scarce.."
bad,"Not that great of a place to work, you get no raises or promotions unless you have a degree in something, and it does not have to be in a related field."
bad,This company is interesting. The benefits are great and so is the clothing. The customers are wonderful and I loved our different promotions.
bad,"This job was original hire for seasonal, while working here was nice there was a lot of promises for more hours and potential full time hiring this was all cut as the hours began to dwindle. The people I worked with over all seemed honest but in the end i had items stolen from me and the management over all seemed to vary from person to person. It just seemed that the store it self was run by high-schoolers that only looked out for themselves and was trying to get a better image for who they were. Literally this was my definition of one of the most nightmare like jobs I have ever had."
bad,"coworkers were nice and friendly and even fun to be with. management was rude and unfair to not only me, but other certain members."
bad,"start up meeting,leard how much work there is if we are working overtime,or not ,if a nother dep,need help,check folklift see if battary has enough lifeor need change.put boxes away or starting picking order."
bad,This was a very laid back company to work for but the company culture was terrible. The people that worked in the store were awesome and management up until the DM level was great. The corporate culture was poor and they were detached from the field.
bad,"A day at A&F was very hectic with a lot to do. Associates took on responsibilities of the unfitted business of their co-works sometimes extending the day for some. I learned how to multiple task and never letting a customer know you did not know how to do something or find an item. My co-workers were cool, but there was a divide. The hardest part was the commute and connecting with some co-workers. Most enjoyable was my manager Jason."
bad,"The job itself was not hard in the slightest but my co-workers were very unprofessional, this made the job somewhat unenjoyable as I had to pick up a lot of the slack. The store would be very slow so there wasn't a lot to do at times and I personally do not enjoy slow workplaces. I also received absolutely no training while working there."
bad,"I learned how to deal one on one with customers "
bad,"A typical day at work includes:"
bad,this job was good for out of high school kids in LA but long term its a turn over where eventually you find a better job.
bad,"Assisted customers in finding items to please their needs such as clothing, jewelry, etc.  In addition to my duties as a sales associate, I modeled for Abercrombie and Fitch which allowed me to further promote the company’s image and products."
bad,I didn't do too much while working here.  I worked here primarily during college with the goal in mind of meeting cool new people.  I learned that I did not want to work for this company as a manager.  My co workers were fun to work with.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with bossy customers whose biggest problems are shirt sizes.  The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and becoming good friends.
bad,Responsibilities included:
bad,"Abercrombie and Fitch gives lower management less autonomy, upper management is unprofessional. Overall it's an ""okay"" starting job, but definitely not a career move."
bad,Overall the Company strives for making the perfect impression on customer base. Management can vary drastically. Experience differs from store to store. The hours are flexible and very good for young students.
bad,"For most of the year the job is pretty relaxed and straight forward, but come busy months such as back to school and Christmas it becomes a nightmare. They pay their part-timers, the bulk of your staff, minimum wage, which is terrible, and expect them to be top of the industry employees. Upper management seems to be disconnected from the bottom floor. It's not the worst, but it's certainly not the best."
bad,"Upper level managers would force you to buy the clothing. Your entire paycheck would go towards these clothes. When i worked there, you were not allowed to wear makeup, nail polish or even style your hair."
bad,Most days are cool and laid back but around update everything gets crazy. If this is your first job you'd be okay with it at first just like me but once you work for more then a couple months and you get bills you need to pay and fun things you want. The pay doesn't help in any way it's more of a spending money type of job.
bad,"I've worked at both an Abercrombie & Fitch and Abercrombie Kids for over a year. I worked at a kids store in San Diego and a flagship store in San Francisco. Both stores were very different. The smaller kids store was more relaxed (except on weekends) and the associates had closer bonds. The flagship store was definitely higher paced and time went by very quickly. The job is not very difficult unless working on a busy day. You will tend to fall into a routine where you do a list of certain tasks. When I first started working for the company, it was very fun. Abercrombie has a good culture where they believe that you should work hard but also have fun. As I worked there longer, I began to dislike the job. At both stores, the management was very poor. Management almost never appreciated the hard work the other associates and I were performing. Instead they acted like this was only expected even if someone was going above and beyond. In fact, if you weren't doing exactly what a manager wanted you to be doing (even if you were helping the rest of team) you would be yelled at. At both stores, the managers had no idea how to delegate their associates and therefore they were not respected in anyway. While the management is very poor at Abercrombie, there are some great reasons to work there. First of all, Abercrombie is very flexible with your availability. You basically work then you want to work based on your availability. If you wanted time off, as long as you closed it off in your availability, there was a 99.9% chance you'd get that day off. You could block off weeks at a time"
bad,This was a nice job coming out of college. They have a very detailed manager orientation trainee program that teaches you all about the business. You develop a lot of skills at its completion.
bad,It was my first real as assignment as supervisor / manager. Overall it was an ok experience but could have much better with staffing and overall tone of the company.
bad,"So I started working back in August of 2016 and it was amazing and all but over time I started to realize manager picks favorite and only schedules her favorites. Everyone else is kind of scavaging for shifts or praying to god they send out shift notifications. Assistant managers, only one is really chill and laid back. I also noticed with the main manager that she will find ways to get you fired or give you a reason to quit. Don't really recommend"
bad,Good place to work if your in school and just want some extra fun money. The staff is high energy and fun to be around. Unfortunately everyone starts an minimum wage and its hard to get the photo shoot and shirtless model bonus. For example I worked with Hollister and A&F for 3 years all together and was only asked to be in two photo shoots and two shirtless gigs. These pay good but its not worth the minimum wage throughout the year.
bad,Overall it was a fun job but I personally felt like I didn't learn anything that I can take with me to help me in the future everything was basic hands on and the mangers where not even advance in their field.
bad,"You are brand representative in abercrombie. But you have to do a lot more then only that. There is no drive to sell, because there is no commissio, and you will never hear any positive feedback. You are treaded very badly. The co workers are very nice tho. Management not so nice."
bad,"For the people who work full-time, it seemed great. The co-workers were nice, but lazy. The managers were tough on you for not knowing things that they had not even taught you yet. Working part time, sometimes you get 8 hours the most for 2 weeks. Sometimes, you don't work at all."
bad,"Simple tasks much like any other clothing retailer, except advancement is based almost entirely on your own physical attractiveness and the attractiveness of the people you recruit. Regardless of the actual staffing needs of your store, you are pressured to recruit as many attractive young persons as possible."
bad,I enjoyed the people I worked with but I did not enjoy the work environment.
bad,"Assessing customers, keeping store clean and smelling good. Keeping inventory within company nummbers"
bad,"•	Helped consumers with general promotions in store and all store products. "
bad,I am a full time student so it was great balancing that. But the hours are horrible after the holidays. Like 8 hours a week and the managers take advantage of the employees sometimes by forcing us to stay past or scedualed times and lunches
bad,"A typical day at work involves loud music and way to much perfume sprayed throughout the store in intervals of 10-15 min. From my experience at Abercrombie I realized how shallow some people are. Some of the managers we're really down to earth people who just graduated college. They would uphold the values of Abercrombie, but you'd always know they disagreed with most of it. The hardest part of the job is knowing you are guilty by association to the company of stereotyping customers, and having to deal with the smell. The most enjoyable part of the job is the co-workers. In my experience, not many people who work for Abercrombie enjoy or agree with it past just being a job."
bad,"As a Assistant Store Manager, I loved my job due to the staff I hired & few co-workers. Management is a fun, exciting, always learning but with no advancement when you are giving your all everyday is unacceptable. a typical day open registers, paperwork, process timecard, follow the program for the day , recruiting, interviews, training, floorsets, and etc."
bad,"Works with customers daily, operational duties, and open/close the store. Floorsets every two weeks"
bad,"A typical day at work included stocking merchandise in the back room to place it on sales floor and assist customers on their questions and tell them our best offers. I learned how to use USR for checking prices on items, folding merchandise in a variety of ways, and pricing them as well. I had different co-workers each time I came in, knowing it has many employees. There wasn't any hard part of this job but what I did enjoy was helping customers out and seeing them satisfied at my hard work."
bad,"I didn't enjoy working here AT ALL! I couldn't wear nail polish or toe nail polish. I could only wear blue, white or gray (their store colors) and the clothing is a bit pricey for the low pay I was receiving! The stuff that was 50 percent off was not so appealing. I stood at the front of the store ALL day greeting customers, folding clothes and only moving to open a fitting room. I left the front for a sec to use the restroom and my manager had a fit. The store was heavily perfumed and the store cd that played all day was highly annoying. I didn't receive enough hours and the pay was minimum wage for the amount of folding and straightening up I had to do."
bad,"The management is overall incompetent, lazy, always come short handed. Credit is never given when it needs to be given. Stay clear away from this place for a job."
bad,they overwork you for minimum  pay and try to make you buy their clothes. also many of the managers are unprofessional and try to treat you like a child
bad,"I was a Brand Representative for a store that could never keep a full management staff. This made for a highly disorganized experience and increased stress for all involved- from a Brand Representative who worked 8 hours a week to a full time store manager. "
bad,"they hire entirely too many people , they don’t give hours and they only pay 8.55 and have you work 4 hour shifts and put you on the schedule for 1-3 days . the new managers don’t communicate but everyone is pretty much friendly ."
bad,"I never enjoyed going to work. We were meant to be doing something at all times, even when everything had been done. Managers often gave us tasks, then changed the task before it was finished."
bad,I would not work here if I was looking to take care of a family or make a living of any sort. The money you make there is chump change.  Easy money chump change.
bad,More of a dictatorship as opposed to working together. Made us purchase clothes because we were not allowed to wear any other brands besides Abercrombie.
bad,Minimum wage and job is recommended for high school children who would like to just earn a few dollars . Management was easy to work with when it came down to scheduling
bad,"- lots of folding clothes or censoring each piece of clothing by putting security tags on; cash wrap"
bad,"this job is very ideal for the high school/ college student looking to get some LITTLE extra spending money."
bad,"Work weeks are 45-50 hours. Pay is low, usually 30k per year to begin for any assistant or store manager. Opportunity for advancement is limited if you don't work close to many other malls with your store with chances for larger opportunities. Managers are expected to get full-time results from part-time employees."
bad,boring and not rewarding. managers were degrading. no one liked the district manager. customers always came in with problems with clothing that i could not help with
bad,"I liked the people I worked with when I was there. I worked as an Impactor (a stockroom person) and the other people who worked as Impactors were pretty chill. The scheduling sucks, though, and the pay is minimum wage for everyone except the managers and lead stock person. Even with their “better than minimum wage pay” the managers still said it was too much work for not enough money. It was good for a temporary job during high school because of the flexible hours."
bad,Abercrombie was an ok workplace but dont work there if youre lookinbg to make money the only benefit is getting a discount and depending on the item may or may not be worth it
bad,It was my first job and I was excited about it. The people were very nice and friendly. My only complaint is that management is very disorganized and the hours weren't consistent.
bad,"Receive shipments from the company and stock merchandise on the stock room in the back of store, which could be considered inventory. Restock clothes on showroom floor in store. In rare cases, work cash register."
bad,"Low pay, horrible hours (16 hours a week at the most), and too many people working there so you can barely pick up any shifts. I never had a full work day and even when i did, my break wasn't enough time."
bad,"I'm thankful that this company gave me employment, but there needs to be improvements. Reduce the amount of clothes an employee needs to buy and the quantity of cologne spraying in the sales floor, please. I was told that my uniform was the merchandise they sold, I only needed to get some outfits and there was no need to buy anymore in the future which I was glad about. This company is expensive! False statement because you had to buy new outfits in specific colors every season. When new merchandise arrived it was mandatory to get the latest clothes. The problem was that this was super expensive even with the discount you get. You're going to smell like A&F men's cologne every time your shift is over because it's sprayed all over the clothes and sales floor. If you have never been into the store, their perfumes are strong. The strongest fragrances comes from men's cologne. When I first started out, I had allergy problems and couldn't properly breath because the sales floor was over sprayed with cologne. I'm not exaggerating, it's that bad. I don't remember when, but many months later the amount of spraying was reduced. I was very thankful for that change, but it's still too much."
bad,This job is not for the faint of heart. I learned to have a thick skin and get many tasks accomplished efficiently. I am a better worker because of this place.
bad,Not supportive of your career aspirations and what motivates you. A typical day at work was not exciting and they make no effort to give you exposure to different parts of the company.
bad,Even though I wasn't at this job long I can say it was pretty great for my time while I was in high school to make some extra money and it did occupy a lot of time
bad,"the amount of hours you put in don't reflect how much you get paid.. that said the paycheck always seemed lacking"
bad,I enjoyed my job and learning how to step out of my comfort zone.  The communication skills required to do the job are great training and you meet a lot of fun people.  I was unfortunately tricked by the corporation in a very shady meeting that probably should have had an attorney present.  I was a devoted worker and maintained the brand for many years.  I would never have expected them to come through with strangers and pretend that I committed a crime and have them pretend their is evidence against me tell me verious stories and hope that I admit to wrong doing or someone elses wrong doing in order for them to learn from nothing.  They interviewed all staff privately using this technique and it was wrong.
bad,"Personally, I did not enjoy working for Abercombie & Fitch because I do not believe that I fit into the culture there. In that, I mean that I am not accustomed to wearing tight fight clothing or the shoes that I was required to wear and buy which were Chuck Taylor's."
bad,"If you like dressing casual daily and having fun at work, this is the place for you. Hours are pretty much guaranteed and pay is at a competitive rate."
bad,"My values and A&F's values did not align, making it not a good fit for me.  I value what each individual person brings to the team and I feel that the company was not invested in their people - as a manager, I had to step away.  Our employees are what make a company great and upper management did not agree."
bad,Great store. Great staff. Loved getting to help people pick out their outfits to purchase as well as checking them out. So cool to see so many different types of people with different plans for the week or the night or occasion all in one store
bad,The employees were immature. A lot of inappropriate things would take place in the workplace during shifts. Arguments would break out. Site for schedules would rarely work.
bad,A typical day at work would be boring. I learned to sell merchandise and create outfits for guest to purchase. My co workers we're funny. The hardest part would be doing go backs behind the register. The most enjoyable part of the job was going on break.
bad,"I would not work here again. The wage is way too low, especially when you are expected to buy your own clothes. way too superficial about look, too many rules."
bad,"I applied for Abercrombie as a stock associate. A typical day would require me to help put out stock on the sales floor and help keep the store clean and presentable visually. So far I have been working with Abercrombie for 2 months and they have not been providing me with enough hours to work. They have me call in to see if they need me to work and usually they do not. "
bad,"Model for store, stood in front at entrance and greeted customers as they came in and always said current tag line for the store. Made sure front room was clean and clothes always folded"
bad,Job only pays you min-wage and expect's you to work as if your making millions off them. sadly this is a job if you need extra cash. wouldn't rec this job to no one.
bad,"Assisting customers with their needs, making sure all shelves are stocked and ready for the day. Keeping up with demands. Hardest part of the day is running out of product."
bad,"In the time that I have been working at Abercrombie and Fitch, more specifically HCO, several things about my employment has been deeply disappointing. Usually I am only scheduled to work one or two days a week, our store managers are not knowledgeable in areas they should be, and shifts of mine are cut on a regular basis."
bad,Very little hours and management is not very good and constantly changing. They let you go without any notice whatsoever.
bad,Everyday was the same thing. Very strong smell. A lot of unnecessary gossip. Best part of the day was leaving. The breaks were extremely short and sometimes we didn't even receive a break
bad,"Fast-paced, exciting environment. Poor upper management, chaotic management team, you have to train yourself on everything, poor support/resources provided by corporate"
bad,Enjoyed all of the people I met.  Unfortunately the pay was not worth the long hours and hiring practices of the company.
bad,The hours here suck! The job is easy because i was hitting 132% per week and its a great job. But the hours suck!
bad,"manage 40 full time employees. Responsible for hiring, performance management, salary increases and promotions."
bad,Working at this job site was fun because of the atmosphere and great co workers that assist you throughout your day
bad,Felt bad for managers hard to promote. Work long hours for no pay. Good health benefits. A lot of fun though the associates and store managers are very fun but District Managers need more training.
bad,"I only worked there for 3 months and I only saw 1 day of work, which happened to be on Black Friday. I had not been trained and I had to stay for 12 hours as a greeter, which I was not supposed to be in the first place. My co-workers were very supportive and helpful. If I had seen at least one shift a week, I'd still be there. Sadly, that wasn't the case."
bad,"I was a greeter and had to greet all the customers. I was perfect for this position because I am very happy, smiley, friendly and outgoing. I am great with talking to people and customer service. I would greet everyone coming in along with helping them find anything needed. I would try to sell cologne to them and other merchandise. My management was alright. Sometimes very annoying because they liked to talk down to you, but I was still professional and didn't argue and just went along with it. My co-workers weren't very serious. It was annoying. The managers would repeat the same things for them to do again and again and they would just complain. I don't like complainers. The job wasn't very difficult for me. I like big challenges. I loved greeting the people and talking to them. I would really have great conversations with some of the customers. I liked taking pictures with them too and making them smile."
bad,"boring and repetitive work days, with not much to be gained. management is very friendly, and co-workers are friendly as well. the job isn't hard, but getting hours are tuff. the best part of the job is the friends you'll make."
bad,"Company violated so many laws. Human Resources is a joke. Stressful trying to meet recruiting goals with the right ""qualifications"" Promotions are based on relationships with the DM. Tough working with teens that need to be micromanaged."
bad,"Very nice people, but can be really unfair, don not give me enough hours to work"
bad,its an fun idea that your working at a very popular store but it sucks that you may only be able to work one day out of the week because they employee hundreds of people and the pay is not worth being on the side or in the closet
bad,they gave m one day a week and yu have to buy their clothes that are like 400 dollars for some dang jeans
bad,"This job teaches the basics of running the business for a retail company, what needs to be done each day to make sure each operational tasks to keep the store running smoothly is done. You learn about setting floor sets, how to process and receive shipment, stockroom organization, a lot of experience interacting with customers and improving store experience for everyone who walks into the store."
bad,"Wouldn't consider this a career opportunity."
bad,"You are able to work with people all the time, wear comfortable clothes and get a great discount."
bad,very easy job get paid to do nothing much but fold clothes and yell at customer when they come in.
bad,"Greeting customers and providing customer services, to prevent shrink. Co-workers were kind of snobby "
bad,"This is not a career, the company has become extremely shady.  "
bad,"The management and other employees didn't seem to care much about the job, there was no real direction. Everyone was very nice, aside from the managers, the employees were all young, fresh out of high school or early 20s."
bad,"Clothes are expensive and you have to buy them or you cant work, no raises."
bad,Great learing experience for your first job. A lot of different people working together.
bad,"All the employers there were here were all very friendly and welcoming. It was a very busy environment and everyone was basically doing there own thing. The management was very nice as well. There was no hard part of the job really, however, the most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers."
bad,"The interview is basic but going to work and then being told ""you can go home, we don't need you"" is not somewhere you really want to work . But the people you work with are great."
bad,"Working at Abercrombie & Fitch, I was able to enhance my communication and management skills. The self-development of my position can translate to all future positions."
bad,im trying to find me a full time permanet position.
bad,"I worked with a lot of great people, a very diverse workplace. I mostly helped open the store, so it was very slow in the mornings."
bad,The hours were horrible and the dress code is hard to keep up with sometimes.
bad,"Management was unfit for the job with taking naps and staying in the back, there needed to be more guidance in an environment with younger workers"
bad,"I got, at most, 5 hours a week, and I eventually was getting no hours. I was let go from the company for whatever reason, meanwhile I had no income. It’s not worth your time."
bad,Productive and fun with a sense of favoritism from managers . Other fellow employees are nice and easy to talk with . Don't receive a lot of hours which is disappointing .
bad,The hardest part of this job was staying on top of tedious details on the presentation of merchandise. You get to meet and work with a large number of people.
bad,Never working for this company again. Got terminated because the store manager didn’t like the fact I had a child and they terminated me. They had lack of managerial experience and hours.
bad,"Typical night, get a piece of paper that has a photo of a closet on it. Take items found on photo and create a closet in store using those items. Then take a picture of the closet that you set up to look like the picture. I do not know the purpose."
bad,"Not a bad place to work at. You’ll have more fun if you’re friends with everybody! Folding jeans all day does get tiring, sometimes all the clothes will be mixed up which would be so annoying to fix. I’d freak out because of how messy it would get on busy nights!"
bad,My first day at the job was on black Friday and they couldn't really teach me anything since it was so packed and crazy. One of the employees helped me out. This job can be very boring during the week days because thats when its really slow and sales are low. The only times where there is some production is during the weekend or during the holidays.
bad,"it's not bad for a high school student as a part time job. very easy and laid-back environment. However, some managers play favoritism. It really depends on they like you or not. they give you more hours if they like you otherwise you will not get many hours, or you only get closing hours or opening hours which requires cleaning."
bad,Abercrombie was a fun place to work but not somewhere to stay long term. The pay is terrible but is a good place to start a career in retail and have a college degree.
bad,"Advancement in operations is quick, depending on how good looking you are. This is why many stores are run incompetently. But good benefits, including 401k match"
bad,"Retail is a hassle, so maintaining the store clean was a number one. Sales were hard to push but easy to accomplish. Management wouldn't work with my hours during school session. Fun part of the job was interacting with customers as well as my crew. Learned how to manage cash and count out registers."
bad,"fun , very face pasted , great people to work with id recommend anybody to work there hardest part was closing at the end of the day"
bad,"management, especially DM, is unorganized and unfair. Nice co-workers. Have to be able to move if you want to advance. Often time the managers become accustomed to certain employees so it can be unfair"
good,It was a fun job the place was always busy so you always had something to do. My co-workers were very friendly. The most enjoyable part of my job was having the satisfaction of helping someone find something they needed.
good,I worked for the company for many years. I enjoyed my job for quite some time. Work life balance as  DM in little to none with the company. Job requirements are different from that of any other DM position in retail.
good,"This is a very bad company to work for. Everyone is very unprofessional including managers and they don't hire base of qualifications, intelligence or merit. It is strictly based off looks."
good,Applying at Abercrombie is a set up. Don’t do it. Some of The managers there are unprofessional except for the general manager. They work you harder than they paying you.
good,"I applied because i had loved and shopped at the store for years. I thought I would love working there but i was wrong. The manager at the time was horrific. I was new, she never answered any questions i had about the place of work. short breaks"
good,Working for Abercrombie is a very good starting point for anyone that is trying to start working in retail and customer service. It was really enjoyable becuase you were able to be creative with customers when they needed fashion advice and it was very rewarding when you were able to help a customer find what they were looking for. The employees and management made the experince of working at Abercrombie becaue they all were friendly and helpful.
good,i worked there so long ago i really dont have anything bad or good to say
good,"When I was going to work at Abercrombie the people that I worked with where friendly what I learned working their was to greet every customer with a smile and to have the store looking neat for"
good,"Working at Abercrombie and Fitch taught me a lot about how to deal with face to face interactions, be mindful of customers, and create budget goals and day to day sale goals. Working here was difficult at times with having store updates and major holiday sales but my co-workers acted as a family which made each working day successful."
good,Abercrombie and Fitch is a good part time job. It is not a full carrier opportunity. The managers are always there to help if we need it. The staff tries to organize the clothes by the fitting room but it gets so packed and busy so fast.
good,"No room for advancement ( You shouldn't want to anyways ), skeptical hiring practices, mind numbing work. "
good,"Abercrombie and Fitch is an excellent entry level job if you're trying to get your first job ever -- but there's little room for advancement, and frankly it's hard to actually get hours. There's no way to get more than eight hours a week, even when your availability is literally always open, because they hire lots of people so that they don't have to schedule anyone for really more than twice a week."
good,horrible people that act like friends and just gossip behind your back.  upper management is just as horrible.  it's very immature and mentally unhealthy.
good,With any position in this company if you do not fit in then you will not be able to succeed and get promoted. Very cliquey environment. If you’re into favoritism then you’ll fit in perfectly.
good,"Worked here during a time when the culture was unfair and biased. I cannot say what it is like to work for the company now, but when I worked there it was tough fitting in sometimes."
good,Good place for students looking to make extra on the side balancing school and work. High turn over rate for management and a lot of responsibilities for associates which are usually divided up into tasks
good,"- Standing and working all day."
good,When I started working there it wasn't a bad place to work. On the days we worked over time they would have breakfast and lunch provided as a thank you. After being there almost 5 years it's like they wanted us to live there and didn't care about our family/personal lives.
good,"There is a lot issues to work here. I believe that its not the company but the managers. They didnt care about your schedule. And they gave you few hours per week to work, sometime i got 4 hour, its really bad."
good,A table full of clothes would be waiting to be folded and put away when walked into work. Thought the job was full of younger more laid back managers and coworkers the work was a bit much for the pay we received. It would always be a fast paced hectic environment and maneuvering in a small room which were in made it difficult to be as efficient as can be.
good,A typical day at work consisted of a numerous amount of repetitive duties. Management was very unorganized. Some of my co-workers were nice to be around. The hardest part of the job was doing the same task for my whole shift.
good,Folding clothes and dealing with drama isnt very fun. It was an extension of high school at min. wage. Poor hours. Only a few shifts each week. Helping the customers was great and the highlight.
good,Fun! Loud music and the same playlist over and over was great! Enjoyed the monotonous work. Co-workers were loud and quite annoying. It way too many individuals of one race. There was nothing hard about the job. I learned nothing from this job. A typical day was folding clothes and counting cash. Most enjoyable part of this job was clocking out. Management was ready not good.
good,"This job is great for high school students looking to make extra money, but there is no chance for advancement, or pay increase. Personally this job was not what I was looking for in terms of pay grade or management. I found that the managers at this job would give hours to those who were their favorites."
good,Short hours. Preparing visual displays for the store. Making sure the store was always organized. no benefits. Being able to multi task in the store. No easy promotions.
good,The pay and other compensation is not worth the stress and non work life balance. OT is a regular assurance but not compensated for it. Advancement occurs if willing to relocate
good,"For this to be my first job it was fine, but i wouldn't recommend it to anyone to work there. The pay is $7.50 the whole time you work with them. Its a lot of work for only $7 an hour and the managers dont help you out they just tell you want to do. In overall experience if i were you and you were thinking on applying, DONT."
good,"A typical day at the store consisted of stocking the floor and making sure it looked clean before the rush hour came. When the rush hour of business came it was very frantic and unorganized. I learned how to handle customers in a fast-pace environment. The management was the reason we were so unorganized. Most of the time you wouldn't ever see the managers because they would be hiding in the stock room. While the management was in the stock room they wouldn't be working and that caused a lot more pressure on the new seasonal workers. The hardest part of the job was learning how to do everything, because we never actually got training. The most enjoyable part of the job was when we had slow days and could relax and do our jobs correctly."
good,"It wasnt a bad place to work, but they made you buy their clothes in order to work in the store. However the environment was fun for a young person looking for their first job."
good,"It worked out with my university schedule, which is why I stayed as long as I did. However, with the lack of structure and lax at the workplace, not at all as expected."
good,"experience was average, hours are lame, don’t make enough money so you’ll need a second job (which defeats the purpose) might as well work somewhere else if you need money."
good,"A very easy going job if you are fairly adjustable and do not mind the specific task and physical duties that need to be maintained. This work space calls for a certain look and if you are okay with their guidelines you will do fine. This place is not so much broad and you’ve a certain mindset to allow yourself to work here. "
good,"The job was very calm and steady paced. Management at the time was poor because of this, employees work time became limited and inconsistent. The Mall closed at a certain time, so pay wasn't that good."
good,"While I worked very few hours per week during weekends, the environment was fun and energetic.  The associates did not hesitate to go above and beyond for the store guests, regardless of how busy it was."
good,Working for this company was an experience that i will never forget. I always felt like an outcast and everyone that worked there was vain and seemed to think they were better than everyone else.
good,"Abercrombie Kids was my first job ever. It was decent when it came to hours, but the only employees allowed were the Caucasian employees at the time I was working here. If a colored customer came in I would be the one to assist them with their needs, because I was told that it would be easier to relate."
good,"From customers to managers , I've had a bad experience working at Abercrombie & Fitch. Management was always a bit tricky with the scheduling and hiring."
good,"no hours , terrible pay, arrogant customers , music will drive you nuts for a first job was ok  now i just need to fill the box"
good,"Without the proper management team of well qualified, customer friendly managers, the store was run very poorly. "
good,"While your in training you learn a lot of different things. Once you get that mastered and have been promoted to AM you are pretty much in the same routine. Constantly different timings, No work/life balance at all. Closing one day and the next you have to be back early morning."
good,Not the best to work for in the long run.  No advancement given to people who've worked with the company for a long time.  Management is inexperience.  Coworkers are inexperienced and careless.  Wants to get paid for not working but still on companies time.  Others are left to finish idle work from others.  Stressful
good,"Not a good company to work for. The CEO is the worst human."
good,"its ok been working here for almost 2 could of been better but it was a decent experience, I will miss my co workers. its a benefit because we are all around the same age"
good,"Cool place, great discount . Coworkers weren't that bad. They like to do group interviews so be prepared you will be competing to work there"
good,Working at Abercrombie was a great experience. There was ups and downs when I was there but overall it was great to work with the associates. I learned a lot at the job.
good,Not a great place to work if you really need income. doesn't work if you're a student because of the call in shifts. The co-workers were nice.
good,Long hours no support management was oblivious.  No room for input or creativity.  Immature staff and middle and upper management.  Learned immense amount and business leadership and management skills.
good,"There isn't a typical day because everyday there is a different task to be done. I learned that High School environments never stay in High School. Management is a joke there, they are all about the same age ranging from 23-30 and they act accordingly, disrespecting certain workers and playing favorites. My Co workers are okay, some have their ways of working and aren't willing to change and some are confrontational; hence the High School Environment. The Hardest Part of the job is the lack of motivation to keep performing at a high level because of the lack of raises or advancement. Most Enjoyable is the location, The Grove in West Hollywood, the occasional celebrities that walk through, and some of my co workers make it fun."
good,"This job did not have much to offer. Upon hiring, they never informed me that the position would just be seasonal. The hours were ineffective and did not give much chance to advance with the company."
good,"Clock in at the start of my shift and go to my supervisor to see whet needs to be done. Sometimes I already know so I start right in with what needs to be done as the day goes by. Our main concern though is customer service and helping them find what they are looking for. The day goes by really fast and you also get so much done in one day. It is important to work closely with your co-workers because we need to work as a team. At the end of the shift, especially at close, we straighten the store and get things ready for the next opening shift."
good,"stocking clothes and displays learned nothing i didnt already know just being honest lol, management was fun ok people co workers also , job wasnt hard at all working in the forum shops was just fun all around fun"
good,"I cannot blame the entire company because, it wouldn't be right but, I have to get this off my chest. I went in for an interview and they later told me I got the job. The problem comes when, I never got to work and was terminated out of the blue. I came into the store and kept asking the manager ""when do I get my schedule?"", she kept replying that they were not in need of someone this week, next week and the future weeks. Long story short , I was only paid $6.50 for the 1 hour that I sat through training."
good,A typical day at work consist of helping customers and assisting them with there purchases. I learned how to keep a strong work ethic and a few leadership skills. I don't have any experience with management. My co-workers are great. The hardest part of my job was that customers always mess up the store and I constantly have to clean it. The most enjoyable part of the job was to see the look on a satisfying customers face.
good,"A day at work consists of cleaning before opening, greeting customers, and providing customer service, working behind the register, and in the front room. I learned how to fold clothes according to store standard, build closets, and pay attention to detail while updating the store with the seasons line of clothing. Management is different all the time. Managers are always being moved and employees are not hired within. My coworkers are professional, well groomed, and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job is updating the store. The company is extremely particular about how clothes should be folded to how far apart hangers should be from each other. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people. From fellow associates to the management there is never a dull moment."
good,"Management was alright, usually promoted people that were liked rather than qualified. Job culture wasn't really exciting, just come in do your work and leave. Compensation was minimum, work life balance was fine since you get to set your availability. Job security isn't that well, you can be let go if the sales for the store aren't doing that well over a the course of a few month. Which brings to the next point, sales targets/goals, unrealistic and this causes management to put overwhelming pressure on employees to basically force sales on customers to get the numbers higher. Overall good place to start off and get work experience, pretty hard to move up though."
good,"This was a a great place to meet new people and stay on your feet but the upper management could use work in communication. The hours can be daunting due to high turnover. No real breaks or weekends off, can be very rare."
good,Everyone was great I didn’t like the hours but it was still fine. The managers were cool just working with people my age was cool too. I loved working with clothes.
good,They did not really train me they kind of just had me walk around the store folding clothes and I cashed out a couple of customers here and there. They did not give me enough hours as I wanted and a I put in my application.
good,Very little room to advance once you reach the management stage. Be prepared to deal with immature kids who are only here because their parents force them to be. Expect drama and petty fights over everything.
good,"Having worked there for four years, I can say that I had a good experience. It was not the absolute best, but it also was not the worst. Some days I would clock in and there would be lots to do, but on other days, we would struggle to find tasks. In those cases, hours would be cut and some of us would be sent home fairly early. It wasn't a reliable source of income, but it did provide good experience when it came to working under pressure and when handling customers who were not polite. "
good,"My first summer job. I was in customer service, helping customers with fittings rooms, clothes options and cashing them out. I would fix the dressing room and provide floor services"
good,"cool place to work in, staff was extremely kind with everybody and made sure we had a good day. helped each other out if needed or falling behind to make sure we all went home at the right time."
good,"Very laid back work environment but extremely boring and the benefits suck. The company doesn't really care for their employees, extremely high turnover rate... never a good sign."
good,"With my experience of working at Abercrombie, I found that the managers tend to favors only a few employees and aren't great with working well with student schedules. Maybe a good job for someone in high school."
good,"This was just a job I had in college to make money on the side. However, I did not end up making that much money because I had to wear their expensive clothes in order to work, which took a lot away from the paycheck. Also, the entire business is discriminatory towards peoples' appearance, which is something I do not condone."
good,It was an okay retail job. It could have paid more and the management was somewhat okay. Not all of them were open to making you feel welcome with the company and they often made you feel kind of down if you didn't know every little thing about the company.
good,"Everything about the company was terrible. No benefits, low salary, terrible manger. Hypocrites. Managers would tell you not to do something, then they go ahead and do the thing they just told you not to do and how that thing would be in inappropriate for the store, etc."
good,"Most of the people I worked in back stocking with were nice and made the day fun, but management was not the best and she has left since then. This was just a temporary job and not what I saw myself doing long term."
good,"It was okay during my time there, I was an impact worker so I didn't have to directly deal with customers or other employees (except for the managers) During my time there, the managers were nice but were dealing with a lot of stress from the district manager. I didn't know many of my coworkers, but the environment felt competitive for hours."
good,"Part time teen job. Flexible hours and good environment. Not a lot of room for advancement. Pay is fair for work load. Will make you forever hate doing laundry,"
good,Abercrombie is a good place/company to work for if you're in high school or starting in college. The pay is alright if you don't have to worry about paying bills.
good,"Depends on the location, working for the home office is stressful, and your expected to do more, stay longer even if you aren't supposed to go over hours. You'll get in more trouble if you don't finish then staying over. Didn't get more pay even though i worked in one of the most important stores."
good,"Definitely decent pay for someone who is fresh out of school with no responsibilities and lives at home. The management is weird, some are cool and some are stuck in their college sorority days."
good,Only good thing is during holidays but other than that it was pretty bland. Really slow and just folding clothes. Got to work only 2-4 days. Shifts are 4 hours long as well.
good,Working at Abercrombie was GREAT in the beginning. We had a wonderful management team when I started as well as a great team. After a year we got a new store manager and everything went down the drain. Employees started quitting left and right. Manager would yell at employees in front of customers and write up employees for no reason.
good,"The store located in Portland, Or, seemed to bring in new managers more than new clothing lines.   I made plenty of good friends while working, and the job fit my college schedule, as everyone that I worked with, also seemed to be in college.  The worst part of working for this company was the short shift hours, and the amount of on-call shifts.  Other than the cons of the job, it was otherwise your typical retail job."
good,Okay pay but work you like a dog. Expect you to hit goals that are not realistic until you get a groove. Breaks are to short and the work load is unreal
good,"i always got my hours cut. management wasnt the best, do way to much work for no advancement, want you to look a certain way"
good,"entreprise agréable, disciplinée , mais sous pression constante"
good,It was a while ago when I just started my first year in college which may have induced stress then that made me quit the job but from what I can remember was how unorganized the system was. It was rather boring of a job but organizing was most enjoyable being as part of my specialty.
good,the store was so hung up on the look and reputation of the store that they don't value their employees. worked here for about three years of my life and honestly stuck around because of its flexibility.
good,The management was rude and unprofessional. They do not care about their employees or their well being. They offered terrible benefits.
good,Depending on which manager is working can determine how your day will turn out there.
good,Working at Abercrombie & Fitch taught me a lot about time management. I learned how to tackle a task in a orderly and timely fashion while also paying attention to detail. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to meet new people and interact with my coworkers while on group projects. The hardest part of my job  was coming to work and having a new/different task to do.
good,performed stock & inventory task. we stayed after making sure everything was in order.
good,Good place to work when you are in high school or even just part time. 
good,"In abercrombie, there is NO raises. You cannot move up the ladder. By that I mean, you start as a sales associate and you stay as one. In order for you to move up into management, you must complete a University degree. College diplomas will only allow you to get an overnight manger position. It is a very unstable job. They hire every week and do not have enough hours to give to the old employees. Working there is mostly for socializing because majority of the time that is what you do. Besides the unstableness, no raises, and bad managerial position, it is a good workplace for those who want flexible hours. You can give away shifts, trade shifts, and pick up shifts very easily through the Facebook group they set up. They are very lenient as well."
good,"Abercrombie and Fitch was, I believe the worst businesses I ever worked for, It was just not a cool place to be, the managers were horrible, they hardly were old enough to manage a day care. That place wasn't the best"
good,Working with customers and doing audits was fun. I learned how to prioritize my time and work better with customers.
good,stationery with good music but very slow
good,Typical retail work life - fold clothes and tend to irritable customers all day.
good,I had a lot of fun and met a lot of great people working here but the pay was minimal wage. This location closed and I was not willing to relocate 35 minutes away.
good,I enjoy working with the other Brand Reps and certain managers but I’m not getting scheduled any hours so it feels like I was kept on for no reason. I’ve been asking for hours and they say “we’ll see what we can do” and I get nothing back from them.
good,"If you looking to grow with them, then you better make sure they favor you because favoritism is all over that place. The co worker was stressed and upset which led to people not getting along or communicating. Management was sketchy and not upfront, they won't even let you know your terminated until you clocked in and worked a couple of hours into the shift which is sad and embarrassing."
good,Do not expect to move up within the company at all unless you have a degree!!! The prefer to hire form the out side even tho they will tell you to your face they prefer to promote form within I haven’t been there Long and I am maxed out in my department already. Don’t get to attached to supervisors because they change a lot. And expect stupid hours! 6 hours on day then 10 hours the next then bac to 6 hours is stupid
good,"Depending on schedule the shifts can be from 4-8 hours (8 is rare due to lack of business within the store). The store Managers ( not shift leaders) I experienced had attitudes and constantly watched and got on you if your not doing something. The store had barely any business so the clothes never got touched or rearranged (there would be nothing to do but was around or be on your phone or talk to your co-worker, nun of which they liked. Overall job is easy, slow, minimum wage paying, and low inconsistent hours."
good,"Everyone on the team tends to be close-knit and helpful to each other, but in my experience, that changed when we received a new head manager. She tended to use her employees and management team to her advantage to do as little as she could. She was always rude and condescending to her team as well as our customers. Much of our original team ended up leaving Abercrombie because no one wanted to work with her."
good,a typical day at work consist of the managers talking all day doing nothing while the associates do mostly all the work. they cut hours harshly depending who you are.
good,Being a key holder you were basically another assistant manager with the expectations they put on you. They really don't give you raises unless you consider pocket change a raise. The atmosphere is fun but too often if something bad happen upper management would love to blame everyone below them for their short falls. Working almost all weekends sucks as well. Only way to get those off is to either beg or use PTO to get it off
good,I show up to work and they have a meeting and explain the daily requirements. Then they tell us what section we are in charge of. It is  fun environment. Coworkers are nice. Hardest part about work is dealing with customers from different countries.
good,This job is a great job if you want to work little hours a normal retail store with some professionalism. Meeting sales goals and working as a team is wha the job is about.
good,"Workplace culture is not great. Very easy job. Not much to learn, just be sweet with managers and you will have an easy time. Not much else to comment on."
good,"It is a great company to work for depending on your immediate supervisor.  There can tend to be a lot of discrimination and unfair treatment.  There are also a lot of internal politics that go on and Human Resources is a joke, they will protect the district manager despite whatever is going on within the store."
good,this company helps you build relationships with your employees. everyone is really close and gets along so well with each other. management can be strict.
good,"While I did advance in my positions at A&F since they changed their store organization, a lot of the qualities that were great about working there disappeared. Most of the managers that work there are qualified on paper but do not show that in the real world. This place is a good place to work when you are just out of high school or need a job in college. Definitely not something permanent."
good,Great opportunity but the environment wasn’t the best . I rarely worked and when i did it was once or twice a week which wasn’t working for me. Hopefully a lot changes overtime.
good,"A typical day at work is very slow-paced, company does not value their employees, the culture of Abercrombie is too relaxed, higher-ups does not believe in firing employees that do not benefit the business, and they turn their backs to a lot of unethical behavior."
good,"The management was not the best, team members do a lot of the work, poor appreciation towards employees, unnecessary drama. Lack of motivation. If you have a situation with another employee, the manager will do take action."
good,"Too much of an emphasis on greeting incoming customers. Greeters were unable to leave the front room for any reason, even if a current shopper needed direction, a fitting room opened, etc. Poor training for new employees."
good,"flexible with one's hours, very nice environment, managers were understanding when one requested off, very comfortable team members to work with, low pay"
good,"Workflow was draining and aggressive "
good,"•	Recommend, select, and help locate or obtain merchandise based on customer needs and desires. Answer questions regarding the store and its merchandise. "
good,Working there is simply just for the time being because if you really want to advance you need a bachelor's degree which is pretty ridiculous to me considering it is a retail job. Overall benefits are bad hours are bad and the people are bad but you get 50% off.
good,"the tasks are so repetitive and the pay you minimum wage for certain positions that clearly require more pay."
good,"I worked there for several years (it is extremely easy to get hired), and the turnover rate is the highest I've ever seen at a job. The hardest part of the job is the instability, often times the management will ask you what to do, their very unorganized and it appears they show up only for a paycheck. The workplace is more of a social hangout than an actual work environment, which can be fun but is ineffective when assignments need to be completed. Management will constantly nag you about hours, and give you several tasks that are expected to be completed in a short 4 to 5 hour shift. Not a place I would apply if your looking for stable work hours."
good,They will overwork you for close to nothing pay. Good job for someone in high school or maybe just to work if you're home from college for winter break.
good,the environment wasn't as professional as i expected to be. had to spend most of my pay check for the dress code. nothing special to learns. but it was a good first job.
good,"A typical day at work  is managing business, providing great customer service and product knowledge. Hardest part of the job is finding things to do when it is slow, best part of the job is the discount."
good,Management did a good job at balancing your work life and personal life. They staff wasn't too friendly to each other but as long as you do your job it can be fun!
good,"Management took their jobs as clothing salespeople a bit too seriously for my taste, but I much prefer that to managers who don't care at all. I didn't learn a lot about retail except for how sales associates deal with theft, which was interesting. The hardest part of the job was maintaining the clothes in a shoppable fashion even though customers would often tear through the piles of clothes regularly."
good,"Even though they closed down, the store had ever poor management. The reason I quit was because I didn't get paid a lot nor was I givin any hours. I only worked like two days a week. The manager picked favorites."
good,"great place for people who never worked before, Serves as lots of experience and you become aware of the work force. The hardest part is being on call barely any shifts and sometimes its hard to be able to work your school schedule around this on call schedule."
good,"A typical day consisted of assisting customers in the store, making transactions,  maintaining the appearance of each room, working on inventory and stock replenishment. I learned how to effectively communicate with customers and assist co-workers with tasks. Working as a team made the day run a lot smoother. The hardest part of the job was dealing with unhappy customers and the low pay. The most enjoyable part was making a lot of sales and having a productive day."
good,It is a great company to work for to gain experience. However the management becomes very selfish towards the top and the bottom has to suffer.
good,"Was a good place to work, but due to the economy / recession, there was mass lay-offs due to the recession. I enjoyed working with the other store employees, management staff."
good,"Horrible upper management, no work life balance at all. I worked with a lot of great people and made a lot friends (even though you are not allowed to make friends above or below your title). They have un realistic expectations for the amount of compensation and benefits you receive. I learned a lot about managing a store, but I do not recon this company."
good,"great place to work for teenagers or even college students that want to make a ""few bucks"". Isn't the best place if you need to pay bills though"
good,very hectic and chaotic at times. Management was fine but co-workers were often very distant and sometimes a bit selfish. very few opportunities for advancement.
good,"Abercrombie & Fitch's warehouse employment is something special, for lack of a better word. Work on it's own is rather straight forward and easy, which allows one to learn multiple different skills in a short period of time. However, what makes Abercrombie & Fitch 'special' falls with management. When starting, management was great, had an amazing supervisor who cared about his workers before the company. With the said supervisor's termination and how abrupt it was, everything went downhill, in my point of view, and everything became a cluttered mess. Supervisors whom had no idea of what needed to be done, had no knowledge of how to do anything but sit at a desk and look pretty, and no idea on how to have an employe's respect. I have never seen such incompetent management, as well as lazy and hypocritical, as what I have seen at Abercrombie & Fitch."
good,"On the days that I did work there was always something to do. You would always have the best customer service and giving the customers the attention they wanted and needed. We had to set the store up to a certain ""standard"" which means everything has to be the way corporate wants the store displayed. It had to be perfect. Overall the work environment was relaxed and easy going."
good,Job was okay for a college student with minimal to no bills. The pay was only minimum wage and did not really like the dress code. Not that it was a bad place to work I was just not interested in pursuing a career with this company.
good,Following suit of it's CEO Abercrombie stores are ran pretentiously and held to a standard that is unfair to the manipulated workers. The appearance guidelines  are misogynistic and unrealistic and the visual-judgement based hiring process is inefficient and produces an embarrassing turnover rate which in turn harms the establishments ability to run even remotely smoothly.
good,"co-workers were nice and fun to get along with but working conditions were not that great. In the stockroom, barely any air ventilation system (no air vents or fans). Store would be very dusty and muggy."
good,"Overnight work hours, Learned ways to fold clothes to appear in a neat and clean fashion. Always something to do and keep yourself busy"
good,Meeting and getting to work with all different types of cultures and races. Learning to work as one big team and while learning how to be leader.
good,"always busy, never get to sit down. i learned cahier skills and how to communicate and sell. managers were okay but we did not get breaks, but the co-workers were easy going."
good,Easy job to start out in when moving to a new town. Strict rules and management was always hit or miss. Overall an okay experience.
good,"Very strict environment but I loved the setting, music and friends just folding clothes and setting the floor."
good,"Not a horrible place to work; however, it is an underpaid position for such a large company. You must have a college degree so they should be starting in the 40s salary wise. The kids are usually nice and the management skills learned are great."
good,"-low pay, a lot of politics within company but fairly easy job"
good,"I had fun with my coworkers and most of the managers in my store.  The upper management seems to ruin any enjoyable atmosphere though.  This company has terrible values and does not respect their employees.  I was ""cast of"" which are the ""more attractive"" people who were chosen for photos and all that so I was considered an asset.  The difference in treatment between cast of and other employees is evident.  The company even gave us a free pair of jeans each one time while other store associates got nothing.  It was always easy to give away a shift if you didn't want to work.  Scheduling was pretty flexible, but that's the only other plus."
good,"I would show up, clock in, stand at the front, greet everyone, fold clothes here and there."
good,"-Learned how to manage 50+ employees"
good,"You come in, work and leave. Make friends so you can give and get shifts from them, other than that they arent your friends. The managers are mean. They give you extra stuff to do that isnt your job. I hated the 6 months here."
good,It is a good job if you have no clue what a good job is. It was one of my first jobs outside of catering. I will never work here again. The mall is not a fun place to be all the time
good,"Working retail in general is a difficult and often unrewarding field.  Managing an A&F - and finding room for advancement - means that you have to learn to play their unique brand of politics.  However, for the hours that you put in the benefits are not worth it.  Silver lining: other retail chains do value the A&F MIT training program as prior experience."
good,"A typical day at work was literally a walk in the park! I did absolutely nothing, and as crazy as it may sound... I hated it! I actually like the idea of working, and not being used as just some sort of prop to attract guests. The management was okay I didn't really know them or any of my co-workers seeing as though I hardly received hours. Abercrombie is notorious for hiring countless amounts of employees and not supplying each individual with hours. Management also required you to purchase expensive uniforms (AAA) every season to be up to date with the store's fashion; but did not provide enough hours for you to afford the clothes! It was nothing hard about my job, besides the fact that I would get yelled at for not doing anything, after I've folded every piece of article in the store."
good,"The company uses ""brand representatives"", now called ""models,"" for store customer service. The models had been required to buy and wear Abercrombie & Fitch apparel, but following a company settlement with California state labor regulators may now wear any no-logo clothing as long as it corresponds with the season."
good,"In a typical day you greet customers, fold to perfection and ring people out, in my store because we were severely understaffed I also processed shipment. The management doesn't care about you unless your one of the cast of's which I was, the cast's of get the most hours and get better treatment than everyone else. The best part of the job was all the cool people you get to meet your own age. Most of the people I hang out with now I met there. If you have good managers you'll be okay, if not you'll be miserable. I recommend being an impactor. You get to stay in the back room most of the time and its much quieter back there. You don't have to deal with customers and its easier to get away with txting and eating during long shifts. They are REALLY strict about their look policy you need to look like you just came from the beach and look naturally pretty without lots of make up or over styled hair. "
good,"I worked as both a ""Model"" and an ""Impact Team Member"", so I have seen both sides of the coin. They both have their ups an downs"
good,"It is very easy going, you learn all the basics of being a sales associate "
good,"The hours were little to none. Your shifts were mostly on call shifts leaving you with no knowledge of your day schedule until 2 hours before your shift, making it almost impossible to have an agenda."
good,"A typical day at work started off by fulfilling all task in order of importance. Re-stocking merchandise so that there was an adequate amount of inventory on the sales floor before the day began. I've learned to work in a fast paced environment with people from all over. My co-workers were amazing, as i am a easy person to get along with i became friends with almost everyone including the supervisors. The hardest part of the job was being done and heading home from a productive day at work."
good,"Had fun overall. Had a good time bartending, learned alot about operating a restaurant."
good,"It was ok not that good....no insurance, not tht much hours and no raise at all."
good,Fun place to work for. Hours are not guaranteed but you will meet a lot of fun people.
good,The amount of work required is not equivalent to pay or related to education.
good,"A typical day consist of associate morning meetings to prepare for the opening of the store and what was expected of us for the day. Reminders to always represent the brand with pride and honor. The managers who lead these such meetings at the beginning of each shift where open and down to earth while still being able to lead and motivate. The most difficult part of this job was when a manager resigned who was respected and liked among employees, yet I absolutely enjoyed the customers and meeting many different people from all over who enjoy this brand."
good,Assistant Managers work 5 days a week with 2 non-consecutive days off. Hours can be a horrible as 1:30-10:30. Most part-timers are 17-20 year old in HS and Community college looking to slack off at a moment notice.
good,"Business is not doing so well. Recently, managers have had to cut hours, including myself, due to not meeting goals, which is frustrating. Coworkers are extremely friendly and managers are very helpful and kind. However, there is almost no view of the front of the store, so people easily steal all the time and we can’t do anything about it. I hate doing floor sets because it makes no sense. It doesn’t really matter where the clothes are, if they’re too expensive, people still aren’t going to buy them."
good,"A&F gave only a small percentage of employees an actual opportunity of advancement. The managers and other associates were friendly and great coworkers. However, it was very clear that a few or the managers had favorites, since most associates could get away with slacking during work hours. The plus side to this job was the flexibility it allowed. Changing available hours could be done online and was usually approved. Managers demand too much from associates for the wage.Management was also very unstable, with new managers changing constantly. Overall, it is a good temporary job meanwhile you look for something more rewarding."
good,"I was able to work in a face pace setting, working with foreign customers and trying to meet quota every day. I was able to gain experience being in the cashier, fitting room, and organizing clothes."
good,Management was horrible but the company was great. The employees  as work as a team and helped each other with the day to day tasks that was needed. The pay was horrible thought
good,Depending on the volume of your store and location determines the store's traffic. Management tends to promote their favorites faster. The training program is loosely followed.
good,I am very neutral about my time spent at Abercrombie and fitch. It was a very basic retail position. You can not move up into management unless you have a degree which I believe is old school
good,Okay part time job. Good for a student that just needs a job to get some cash. Typical day was folding clothes and greeting customers.  I did learn some customer service skill.
good,"Great people and fun environment to work in. Senior managers play favorites and expectations for management are set very high. They play favorites and if you are not one of the ""cool kids"" you wont get promoted. Things have changed since I worked there so it could very well be different as its been over 5 years since I worked there."
good,"While I learned a great amount about retail while working here, the management team had clique mentalities and were very passive aggressive to new hires. Also the pay was too low."
good,"It was a job that unfortunately had too many employees but enough hours. Unorganized and no flexible hours. Out of the 3/4 managers I had, only 2 were truly effective and correctly managed."
good,It was a very unorganized place. Everyday something was new or changed and we didn’t get notified until we were still doing the wrong thing and still get penalized for not knowing the right thing to do because it was changed.
good,"The managers were always your equal, but acted very power hungry and superior. Tons of drama in the workplace, and non nonchalant style of work/management. Good for someone who is starting out and is not looking for a real job. Pay can vary, but pretty much sucks, people get sent home often. Favorites are kept around to hang out, and do nothing but get paid all day. Customers are awesome, and some mangers and coworkers make it worth being there."
good,It was fun to work with people my age (late teens) but the pay is minimum wage and hours are constantly changing. Great place to work while in school. Not much growth.
good,"Working for A&F isn't a bad job, it's just not that much of a job at all. A typical weeks schedule consists of 1 shift (4 hours) and 1 call in. They're very clear with you that you get hours (shifts) based solely of your looks. If you're attractive, you get more hours, if you're not you'll quickly be reduced to either call ins or back room type work. It's a lot like high school, drama and all. You're required to buy and wear the AAA clothing they tell you to, again... if you want hours... You don't even make enough money from working at A&F to be able to afford those clothes. All that being said, it isn't much of a job. You barely get hours, hardly make any money, it's like a continuation of high school... However I think the experience was worth it. If you just want something to be doing that you can call a job then this is the job for you. Management was ever changing, as well as the employees... But those who did stick around have been, and are still the best of friends years later. Working at A&F is exactly how it appears."
good,can be stressful depends on store manager and distract manager.  the relationship between you and your part-timers are also very critical.  the company does not pay very much for manager to part timers for the amount of work they expect you to do.
good,I enjoyed working here but I realized that it was a dead end job. It would get very busy and the not very busy to the point they were cutting hours. I worked very hard but realized that I would not advance higher then a lead.
good,"I loved working for this company. It really is a true lifestyle brand. The pay was absolutely horrendous for the amount of work you are required to do. Managers must have a degree in order to be a manager, which is a bit silly and cuts out a lot of people who are more than eligible for such a job. It is a very young company, and a great first job for someone just starting in the workplace."
good,"Liked working for the company, but the pay did not equal the amount of stress you may be put under and the daily activities you have to go through. Only complaint is pay."
good,"Opportunities for the right person that wants to enter into the entry level retail business, but has limited advancement opportunities or training programs"
good,"Mainly folding clothes, assisting customers, and making sales goals. Fun work environment. No room for growth or raises. Doesn't give many hours and hires a lot of young workers."
good,"This being my first job it wasn't so bad...however, it was not a company I wanted to continue to work for. The management was very unorganized and they weren't friendly with their employees. Also, it was very hard to get decent hours weekly. The system they had for scheduling was very iffy and often didn't work. This job just helped me get some experience and step foot in the work force."
good,"Enjoyed working with Abercrombie & Fitch. They provide a fun environment and atmosphere for the employees and customers. They also have a very challenging and enlightening Management in Training program for college graduates. I enjoyed working with the teenagers, as working with the youth has always been something I enjoyed."
good,"This job was fun, however there hourly wage is very low and hours are limited. Nonetheless, I did learn how to pay close attention to details regarding store products and communicate with guest about deal and discounts."
good,"in 2010 when i started with this company i LOVED it! Since the recent media attention and transformation of the company the good things with the company slowly disappeared. Typical day is high stress, every day is different, high expectations, not a good work life balance. High turn over rate."
good,"Fun workplace, friendly people, great environment. Not enough hours available, wasnt paid enough for working almost 30 hours a week. Hours were very inconsistent."
good,"A typical day at work for me consisted of: early rushes, constant ""hellos"" and very messy displays. I would often tend to fixing the displays as quickly as possible in between rushes. The most enjoyable part of my job was offering my help to the customers who needed it."
good,"The pay is reasonable for the work you do at the basic associate positions, management is a different story. The company as a whole is somewhat childish in that it feels like a massive high school. Staff can be petty and mismanagement is common."
good,"Great part-time job or entry level career. Cons include federal minimum wage, little to few hours offered, and no real room for advancement."
good,Working at Abercrombie is not as amazing as everyone thought it was. You fold clothes and customers sometimes criticize you and the store. I learned how to manage the cash register and fold clothes neatly. My co-workers were a good mixture of every personality. The management definitely needs improvement. The hardest part of the job was getting criticized by customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was having great relationships with co-workers and the job was not complex.
good,"My career with A&F initially was great.  I developed many key business, communication, and leadership skills. The management at the time went through radical changes, thus creating confusion with different processes. Although there were more cons than pros working for this company. I was able to extract the additional skills needed to begin my MBA studies. Most enjoyable part of the job is the ability to relocate."
good,"I would typically help customers with finding things withing the store, clean up after them, and learn to handle different kinds of patrons."
good,"This was a slower paced job which I did not enjoy. I enjoyed interacting with customers when they came by, but it was not a very busy store."
good,The clothes were overpriced and we as employees were required to pay for them with our own money every quarter. Something about using the money from my A&F paycheck to spend in their own store never sat right with me. Probably one of the many reason my store location is no longer in operation.
good,"I worked in the back. A typical say would be me pulling clothes from the shelves and preparing it to go out on the floor. I learned alot about clothes and shipping products , also about receiving products. Most importantly , you learn how to communicate and prioritize. Management were very fun and understanding. Co-workers were very reliable. The job wasnt hard at all. The most enjoyable part was helpng out a customer."
good,"I enjoyed my time working for Abercrombie and Fitch. There is great diversity, everyone is great to work with. Being my first job, it taught and showed me a lot. Its taught me how to deal with 100+ personalities and how to deal with each person in a professional manner. I learned to how to work both in fast and slow paced times. "
good,Its a great place to start to get experience. They don't pay very much and they work you really hard. They also make you buy their clothes very month.
good,"A typical day consisted of greeting customers and assisting in finding the merchandise they were looking for. The management was great , but the compensation was not up to par with my bills"
good,"You get to meet some pretty cool people and spark up friendships but the hours the give and management lacks in respect."
good,This job my leadership skills really came out.  The amount of tasks throughout the day and amount of money the company was making  did not make sense financially to stay.
good,At first the job looked like a fun experience but then after being submerged in the environment I observed and experienced work procedures that I was not happy with.
good,"Besides the fact that there is limited hours because of the High Capacity of staff working for Abercrombie and fitch, it is great experience for anybody who wants to get their ""Feet Wet"" In the whole retail/Sales field."
good,"Over worked, only male brand representative that did all the cleaning fixing light fixtures and running the cash register at the same time. Was not worth it for minimum wage pay."
good,"Working at Abercrombie has been the most challenging experience yet. Everyday I work with people from different backgrounds and different views on what a successful work place should be. Some of the managers there are very unprofessional and makes it very hard to work with them The associates are the glue of that store. Without us, Abercrombie would be a crazy house."
good,"Friendly co-workers and fun environment"
good,Did not enjoy. Over recruiting and specialized recruiting tactics used to draw new hires. Basically managing 16-18 year old spoiled kids whom just want a discount on A&F clothing.
good,"it is a great stepping stone to get into retail. As the company may not be publicly liked and has a bad reputation with how they treat there employees, it had a great structure that allows you to learn how to run a business."
good,"everything you do can and will affect you career with the company."
good,"- a typical day at work consists of either maintaining the sales floor, constantly folding and giving customer service."
good,"Was easy job for in high school, learned to deal with customers and money"
good,"You are under paid for job duties. Process shipment, no room for advancement. It takes a while for you to even get a raise. Job is best for high school students."
good,"A typical work day was folding clothes in accordance with company procedures. I've learned how to work within a team setting and also how to meet stringent deadlines. management was okay but there was definitely room for improvement as far as favoritism went. co-workers were great, never met a cooler bunch. the hardest part of the job I'd have to say were the large projects which usually consisted of seasonal changes and weekly/monthly sales. The best part of the job was having the pleasure of meeting new people and acquiring so many lasting relationships after I left."
good,"Show up in flip flops, jeans, and a shirt that must be in accordance to what headquarters wants us to wear. (Abercrombie & Fitch)"
good,"The position for Managers and Assistant Managers is a revolving door, sales associates did not have the opportunity to benefit from the professional skills of their superiors"
good,"unorganized corporate office, difficult District and Regional Managers, low salaries."
good,"I stayed at this job because of the people. I made so many friends there. The job, however, is stressful and does not pay enough"
good,It's a nice working environment and the co-workers are usually willing to help.
good,The company is all about visual representation. I learned most of my visual experience with this company. It was great but not mature enough to work for me. Needed to move on.
good,"My typical day at work involved providing customer service, cleaing and being a cashier."
good,"On a typical day I am in charge of 6-20 employees (given the time of year), making sure they are zoned out to complete a specific task and making sure those tasks are being completed correctly. I also keep a log of present sales compared to last years sales. I make sure all clothing is pulled, prepped and placed according to company guidelines to ensure our store runs smoothly. The hardest part of the job is the constant training of new employees derived from the weekly hiring goal per manager set by the company. The best part of the job is the relationship building between employees."
good,"This was not my favorite job, the managers were self centered, the schedule wasnt very well planned between managers, the pay was not good at all."
good,"This job is only a job if you are in highschool or if you are in college and already have a job. The hours per week varies from 4-30 hours, it all depends on if the manager likes you to put you on schedule a lot. If you apply for model position expect long hours standing in one spot, doing repetitive things. If you apply for impacter expect having lots of shipement and not enough hours or people. No break unless you work 6 hours and then its only 15 mins. Expect superficial DM'S and management. This is an image based company an you will be judged just on that no matter how good of worker you are. There is also a strict look policy you must follow at all times."
good,A typical day at work involved clocking-in sweeping and dusting in the morning along with greeting customers and folding merchandise. Also checking out customers on the register. I learned that a lot of people love to shop there and how to work a register quickly. Management never really did much but text and talk to workers. All my co-workers were friendly and diverse. The hardest part of my job was keeping a look out for shop lifters. The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting them on finding the perfect match for there outfit and also having a discount on merchandise.
good,-learned selling techniques.
good,"Great out of college entry level work experience! However, lots of politics and games when it comes to promotions and managers get burned out very quickly. Managers also are not compensated past their 40 hours and are expected to ""go above and beyond"" by working past their scheduled 40 hours."
good,"good training in HR, supervision and store management. wanted 50-60-hrs per week but only wanted 40 reported. unregular schedule."
good,"Working here is fine. You don’t get any hours but it’s an easy job for what it is. If you are brand rep then your job is to just fold down the rooms, maintain cleanliness and give the best customer service possible"
good,"If you're not in the cool set of departments good luck getting promoted. be ready to work 70+ hours a week for a minimal cost of living increase while your peers pass you by on the career ladder. Lots of good people leave for better money, it's a good stepping stone to get experience but don't linger here with their ""Promises"" of promotions and raises. It won't happen. Get used to seeing good people who have been in senior specialist or low level management rolls who hold a plethora of institutional knowledge laid off so that some director can become a senior director and then the rest of the teams are left to pick up the pieces because the people getting the promotions and laying those under them off for the salary room don't actually care to understand how their departments work."
good,Company had great training and development program for managers in training. Once completed you become assistant store manager. I accepted a relocation and promotion to position of store manager in only six months time. Managers are then responsible for recruitment of all store staff including the assistant managers. Corporate homeoffice&district managers left the burden driving sales and staffing to SM
good,The only thing that was nice about this job was the break room because it was City walk so it was a lot of food places in the area. This job was good for first time workers while attending high school and going to JC.
good,My coworkers were cool. But omg. The GM was so condescending and passive aggressive. It really bothered me. The pay wasn’t worth the treatment. I will never work there again. Ever.
good,I loved working there when I started but later on the company just started going downhill and it was not an enjoyable place to work anymore. I used to use work there as an escape from my everyday life but I do not want to be there anymore.
good,Was not here for too long and did not really like the environment. Just stocked clothes and did not talk much to anyone. Managers came but had favoritism so there was barely any interaction between us.
good,I had multiple managers tell me to purchase Abercrombie & Fitch clothes so that I could wear them to work. I would receive comments on clothes that did not display the Abercrombie brand. Got around this buy purchasing my clothes online for cheap by stacking online sales with discount codes sent to my email address.
good,This place is like a highscool you have to be friends with the right people kiss the right butts. Management puts associates in position based on popularity and how long they’ve been there NOT because their actually the right person for the job. Assets protection is composed of mostly retards with the exception of 2-3 their rude asf
good,"It was okay. "
good,"It was a good environment to work overnight, no pressure as long as job was completed on time. Quiet working system and able to listen to music while working"
good,"a typical day was pretty boring, pretty much just folding clothes and ringing people up. coworkers were great and management was pretty good but the loop of music they play drove me absolutely insane and they only paid minimum wage so I didn't work there for long."
good,Abercrombie was my first job right out of high school. There was a time where I did not feel safe around an employee. Some of the employees and managers were good though.
good,"It was an okay job overall, I seriously loved my coworkers but we as a company didn't get enough hours and it was many of us who worked there and sometimes we got even up to three hours. I am not leaving my house for 33 bucks minus taxes."
good,A simple place to work especially for a part time job.  Good way to get started in the workforce.  Helps with management and organization skills.  Because it is part time schedule can be flexible.
good,"Had issues with their many ""dress codes"" that caused certain groups to be totally excluded from using the brand. ""Models"" had to wear specific outfits and their only real responsibility was folding shirts"
good,"If you are young and have lots of energy, this is the place for you. Be prepared to work more than 8 hours/day if you are in management. With that said, everyone got a long pretty great, which made time outside of work enjoyable."
good,It is a comfortable environment with fun employees. Busy hours are not stressful. Managers are very flexible with your availability and they treat you nicely.
good,"Everything was great at our location until they needed new management. They got the manager from another branch store (Hollister). Once she came over to our location, she changed everything. She tried to mold the business into almost a commission based job (That doesn't even pay commission). She chose favorites from her old store and hired them over to our location allocating our already low hours mostly to them. The job became just a title to most of us that were employed before she was transferred over."
good,"Although I made working at Abercrombie fun for me, it had a very slow working environment and the salary was very low for the work needed to be done. I enjoyed putting in my hard work."
good,New rules and the low hours caused me to leave. The on site managers are amazing but the higher ups are bad and strict enforcing new rules. Was relaxed and enjoyable until new rules.
good,"Abercrombie's hiring model is pretty exclusively hot teens. The job is stupid easy. Customer service and folding clothes. Things have changed, but when I was employed I struggled regularly the dresscode (couldn't even wear eyeliner)."
good,"On a typical date at work I would check the sales-gun to see what items needed to be replenised, and take them out to the sales floor. I would start working on shipment, then I would usually be pulled to the sales floor to help out. If the sales floor was being well managed I would stay in the stock room sensoring new items, preparing for sales floor updates , or preparing items for shipment. At abercrombie I was taught it was better to figure out how to do something on your own or ask a co-worker how to do something, before asking a manager. The managers always had alot going on and it was very rare that the manager would willing assist you in a task or provide wanted assitance. Depending on who you are, the managers would be more understanding than others. The hardest part of my job was feeling bothersome to the managerial staff and having to figure things out on my own. It would be really frustrating to mess up on a task I seeked asssitance on, and then making the managers believe I was incompetent. The most enjoyable part about my job was my co-workers and the relationships I built with most of them, my co-workers were hands down the best part of the job."
good,You enjoy working at abercrombie because youŕe able to trade off days with anyone in the group chat and ypu can take any shift as long as you weren working that day
good,"It was fairly simple work and I loved who I worked with. The pay could've definitely been better, but it was okay because it was just a high school job. There was also such a strong smell of cologne throughout the entire store, the music was blaring, and you have to buy new clothes every time a new catalog came out, but other than that I liked working there. You also get a discount on their clothes!"
good,They are very flexible with your work schedule. You get paid minimum. Hard to get fired from there. If they don't like you they won't schedule you. Just do your best. Be friendly and outgoing. The customer always comes first!
good,"This is good for a starting job, but not something you would like long-term. The management is not the best and the pay is not worth the amount work the associates do, especially if it's bi-weekly. Hours during the holidays are terrible and not much benefits working there besides 20% discount on store merchandise (not including those in sale)."
good,"This company takes anybody with a Bachelor's so my suggestion is to take the job then after a few years if you're not advancing fast enough, find another employer."
good,Dm plays favorites. Good goes unnoticed but bad always gets reprimanded. Small district so no job advancement unless somebody left the company. My store had 5 different managers within less than 2 years. Pay is fair for the actual job.
good,"Working at Abercrombie & fitch"
good,"Flexible hours and allows for shift coverage by anyone available. A very easy job to start, so perfect for entry level. Felt very draggy after just a few weeks, but if you do not mind then it will be okay."
good,"It is a good place to start if you are young and fresh out of high school. The hours, if you're part time, is 10-15 hours and the schedule is very flexible."
good,"There were several managers at any given store. Some of the managers had excellent leadership ability, but others would drink on the job. You also had to go through several non-paid security checks to make sure you weren't stealing every time you clocked out and went home."
good,They over hire and it really hurts your hours. They also have you on-call certain days a week and if you get called in you have to work so it really limits your plans in case you have to work.
good,"The first few days working at A&F were stressful since I was not prepared for some transactions that were never taught in training. Although I asked for more hours, they seemed to favor the ""seniors"" and gave me the least hours in a week I have ever worked. Workplace was pretty relaxing, since most of my time was spent alone with customers. The hardest part of the job was not letting the customer ""take over"" the situation, and the most enjoyable part was being able to do things on my own, at my own pace."
good,"Good for new or first time managers, allows for growth and development, if you have the right person in a position of leadership. Growth within the company will vary by location, supervisor, and need. It is not just based off of sole performance or tenure."
good,"Good place to work with great benefits. OK work life balance. You can take on a lot of responsibility very quickly and there is opportunity to move up within the company; however, there is constant change and turnover."
good,Seasonal work for the Christmas time. Wonderful co workers and management. A bunch of different opportunities like picking packing forklift driver and a lot more.
good,Not a company where a part timer can advance without a 4 year Bachelors Degree. People are usually friendly that work there. Discount Is not the best for the price of their clothing.
good,The amount of work put into a typical day as a manager working for Abercrombie and Fitch is often times overlooked. I felt like job advancement within the company was impossible unless you had a friend of a friend work at home-office to pull some strings to get you up that latter sooner..
good,"Working here was not at all what I had expected. You work a lot harder than one would think, and the term ""model"" means you fold clothes in the front room of the store for hours. It wasn't too bad, but the management was awful and people dont take working here seriously, which is frustrating if you are a hard worker."
good,"it was alright . I wouldn't recommend somebody who wants to work here for awhile . Like a nice summer job is good , but you will meet customers who like to steal kids clothes a lot or who don't like seeing things very diverse which they can be rude. But the employees are nice and okay."
good,"The hours were fair, the people were kind, the music was loud. Minimum wage remain $7.25 and didn't rise. Though the store was too posh, too not in my taste. Plus the CEO was really about anti-fat people which caused problems in the store, once."
good,The pay was ridiculously too low which is why associates continue to leave because they are getting min wage. Advancement options seemed very nonexistent.
good,"Organizing merchandise with store managers and creating displays and objectives. "
good,"I was a Brand Representative and our store wasn't very busy so this was a very boring job.  When I wasn't folding or working the register, I'd dust or sweep the floors."
good,"I enjoyed working at the Fayetteville location, but management was awful. I only received negative reinforcements, and the management staff was very catty. I felt disrespected and constantly feared for my position because of the rude store manager"
good,"The good things"
good,"The people that you work with make the environment fun. The managers were very into micro managing tasks. The hours were sometimes not enough, and call in shifts were annoying."
good,"trendy, busy and ever changing, you will learn fast when you first come into the door but the advancement is truly up to your DM and RM.  Jobs like these are always performance based."
good,"Part time, you'll get 20 hours a week max. Usually shifts are 4-6 hours. Management was good when I was there. Flexible hours helped with school."
good,Great place to work if your just looking for experience and a decent work environment overal. I enjoy my time working their. No career advancement or potential for a raise.
good,"Trabajo a media jornada que permite conciliar estudios y trabajo, durante la época de estudio en la universidad  es el trabajo ideal."
good,I feel that working for the company in the long run is not benefiting to me in regards to moving up in the company. I want to work in a company where I have the ability to move up quickly and I don’t feel that opportunity with Abercrombie.
good,"Hectic days, associates are always quitting."
good,Employees definitely get underpaid. It is minimum wage. Employees don't get scheduled very often. Short shifts for little pay. Not worth it.
good,"It is difficult to preform to the best of your abilities with immature management teams but if upper management supports you, you can move up quickly."
good,It is a great place to interact with people. You also get to move around the store a lot to help customers with all their needs.
good,Fun side job to have. Don't rely on this as your main job. Never really had an issue with management and it's fun working with everyone. New employees are hired too often.
good,Coworkers and some managers were well understanding and everyone was cool to be around. But the only problem was no room for growth and not enough working days because they hired over 500 people ans people days and hours were being taken away
good,"Very minimal work hours given. Overall easy job, labor wise. Not many opportunities for job advancement. Recommend for those that have a busy school schedule."
good,The job is way different for someone who lives in the US but Canada has very limited opportunity for advancement with very high turnover of staff. The two are definitely linked. Schedule can be flexible depending on store but they don't really back up their store front employees.
good,The atmosphere at work is favorable and so are the customers . Management just is really screwed up they pass off their tasks to the associates.
good,"A very fun, young company to work for however, favoritism exists a lot within the management teams. I've noticed that having a good relationship with the supervisors gets people closer to getting a promotion, even when they don't deserve it."
good,"A typical day at work starts with a five minute meeting of what needs to be done for the day. My job duties can either be folding the merchandise and making them look presentable or running the register."
good,I successful combined to work as a cashier during my bachelor in economics. I worked both as a cashier and as a model at Boom Models in Milan.
good,"A typical day at work during the week was usually a slow steady pace, at certain there would be certain intervals throughout the day where it really picked up but nothing to bad. During the weekends and holiday seasons are the most stressful for any retail worker, but overall manageable. Management was not consistent in expectations. Head manager was often unprofessional, at least at my old workplace. The hardest part of the job i would say is seeing that paycheck after all that work you did.The most enjoyable part of the job would most definitely be being able to talk and help all kinds of people from around the world, of course i worked in the galleria though."
good,"Everyone is easy going. Easy place to work and get along with associates. One sided when it comes to a females argument. Direct manager doesn't really have any power in figuring out whats really going on in the store other than going by what the store manager says. So make sure you kiss the store managers butt or he/she can set you up for failure. If management is handled professionally than being promoted will seem fair and easy going, but moving up the ladder in the company is very difficult when people are choosing favorites instead of how hard people are working."
good,Good pay but long hours and very hard manual labor job. Short breaks and overtime is not optional. Not the type of job I would stay very long at.
good,Corporate structure wasn't understanding of daily issues and concerns brought to their attention by the managers for the retail locations.
good,"A typical day at work included running a business. This included managing hours given by corporate office, paying attention to top selling items, filling the salesfloor with those items to push units and reach the daily currency goal. It also involved training our part time associates (ages 17-22) to be business minded and giving them redirecting feedback as needed. I have enjoyed being a trainer and mentor to them."
good,"Lot of work, fast pace, heavy load"
good,"If your looking to gain leadership and management skills, this is a good position for a young, fresh out of school job seeker."
good,"Working here would be great for students, because they can work around hours, but there's not much room for improvement in this line of work. There's also certain dress codes you have to follow by seasons, and they say you don't have to buy their clothes, but you really kind of have to, in order to promote the store. All the clothes there run small also. You basically do the same thing everyday, and don't learn much, since they keep all their ""models"" in front, and all the ""impact"" workers in the back. They care way too much about looks and the way your hair is. Off and On job, not enough hours."
good,many of the associates are teenagers. managing doesn't look as satisfying and fulfilling as other companies.
good,"Typical day at work included keeping that store to corporate standard. Includes clothes, sales goals and employees appearance. Easiest part of the job was to fold the clothes. The hardest part of the job was to fold clothes to corporate standard and keep in same condition during store hours."
good,"Abercrombie is a great way to get into management.  They have an awesome manager in training (MIT) program which allows collage graduates to quickly adapt to the working world by constant managing of hours, associates and scheduling."
good,picked and pack clothing and accessories for Abercrombie. the hours weren't that great but the people working there are great and are hard workers. Loved going to the sample sales and getting great discounts!
good,"When I first applied for Abercrombie & Fitch I wasn't sure what to expect. What I came to find out was that a typical day at work consisted of standing awkwardly in flip flops and saying, ""Hey, how's it going?"" whenever a customer walked by. We folded clothes, monitored dressing rooms, handled purchases and returns, all the while making sure we looked good doing it. It was definitely a strange atmosphere that merely felt like a standard customer service job with an artificial and glossy finish."
good,"Great learning experience, really good for me as a recent college grad. My co-workers were awesome and we all developed strong relationships with each other. However the actual company was hard to work for, the Home Office was too disconnected from the retail stores and the upper management rarely visited. "
good,High amounts of customer interaction. Shifts are usually busy and there are always tasks to be completed. Good mood throughout the stores and management is very goal oriented.
good,In the back steaming and folding clothes to put on floor display.
good,"Job duties include maintaining the appearance of the store and merchandise, assisting customers and stocking merchandise. Cashier duties included processing sales and returns."
good,Abercrombie and Fitch is a fun and exciting place to work. I have enjoyed working for the company but some times people out grow the company and need to move on things that they really enjoy. The most enjoyable part of the job is people who work for you such as your management team and associates. They are what brings the store alive and make it a fun environment.
good,"A typical day at work would conclude with me first getting a project from my managers which could be anything from folding clothes to make our store look presentable in the best way, answering phones whenever they rang, greeting every person that entered the workplace, and transfer items when needed.  i have learned how to work with other co-workers who were awesome. This is a job where as long as your working you could talk with your co-workers. The hardest part of my job is that when were slow which is a lot, the work day is slow. the most enjoyable part is working with people you get along with as well as the managers."
good,"long hours nice pay, pretty easy work, a couple nice co-workers, bad management, when you worked at a fast pase work went by fast"
good,the hours are long for the associates nd they never give them raises and starts at minimum wage
good,"This was more of an after-school summer job for me personally. The store was neatly organized and the staff was friendly. Most of the time I was standing around more than working because they were overstaffed and you just had to stand there and look good. The store was very dark and it had very loud music, so it is hard to have good customer and retail service skills when you can't hear or see well. You mostly had to pick up after people or watch for shoplifters. The store had a very high turnover with employees because they hired kids that are alot younger. The benefits were the discount on clothes and the staff connected very well based on demographic and age. Overall, not alot of room for advancement but an easy, fun and temporary place to work."
good,the company doesn't pay enough for what they expect. They only hire managers who have a bachelor's degree and they start off at little pay (less than 28k) The best and worst part is going recruiting managers have to drive their own vehicles and use gas to go recruiting. this is not paid for. I learned to manage time and tasks but this can be a nightmare if you dont have the right staff and enough staff. We get guidance twice a week on conference calls to help assist us with what can be improved. Overall the job is decent not great not bad.
good,"i clock in and am assigned to my daily task, its either visual or receive shipment. i do everything up to standards my managers are proud of my short time that ive been there and have been learning to much of the company. they always assign me to the hardest tasks cause they know i will finish on time and will perfect it. theres nothing really hard to do there i get everything i do, i enjoy my job when i receive shipment and take care of my visual tasks."
good,I loved working for this company as an impact team member as I was always busy and I loved working stock and floor set. I would also cashier at times as well. I loved the management as they were hardworking and always had a great attitude. The co workers were fun as well although I noticed some lacked a good work ethic. The hardest part of this job I feel was having to conform to so many regulations and guidelines. As well as purchasing the clothing of the store and not even making much to begin with. 
good,"If you do not have your degree, I do not recommend committing to this company. The only thing you can currently do without a degree is part time, lead stock, overnight manager, and stockroom manager (only in select stores) You cannot make any more money than about $14/hr without a degree, forever. (*Note my comments below about the schedule, if you think $14/hour isn't bad) If you have your degree, know that the end of the road is only 5-7 years away if you're lucky, and many, many long nights and days away. The time that you spend being tired and miserable heavily outweighs the time you will spend enjoying your job. "
good,"not much different from any other clothing retailer. hours varied by week. very strict set of rules to follow in regards to hiring, employee placement, spraying the store with product, etc."
good,"Working there was an average experience, the only great was assistance with customers and co workers, and receiving the discount. but as far as the pay goes, which it is a private company, doesnt pay as much."
good,Learned to balance time
good,"I enjoyed working here, for the most part. It was my first real job and as an eighteen year old it was exciting. I was able to grasp all facets of every position in the store, from visuals to cashier. The management was poor. Everyone was at the most straight out of college, mostly because they needed to adhere to the Abercrombie brand--young and for lack of a better word, sexy. I learned that there was more to life than dressing well and getting paid a minimum wage salary."
good,On a typical day I would oversee the cleanliness and presentation of the store. I would manage customer interaction through myself first and foremost but also with great communication to my assistant managers and part-time staff. I learned how to deal with all types of personalities and more important how to create an inclusive and diverse team. I learned how to prioritize and multi-task and give feedback to team. Management were great but with sometimes unrealistic expectations. Co-workers were all great. Hardest part of the job was meeting people standard while running all other aspects of the business. Most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with all the customers and co-workers.
good,"the hours i got were very poor, i didnt like the hourly pay. if anybody got a job there , they would really have to get a second job."
good,"Abercrombie and Fitch is a good part time job that is easy and fun. being a sales associate would include helping customers with finding products, sales, and the best suited clothing for the occasion the customer looking for. co-workers and managment are fun and easy to get along with. the hardest parts of the job was upkeep of the standards of the store while customers rumage through piles of clothing. the most enjoyable is the customer satisfaction after finding everything that they want or point them in the right direction to get them what they are looking for."
good,"the day usually started with the store opening, such as: banking, inventory,shipment,scheduling, then sales, in that order. co workers where amazing very hard workers. The only challenges i experienced at this job was unable to perform to the best of my ability due too lack of training."
good,Provides a great opportunity to learn the retail business for first time managers. High company turnover leads to quick advancement for aggressive candidates. Compensation not equitable with competitors.
good,"As a 17-year-old at the time, I was the youngest one who worked there and felt somehow left out and some of the employees were rude but most were nice"
good,Great culture not the management needs work and the higher ups beyond management are disconnected. Great discounts and benefits if you’re a key holder or associate manager
good,If you are a minor you either don’t get scheduled at all or you get one day every week. After the managers are quite nice but you need to be prepared to see favoritism happen.
good,just to get some experience but I had a manager who yelled and got her attitude with me on many different occasions. I ended up leaving because I felt super uncomfortable.
good,"The day to day expectancy in this job is really boring, and they do start at minimum wage. The culture there isn't really great either, the associates all seem to not enjoy being there. In fact most associates get along with just agreeing on how much they don't like the day to day procedures."
good,"Picking and packing training new people coming in to the company"
good,"The overall culture and values of the company align with all applicants searching for a company rooted in diversity and inclusion. however, the message can be lost with upper management"
good,The company claims to value diversity when they actually don’t. Higher ups love for those in a position under them to fawn over them just for a chance to gain promotions. Everyone is childish and wants attention. They don’t actually value those who work hard but those that seem to give the most gossip. But overall you get a decent pay for the amount of work that you’re doing.
good,A&F plays real ambient music that rarely feels joyous. I did not like the music; it dampened my mood. Every day I went to work I felt had a bad feeling.
good,Great for people who can multitask and keep up with a fast-paced working environment. Adaptability and leadership are integral to management positions.
good,typical day at work would be to fold clothes also help customers out with fitting rooms as well as finding the correct size they are looking for and at the end of the day get ready for the following morning which included cleaning.
good,"Fold clothes all day just to watch rude customers mess them up, then yell at you. Abercrombie and Fitch pays their employees minimum wage, yet ""strongly encourages"" them to purchase their clothing. DO NOT show up looking like you've strayed away from the style guide unless you want to be yelled at and then sent home."
good,"I liked my job if I would have got more hours and money would never have left. I worked in the stock room, should be fast last but they don’t hover telling you your not going fast enough. Dress code is simple no logos that isn’t  Abra Comby and Finch no pictures on clothes."
good,"For those who are going to school and need a little cash on the side, A&F is a great company. They allow you to create your availability and work when you can. Management varies upon location but the majority of them want you to succeed."
good,"This was my first job and I was very excited. Loved the fact that there was no actual ""uniform"" to be worn, just had to dress you way with no other brand logo displayed. Only issue I had, which is the reason why I left, is with scheduling. When I first started, I had open availability. Once I got my second job, I let them know that I wasn't going to have open availability anymore and that I could only start working at 4:00 everyday. They said it would take three weeks to process the change in the system. I offered a solution to switch shifts with different people until the change could be made but it only worked for one week. Following that week, I asked to be rescheduled for certain shifts I wouldn't have been able to make because of my other job. They said I couldn't change my hours, and that I would be written up for every shift that I missed, and after three write-ups I'd be let go. So instead of being fired I decided to quit."
good,This is a job for students in high school. They pay at minimum wage and to be a manager you have to have a degree which doesn’t make sense. You’re selling clothes and that’s really it. The managers never went to meetings and if they did it would be on the phone.
good,Working here opens your eyes to a different prospective. There is a lot of micromanagement within management. (Go figure) There is a lot of politics involved and inconsistencies
good,A good first job or job for those looking to understand the retail side of working. Training is thorough. Shifts are generally spent with friends and are laid back.
good,The company is a great company to work for. The company’s management team is forever changing. I’ve been with some really great teams and no so great. If you are lucky to be with a great team you will get promoted easily. If your team is lazy and are lazy to develop you. You will stay in your position for a long time.
good,"Workplace culture is very upbeat and a perfect start to learning about management, providing customer service, and self-growth."
good,"Amazing people but it’s not for everybody. You have to work on the tills, in the stock room and also doing overnight shifts which has a big impact on your social life"
good,I worked for some great people that developed me and pushed me to achieve success and fulfillment in my career and i worked for others that saw me as a tool in their toolbox to get the job done.
good,"Fellow associates are very helpful, although some work how they get paid: minimum wage. Most of the management is friendly and very encouraging but upper level management like the general manager is disrespectful and demanding."
good,Working at Abercrombie was a cool experience. I've learned alot from some of the managers I've worked with. And it has helped out a great bit with time management.
good,"They hired far too many people so getting scheduled was difficult and unpredictable. The work day could be either stressful or painfully slow. The managers were nice and reasonable people, but often times responsibilities fell through the cracks and sometimes closing would take hours."
good,The store was relaxed and employees had a great relationship with each other and various customers. Learned more about retail and the brand. Various tasks included customer service and working the cash register.
good,"You do not really get a raise, and the wage is minimum wage. One of the stock manager was really nice, but other than that they are not very friendly toward associates."
good,"For the most part you are helping customers look for clothes and checking them out at the register while keeping the sales floor tidy and organized. It can be a fun place to work depending on the associates and the day of the week but for the most part it's really slow with little foot traffic. Nothing is really hard about the job, but maintaining presentable clothes throughout the day can become tedious."
good,If you want to live out your college days and continue the fraternity lifestyle then this is the perfect fit for you. Management will tell you they will be promoting you every month just to keep you on.
good,"Can be tedious, however co-workers are young and friendly. Great place to gain experience in customer service and great opportunities to move up as long as you work hard."
good,"the job was taxing and management was flawed. The distribution of hours was favored towards certain employees, there as friction between the managers which eventually caused one to quit and I followed suit."
good,"I worked as a brand representative at A&F. It was a good first job, the pay was pretty low. But the discount was really good. Its a chill job. I liked being on the cash wrap more than being in rooms and fitting rooms. There were many managers and some of them micromanaged."
good,"Culture is passionate and devoted to brand, product, and store experience.  Open, collaborative work environment.  Too focused on quarter by quarter results versus sustainable long term strategy."
good,"Perfect part time job for someone working 2 jobs or going to school. Slow paced, no job experience required just needs to pass interview and be recommend by manager or previous worker"
good,Lack of career advancement and lack of value placed in employees. Discount was nice 5 things at half off for every season. Due to value not placed in employees Store manager turn over rate was very high.
good,"Great job to work part time while doing other things. Easy relaxed place to work with some pretty cool people, the pay is the worst though. easy place to work."
good,Getting Everything ready and off the shelves and ready to go out on the floors. Bringing stuff back that was left on the floors and Iron and Get ready to go out again. Fold clothing and prep. Hardest part was probably checking numbers each month. Most enjoyable was co-workers.
good,"Working at Abercrombie, I would be in the back most.. helping with stock. I would come in the store every so often to help keep up with organization, but mostly I would be fixing up the back. Management was okay for the long part. I ended up leaving due to serious surgery requirements."
good,Working at Abercombie was decent. They just work you like a slave and pay below minimum wage. The mangers were pretty cool. That job has taught me how to communicate well with others.
good,"You don't get paid enough and there aren't any raises. All you do is fold clothes, greet customers, and use the register. You usually only work 4 hours a day if you're part time which isn't really much."
good,I worked with the team but the management team lacked communication. the pay was very poor. management were non-friendly. very rude management team too.
good,"A fun and fast paced work environment, but the pay and the hours do not make it worth it. Good management program, however the people in upper management do not treat everyone fairly and have unrealistic expectations."
good,Their is a disconnect between the people at top and hard workers on floor running equipment. I really like working their and hope i get to continue working there until i cant. I like the guys and did not mind the workout. I am happy to try and work hard and keep this my current postion
good,Good job for young college students looking for seasonal work in the retail industry. Great if you are looking to transfer stores seeing as there are many around the world.
good,"While I did enjoy my coworkers and managers, the position I had did not fit my needs and long term goals.  I was not with the company for long and I did not have a problem with the job duties.  I just didn't feel like it was the correct place for me to work."
good,"Minimum wage pay. Very busy stores, learned how to work better in a team. Workplace culture is very hip and fun and natural. Hardest part is customers."
good,The day are short which is the most enjoyable day. I don't think there was an hard part with this job. Management was fair when you first start working there and then lose hours while time goes on
good,Working at Abercrombie can be fun if you don't mind a lower salary and working with kids all day long. Or if you like to inhale all the cologne that is sprayed to keep the store smelling like Abercrombie.
good,"Starter job that does not require much skill. The people who you work with really make your experience there, try not to get on a managers bad side - they will cut your hours if they don't like you."
good,Abercrombie is an easy place to work. Gives you in off time to go to school and work too. Everybody is friendly. Just the mananagers are full time the others must be part time.
good,"There was no room for advancement from an Assistant Store Manager to a Store Manager. I had requested to go work overseas but was always told no until the store I had worked at was closing and then the District Manager asked me to open up a store in China with no additional pay. Why wait until the last minute when I had been asking for a long time, no one wanted to promote."
good,"The day consist of standing around folding clothes most workers were on there phones because nobody would come into the store, the manager would sit in the back and goof off, this workplace was not taken seriously at all."
good,"I was in High school when I applied, the job itself wasn't too stressful. low hours and no benefits for sales associates.  They do have a dress code, so you are limited to what you can/want to wear at work."
good,Being a manager at Abercombie sucks. The pay is just horrible for requiring a four-year degree. My store manager is awesome but this job has a ridiculously high turnover rate for the lack of pay with not much possibility of growth unless making a little bit of money. This is the job for you if you're willing to wait six years for the chance to make below the national average salary for an American. STAY AWAY.
good,It was okay. Would only recommend it to teens that are still in school. It could be changed in many other ways. I left after maybe 3 days of working there. It isnt worth it and you dont get hours
good,"Fun environment where work can be relaxed, and easy. Nice part time job. Management in the store constantly changes every 3 to 4 months. Therefore, management and how good it is depends on each manager in the store."
good,"I work really at what I was doing. I didn't like how I was a student still at school and I was working from 4:30 to 12:00 at night when I wasn't working at my other job. After work you have to prep for the next day, and I guess one of the managers didn't like it so she came by and knocked everything down and made me re-do it. I wasn't properly trained at all I missed one or two paychecks I didn't received. They stopped putting me on the schedule because one day I had death in the family. I liked the job but not so much the managers. I wasn't allowed to take a break, and at the time I was pregnant. I love that you have to learn from your mistakes and move forward."
good,"The most enjoyable part is the people I work with, I learned teamwork and people skills. The management could have been better, but overall is was okay. The hardest part was always staying late, past 11 p.m. most nights. A typical day includes running around on the sales floor making sure customers needs are taken care of, and making sure the store looks organized. Also making sure that clothes are replenished onto the floor from the stock room."
good,This job was great when I was in class full time. Very flexible with my hours. Normal work day would consist of me greeting customers and making sure they knew where to find anything.
good,"Co-workers were great to work with, Management as well. Job security and part-time positions were all negatives. Work enviroment was good."
good,I enjoyed working with all of the employees. unfortunately there was no room to grow. I enjoyed training new employees when they came in and helping customers find what they were looking for.
good,A laid back place to work with great coworkers. Changes at the executive level have the company moving in the right direction.
good,"I enjoyed my time at A&F, it was a fun and playful environment and most of the times, we didn't feel as if we were at work, but that being said, it was not a ideal situation to be in when you had visits from home office. we were told to be cool and chill but once someone came to visit, we had to pretend like we cared. didn't enjoy judging people by their looks before hiring them. company told us to hire good looking people even after they would advertise that there's diversity in their staff."
good,I worked her for most of my high school years and I had a blast. I enjoyed the people I worked with and was a stress free environment to work in while attending school.
good,"Abercrombie is not a good place of employment if you are looking for work that is meaningful or beneficial to your growth as a person. There are little hours available, room for advancement, or tasks to do at work. It is mostly folding clothes and greeting customers."
good,I worked overnight stock for this company. It's fun if you aren't a peoples person and like to work and listen to music. you pretty much just come in after the store closes and restock the shelves and table and make the store presentable. I normally worked from 10pm-6am at my store so if you don't like to up late and work long hours  its not for you.
good,"Abercrombie is great if you just need a bit of extra money but i would not recommend if you are looking for something to support yourself on, not enough hour or pay"
good,"A typical day at work included managing different parts of the store, such as the front where you would have to great incoming customers, the fitting rooms, the back room, and the cash registers. It was a fun place to work at since most of my coworkers attended my school, so we all got along. Some things that I learned from working here is time management, public speaking, customer service, sales, organization, and networking."
good,"A typical day was folding clothes, greeting costumers, running the cash register. Co workers were awesome but management was not friendly. I learned to run a cash register."
good,"- gute Kommunikation im  interkulturellen Team "
good,A&F was fun to work at and meet other people that was into what you're into.  Its a different kind of work place but it was always laid back and chill.  The hours weren't great though and the scheduling was
good,Its a great place to start working if you're looking for retail experience they're very flexible with there schedule. Hours are terrible though.
good,"Easy place to work, deal with customers a lot, coworkers are very polite and easy to get along with,and  the managers are very understanding when you need days off."
good,"Employees were very nice and helpful, which made the job much more enjoyable. Mostly greeted customers, and folded clothe on my free time. If this job ever taught me anything, it's that retail isn't what I enjoy doing."
good,"While working at Abercrombie the days often went by smooth, however being a college student embarking upon graduation i quickly found that there would never be a great opportunity in moving from the current position I held."
good,"was sexually harassed by the assistant manager "
good,Managers change over a lot in retail. My previous district manager advanced me quickly and set out a roadmap for my career. I and other managers left the company because my new district manager didn't seem like that was important. You can't keep people in retail if they have nothing to look forward to or no reason to accomplish goals.
good,"Company offers good benefits however their pay can be better. Advancements in the company could happen; it's based on the luck of the draw (when someone leaves or gets promoted, everyone either moves up or gets transferred out). Needless to say, the holidays gets everyone stressed out and it shows through the actions of the upper managements; that is the hardest part of working here in the company. "
good,My management/leadership skills improved from the experience I gained while working there. Typical day involved budgeting hours and  associates as well as pushing sells.
good,"Working for this company can be somewhat fun, but unless you have a good relationship with your management team along with you supervisors, advancing in the company is somewhat challenging.I believe that there is a slight existence of favoritism, that has helped supervisors decided on who gets promotions."
good,Fun place to work but little opportunities to advance with the company.  Low weekly hours and pay.  Supportive management and employees. Learned how to better serve customers in the retain setting.
good,overall decent place just doesn't always have things organized all the time i didn't like how we never really were guaranteed our 40 hrs
good,Typical teen retailer which was popular at that time. The environment was fun but the compensation was not good. Stores began closing down in the metro.
good,I don't like the job because I'm not placed in a position where I can utilize and develop my skills. I'm educated in sales and customer service but I'm placed as folding clothes at times. and there is no  way you can progress to the next level within the company.
good,"Abercrombie was a great place to work. Fast paced, great music, and good sales. I learned how to work calmly under pressure and great interpersonal skills with co-workers and customers. Management was top notch. The people I worked with were all around the same age group so it was easy to relate to one another. The most difficult part of the job, in my opinion, was keeping the floor and merchandise presentable and meeting the standards throughout a work day. I enjoyed working in retail because it's a field that I'm very comfortable with."
good,"I've worked with Abercrombie and Fitch for four years now, so seeing the ins and outs of the whole thing is truly a scary thing. It is an easy job, minimal thinking involved, but a lot of work when you do know what you're doing. This job is not worth the compensation, in my opinion. For a part-time employee that looks just to make some money when home from school, there's a lot expected from me. I have helped new managers learn what they need to do and what is expected of them, for minimal pay. I have spent numerous hours working off the clock or until 3 am preparing for a visit that typically doesn't even happen. The hours are great, you can basically pick your schedule, but you only get your schedule on a week by week basis. And, unless you know weeks prior to what it is you're doing, you can't take off work and are stuck with the possibility of having to work. There are a lot of flaws with the way this company is run, but for a first job it is great, and for a job to come back to when you just want some money when you're away at school is good too."
good,"Typical day: you open up the store, Put new clothes out, and manage the business numbers.  You will come up with new ways to help sell the clothing.  It is 100 percent customer service."
good,Brand Representatives were responsible for the cash registers. Greeting customers and providing customer service. Environment was definitely fun to work at. Meeting of people from around the world was the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"not enough hour"
good,"misserable job where you perform depressing task in a closed environment for 4 to 5 hours a day. if you like to see the sunlight, you will miss it. but the people (assosiates, managers) are really nice and easy to get along with. the job flexibility is the best, you can literally go to work when you feel like it and if you dont then you have the option to give your shift away to anyone else aswell as pick up any shift from people who dont want to work any day during the week."
good,They were very flexible with my full-time college schedule. I learned the basics of working in a clothing retail environment.
good,"I made some of the best of friends working here, but the company does not invest in its management team, resulting in a large turnover."
good,"Learned that theres a lot of personalities, but I was able to bring everyone together and have a better team work than what they already had before."
good,"Have to work for little money, No experience needed. A lot of people and managers and coustomers are terrible"
good,"- organizing merchandise "
good,"I learned how to deal with customers. My Management tough me to become a good people talker how to sale the product. There was no hard part about the job, It was a very enjoyable place"
good,Very organized retailer compared to other stores. You meet great people and make friends. Upper management very political
good,"This job is only for people who don't care much about working. Hours suck, clothes are too tight for guys, strong perfume smell in the store, not the kind of job you want to stay in."
good,"Pros: "
good,I didn't really like working here. I was always kept alone working while managers stayed in the back and didn't do anything but sit there an gossip.
good,"I was a member of a highly effective sales team tasked with the responsibility of meeting set monthly targets coupled with achieving the highest customer satisfaction. As a member of a retail sales team, I was responsible to responding to customer queries and ensuring that we have above 80% of repeat customers."
good,"Abercrombie & Fitch Co. helps you acquire essential management and ethical skills. The hardest part of the job, for me, was the hiring process that we were required to follow."
good,"I learnt about how to communicate with customers and how to deal with problems or issues that came up. Developed my social skills, and remaining positive in difficult situations or when a customer was unhappy and had a complaint. "
good,"Typically, I would come early and stay late for my shifts. I would assist the morning manager and oversee/delegate tasks to sales associates. I would prioritize and complete daily agenda tasks. I maintained cleanliness and enforced company standards/policies. I hired quality employees and thoroughly trained associates. In general, I maintained positive relationships with employees. The hardest part of the job was the chaotic management in place and unequal work effort from co-managers. The most enjoyable part of the job were before opening / after closing, when we could listen to music and have fun while performing necessary daily tasks/operations."
good,The job has some tedious task that seem meaningless but you will always find co workers to get along with. There is a huge diverse staff and it is filled with young energetic people that always seem happy. Fun place to work but never scheduled many hours always have to look to pick up shifts from others.
good,"A typical day at work consists of greeting customers, keeping the store folded; clean; and presentable, providing customer service, and taking inventory at the end of the day. During my time at Abercrombie, I have developed better people skills and learned how to cope with difficult personalities in a friendly manner. My co-workers have a sense of camaraderie, mostly friendly college students all striving for the same goals. Management, especially at the upper levels, has not been running smoothly as of late. Store hours have been cut yet new hires are being added all the while and there are not enough hours each week for each employee to have a shift, poor management is becoming a large problem for the corporation. The most difficult part of the job is having an unreliable schedule from week to week due to having so few hours. Working with difficult customers is never a walk in the park but every industry has its setbacks and working with such customers helps build character and teach one how to manage situations in a professional manner. The most enjoyable part of this job is camaraderie among employees and the chance to meet and interact with new people each day."
good,"Great training for management, recruiting, training and managing a large team.  Really learn how a business operates.  Every day was new and exciting. Work with great people who are life long friends. Pay was not on pace with other store managers. Long hours especially if understaffed. Just an overall fun environment."
good,"long hours enjoyed coworkers, crazy business practices, room for advancement"
good,"This was were I first found an interest in customer service. I didn't like that clothes we sold, or how they made us dress. What I did grow to like was the feeling of assisting a customer and making a genuine connection with them"
good,"During a typical day of work consisted of: greeting customers, folding/ organizing clothes, stocking the merchandises, and working at the register. During my time there I learned how retail organizations carry out there works duties. Fair to say the management was somewhat inexperienced, immature and very unorganized. My co-workers were a positively influence my work experience, a variety of ethnic groups and down to earth people. The hardest part of the job I would say, was coping with difficult customers. On the other hand,  the most enjoyable part of my job would be helping out customers because they usually thank you for assisting them and are usually very appreciative for the assistance."
good,"This was only a part time job to help me pay the bills during college. It was a good environment but with flexible scheduling, but that is the only positive thing I have to say about the company."
good,"Management was not on the same page. "
good,"The people I work with are great. Most are college students who work part-time. Co-workers are friendly and they easily become your friends even outside of work. Managers change every few months. Some managers are great while others are just horrible. Hours vary depending on how much the managers like you, how you dress up, how you present yourself. Main thing is to make your managers like you so they give you hours!! Call-ins are annoying. If you have a call-in shift, you have to call the store an hour before your call-in shifts start to ask them if they will need you to come in or not. It basically wastes your time because you dont know whether you are working or not until an hour before that call-in shift starts."
good,This was a good company to work for if you are a high school student looking for a little extra cash. They do not give you many hours so they have a variety of workers.
good,Restocking shelves and tagging clothes with stickers within a time frame
good,"Abercrombie was a part time summer job for me that actually ended up lasting me over a year. Personally, my store managers were very nice, helpful and personable, but the corporate culture in my opinion was arrogant and stuck up. Most co-workers did not care about their responsibilities and would find ways to slack off. The responsibilities include a lot of busy work that really made no difference. You could spend an entire shift folding and detailing a table only for corporate to say that its wrong and they like it better a different way even though you carefully followed their instructions the first time."
good,hectic schedule ....always expected to close and the music gets old after a while
good,"A typical day at work consist of dressing in nice clothes and working at cashier, customer service for all/any customers that walked in, I greeted each customer with a smile and a tag phrase. The management was laid back, everyone did their own job. The co-workers were all spread apart and did their job. The hardest part of the job was standing for long hours at a time without eating. My stomach couldn't handle it. The most enjoyable part of the job was greeting and meeting new people every day."
good,"A scheduled day at work as stockroom manager would have been nine hours with a one hour lunch break.  Actual work hours involved 11 or more hours, often with lunch being eaten in the stockroom.  Employees found it very easy to call in or not show up causing the stockroom manager to fulfill their duties or other employees to be called in to work when otherwise unscheduled.  This was common in a typical day at work.  Inventory of the stockroom was taken weekly.  On a daily basis the stockroom was to be organized and/or maintained as well as swept and mopped.  The stockroom manager checked daily the inventory of the actual store outside of the stockroom and made sure which items needed to be filled, filling the inventory of the shopping floor.  Daily the stockroom manager worked with customers in the store, assisting shoppers and finding particular items as well as performing register duties such as returning items, exchanges, and purchases.  Shipment from other stores or headquarters was received twice weekly and added and organized into the stockroom according to the charts received from headquarters.  As well as receiving, the stockroom manager was responsible for shipping items to other stores, as per orders from regional managers.  Organization was a strict and key element in properly maintaining a stockroom.  Monthly visits from regional managers involved reviewing the stockroom organization and inventory paperwork.  Weekly manager meetings kept lines of communication open and addressed situations in a positive atmosphere.  Weekly interviews took place as well as monthly"
good,Its a good way to start. You learn to work as a team member and also independent. 
good,"Working for a big retail company is not for everyone. Everyday is different and can be stressful. Although the environment can be fun and exciting at times, the work hours are not always the best part."
good,-A typical day at work consisted of folding clothes and waiting on customers.
good,"-A typical day would involve interacting and assisting a vast amount of customers, running fitting rooms, maintaining sales floor, an.d operating customer."
good,"Stand at the door and greet customers, complete transactions and stock items. Management was close with me and other co-workers. Mostly college students. Enjoyed working with people mostly my own age."
good,"I enjoyed meeting coworkers and the environment but, benefits are not good and discount is horrible! You will get ""free"" products and they will take a portion out of your pay check. The worst was on call because you can't plan anything to do that day."
good,"I worked there for 6 months, during the time I was off from school. I did not continue working there because they were unable to move me to a different location when I went back to school."
good,Ensuring store standards and stock levels. Manage and develop staff. Providing great customer service.
good,"Abercrombie is definitely not a place for everyone. But, as a recently graduated high school student it was a great place for me to meet new people and have a place where the work was consistent. But, the policies are unreasonable and it is work place for younger individuals. The most enjoyable part of Abercrombie is the customer service aspect of it and talking with customer's to help them find exactly what they need. I definitely learned a lot from dealing with the wide range of people that come to shop at Abercrombie. Co-workers and management are always changing which, can be a good thing to meet new people but at the same time it gets kind of irritating. All in all, Abercrombie is a minimum wage job and there are many cons but it has an addicting quality to it that people can't get away from."
good,"In 2 1/2 years I was able to scratch and claw my way up to a fill-in group lead position. No one else had moved in the company as they liked to hire from outside and put fresh management figures into the fold with very little to no experience. Supervisory turnover was very high due to the fact that management kept shuffling their leads and supervisors around from department to department, keeping the morale low on supervisors kept the morale very low for everyone else."
good,"I worked weekends at this place of employment and was payed minimum wage. I spent my time at work greeting customers, organizing the products, and assisting customers with finding the particular items they wished to acquire. Management was not very involved unless an incident occurred and coworkers mostly kept to themselves. I enjoyed interacting with people but was not getting the amount of hours needed."
good,Fun place to work. Customers are sometimes impudent and disrespectful. Associates are generally happy and the environment is engaging. One can find many people that they enjoy being around.
good,Great summertime relaxing part time job. If you like folding clothes over and over again then its the perfect job for you.
good,"Was a good ""first job"" experience. Management was very laid back & were quite flexible. Pay is very low & very little chance of advancement. Would recommend the job to somebody in high school, but not anyone else."
good,"Abercrombie was a nice relaxed environment, but I noticed favoritism and unprofessionalism started surfacing the longer I worked there .. which made me uncomfortable."
good,"Heaps of teenagers worked there, the activity was really loosened up standards savvy. However, there was a major quota to meet so their were a few desires generally speaking that ought to be satisfied regular. The majority of my collaborators were extraordinary and super with the exception of me and others."
good,here and there managers beef but other than that its cool. its a lot of women so people having problems with each other is something that happens often
good,"I started there shortly after transferring universities. My first set of managers were amazing. When the second set came in, there were a few that the employees butted heads with. I moved and started work in the TN location, which was an easy transfer. I loved the management team I started with there, but they started leaving. We ended up getting a manager from Hollister and her and the original SM fought hard to keep the team together (DM wanted new, younger faces. She wanted us to work the stock rooms and not the main floor, but wanted us to make the store look perfect when it was floor set time). "
good,Was a nice job to have as a teen with high school. Great to interact with others and start off your career in a flexible company that was popular during my generation.
good,"My experience took place at Abercrombie and Fitch's subsidy company Hollister. While there I met a lot of great people, many of them college students working two or more jobs. I was being paid under minimum wage and had only 8 hours a week. I also did not work every week, this made it hard to take care of myself independently. When I interviewed for the job I asked the Hiring manager at the time if the job was the job a part-time or seasonal job. I was notified that it was full time and so I then accepted the job offer. Later after the seasonal time of year had passed I was notified that my position was terminated due to the season being over. I had ONE major problem while working there which was the inconsistency with one of the managers, he was often times rude to me and seemed to target me declaring that I was not completing my duties, I never had any other complaints out of any other of the managers, just that one. When my position was terminated I was contacted by a new manager who was under-informed about my working terms."
good,"Schedule was volatile, you learn basic management and business practices, management can vary from store to store, workplace culture varies on the teams that comprise a store, hardest part of the job was the very low pay and lack of work life balance, most enjoyable piece of the job were the people you got to meet and know."
good,"I was not treated fairly and everything I would present to them was not taken into consideration. I had many scheduling conflicts with school, after giving my availability."
good,"They didn’t give me enough hours or barely any. And with the pay, it was terrible. Management was good overall. Good management, very nice and friendly"
good,Harte Retailbranche mit freundlichen Angestellten und Führungskräften.
good,Introducing customers into the store was a fulfilling experience and operations within the establishment ran smoothly everyday. The culture was open and friendly.
good,"Needs more structure in upper management and need to focus on sales more, instead of brand image. I believe this is the reason for the decline in this company."
good,"This job was a lot of fun. Most of my co-workers were in high school. There wasn't much opportunity for advancement within the company. The discounts were great but you were expected to keep up with the new styles for work uniforms. They also primarily hire sales associates based upon their ""look""."
good,"Working at A&F was cool for a while, but it wasn't the job for me. You have to constantly stand through out your shift, talk to customers and managers, stock clothes and work fitting rooms, as well as operate a cash register. The hours were very flexible, you get to choose your own hours, and some of the managers are very friendly. If you like talking to people all day, I'd really recommend the job as that is most of it. However, I did not feel fulfilled by the job, and didn't like the fact that I had to stand for over 5 hours straight on most days."
good,Supportive work and learning environment. Learned all principles in running high-volume business. Schedule is very demanding. People culture is great. Loved working there!
good,The job it self isn't bad but the pay is horrible and there's no opportunity for a raise. Also work hours are not consistent. Constantly hires new employees which equals to less hours for current workers.
good,"The pay is terrible for how hard you work! Almost always worked over 40 hours and made overtime, however initial compemsation is very low.  Hardly ever give raises"
good,I helped to restock the store and also folded the clothes. I learned that this type of job wasn't right for me. The hardest part of the job was making sure that the clothes were folded according to how they wanted them.
good,Very hard to get hours but boring for the company is very relaxed and friendly. Give it a shot! This job is very easy and the store is always clean making you have less on your plate.
good,"The manage system was all over the place. I barely had hours to work some weeks because we had a lot of female brunettes working at the store,  and you were only allowed to have so many people of the same hair color working at the same time. That was frustrating to deal with. I also caught an employee stealing from the store that I had to report."
good,"in charged oh all the delivery special every wednesday and make sure that every clothes were in cuorrec order before opening the store, make sure everything was clean at the warehouse and boxes out"
good,"Although the schedule and your hours were flexible, the hours and work you do are not worth minimum wage. Their values and ways are fraud and I would not recommend working there unless you are a high school or college student just looking for extra cash."
good,"A great place to work, temporarily"
good,"Abercrombie and Fitch is a great starter job, because employees will learn how to work on a sales floor and how to interact with different kinds of customers."
good,"This place is a good place to have your first retail job. You learn how to deal with different customers and good retailer etiquette. After awhile you begin to realize the pay is not worth the customers you deal with. There are some really nice customers and some not so nice that like to test your patience (especially on busy days). Management doesn't communicate very well when it comes to important things about employees. I ended up with many scheduling conflicts, because they didn't communicate. The other thing that made me realize it was time to leave was they would write you up if you couldn't make it (and no one would cover it). Even if you are super sick or if you're having car troubles.  Many of the people who work there also have other jobs especially during the summer, so no one is willing/ can cover shifts. The work place is very diverse, but some managers do play favorites.  They changed the way they schedule hours so most shifts are 5-8 hours instead of 4. However, there have been times they don't schedule you for a month."
good,This is a good place to work if you are just starting out in logistics.  The work culture has cliques that you have to adapt to.  Constant changes with no set plan.
good,"My experience at Abercrombie was very diverse. When I began, it was small and everyone knew everyone. Over the course of my tenure, it expanded both domestically and internationally. a"
good,"Work was always fun with fellow employees and with everyday being different. There was no loyalty or great rewards with this company. Their values and rewards are based on physical looks and the willingness to work ALL the time. They were like ""slave-drivers"" and there was no overtime pay or any type of compensation or reward."
good,"Overall I thought that Abercrombie was a good experience. As a student, it's a great way to make friends with people of similar age. In addition the hours are flexible and not super long. However, I thought the pay was too low."
good,It was a pretty good start for a job since I was in highschool looking for a part time during the summer. The management is pretty understanding and the schedule is flexible during the summer.
good,"This company is fun for youngsters that are looking to have a good time, make some friends and nail some retail experience. If manager like you ( and yes, they often do play favorites) they will most likely approve of you taking a step up but it really all depends. The pay is not great but it's fine because most people are not that serious about working there anyway. The high school mentality of this company's culture gets old very quick, be prepared to find a plan B."
good,très grande entreprise. bonne entente entre collègues
good,"Unfortunately, despite the friendly work environment, I believe the  the company does not offer high enough salaries/benefits to incentivize potential employees who seek career advancement."
good,"A&F is a great place to work in your teen years. You meet some pretty great people and make really easy money. The management team, depending on what store you're at can be good or bad. Sometimes they are super lazy and try to hand off all of their work load to you."
good,"While the pay could leave more to be desired, the entire job was relatively easy to do. If you have good people skills and can fold clothes then this is the job for you."
good,Made great friends over the years. However looking back there wasn't much room to grow. Management lead by fear and intimidation rather than compassion.
good,"I did not enjoy working in retail. I did not like one of the managers there we had short breaks. Also, this company does not give enough hours to make a living."
good,Abercrombie is a business that is having trouble adapting to the evolving retail climate. There is constant change from the executive to entry level roles.
good,easily can get stuck without potential to move up. horrible work life balance. you work with great people but the company poorly compensates assistants and part timers
good,"- Diverse employees "
good,"The job was very slow paced and relaxed. On a typical day, employees would stand in the front of the store greeting customers, fold clothes and make sure all shelves were organized meticulously, or were in the back at the cash register. It was a simple job and not much effort had to be put in ."
good,"I worked for Abercrombie for about 5 years. I would have to clean the store, fold the clothes, ring customers out, find different sizes for customers, greet customers, get fitting rooms for customers, and change floor set. I made life time friends and most of the managers are understanding, flexible, and want the best for you. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers who are angry or just rude. The most enjoyable part of the job is the co workers you work with and that it is an easy job."
good,"I have been asked to work here many times after from different Abercrombie companies trying to recruit me again. I would never work for this brand ever again. Working here was basically everyday, you would get paid to look pretty. There would be no work being given to you. Most of the time, youre standing there refolding things that are already folded to make yourself look busy. Unless you are working on a holiday, you are pretty busy."
good,"While Abercrombie was a fun job because I worked with a lot of people, it was also a lot of stress in the Management position.  The other managers were often mean to the other employees and I didn't like the standards that A&F had."
good,"The people you meet are great, we're all so diverse. But the company overall is a terrible company from within regarding pay and hours."
good,"My overall time here was Ok. I left for three reason, I wasn't getting the hours that I was told that I would get, I didn't feel as if this was a job for me , and lastly, I was promoted to being a manager for current job. "
good,"I learned a lot from the management at Abercrombie and Fitch. However, the compensation package was very much lacking."
good,"There is room for growth if you constantly push yourself and make it known to supervisors, however unfortunately the compensation is not comparable to most retailers."
good,"Great place to start working if your looking for retail experience. they don't provide associate with enough hours, but that's retail and the managers pick favoritism"
good,Always busy with new coming impact team members. Job is a great way to interact with likeminded people. Busy work hours but really soc
good,A&F seems to be one of everyone's first jobs. There is constantly new management and new employees. Its a great first job but we all move on from it.
good,"Ambiente stimolante e ottimo trampolino di lancio nel mondo del lavoro."
good,"The associates are great, so are the customers. Sucks on the slow days cause time drags but when buisness is booming, being on your feet moving around helping customers feels great"
good,"I have been with this company for +6 years and looking to expand my knowledge in the workplace. I learned how to communicate and enhance my customer service skills over the past 5 years. How to handle certain situations with customers. Handled transactions, as well as increased sales. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people i work with make the job fun to be at. The hardest part is the time management and getting everything done in a timely manner, while budgeting for hours in the week."
good,"Horrible Pay, Good benefits, NO weekends off.  Great place to work! Part timers/ some managers are cool.  Assistant Managers work every Saturday night and Sunday morning."
good,"The job was what you can expect for a retail job. Minimal compensation for a generous amount of busy work. None of the work was necessarily hard, but it was time consuming and constant."
good,Each day is different when you work in a concept store for Abercrombie. Have to be very adaptable and accept that changes happen all the time without much notice or planning.
good,"As a popular retail company, work pace was always busy. it was fun to keep up with fun and trendy fashion while working there. Though working in one of the busiest malls in Georgia was a tad bit stressful, it was always nice meeting and helping customers each day. The assurance of customer satisfaction was motivation for me"
good,"Fun environment with a very upbeat staff. Managers are usually very like-minded. Hours are unpredictable, and you are often at work much longer than planned. Difficult to take time off from work."
good,"A normal day would consist of checking in with my manager to know they want me to do. Usually they would assign me to a register where I would check out customers or have me on the floor where I would maintain it's appearance and provide customer service. As my first job, working in retail helped me get out of my comfort zone, talk and deal with people with what ever needs they desired. ""Customer service is our main priority"" was highly emphasized by my mangers. All of my mangers were easy to get along with. Some were great at their job but unfortunately others were unfocused and so what had to be done during the shift would be carried out. Most of my co-workers were good people, would perform their duties correctly but others lacked effort because of this being ""just a part-time job"". Working part time at Abercrombie & Fitch was my biggest issue and at times a lackluster drive to actually work from management/co-workers made me question my commitment to stay. Though it being a fun work environment and being my first job is what made me stay as long as I did."
good,"Pull orders and box them for shipment."
good,"lots of walking"
good,I typical day at work for me would be clocking in and going to the back and seeing what there is to do. I would then be on that task for my whole shift if there is not something else to do or if i'm done.
good,"Abercrombie gave me the opportunity to have a part-time job but was really hard to catch any shift available because you need to organize your own rota on a group on facebook and they have a lot of employee."
good,"A typical day is overseeing all tasks that need to be completed for that specific day and thinking about days to come. Hours used for the week and day, zoning out employees in the store and making sure they have specific tasks and are focusing on customer service. Understanding priorities in the store and knowing what comes first and last on the list of things to do. Usually a fun environment with the occasional very stressful periods, but knowing how to stay organized helps. Co- workers vary, usually everyone you work with on management level is fun, but you do encounter those few who are lazy or too high strung and that makes working with them difficult. Usually the stores are understaffed with managers, this is the hardest part about the job. If your store does not have enough managers sometimes you get stuck without breaks or manager overlap. Also the company does not give enough hours for store coverage so usually you will have one other person working with you while trying to maintain an 8 room store.Good for someone just out of college and not sure what they want to do."
good,"I was scheduled at the busiest time of the day. I would start at 3:30 and would either do all the work myself or I would have one impacter to help me. The hardest part of my job was trying to get everything done in the amount of time that Abercrombie wanted me to get it done in. I would have a 6 hour shift and I would have 6 hours of shipment to go through and they also expected my to replenish the sales floor which would take anywhere from 1-3 hours. Working at Abercrombie and Fitch, I met some of the coolest people. I loved my co workers so much. They were all around my age and it was awesome to be surrounded by people who understood me but I took work more seriously than they did. Most of my managers were awesome people but of course like any other job, there were managers that I didn't agree with. I got conflicting instructions from many of my managers and would only give negative comments. I learned so much while working at Abercrombie. All the lead stocks including myself were taught how to run the store so that if it was ever needed, we could do the jobs that our managers did. So I knew how to ring up customers, open and close the registers, the opening and closing procedures and was apart of conference calls that informed us on how our district is doing and anything new happening in our stores. The most enjoyable part of my job was when I was being challenged and that was when we would do our new floor set. It was when we would put new items onto the floor and take the old ones off and into the stockroom. It was always crazy but I loved having the help of the impacters"
good,"This job was a great start of point for me because I had no experience in customer focused fashion retail jobs before this, I got to learn how to use the tills and it helped me build my confidence with talking to new people. I also learnt how to work as a team and I was given the responsibility to teach others how the company operated."
good,"Manage associates, meet business plans and keep track of shipment and inventory"
good,"Very nice place"
good,"My day always started out by making sure the store looked good before we opened up for business hours.  My main goal everyday was to have all shipment processed and the inventory room well maintained."
good,"loved working here, lovved the workers and managers. very fast paced"
good,"Great people. Rough hours. You will be promoted if you fit their look, are a hard worker and are willing to move. This is a great job to get right out of college just to get your feet wet in the work place. You will learn ALOT."
good,"Abercrombie and Fitch is a company with 3 sister stores that work together (Abercrombie, Hollister, and Abercrombie Kids). Managers learn how to run all aspects of a busy retail store; from scheduling to merchandising, It is a high stress environment where there is little work/ life balance. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with all the employees and corresponding with home office and other managers within the area."
good,"Upbeat place to work. Responsibilities involve running the business and customer service, organizing and controlling all visual updates and changes to the sales floor, managing and motivating my associates to help maximize profits"
good,"A typical job day would involve anything that would normally involve maintaing stock so doing go backs,  marking prices, lot's of heaving lifting, folding new and old merchandise to then run and put out on the floor and be organized from there. Some days I would be needed to assist customers finding something in the back stock or helping them with any questions they had about merchandise. Through working at Abercrombie I learned the in's and out's of the retail business and working with coworker's my own age an experience which I had never had before. My only challenge with the job was the fact that you didn't see the sun much but you got to see a lot of smiling faces when you were able to greet the customers so that was nice."
good,"Very difficult to build career, long hours, no work/life balance but great people"
good,"Not enough hours available, but did gain customer service skills."
good,"The fun part of the job is that you get the opportunity to run a million dollar business with a young and energetic team."
good,Fun great environment to work in. Great work style and casual wear. Friendly management and co-workers.
good,"If you just want to have a kind of part-time job experience, then fine, you can go there. not really for a long-term career path people. recommendation for students."
good,"Great place to work, however you can't support a lifestyle of comfort working here."
good,Fun atmosphere.  Perfect first job out of college as it allows you to step into a management position with no management experience.
good,i  have  learned  a  lot in  terms  of  managing people  and  multi-tasking  projrcts.
good,Work here if you want to make min wage but you can basically work whenever you want to. Management and other employees easy to get along with.
good,"Working at Abercrombie and Fitch gives you an excellent experience and informs you about everything about retail. It is a very easy job to keep up with however, some of the managers are difficult to work with and have poor ways of treating their associates."
good,"great place to work , had a lot of fun. The management really help when a problem occurred."
good,"Meeting quotas at specified pace"
good,Employees are friendly & turn over ratio is very high. Most of the employees are aspiring actors and/or models.
good,"its okay, it can be fun but boring at times. theres a lot of managers so it just deoends on what manager you have that you;ll be having fun or not. some managers are okay."
good,"every morning we would all be briefed of what needed done. Mainly I operated Pallet jakes, Forklifts sit-down/or stand-up."
good,"A typical day at work was coming in and making sure that the store was ready for the days' business. I learned about managing people beginning with my assistant managers and down to part time staff. I learned each and every person is different in learning in their own way how manage people. With this company you have to take a step back and realize that you have to set your assistants up to become the next store manager. I also learned a lot about myself not only with the way that i manage people but also that how to learn from my mistakes. "
good,"I got to learn a great skill set for future success. I learned great time management skills, how to work in a fast paced environment, how to improvise when things didn't go to plan, and most importantly, how to develop and lead a successful team."
good,Emphasis on the ultimate customer experience and attention to detail 
good,Pay is rather low. Management was actually decent. Co workers were decent also. Just your average retail store. 
good,Fun and easy but management has very high turnover. Constantly moved around and being borrowed at other stores as well as many random schedule changes. Never have consecutive days off. 
good,Enjoy a diverse group of customers. Must be able to multi task and have great customer service. Must be able to stand on your feet entire time and listen to loud music in a dim setting.
good,its ok .... but management needs to improve on social skills as well as work effort.
good,A typical day at work would consist of providing customer service and folding clothes; Keeping the workplace neat and tidy
good,"This is a company that always gets mixed reviews. And the reason why, is one day can be the best day, and the next, you want to quit on the spot. Your store co-workers and staff can be a lot of fun to be around, but watch out when upper management stop by. They have tendencies to be rude and short and easily dismiss the issues at hand unless it directly reflects them."
good,"days at work are generally okay, easy; management and coworkers are okay as well, the job is not that interesting to me, hence the reason I am looking for more employment."
good,"A typical day at work consists of customer service and standing and walking. The hardest part of the job is when you have to multi task with different customers when the store gets busy, especially having to stand for extensive periods of time or deal with a crowd. My co-workers were great for the most part. They are an enjoyable team to work with. The most enjoyable part of the job is probably working as a cashier. Overall this is a fairly enjoyable job that is unfortunately underpaid.The flexible hours are a pro."
good,"this company is good to work for and compensates you for average of what the industry allows. If your not attractive you are looked at as an outsider who doesn't belong. this was a deal breaker for me, couldn't work for a company that treats people that way."
good,A typical work day requires a great deal of customer service. I have learned the importants of details. My co-workers are pleasant. The hardest part of the job is the shallowness of rewcruiting. The company is all about good looks. Qualified candidates who are not attractive enough cannot be hired.
good,"Typical day can be very stressful, workers are all bueatiful ladies, (and gents) as abercrombie dosent tend to hire ugly people. Hardest part of the job is the customers"
good,"Clock in, checkout if I'm on floor or registers. I learned how to greet customers and follow up with them. Communication was key at this job. The management were very awesome to be around. They were around the young adult age so it was easy to get along with them. They weren't too strict but very prompt about getting work done. My co-workers were cool. The hardest part of the job would be the days where it was busy. It seemed like cleaning up was being done in vain. The most enjoyable part of the job is the atmosphere."
good,"My review for Abercrombie and Fitch is strictly based upon my own experiences over the course of two years. This is a great company to work for and there are a number of opportunities to do exciting things but the down side of it all, are the employers/employees. My typical day at work is basically coming in to work, following up with my assistant managers of their responsibilities and making sure they are on the correct path as far as completing their work accurately and in a timely manner. I've learned from this position how important it is to listen to others, delegate according to one's weaknesses and strengths, a sense of urgency (to complete work projects), and how to provide excellent customer service. The hardest part of my job is meeting company standards as far as hiring employees. The company looks for well groomed individuals but it conflicts with my personal morals because I would hire someone who isn't as visually appealing that can do the work and actually listen to a supervisor opposed to hiring someone who the company would rather have that doesn't. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting and learning about the kids that work there. I am mostly working with college and high school students and just having the feeling that they can come in and talk to me about anything in their lives fulfills my day. My job is really repetitive and tedious at times but meeting and changing these kids lives brings a joy to my day and a smile on my face."
good,"A typical day at work is slow. It can be somewhat fun, it depends on the day, but most of the time it's slow. I've learned how to have a lot of patience, I learned how to do maintenance and also learned how to work as a team. The management team are very nice, and they also help you with any questions. The co-workers are a little challenging, but I manage to work with them, unlike some of the staff. The hardest part about this job is nothing, the job is very easy. The most enjoyable part of the job is when it gets very crowded & very busy."
good,"they hiring a new group of people every week, leaving the people previously hired hour-less."
good,"Was fun and chill, not serious hard work especially if you're a model like I was but trying to get more hours around a school schedule can be less than fun, but at least theyre flexible to your work schedule."
good,"There were only four managers that really did their duties as a manager and helped their team members, but the others took that title to heart."
good,"Positive values. ..."
good,Working at A&F is great as long as you can find an area that you like. I was fortunate enough to have worked in several areas but never found a solid position for myself.
good,not the best job but defiantly put food on the table. I respected my peers but the work is boring and I didn't really enjoy much of the benefits nd there was nothing I could do about it I truly felt unmotivated and if it wasn't for my coworkers I would have been left this job
good,Good starting job. Easy. Learn good people skills. Fold clothes. Work the cash register. Interact with people and customers. Interact with tourist and provide fashion insight.
good,"cool place, the basic requirements of the job, make sure you can be active and lift boxes, learned how to productively multitask, management is ok, putting your availability in ahead of time is key."
good,There is usually an abercrombie and fitch at every local mall so finding a job there or asking for a transfer was very easy. I worked there in 2013 when minimum wage was about $8.00/hr so the money wasnt great but it helped. Relaxed environment.
good,"At the time it was what I needed, but it wasnt something for long term. The associates were cool to work with, but the managers were not. It's cool for short term employment."
good,"Worked on the sales floor, assisted in the cash register and fitting rooms. The managers are hard working and very friendly. This store is extremely customer friendly. They value customer's happiness while shopping."
good,"I learned how to manage my time and complete important tasks first. also helped me develop my management skills, as at times I would have to take control of the stockroom. great environment to work in. very friendly and sociable employees."
good,I gained great experience in back room stocking if I had a question I was sure to ask and other employees helped me out. Very calm environment and they work with your schedule.
good,"sometimes it would be long hours of doing nothing if there were not enough customers and it's not a bad job but it's not a good job. this employee discount is really nice. if you don't like their clothes, then the job isn't worth it , Once the managers know you and you show consistency in your quality of work, everything is awesome and you can pretty much just chill and have a good time. Super casual dress and it's ok if you're a few minutes late. Super youthful vibe"
good,"Although the work environment was rather small and crampt (not recommended for a claustrophic person), the people were nice and you will meet many different personalities"
good,"Its a nice place to work, you move around a lot. You have to have patience because people like to shop and move the clothing around if they dont want it but Its very nice working there because everyone is very nice."
good,"I didn't mind working here, but NH minimum wage just was not worth it. It can be very fun when you like your team, but it can also be dreadful if you have a manager that is all work, no play."
good,Abercrombie was easy hire and quick and easy the interview was straight for it and got the job in less than a week job was cool until they start messing up the pay
good,"Always had something to do, there was never a slow day at work. I really liked my coworkers, and everyone got along well. The work environment was fast-paced."
good,"The place is very relaxed and there are hardly any crazy customers, mostly moms and dads buying kids clothes. Holidays are hectic as clothes are the main gifts for little kids."
good,"just folding clothes, cleaning up, and  talking  to customers , so it is a little bit boring.  The time goes fast only when you are at the cash register."
good,"Working at Abercrombie is pretty easy depending on the staff. I had a store manager who was pretty strict, but the rest of the managers and staff were very chill. The manager liked me so I would be on cash wrap all day, but if she didn't like you, you would have to do things like refold the jean wall. I would recommend if you're outgoing and like to help people."
good,"I liked working at Abercrombie & Fitch the environment was nice and I enjoyed everyone there, I just didn't get much hours so I had to let go of the job"
good,varies from store to store depends on the management team you have to work at and the volume of your store. The higher volume the more stressful and harder the job.
good,The place was an okay place to work seasonal. I was able to gain some retail experience. My biggest complaint was the lack of consistency with my hours.
good,"This is a job for people who are still in High school. You won’t make enough for living expenses, unless you work a lot of hours. This is a job for social people, because you’re dealing with new customers everyday."
good,Every employee had a set task in a certain part of the store. Be prepared to be on call for some of your shifts also. Very strict on dress code and wearing makeup.
good,Para obtener un sobresueldo a mi otro trabajo en una tienda de suplementos deportivos trabajé en esta empresa casi 5 años en el turno de noche: de 21h - 02h (20 horas semanales).
good,"A typical day working at Abercrombie & Fitch would be fixing clothing items on the statues in the stores, give fashion advice here and there. Also, giving your all into what you do. The work environment was good, making friends isn't hard because your working and you'll eventually find something to talk about during your shift."
good,Abercrombie and kids had some really dope managers but they pay and hours wasn't cutting it for me. I loved the vibe and the people. The customers were also not that bad.
good,I worked in the stock area and product placement but did sometimes work the sales floor. It was fine for a part time job in retail. The manager was okay and new what she was doing.
good,"The job was very easy, the people were fun, and the pay was pretty good for management. Out of college it was an ideal job to take and their training was actually very good."
good,it was a regular job nothing really special about it put clothes away you helped customers indeed is forcing me to do this so i dont have much else to say
good,I worked in the stores.  There is alot of folding required of employees and it's very intense-especially for managers.  ALot of late nights are required.
good,I am confused I was young when I did it they pay was not good so if I give it a bad review then it makes me look bad and next employer doesn’t give me a fair change which is unfair.
good,A typical day at work at abercrombie was fun started off with a morning kick off meeting. I learned how to work in a fast pace enviroment. Management was fair & willing to train & promote.
good,"Fun and energetic work environment "
good,This job is fun if you have good coworkers but younstatt off on really low pay for a lot of hours and hard work I was put in storage and sales and I enjoyed sales more .
good,"This job really wasn't anything more than a job. I wouldn't turn it into a career, the pay was no where near competitive, and I wouldn't be able to live on just my income from that store. It would be more of a supplimental income."
good,"Managers were definitely professional but definitely not invested in continuing with the company. Associates even more so. Associates were usually students, as well as the managers."
good,"Great to start a career after College, learn about management, and store management. Can be promoted easily, and be relocated. Not a professional environment."
good,"Fun, hip place to work when you are young. Not really good for career development and it is hard to move up. The people are great but management expectations are too high and at times not feasible with the resources available."
good,I learned customer service skills. management was alright. I was younger when I worked there so it was fine at that age but now I am looking for a career
good,Abercrombie and Fitch was a learning experience. I learned a lot of customer service skills in which I can apply to any job I land. The management needs some work.
good,sometimes i would work in stock and other times they would have me work the floor. i learned how to fold better. the management is different. the workplace culture is good. a lot of people that are young works there. the hardest part is when shipment comes. the enjoyable part is break
good,I was a leader of 3 to 4 employees a day or help the manger get stuff ready for the floor set. I also learned about the stock room and what to role was.
good,Average Retail job. consistently had to deal with people shoplifting especially in the mall. People could often times be rude but the staff was friendly and made the best of it
good,"While Working at Abercrombie, it was fun. All though I being one of the people who was with the compony the longest was really hard. I was basically always scheduled almost everyday and I knew how to do all jobs so I was put on 3 tasks per day. It was overwhelming, but I liked the people I worked with."
good,"It was a good part time job to have while in school. The hours were flexible, coworkers were chill. The customers suck. The managers, for the most part, were super cool."
good,"was a fun place to work, no idea what its actually like now days but i had a blast. a;; young life full of life and enjoyed our jobs. really no complaints"
good,"There is nothing wrong with working at Abercrombie and Fitch. It is a good first job since it is simple and easy. The only negative I would have to say is that they made every employee buy the brand's clothes because it was considered uniform, but only offered a 25% discount. No reimbursement or extra discount. The only time you got a 50% discount of their clothes/uniform was during curtain seasons."
good,"i learned a a lot about retail marketing, hiring and fire.  Customer service was not focused on as much as it should be.  I liked all of the upper mgmt that i worked with."
good,Needed more daytime hours to make up on hours to acquire a better income.  Opportunity to excel was not very possible.  Needed more opportunity to make extra hours.
good,"Honestly working with them made me feel pretty, or was very cliche but cliquish. They were very strict with uniform (with what u can and can’t wear) and they were also very competitive. Some people were nice and some not so much. Yes I would work there again but I don’t know about full time. Good pay though!"
good,Everyone is very helpful and enjoys their job. I asked questions whenever I needed help and someone was always ready to answer my questions. Very good work environment.
good,"Ambercrombie&Fitch is perfect of students. I am a bit too old, but was able to be useful nonetheless. I recommend spraying a bit of FIERCE on your triple-A'S before stepping on the floor. : )"
good,Spent most of my time aimlessly folding clothes or being barked at by my supervisors to do tasks that my coworkers were incapable of doing themselves.
good,AnF is a company that strictly adheres to its guidelines and policies. There is one way to execute their vision and it must be done to a T. Great learning opportunity to prepare for better options.
good,"A&F provides you with a work environment amongst like-minded people, a place where you can enjoy working and make great friends at the same time. A good experience overall."
good,"Brand representative is pretty simple but at times  could get rough. Not as busy so more one on one with the customer to better understand them, and restocking back the store merchandise"
good,"I work in replenishment; 4 10h days; 4pm-2am. Seasonal Full-time employee. "
good,I enjoyed the retail environment but disliked the companies requirements for their employees. Employees should be judged on their performance and not their appearance.
good,This wasn't bad while I was going to college. I could build my schedule & swap shifts if needed. But its retail & a lot of pushing people to buys things.
good,"Decent job, not very stressful on the worker, allows for ample opportunities to work, base pay however. The scent can be overwhelming at times due to large amounts of cologne and perfume."
good,I had to work between the Abercrombie and Hollister constantly and had to work mostly nights. I couldn't negotiate my schedule to get me off nights.  So I really didn't know where I was going to work any given day
good,"you get good discount, they usually hire more than they need so you will not get as many hours as you would prob like, otherwise it is a fun place to work"
good,"It was a good first job, but I wanted a job with better hours. The compensation is not great but the people I worked with made the job more appealing."
good,"A typical day of work includes checking in with your managers and reviewing spreadsheets on inventory and duties for the day.  Afterwards, you work either in stock or on the floor.  Lots of walking and LOTS of customer service included for this job.  For the most part, a regular work day is smooth.  Since I worked in Hawaii, it was helpful to know Chinese and Japanese and these skills will likely land you a floor-model position right away, due to having so many Asian tourists.  Although a great job, Hawaii minimum wage is horrible ($9.25 per hour)."
good,"Most people know that the first day of spring is associated with the Vernal Equinox, which falls on March 20 this year. But in 2018, the flowers might start to bloom a bit earlier than usual in some parts of the United States, continuing a trend that’s deviated from the norm in recent years."
good,"Working at Abercrombie is an easy job, however, the managers act as if we are conducting a NASA science experiment. They are insanely obsessed with their position and take themselves too seriously. If you can look past this, It'll be fine."
good,"-Working there during the weekdays can be slow but working at Abercrombie on the weekends can be very hectic. You have to be able to multitask most of the time. "
good,"It was an okay place to work, but quite slow and often became boring during the week. Most of my managers were kind and easy to work with; it's honestly a gamble."
good,good environment. only good for part time work don't expect full time pay here. some weeks you might not get scheduled. they play favorites with who gets most hours.
good,"Management was okay, hours were the reason it was bad, very repetitive a lot of folding job was over all easy. We had alright discounts it was just very repetitive."
good,great place to work if you are student looking to make some money. they have flexible hours and do not really require retail experience. not much room for growth in the company.
good,"Nice co-workers."
good,"fast paced, not enough time to balance personal and professional life. the music and the smell is super annoying because you smell it every where, no a great place for moving up in your career"
good,"I would have stayed with the company if I didn't have the devil herself as my district manager. She made it such a stressful and negative work environment. I dreaded any phone conversation (which is every day) and store visit. Compensation is a little low compared to competing retail companies. Other than my district manager, I met and worked with a lot of awesome people."
good,"This was a seasonal job over the holidays. It was a busy time for both shoppers and retail workers.  The staff was nice and worked well together. During the holidays you should be prepared to stay late in the store, cleaning up and resetting the store items."
good,Long hours but lots of work. Decent pay and a variety of shifts to choose from. Mostly warehouse work but employees are friendly and very welcoming. Nice place to work.
good,"I am in misery. there aint nobody who can comfort me. girl you really got me bad, you really got me back. girl, im gonna get you back. is it ""bad"" or ""back"" idk.. ask whats his face, not me."
good,"Tanti giovani, tanto divertimento, per tirare su qualche soldo è perfetto"
good,Fun environment to work in get to see different types of clothing and fashion trends. Its a fast paced environment you'll learn how to be quicker with your hands.
good,"The location is great but unfortunately there is so little foot traffic that there is hardly ever anyone in the store. Not the worst problem, but makes for a boring day."
good,"I worked at Abercrombie right out of high school. Not a permanent place to work, but if you're interested in a place to new people and going to school at the same time, this might be the place for you. Policies have changed since I've been there so might be better."
good,Working at Abercrombie was pretty challenging only because of what was expected daily. Shoplifting procedures were ineffective and we received little help from mall security. All in all it was an “ok” place to work but they did not pay well enough to continue employment there.
good,Good job for a high school or college student who does not want many hours.  The amount of call-ins for employees is not easy to schedule your personal life around.
good,Me gusta trabajar en la bodega organizando la ropa como debe de ser. Aveces es frustrante pero es un ambiente de diversidad.
good,Very chill work place. Mainly stay in the back depending on what you apply for. Discounts on the clothes are the best part of the job honestly and on the busy days of the year for Retail.
good,"Overall, good experience to help the principles of company management, hiring practices and development. Company is based on appearance and recruiting a certain look/culture.  Very demanding and competitive."
good,Learned to communicate effectively with coworkers and customers. Kept stock room and sales floor presentable. Worked register when needed. Hours conflicted with my final semester.
good,Overall I enjoyed working with the children and the parents who came into the store asking questions and my opinion on fashion. The pay was average for my age at the time so I couldn’t really complain at the time. The breaks were short and the work load was pretty harsh around the holidays.
good,The typical day at Abercrombie and Fitch assisting and styling customer. the management was good. They made the job enjoyable. There wasn't a hard part of the job for me. Most enjoyable was helping customers.
good,"Open and fun environment, customers as well as staff were very friendly. Management open-minded to change. Getting more hours to work. but the overall experience was enjoyable."
good,"This job in all was ok, its for someone who doesn't mind standing on their feet long and talking to people. Hours aren't long if you are part time and your hours go based off of you performance."
good,"The work day is not very stressful. There are random times where you feel you have so much to do, but only during the busy hours. There are plenty of employees so there is not many hours for them to give away so it is difficult to be scheduled."
good,"Good management, with a large staff. Very strict of the look of the employees because the represent the ""brand"". Uses on call for employees to come in often."
good,"have worked at A+F for about a year and a half now, the people are great, the pay for the work you do is unfair, minimum wage only with no raises at all."
good,Lo que mas me gustó fue la excelente estandarización que tienen.
good,Abercrombie Kids was a fun place to work at times. The staff all got along very well and work collaboratively. This job could sometimes be stressful especially on busy days such as holidays and sales.
good,I liked working with all the coworkers they were really sweet and fun and very very helpful with anything and everything . They were very good spirited people
good,The hardest part about the job is being able to keep up with stocking for the storefront and restock the bays in the back area. I learned how to manage time better.
good,"fast-paced, reliable, great customer service and follow-up from all issues or questions from students. Co-workers work well together and function as a true team"
good,it was ok working here. The perfume was very over powering however its a great first job. crazy during the holidays but it was ok. its a phase job so.
good,A fast-paced yet light-hearted working environment with a desire to be inclusive to customers and employees. Relies heavily on corporate standards and training.
good,Working at A&F was busy we always had somethig to do to keep us busy. i learned a lot from working there. how to deal with customers and how to be patient. The hardest part about the job was when there was nothing to do. we would just have to stand there and be bored.
good,Abercombie was my first job in the UK. I was studying at that time and Abercrombie was the only job that had a very flexible job. I learned a lot and a had a wonderful time helping and interacting with the customers
good,The workplace wasn't that bad at all its just you hear the same CD over and over again. The women there are gorgeous and the women who shop there are even more gorgeous
good,A lot will be expected of you and there will be little pay.  Promotion is very much being available to relocate so long as there is an actual opening (new expectation is for managers to stay in position longer) and relying on assistants to put forth effort beyond what they are paid.  Annual raise rates are laughable.
good,The only thing that was nice about this job was the break room because it was City walk so it was a lot of food places in the area. This job was a type of job for someone that was still in High School due to them not having a regular schedule.
good,"A typical day at work consists of folding clotes, cleaning dressing rooms and interacting with customers by assisting with sales or helping a customer find a particular item in the store."
good,"Management was knowledgeable of products and operations.  Through them the companies culture was passed onto their subordinates, a love for Abercrombie & Fitch was visible among the staff."
good,They don't care about you as a person. You are only an employee. Long hours and you don't feel like you are appreciated for working them. Not a great experience.
good,A typical retail job. The hours depend on how much management likes you.The hours are competitive with each employee.If you don't like strict uniform policy this isn't for you.
good,the job was okay to keep for a little bit. but the job could be more fully staff. but the job was a good customer serivce and learning how to handle money
good,The best part of the job is helping the customers. Being on the floor or at the cash register are both fun. The employees here are relaxed and fun to be around.
good,"from the register to being on the sales floor , we were expected to assist cutomers and be able to find what they were looking for . We all took turns when it came to beiong on the cashier desk , refilling the floor, presentation fixing , fitting rooms and sales floor rep. At times the store did get busy and it became mayhem, but it did sometimes have those slow days which was good. There was a good balanced , that is one of the things i liked  about working there."
good,"not organized"
good,"The job is perfect for students who just began high school. It allows them to gain a sense of responsibility while growing up. Having some extra pocket money is also advantageous. The management is laid-back, and the job is not difficult. You do the same thing every time you clock in. "
good,"I love working here, it really helped me be more vocal with random people (customers). It also evolved me into the person I am today and I am no longer a shy and closed off person. It's a great first job to have!"
good,honestly i did not have a big expectation for A&F when i applied... it turned out to be one the most fun jobs that i have had! the people there are really fun and exciting. Down write them off so quick.
good,The store was a cool place to work.   But they cut down my hours to a minimum after over hiring then cutting peoples hours it was a scam.  I would not recommend it..  It was a good first job to start with...
good,"It was a customer oriented environment, required a lot of customer interaction, keeping the store well organized to meet store goals. Very relaxed but at the same time busy"
good,Working at abercrombie and fitch is a very suitable job for a high school student or a full time college student. it offered part time flexible hours and discounts to eompoyees.
good,"Easy job, but some managers were rude. Hardest part of the job was dealing with them when they were having a bad day, the mandatory parts of the job weren't bad at all & were easily done."
good,"A typical day at work: Standing on feet all day"
good,"Sold retail products and goods, such as equipment and clothes. Worked with customers to find what they want, ensure a smooth sales process and process transactions."
good,"I really enjoy the people I work with, however, we never know how many hours we will have that week.  Raises stop after a certain point and you will never make anymore money no matter how long you are employed.  I have been there 15 years and will not making anymore money than I do now.  No cost of living raise. Nothing."
good,"Pretty Chill job, nice co-workers, good pay and a smile on the face everyday. The discounts were the best benefits. Would come into work in a bad mood but would change after getting off."
good,Abercrombie and Fitch is a fast paced environement that may not be for everyone. The days pass by quickly because there is always something to get done.
good,"Abercrombie is like most retailers, a good place to work while in school. It's not somewhere you want to stay. They have limited upwards mobility and up until recently you needed a bachelors to be in any type of underpaid management position."
good,"Work hours were inconsistent, but it was an overall easy job. It was a temporary job for me anyways, so I didn't really mind. I never saw the manager when I did work."
good,I loved working at his location in 5th avenue the music was very vibrant. Great customer service is key as most customers were tourists. It was great meeting different people .
good,Good first job out of college at the time. Became store manager and then helped train managers to open their on stores. Mostly college kids as employees.
good,"It was my first job so everything was new. I loved it for the time being and then it started going downhill due to management, managers were coming and going and sales associates were told different things and how to do things certain ways. "
good,Abercrombie is a very high maintenance store. Okay place to work with very diverse people. Making it a great place to hang around while at work . I'm sure that's what they were aiming for .
good,I only worked here for a few months during winter break of college. I liked the job and it paid well. I was able to be in my own head space while doing this work.
good,"For a stocky guy like me, some of their clothes I can't fit into, with the exception of their graphic tees and a small variety of items. Working here, there were associates who were a mix between hard workers and had the motivation to drive sales and others who spent more time skipping shifts, leaving people like me to pick up the slack. Most customers I interacted with were a pleasure to help out and get to know, which made up for any low points of my day. Employee discounts were great, definitely encouraged me to purchase more from my workplace. Wished we had upgrades with things like security, stockroom space, better pay wage for management/key holder positions, etc."
good,"chill co-workers, terrible management, terrible pay.... no raise......discount is horrible......The enviroment was relaxed . Usually just clocked in a greeted customers and cashed out and opened dressing rooms."
good,"Working with other college aged employees means you're all in the same boat, and can relate. Otherwise the early morning shifts are a fun way to to work."
good,Abercrombie was a very comfortable work place. everyone their was around the same age so we all related very well. working on inventory wasnt that bad folding clothes all day wasnt bad either.
good,The pay is fine but the time isnt appropriate. But they will let you work when they have enough things to do for the day. But in general it a fun place
good,This was an okay place to work as a summer job during college.  There were some wonderful employees however much of the management team was lacking and hard work was not rewarded.
good,"Abercrombie is going downhill fast. Anyone can work there regardless of how you look now and the people that worked there were not the brightest at all. Too much work for minimum wage, I stopped trying within the month and looked for another job quick."
good,"It has been nearly 8 years since I worked at Ambercrombie. It was a good retail experience, but the atmosphere and work place moral was not my favorite."
good,It was ok its good if you are going to school and work because the hours are really flexible but they dont pay much and require you to do so much work and overnight updates for 8$ so not worth it
good,A&F had a strong workplace culture when I first started and that is what kept me there for so long but that culture is dying and upper management sets unrealistic expectations on stores with a fraction of the resources that they had when they were in stores. There is a huge disconnect between upper management and those running their stores.
good,Not a bad place to work as a high school kid/college kid. No real chance to get any sort of raise or bonus which discourages one to really work harder or excel.
good,"Overall, it is a fun company to start in, if you don't mind being in a retail environment. I was able to learn each and every aspect required to run my own store. The management and people skills I gained have given me the option to pursue various careers outside of retail management."
good,It was a typical retail job. Very slow during weekday evenings. You're inn charge of making the floor presentable and clean. Cash registering and inventory.
good,"The work schedule was very flexible. A typical day required the employees to keep active even during slow periods. Employees kept busy by organizing and maintaining a clean work environment.  The job also required a lot of customer service and keeping on your toes with tasks requested by customers. "
good,"My experience at Abercombie started out very positive, but over the years it started to decline. Managers change very quickly along with employee duties. It's a nice to play to start working, but maybe for only a few years."
good,"The manager schedule creates a hard work/life balance. This position is geared towards younger, right out of college applicants. The compensation is low for a retail manager position"
good,"I love the Abercrombie & Fitch brand however, management in the stores is poor. Great discounts for employees. Opportunities to advance in the company."
good,"Manageable work load, easy going environment. Management was great. Customers were generally good, rarely encountered difficult customers. hardest part of the job is ""updates"" where we redo the store for the new merchandise"
good,The place was a rave the whole time. In my opinion this is a great job if you are young and not looking for a serious job. The staff is severely under paid.
good,"Overall, this is not a bad job. They do not usually give you many hours since they have so many employees. The management is pretty friendly. There are very strict rules on what you can wear and what you have to do while you work. It can get very boring."
good,Abercrombie & Fitch was a very small workplace that consisted of the same day to day festivities. Your typical retail working environment that didn't consist of much change.
good,It is great to have a job where you are working with people that are the same age as you since you have so much in common.  Also getting employees discount is great.  Other than that the hours are not great and it is a typical retail job where customers will make a mess out of all of the folding you have done throughout the day.  No competitive salary but a good part time job for students in high school or college.
good,i was folding clothes and making sure the tables were full and presentable.i was also dressing mannequins and measuring the tables making sure they were mapped out correctly for the store.
good,"good place to work, people were too young, didn't know much about folding cloths, classified their workers at models, clothes were getting out of style,"
good,"I can't complain much, I met some of my best friends at Abercrombie and Fitch, but I would compare the work to slave labor for the price. Minimum wage to be working at the cash rep all day long with few people congratulating you for a hard day's work, this is where I knock the managers. I think it's vital to encourage your staff, and I didn't receive that treatment here. But it's a very relaxed environment, and the college students who work here are all very interesting, and for the most part hard working."
good,Abercrombie is a good place for new college students who need the kind of flexibility this store provides. But management can be tough and there will be times when you get little work hours.
good,Typical day is busy which is good  so time will fly. Week days were slow so I was left standing there. A lot of folding clothes after people and taking care of the front house.
good,"To make this quick, simply don't work for A&F or any of their brands unless you need some pocket money or you hold a degree to move up to management. From my experience and the many years I've work there, A&F provides zero possibility of raises or promotions. The only up in this company is if you have a masters degree of any kind, seriously. Until then you're stuck with minimum wage, here in GA it's 7.25."
good,I worked at three different abercrombie locations I loved everyone I worked with for the most part but the hours could be long and the pay wasn't much
good,The workplace culture suffered due to corporate mistakes. Fairly easy day to day job. 2 months of training required before you are salaried. Decent health benefits!
good,Didn't really enjoy the job. They didn't give me enough hours and everything was very unorganized. I also hate folding clothes so that made everything a lot worse
good,"Wearing apparel from this store was mandatory. Clothing that went up to over 150 but the sizes run small. Pay is not good at all, especially after having to have an A&F wardrobe."
good,Abercrombie was a fun environment to work in. Getting to know customers on a friendly basis really helped to drive sales for the company. Only issue would be the management changes every couple of months so its hard trying to drive sales and complete expectations with new managers coming in all the time.
good,Abercrombie expects the best service because you would have to deal with alot of customers that walk in and look around so you would hafe to have good cu service skills.
good,Working there I did not get hours and when I did get hours I would have to stay longer because people did not show up for their shifts and also the managers were not organized at all.
good,"This was my first job and it was a great place to work. I met lots of young people and I learned hour to fold clothes and complete transactions. Additionally, I learned how to conduct myself"
good,"- Most times we did nothing "
good,"This was my first job and as my first job I was taught many things. I got paid minimum and scheduling was horrible. (most call ins) Most of the time I was only scheduled on Saturdays. Management was half and half, there were good managers/supervisors and there were bad. Although the environment was enjoyable most of the time. Customers enjoyed my presence and vice versa. This makes for an OK first job but if you're looking for set schedules this is not the place."
good,"Ability to focus on different aspects of the business."
good,Average Company on Fed Contract Market. Management is very nice and take personal visits regularly. Benefits are almost the same of other Fed Contractors at average level.
good,"The store was fun to work at and there was a lot of flexibility in tasks and conduct, but management was poor. Scheduling was very bad and it was difficult to work there while being a student."
good,"Working for A&F had its pros and cons. You got 30% off of all merchandise and you worked with people your age, but the hours weren't as good as I hoped."
good,Abercrombie and Fitch was a good stepping stone for a first employer in retail and customer service. It molded me to become a better team player for future employment opportunities.
good,"Fun place to work. High stress environment, but upper management is good and willing to lend a hand when necessary. If you work hard you will be paid in promotions. The job does not necessarily pay well."
good,"Great place to start out at if its a first job.  Teaches merchandising, stock, cash register etc.  One major downside is the limited hours.  More suitable for someone in high school, unless in the management  position."
good,I didn't work there for a long time but when I did it was okay. It wasn't the most fun place to work. The managers were a pain because the wanted everything to be perfect. Even if one little shirt in a pile wasn't perfectly right then they would ask you to fold it and put it back until it was perfect to them.
good,My typical day began with me cleaning the dressing rooms and folding and putting away clothes from the previous days.  I enjoyed helping enthusiastic customers find their perfect outfits and gifts for others.
good,just did this review but  the job had a decent workload with expectations that could be met had a lame dress code and wouldnt be recommend past the age of 16
good,"good for customer service and challenging for management "
good,i got good experience here. they do not pay enough thought for the work that you do. Strict dress codes. can be boring at times. its not a bad place to work
good,"You won't get a lot of hours unless your upper management. It's a very easy job but overal pretty boring. Management was pretty okay, overall an alright job, nothing great but also not bad"
good,"I was responsible for creating and keeping accurate database for all international and domestic leases. "
good,"Must provide great customer service"
good,Okay but not worth the hasssle and time I wasted learning new technique. I would do things differently if given the option.
good,"Not much to review. Easy days just stalking things. I left because I did not really like the people I worked with, I think they hire based on looks not on work ethic."
good,"Start as scheduled. Came in take inventory, check emails and take calls. Reply to all customers problems. Resolve all customers issues at a timely fashion. Learn a lot of management skills, grain maturity as well as responsibility. As far as management goes had no issues. All of the co workers were great and fun to get along with. This job wasn't that hard not really anything that i can think of that was hard. I enjoyed the work environment it was fun and great people to work with."
good,"it's a typical retail job with short hours, not much room for growth. People are great and fun to work with. Low maintenance job that is easy to keep on the side"
good,"great  management, everyone is goal oriented, the hardest part is the up keep but our look was most important. my co workers were very hhelpful always helping each other out if needed"
good,"This is your standard retail position. Management is cool and the work is not demanding. Pay is not great, no benefits, good first job."
good,"The pay sucks honestly, but the work environment is fun. They mostly hire part time so they dont have to give benefits which is annoying. Its okay for a 1st job or someone in highschool"
good,Great team ! Learned a lot from coworkers but busy environment. Everyone is friendly and happened to be more that what I expected. Don't like how scheduling is posted though.
good,First job great achievement. Stepping stone to learn observe and prosper as a better worker and as a great customer service representative
good,This is not the kind of job you want to work for more than a month. clothes are so expensive but they dont pay anything. Hours are horrible. Management changed every couple of months.
good,"interesting place to work. Almost a formula 1 pit stop place as people come and go, great environment to work in and socialise. Platform to meet new and interesting people all the time. great place to help build confidence and charisma for young people starting out in professional work. Very easy to work as part time as management is very flexile."
good,"Great beginning for someone getting into retail. Great focuses on operations, and merchandising. The focus on recruiting talent and training was a great introduction to team building. "
good,I love the clothing and working in fashion. Co-workers were also great to be around. As a store i wasn't to fond of. They are constantly hiring and theirs to much employees that i would hardly get any hours.
good,"Stack clothes, customer service, maintain floor organized."
good,"Really tired to work there. And they change the managers too often, which makes me feel uncomfortable to work since we have to change the way to work there to match the style of different managers."
good,"This was a perfect job to maintain while I was in high school. It worked well around my classes and water polo schedule. I was happy working here until I began to see the injustice the company was showing minorities, many cases have been brought up against this company, and I have even been notified that i might be able to receive compensation as well, but never acted on it."
good,Great 1st job would not recommend long term but a great option for highschool-ers or young college kids that need experience under their belt. Good stepping stone
good,"retail. loud music. strong cologne. A lot of customer service. A lot of folding. Meet some great people, made life long friendship. Micro management though."
good,"I honestly enjoyed it a lot. Meeting new people and learning skills for communication. I plan on becoming a model, this job gave me a lot of experience and opportunities for future modeling career. I also revived a recommendation for F.I.T. For a fashion opportunity."
good,"- Basic open and close store duties"
good,"Opportunity to learn immediately after college. Manage people, inventory, customer services, and sales. Hours can be long and hard but most of the time it was still a fun place to work."
good,It's a fun company to work for but employees make very little. Employees also aren't given the opportunity to earn raises unless they come from a management position.
good,Hours were not consistent as the job was on an on call basis. Co-workers and management were absolutely friendly and helpful. The hours that I sometimes got were unrelated and not considerate of my schedule in college.
good,"it was an alright first job, nice co workers, easy tasks, the store could get really quiet for hours at a time. Very few hours available, I worked part time and sometimes could get as low as 4 hours a week."
good,"Not a bad place to work at for your first job. Enjoyed working with my co-workers and even my managers, but did not like the district managers at all. There were frequent inspections and they were extremely particular about details."
good,Laid back environment and everyone knows each other and is nice to one another. i left because the managers left and i was going to school
good,"Abercrombie hires a ton of workers so that they always have workers that are able to come in. That makes it inconvenient for a lot of workers, as they can be on-call on any given day. When there was a managerial shift, communication between the employees and the managers was very unorganized, and caused a lot of the workers including myself to leave."
good,"In the mornings the faculty got together and went over the entire store display plan which changed on a daily basis. Each associate is assigned a task and must do the task to the company's standards. During the day the associates just kept up with stocking clothing out onto the floor when it got low and helped customers. In the evenings, the associates who closed helped prepare the store so the morning shift can be prepared for the store display changes."
good,A typical day at work starts with a five minute meeting with my manager explaining where I will be and what I will be doing during my shift. I've learned how to complete duties within a certain time span. Management is always helpful and friendly. Co-workers are also very friendly and willing to lend a helping hand at any moment.
good,"A typical day at work involves greeting customers and answering any questions the customers may have about our products. I've learned to better communicate with customers and give great customer satisfaction. I have learned to work well with other associates and managers as well as know the basics of retail and the vision of the company. The job is relatively easy if you put forth your best effort and make it enjoyable, thus gaining new skills and experience."
good,"Clothing neatly folded"
good,it was a job with no chance of moving up and the management was weak at best. treat employees natural no respect nor disrespect. should try to be a little friendlier
good,it was a fun job to work at. great way to meet new people .the pay wasn't great but this job is mainly for high school and college students. nothing more nothing less. job was very easy and hard to mess up.
good,My day consisted of standing at a computer and returning customers orders then folding and bagging items and putting them back into inventory. I was cross trained in most of the departments with in the company. The people that I worked with were nice. The hardest part of the job was having to be there at 6am. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting a 4 day weekend.
good,good job fast pace  .The only thing is that they only look for skinny people that wear there brand of clothing. Also the said they don't carry or sale extra large sizes cause it was not made for plus size people.
good,"Abercrombie is an international clothing company that focuses on the active, fashionable and outdoorsy clientele. They provide high quality clothing at an affordable price."
good,"A typical day at A&F was fast-paced or extremely slow and repetitive. I learned to have patience with every customer. Management was less experienced than some of their employees, but were paid far more. Co-workers were either very helpful to one another or completely rude. Finding what the customer was looking for was always difficult because the floor rooms always were changing. The most enjoyable part was making friends from different countries."
good,"I enjoyed working here for sometime. "
good,I had a short overall experience working at Abercrombie. I also had very short shifts which lasted four hours. That was a pro since I was in high school and I would have just made some money and leave. I also had a productive day and my co-workers and management were very helpful. What I could not have worked with was the lack of hours I was given after a month or two. The company would not give me hours to work for the large staff we had and they were given to new employees. The job was not working for me because of this but overall my experience was excellent.
good,"The hours were hard during peak seasons, and the job can be stressful at some points, but this is a pretty decent jobs for someone beginning their career, with a decent pay scale."
good,"i find myself having no life. i come in early, stay late and there is always more to do and you will never meet the home office standards for your store.  i have no life outside of work. i constantly work off the clock to make sure things are finished.  the company has super unrealistic expectations and does not provide you with the resources to achieve them. on a day to day basis you are severely under budgeted hours and only have the bare necessities to run your store."
good,"you interact with many different people, i learned a lot of sales and sizing. the hardest part of the job is getting hours to work."
good,"correct"
good,"its a good job if you I high school trying to have gas or chump chain, it a fun job. you get to have fun get to rock out the new close only thing u have to pay for it and itz high"
good,"It's your typical retail environment, they have so many people working for them that individual needs are not very important. Management is usually pretty good. Good to get to know a lot of new different people."
good,great opportunity for experience and had flexibility on hours. i was able to gain many skills. managers were helpful when there were any problems or questions.
good,it was great working their.the staffs were great. flexiable schedule to work with when your still in school. it is very enjoyable
good,"Many socialites, aesthetically pleasing people to work with and a fun environment. Get ready to either pull somebody'd weight or vice versa."
good,The staff was a bit unorganized but the workers were always fun to be around. I never minded coming to work and the environment was always upbeat and enthusiastic.
good,This was a fun temporary and seasonal position. I liked the people I worked with and I liked the work I did. I liked that I was always busy and there was an opportunity for overtime. I liked the discount and the cafeteria. The end of the season christmas party was awesome.
good,A sense of camaraderie throughout the store. Consistently driving business by providing exceptional customer service. The development of the team was always a main focus.
good,"This job was quite exciting, and every day there was something new! I learned about a lot of different personalities. Whether it is a co- worker or a customer; it taught me about people and how to read them better."
good,"Just like and other retail job, no room for advancement. pay is pretty well hours aren't bad their are different shifts. Fun working environment"
good,"A typical work day for an impacter is really just replenishing the items in the store and stock room, tidying up the stock room and taking out the trash."
good,"Fast pace, independent work, easy environment, cool colleagues. Easy supervisor, get job done and you wont be bothered."
good,This is one of the best companies to work for as a student. The scheduling is very flexible and the workplace is very cool and relaxed. It is especially easy when you can talk and interact with customers fluently.
good,"Atmosphere can be more on the very serious side, not too involved with customer service.  Co workers and managers had conflicts at time.  However, did learn how to manage time with my tasks."
good,With only a few hours given to you per week it is difficult to make ends meet if one was to live on their own. Many college age kids are employed for as short as a few weeks up to many years.
good,"A typical day at A&F is like any other retail customer service job. You are constantly on your feet, folding and re-folding clothes that customers consistently destroy. Managers will ask you to do things like clean counters, sweep, clean the bathroom etc; these things aren't in your job description but you'll do them. "
good,It was a good place to work and make friends my age. This job would be ideal for 18-21 year olds looking for a simple job. My coworkers were a great bunch to be around.
good,"You are truely over worked and underpaid at Abercrombie & Fitch"
good,A typical day at work was very hectic because of the amount of work been sent to me.. i learned how to manage my time wisely and work at faster pace. co-workers were cooperative and sociable to work with. the hardest part of the job was lifting boxes and standing on your feet for 10hours. The most enjoyable part was having free pizza and receiving paychecks
good,A typical day at work is replenishing the sales floor complete shipment in a timely manner and also operate the cash register
good,What I learned from this job was how to use a cashier and also how to organize a stockroom. Management sucked! The job wasn't hard at all.
good,Management was identifiable given small age difference which allowed for a comfortable and therefore enjoyable work exp.
good,"Abercrombie was a great opportunity to gain managerial skills in a short period of time. It gives you the opportunity to learn management of people, money, and store maintenance."
good,"The idea of promotion within the company is great and there are travel opportunities if you want to take advantage. However, you must have a bachelor's degree to apply for the management position. and the pay is menial. Sure the job is easy enough, however, you will work weekends, most holidays, and the schedule changes from week-to-week providing little to no home-work balance. The first 10-weeks you will be a Manager-in-Training (you get a binder filled with worksheets and will have to take weekly quizzes) and upon completion, you are ""promoted"" to Assistant Manager, but it doesn't include a pay raise. When you finally become Store Manager, you will see an increase in pay, but expect to have even less time off now that you are solely responsible for the success of the store and the abilities of your assistant managers. This job is good if you're looking to add experience to your resume, but that's about it. I would not recommend this job to anyone."
good,"The position of Abercrombie & Fitch floor model entails a number of job duties. In addition to showcasing fashions and accessories, floor models assist customers with sales and answer questions about products and merchandise."
good,"-Associates are generous"
good,I didn't get a lot of hours working here because it was very overstaffed and there wasn't enough job positions. I did not enjoy working here
good,"Abercrombie was a great place to begin my search for a career. I was able to learn a lot about myself and my abilities to lead a group of individuals. As a manager there, I acquired several skills that have allowed me to be successful at any job I have acquired after departing with the company. A typical day there involved preparing the stores by cleaning and opening registers before opening the doors. Then maintain the look of the store throughout the day by delegating tasks for each and every employee. While doing this and handing managerial task I also had to engage in loss prevention duties. The hardest part of the job was getting so much work down with so little hours to give to my employees and so little time to complete the tasks. Thanks to the energetic and hard working staff these tasks were accomplished in a timely fashion."
good,Co-workers were really friendly and management was great willing to work around your schedule. The hardest part of the job is organizing the store prior to company regulations.
good,"For my past 2-3 years working in A&F, I have learn a lot and have met great people through working in the store. Though its more beneficial to work during seasonal times, A&F is a good store to work in if you are looking for your first ever job to get you prepare for future jobs."
good,"laid back, interesting, good experience. For those looking for a first time job while in high school i would definitely recommend."
good,"knowing the products that you're selling to the costumers, listening to the needs of customers, and doing your part for your team was essential for my success at Abercrombie"
good,most store managers are overworked and underpaid. Expectations given by upper management is unattainable. The hours/schedule was horrible
good,A good work place with a good pay and benefit package.  I enjoyed my job and my time working for the company.  Unfortunately the company sales are down and the stock is at less than half what it was a few years ago.
good,"Abercrombie is fast paced place to work, but is also fun. A typical day at A&F is down stocking merchandize, folding it then placing it in the appropriate location. Working at A&F I learned more about retail. My coworkers were mostly in high school or college students, which gave A&F and pleasant and fun environment to work in. Hardest part of my job was to find items. The best part of my job was being with young adults."
good,"The focus at Abercrombie and Fitch is what do you and your employees look like more than how many sales did you make that day. "
good,in the three years i worked for abercrombie i had to force the issue with management to learn anything new. turnover was very high because of poor hiring policies. no opportunity for growth in the company without a 4 year degree.
good,Its an okay place to work at. Learn to cooperate with co-workers and also interactions with customers. Co-workers were really friendly and fun to interact with
good,Low wage job with not much room to grow. But flexible schedule and hours. The work was easy but most of the managers were not qualified for the positions.
good,Work here was not terrible just had ridiculous rules and made you wear extremely short short pants for the men. Management didn't really know what they were doing mostly because they were all just kids.
good,"Very big warehouse"
good,"Great company to gain management experience. A very inclusive work environment. The most enjoyable part of the job was training and developing associates. A typical day at work was opening the store, doing maintenance checks on store property, planning and prioritizing work, directing associates, creating employee schedule, and performing displaying changes, just to name a few duties."
good,"A bit strict in uniform and I didn't get a chance to get to know anyone, but I loved the organization and perfection in the folding of the clothing."
good,Sometimes your peers think they are hot stuff working at Abercrombie. They need more average looking people there with less egos.
good,"It was a fun job because we had great managers, was harder because you had to stand for long periods of time and everything in this company has to be PERFECT. if a corner is off on a stack they make you redo the whole thing."
good,"The relationship between management and workers was well and respectable. Always acknowledge and praised when doing well."
good,"Great job if you are skilled and are looking for hours. Scheduling is accommodating. Upper management is constantly in a flux so you never have a manager for more than a few months, which is sometimes a pain. In general a very friendly atmosphere."
good,"A typical day usually consists of opening/closing the store for business, managing part time employees, overseeing and directing customer service, and implementing any changes to the sales floor in terms of new and existing merchandise presentations. "
good,"La polyvalence du travail a vraiment été un rôle déterminant dans l'acquisition d'expérience, le fait d'être autonome et devoir réagir à certaines situation à vraiment développer mon sens de l'initiative."
good,Learned about retail and stocking. Enjoyable and upbeat environment
good,"Great for young people newly entering the field of customer service. A fun work environment, with positive leadership and upbeat environment."
good,"A&F is a great way to gain management experience out of college. You work with your peers, which can be fun but also challenging."
good,"What is there to expect, its Abercrombie and Fitch. The work place fits the stereotype perfect. Outfits are tightly regulated, break time is limited, mistakes are not tolerated, and mangers spend too much time micro adjusting employee habits."
good,"job was okay, didn't work there long enough to say much about it. The people I worked with were not kind at all, so I was forced to resign."
good,Working at abercrombie and fitch is not a fun place to be. They don't give you that many hours and they never respect your scheduled. They expect a lot from you yet they don't even want to pay you as they shoould..
good,It is a fast-paced company where being a manager teaches you a lot of time management and how to multi task. There is limited to no work-life balance.
good,"I am responsible for pulling USR, as well as putting them out on the floor in the correct places. I am also responsible for making sure that the shipment that comes into the store are all censored and stocked in the correct place. I maintain the stockroom by keeping track of the labels that tell my impacters where a certain type of clothing may be found. The hardest part about my job is when some of my impacters do not do things properly and do not take the time to read labels so that they may place clothes correctly. the most enjoyable part of my job is that I am surrounded with people who have great personalities and I am surrounded with a management team that pushes me to and well beyond the limits that I can achieve."
good,Abercrombie was a good place to work at during college summers.
good,My first job ever and it was a really good experience.  My managers did not micromanaged at all and was very relaxed.  The store was usually slow during the week.  The hours were ok.  Usually worked 3pm till close and off on the weekends.  It was a great learning experience.
good,I enjoyed my time with the company however there is a lot of politics involved in career advancement.
good,"Not much hours, mostly on call, and there are no communication of my status at the work, previously so, I was not sure if I was permanent. Bad experience with other associate because someone stole my camera so, inside thief are high which makes me uncomfortable working at Abercrombie."
good,"Job security is solid, but retention is quite low given low salary for all of the responsibility that comes with running a store, training associates and assistant managers."
good,"Compare merchandise invoices to items actually received to ensure that shipments are correct."
good,"Inventory and sales"
good,"My typical day consists of processing shipment, opening registers, paperwork, and lots of customer service. I learned so much about retail, and management from working here since i've moved up through the ranks. Since I have been there for four years now I have gone through a ton of managers so I've had to help train them. I love all of my co-workers, and have made great friendships with them. The hardest part of the job is all the censoring, and lifting that I have to do daily. The most enjoyable part of the job is all the interaction I get with meeting new people from around the world everyday."
good,"They have to many associates, so getting hours is tough. job is easy,"
good,"it is a great company with great people and clients, but it was not for me."
good,a day at A&F I would say is pretty nice and smooth. I didn't really recall encountering in any disagreements with neither customers nor employees. I learned very little but got to know a lot of people. Management was very helpful but not very involved in getting to know employees more and getting them more involved with the company. The co-workers were very chatty yet some were very distant. There was really not a hard part of being a model at abercombie.
good,This job is great to get management experience fresh out of college. You only work with cool people. Overall every person you will ever work with is a cool person. It is difficult to advance past the Store Manager Position.
good,"a typical day would be greeting customers, folding clothes, dusting. coworkers were all nice, hardest part was trying to get more hours because they hire so many people but give little hours."
good,"I would fold clothes and assist fitting rooms every time I worked."
good,Job is ok but hours were low and the salary is very poor. Also requirements and dress code is very strict.
good,This was the place I learned most of retail management experience.
good,"Cashing people out at the requesters, help people find what they looking for. assisting people with any help the need it."
good,K&M was a good place to work if you want to make money and get a lot of hours that is the place to be.
good,You'll definitely stick out if you know how to interact with customers and sell.
good,"A typical day at work is as follows:"
good,It is alot funner to shop than to work at the Abercrombie store. The lighting makes it difficult to help clients pick their correct sizes and the music is very loud which inhibits workers to fully tend to customer needs.
good,"There was no ""typical day"" at my previous job. There was always something new happening. I learned an abundance of management skills at my previous job. I learned how to manage a group of sometime 50 plus employees. Also I was able to recruit top talent in my last position. It was a fantastic opportunity, and I let myself take in every learning experience."
good,I learned a lot and got a chance to use my leadership skills and I was thankful for the chance for advancement
good,I learned how to be more disciplined and organized in this job
good,"great place to jump start your career post graduation. great opportunity for new degree holders. great amount of responsibility as well as benefits. only downside is the pay. would have no issue with the position if it was $17/hr. everyone looks for a greater opportunity and that time has arrived. in this economy, the assistant manager position does not have a pay that's conducive to the current cost of living."
good,"energetic crowd to be around, repetitive tasks though such as folding the same pile of clothing over and over"
good,Co-workers share similar interest and it's a fun laid back work environment.
good,"Working at Aberombie and Fitch was overall a good experience.My managers were nice and understanding, my co-workers were fun to work around and loved working as a team. I did enjoy the tourist that came often it was good to meet people outside of this country and state."
good,"I did not enjoy working at Abercrombie. It was unjust for we had to buy the clothes we had to wear from the store, and wear it the way they wanted us to fashion the store. With the work that we were required to do, we were not getting paid enough. Everything had to be folded a certain way, in the correct order and had to look perfect. If something was off, I had to refold or restock the items. I had to greet the customers with the same three phrases. When working at the store, everything had to be in a certain way or else you would get in trouble."
good,"typical day at work is boring"
good,"Greeted customers as they entered the store"
good,If you want a job in retail this would be a great work experience. Hard-work at its best. Love fashion
good,"Typical day at the job consisted of making sure that the store was visually pleasing, marketing was in its proper place, the models were in their work zone and properly dressed, and making sure shoplifters were not in."
good,"Modeled clothing"
good,"The best part about the job is the people I work with. I normally work on the floor, greeting customers and folding clothes or on the register. The management and co-workers made my experience the best it could be."
good,"Fun and energetic place to work, awful compensation for what's required of you."
good,Fun job because it was so diverse but it wasn't for me because they didn't give enough hours and the pay wasn't really that great.
good,"Ive worked for this company for 4 years its a part time job its a very popualr job to have as a teen. I worked as a ""model"" which was giving great customer service and also as a cashier."
good,"Not that great of a company, there is a reason so many of their concepts have failed..."
good,a typical work day would be folding clothes and cleaning the store and doing other tasks given by managers.
good,Very easy job. Had a good time learning about being an employee in retail and working with difficult customers.
good,"For young adults, its full of mostly college kids. As an older adult I would not apply"
good,"There are issues with upper management handling conflicts and there is no help for advancement. The company claims you need to be a SM to advance to home office, which is very untrue. When there is a serious conflict, the District Managers and anyone above them do not want to handle the situation. The pay is horrible for the amount of blood, sweat and tears the company expects out of the store level employees. If anyone wants to take vacation or a sick day, they are basically shunned. The company also shuns anyone who does not fit their look policy."
good,Fun Place to work with great people. Not a great deal of room for advancement quickly.
good,Coworkers are down to earth.  Teaches you great customer service skills.
good,Typical day at work usually you just stand there and greet customers and fold clothes. What I learned in here is to be great customer helper. The hardest part of the job is to really fit in with your co-worker. But I enjoy and laugh being in  the store and just walk around and fold every clothes I see and basically get a discount on their clothing.
good,"Greeting the customers, providing great customer service and maintaining the sales floor."
good,busy place to work. but you meet different people daily and you learn alot.
good,There is a lot of drama but a good part time job for students. pays minimun wage and few hours aside from holiday's
good,"A typical day at work began with operational duties and preparing the store to open for business. Once open for business, my main focus was ensuring that the customers were having a great store experience and that our associates had what they needed to be successful at customer service and sales. Throughout the day I had tasks such as training, recruiting, interview, and conferencing with upper management and other stores. At least once per week I closed the store for business. "
good,This job was fast paced. I had to learn everything very quickly.
good,"A typical day at work goes pretty quickly, most of the time it is folding clothes, working the cash wrap area, tag lining people, and being in dress code. This job isn't one that should be taken to seriously just because of how the work day is set up, you are there maybe 4-6 hours maybe 3-5 days a week. A typical part time job. It is awesome working with people your age even the managers are not that much older than you are. That is also the downside to the job, it can become very immature very quickly and sometimes it feels like you are back in middle school."
good,As a manager you were expected to work 50+ hours at half of your normal pay rate. Co workers became best friends and family members. Learned a lot about the retail community and their policies taught me to be a more organized individual. I owe all of my excellent management skills to them.
good,"A typical day included pulling stock in the back room to replace what was sold on the sales floor, folding the clothes very specific, maintaining the sales floor's appearance, organizing shipment, and helping customers. I learned how to help customers, pull stock, and work a cash register. The management changed a lot, almost every few months. The company is very specific about how the clothes are folded and everything needs to be extremely precise which is hard. Best part of the job was that my coworkers were my age."
good,"•	Managed purchase and exchange/return transactions"
good,It was a job that I used over the summer and honestly was a light hearted fun job.
good,"Overall Okay experience but lack of hours was a problem at times. Retail experience is priceless due to the high standard of store maintenance. Management was also a bit of an issue, I felt that the negative atmosphere was painted by poor management and lack of personality. But regardless the experience tops the negativity."
good,"A typical day spent is composed of assignments to task out throughout the day, mostly between the two managers on duty that day. Assignments include store surveys, sales floor audits, creating schedules, group interviews, recruiting, marketing placement/filing, associate meeting topics, configuring business sales and calculating hours. "
good,"Fun part time job, good management, lots of hardwork required. Great place to learn about customer service."
good,Messy over crowded stock room. limited work hours. no proper job training. I think that the staff did not pay enough attention to the newcomers.
good,"I did not particularly enjoy the atmosphere at Abercrombie & Fitch with the dim lighting, loud music, and heavy aroma of automated cologne spritzers."
good,"Ask the manager what needs to be done, get the equipment required and do the job to the most highest standard. Also at the same time provide customer services to those i see need help or customers that look as if they need assistance."
good,"I would come in, sign in/clock in to work. head to the first floor for our annual morning meetings about what the day may hold. Comparing projection sales from the prior year. Which helps us know if the day may be a busy day or not so much busy. I am assigned a room to make sure its neat and tidy throughout the day. I have learned a lot at Abercrombie. I have learned more patience. I have learned how to deal with customers who does not speak English but yet I can help them find exactly what they are looking for. I have also learned that the customers are friends and be polite and the best salesperson you can be to help the customer. Some managers are friendly. The co-workers are very friendly and also helpful. The hardest part of the job was updates. Updates are staying after hours when the store is closed and switching up the store, bringing in new items and folding them and breaking down shelves and closets. The most enjoyable part is the loud friendly music and customers that enjoy the music just as mush as they enjoy shopping and the clothes."
good,Everything you need to know is at your finger tips. All of your daily task are outlined for you from opening the store to closing the store.
good,Fun Employees Great place to work but you will never move up in store.
good,An employee's job responsibilities depends on their shift.
good,"I made sure nothing was stolen, worked register, folded clothes, and maintained a clean and presentable work environment."
good,"Fun place to work with scooters to ride and music playing over loud speakers all day long.  Challenging to work for a company where the CEO has a hand in all decisions.  Flexibility is key, but eventually it is frustrating to be changing direction back and forth over time."
good,A&F is a very structured company that tells you exactly what is expected of the management team and the associates.  This makes the daily tasks easy to know how much time should be spent doing each assignment and what the end result should be. The environment is fun and the co-workers are young energetic people who are easy to get along with.
good,"I love my job and all the associates and managers that I have worked with. The only thing that I do not like about the job is the fact that our company over hires, leaving all associates with little to no hours throughout the work week."
good,"A typical day at work would be delegating associates to maintain and improve presentation standards of clothes and forms. To recruit throughout the day. Ensure that all sizes are represented in each presentation of clothes. Receive and scan out all shipment boxes and to delegate associates to sensor all units of clothes, fold, and to organize numerically within the stockroom bay. Making sure the store is kept clean throughout the entire day. Ensuring that all associates are fun, friendly, and approachable."
good,"My typical day would be different based on the goals that needed to be met for that day.  For example one day I might be Form Styling; Which is dressing the forms according to provided standards. Another day I might be on one or two floors helping customers meanwhile, getting other visual tasks done.  The store is a flagship which means the traffic tends to be pretty hectic, so working there has taught me how to multi-task The hardest part of the job would probably dealing with the extreme attention to detail. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the getting to interact with a broad spectrum of people from different walks of life."
good,"people are friendly, managment was nice, helpful. always doing something"
good,Abercrombie & Ftich offers a management training program for recent college graduates which helps them learn what it takes to run a business on lean budgeting and limited resources. 
good,"A typical day started with a great positive energy and organization of the tasks for the day. As a flagship there is a high volume of customers and employees within the store, it was especially important for the operations team to be quick and efficient in order to have all teams perform to the best of there ability. I have learned a great deal from my peers and managers. Working in a very diverse environment has challenged me and taught me to be a team player. "
good,"Simply pick up the store and make sure everything is where it needs to be, also we would assist customers with the most upright customer service"
good,Abercrombie takes pride in the stores appearance and a usual overnight shift will consist of stocking all the shelves to capacity and neatly folded.
good,"I have never managed or worked in retail before, thus I learned a lot quickly. It became clear from the very beginning that managing is all about multitasking and staying patient. I grew to enjoy the challenge of training new employees while maintaing the flow of everyday business. There were always a million tasks at hand and learning to be efficient with time and employees made the job a fun challenge."
good,Typical day would be running the business along with achieving unrealistic staffing goal and long hours. Co workers and employees are the best part of the job.
good,Fun place to work. It is a good place for when your in school and need some extra money. Definitely not a place to make a career. 
good,"Caissier ( sur le contrat ) , je pouvais être envoyé à tous moments en rayons pour conseiller les clients ou bien faire les cabines d'essayage durant des shift de 5 heures sans poses . Avec plus de temps dans l'entreprise il était possible de passer en ""Lead"" ( sous manageurs ). Les manageurs en savaient parfois moins que les caissiers et vendeurs donc il m'est parfois arrivé d'expliquer une tâche à un nouveau manageur ."
good,"Greet the customers"
good,"The MIT, Assistant Manager, and Store Manager positions are a great way to get management experience right out of college. The company is very detail oriented, putting a lot of emphasis on standard of merchandise presentations, lighting, marketing, recruiting, and store experience.  However the hours are not favorable, and the amount of stress this job requires of you is not comparable to what your salary is.  "
good,"Day to day activities were varied but within job background"
good,"Typical day was pretty mundane work.  Folding clothing, stocking, and straightening. I really enjoyed the high level up detail I was held to.  The hours were sometimes unpredictable, but management always remained flexible. "
good,"A typical day at work was all about motivating associates to make the store very nice with all the latest clothes in the right marketing positions.  I would manage the store and the associates to deliver the best in store experience for all customers.  I management two big teams, stockroom associates and sales associates, to do their best in getting the store operations going forward. The hardest part of the job is the continuous running around to make sure all the associates were doing the right work. The most enjoyable part of the job is working on the visual marketing projects and managing a large diverse staff. "
good,It will depend on the people you work with to decide if this is a productive and enjoyable place to work at or not.
good,it is a good starting job when i still in high school. it was my fist job i had great time there
good,New managers every couple of months because they would hate the job. Some had no idea what they were doing. Good job to meet girls
good,"It is your top clothing store for customer service, i learned organizational skills which created a neat store front for the Abercrombie store. "
good,"A typical day at work consists of driving sales via excellent customer service and sales floor merchandising. Additionally, it consists of delegating tasks to employees to improve the store experience for customers, and motivating employees to take pride in their work. "
good,Attention to detail was a must for this employer.  The managers and the employees are very diverse and made work fun 
good,"My typical day at work would be folding clothing and bringing out onto the sales floor, also working fitting room. Everyone at Abercrombie is really cool, and down to earth. I learned how to multi task very well there when it comes to folding, bring clothing out and answering customers questions"
good,"There were so many employees that they might even forget to schedule you in for the week. It was hard to get to know the management on a first name basis because you really only worked one day a week. This is a good job for someone who has never had a job before. But if you're looking for something that will actually give you hours, this probably isn't the place for you."
good,"Responsible for organization of several projects through use of varied resources"
good,"Overall good place to work,pay not very good but for what you do it was fine. If you work on weekends they always bought donuts, coffee,and orange juice for first break, and pizza for second break for both shifts."
good,"typical day at work consisted of interaction with customers, stocking, store maintance and visual aids."
good,At Abercrobie the faculty was at hand when you had a problem or if you needed to work longer. They were very open  
good,I enjoyed my time working for A&F but its takes alot of hardwork
good,Love how I can be myself. The people are over all friendly and nice. Some superiors have a negative inlfuence. Some requirements are not realistic and practical. Some days can be demanding but overall doable.
good,Folding and marking merchandise. Ironing merchandise and running go backs. Setting up fixtures and setting up store for opening.
good,"This was initially a great company to come into. The people they look to hire are fun, energetic and aspirational. The company benefits are better than most companies around. I learned a lot on how to manage people and their training period is set up to learn everything about the job. I learned some valuable skills on managing, recruiting, hr policies and how to run a multi-billion dollar business. Unfortunately there are a lot of cons to the job. Recruiting for the company is a higher priority than most anything for advancement in the company, yet at times the hiring decisions do not make sense for the benefit of the company. The company hires on looks alone for management, and is quick to turn down a good interview only because they were not good looking enough. It also seems to be a male dominated company in which men are promoted at a faster rate than women."
good,"A typical day consisted of maintaining the look of the sales floor (addressing mannequins, folding clothes, setting up modules). I learned folding techniques and had plenty of time to practice customer relations. The co-workers were always fun to be around and really helped maintain a fun environment. The most enjoyable part of the job was the relaxed, easy-going nature of the job."
good,I ended up doing all the work for the management team since my store manager was not willing to do her part. This made my job not enjoyable but very stressful.
good,"I enjoyed working at Hollister, Abercrombie and Fitch's teen brand. I was fortunate to work in an incredibly busy store, so there was never a dull moment. You must be willing to work incredibly hard and long hours during the holiday season, something that is typical with retail work."
good,"Abercrombie is a fun place to work if you are a people person. You are constantly surrounded by outgoing employees, so not one day is the same. Overall, the best part of this job is getting to work with so many interesting individuals who I learn many things from on a daily basis. The hardest part of this job is never having a set schedule which makes it hard to have a personal life."
good,A typical day at work consisted of working in clothing retail.
good,"Abercrombie and Fitch was a okay job. It required you to be on your toes at all times. Cleaning, restocking, and attending to all customers and their needs. This job requires you to do everything precisely. All of our work was judged to make sure we put one hundred percent effort in whatever it is we were asked to do."
good,This was such an amazing experience for me! I recommend this job to everyone!
good,Had A wonderful experience.
good,"Abercrombie & Fitch is a job that you would do if you needed money. I can not see too many people working their because they like it. The problem is that the company cares more about its image than their actual workers. If you don't look a certain way, you may not get a job there. They over work you and you will be lucky to get a break. With all the negatives I can put with this company, I would say that the positives are that they have nice music to listen to while you work and its a job! Not all jobs are good ones, but if they pay bills you have to learn to like them!"
good,"Sales and customer service are my main priorities, while running business operations and delegating tasks to employees. I recruited and trained most of my employees, so I enjoyed working with all of them. The most enjoyable part of my job would be making customers happy and helping them out in anyway that I can. I was in charge of the visual presentations in the store, and I always had fun perfecting everything."
good,While working as a sales associate at A&F I provided customer service; replenished merchandise and monitored floor stock.
good,I've been with the company for over a year (Hollister is a sister company) and I have made great friends with both other associates and the managers. Some managers are very strict and unfriendly but it varies by location.
good,It tended to be a very boring job. There were too many employees therefore they would only schedule you about one day a week.
good,"Days at work can range anywhere from 9 to 11 hours as a manager. Updates are very frequent and perfection is a must for all the Hollister, Abercrombie, and Gilly Hicks stores. Co workers are generally easy going people who are all very friendly. Employees are selected generally based on whether or not they are attractive rather than if they have retail experience. Hardest part of the job is keeping up with all the updates and maintaining the store standard which is well above most retailers."
good,"ANF is a unique place to work, however the hours are long and it can be very demanding and exhausting."
good,A great place to meet a lot of people and socialize with customers.
good,Basic retail experience. Performed customer service duties. Interpersonal communication skills highly demanded.
good,"Folding clothes and keeping the store tidy was very important of upholding the image of Abercrombie and Fitch, however, specific downfalls of dresscode included - not being able to wear the color black and males could not have his ears pierced, just to name a few. It was typically busy work with keeping the store stocked with clothes and folding pile after pile. My co-workers were fun, but management were more ""for show"" who gave very non-specific tasks to be executed. Working for a place that dealt with so much clothes and customers was fun, but the hardest part - as well as one of the more prideful part - of the job was folding clothes, but after folding and seeing it made a mess of was difficult."
good,Meetings every morning consulting how to increase our sales while providing excellent service.
good,"A typical day of work at Abercrombie will range from helping customers on the floor to maintaing the store to folding and organizing clothes in the stock room. The management was decent considereing we consistanly swithced managers every few months. For the most part, my co-workers were enjoyable. We would enyoy each others company during our shifts while we were getting our work done."
good,Had to conform to their uniforms and could not wear anything inside the brand. I left the company because of the intolerable comments from managers of another race. Was blamed for doing things I did not do. Employees waited outside in the cold for up to 20 minutes at a time before Managers would let them in. Then they would be written up for being late.
good,As an assistant you work very hard to complete your daily tasks. You often work more than 40 hours a week. The busy seasons are the most fun. You have the opportunity to hand pick your own staff.
good,"Amazing place to go to work, great people and music! The overtime pay was unfair. I liked getting to work all management positions within the company and at all brands."
good,Co-workers and management were overall friendly and relaxed. Things ran smoothly at the store and everyone got along.
good,At times this can be a very fun job. There are other times where things happen that seem completely unneccesary. It all depends on the person or people involved.
good,"Overall, working for A&F has been a learning experience. Learning about different levels of management, customer service and most importantly yourself. Definitely wish there was a little more of a balance between life and work, but that is ultimately the price you pay with working in retail."
good,Working for Abercrombie & Fitch was my gateway into the retail business. I learned a lot about customer service and how businesses operate.
good,"working hard, and making customer happy,I learned that when working in retail try your hard too make the customer feel welcome."
good,A typical day at work consists of being in a positive mood and socializing with customers and other employees.
good,"Just out of college with a Business degree, this was a great place to start my career."
good,I worked 4 or 5 hour shifts but it seemed as they were around 6 or 7 hours
good,"Working at Abercrombie was very diverse, met great friendly people from all over the world."
good,"A typical day at work was to maintain the store's ambiance by organizing all the merchandise according to the planogram. As a model or sales associate we greeted customers and informed them of the new merchandise for the quarter. We would also find sizes, colors or styles customers were looking for. If we didn't have any of their requests we would contact other stores to help meet their needs."
good,- Management very open-minded
good,This job require you to be great a customer service as well as selling whats on the shelves.
good,"Typically arriving at the store at 6am and cleaned until 10 am when the store opens. Supervised all cleaning crew and served as a team leader. Oversight of all tasks, and assisted with vaccuming, cleaning, high /low dusting, sanitized the rest room and ordered supplies. Worked on the overnight team with stock inventory and redecorating the store and reolacing fixtures. performed internal and external cleaning"
good,Great career for recent college grads who want to work up to a corporate environment. Advancement can be a quick process (within 2 to 4 years) if you want to get to a corporate job but you have to prove yourself at the store level because they only hire from within. The hours can be long and the pay is mediocre but it is worth the effort if you can stick it out. They are not very flexible with scheduling however and it is hard to get time off even for sick days.
good,Great way to meet new people. Was a good place to work at if you have to go to school and work.
good,"Abercrombie and Fitch has is a fast paced, fun, exciting work environment."
good,"Abercrombie and Fitch is a highly ""religious"" company, as in they expect you to treat the job as though it is your life and there is nothing outside the abercrombie world. They offer good benefits, but the pay is terrible, and you are expected to work 5, 9 hour days a week."
good,"Management position is great for right out of college. Must have a four year degree BA or BS. The person doesn't have to have any management experience and will gain experience in managing. As long as you are adherent to company policies, your job is secure. Company has career opportunities in many fields, including international opportunities. The person must be ""brand image"" in order to get promoted to home office or international opportunities. A&F is slow to employ diverse associates at home office or any other high positions within the company. Company isn't supportive of furthering education. Good health care, vacations, and other benefits."
good,I just went to work on time all the time did whatever it was I had to do until my work shift was over
good,"I really enjoyed managing because it gave me better leadership and customer service skills. Managing a store takes hard work, dedication and self-confidence. Helping run a business is both rewarding and stressful so you have to be able to handle whatever is thrown at you. Sometimes customers can be very unpleasant but its how you handle the situation that determines the outcome. I wasn't fond of the strict guidelines and hiring process, but if you like the company culture and values it might be the place for you!"
good,"Abercrombie is a great opportunity for anyone about to graduate high school and/or in college. I worked there as a model (aka a brand representative) but was offered an MIT position before I was about to graduate college (you need a degree in order to be a manager). At this point I had been leaning towards leaving the company mostly due to the fact I had grown from it. I no longer wanted to wear the same outfits everyday to work, and the same outfits as the years prior for that matter. It was a lot of fun there and I learned a lot in regards to hard work, standards and customer service."
good,This a great company to work for. When it comes to management there is a lot of room for improvement. Management doesn’t seem to care about the associated growth within the company
good,"You’re expected to be doing 5+ things at a time. If you have a provide high output, you’ll be held to higher standards than people who obviously don’t try or care. You’ll be praised in private and criticized in public. Turn over has been an issue but starting to balance out."
good,I liked my manager but there was a lot of prejudice in the company when it came to the hiring process. The pay is fairly low; minimum wage if i remember correctly.
good,Huge company. Every time busy people making  money and working. You can work.all seven days if you want. But now I dont know. How it's going there what has changed because I' m here in new Hampshire.
good,"Very relaxed workplace managers were easy to work with as well as at along with. Flexible hours, store meetings very efficaient and fun as well. Really like working here. I moved back home to New York due to having my son."
good,"The people who work at Abercrombie were really great and made for a memorable working experience, however the amount they paid us for the work and the amount of hours we were working were simply not fair and was the reason I decided to leave."
good,Fun working there and the people were nice. It's a fairly simple job and great for someone who is in school and needing something to do on the side. Slow paced except for the holidays and back to school.
good,most of the people at are friendly here but working here during seasonal times there's a lot of new faces. I found it so slow folding clothes to pass time
good,"The work environment at Abercrombie and Fitch was slightly collaborative and the employees usually get along perfectly fine. However, when it comes to pay, associates of the brand are paid Minimum Wage ($8.60)."
good,"If you do not have any cashier experience, they will teach you right off the bat. Many of the employees are great to work with and management is very understanding."
good,It's a very labor-intensive work because you get shipments multiple times a week and there are tons of boxes with each shipment. At the store I work at they have a difficult problem with employee retention so employees quit usually and the work falls on the same people.
good,As a part time associate the pay could be better especially since the hiring age is 18. It is difficult to live off minimum wage for working adults. As a member of the management team the pay is better and benefits are fair.
good,"A&F had a very young workforce. Working as a merchant for this company was a great learning experience which gave me a very comprehensive entry into apparel production and merchandising. Demand for the product was high so there was a lot of pressure and work could be stressful. However, company took a slump and is now probably a different animal."
good,"Abercrombie and Fitch management make it very clear that they only hire 'good looking' people. Very boring job if you are only an associate, but you will become a master folder."
good,Although the the workplace is fun and you're sure to meet good people the work they have you do for the pay you receive is not worth it sadly. I can say I don't regret working there though and was a good place to network
good,"A typical day at work was very trying. There was a specific way the workers had to dress -from how your hair is styled/the color to the socks you wore. I learned that for my first job, this was not the ideal job for me at the time. Certain jobs come with a strict guideline of how their employees are expected to look/dress and sometimes, the outfits they require you to wear are uncomfortable. Management was, ok. From what I can remember, management played favoritism a lot. The hardest part of the job was having to wear very uncomfortable clothes and sneakers for almost 6 -standing. the most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers."
good,"It was fun working at Abercrombie & Fitch but its definitely not as structured as most jobs you would have. Overall you're pretty much left on your own and you have to figure out what works. It can also be overwhelming because of the traffic, trying to keep up with the customers and keep everything organized. Best skill it teaches, however, is how to deal with all types of people."
good,"I had a good time working there. The money was decent, but I had to leave due to personal issues in life. I felt bad leaving, but I appreciated working there and meeting the people there too."
good,Come in and clock in. Do your work. Ask what to do if you finished everything. Poor management. The best part of the job is working with fun people. Workplace culture is laid back and chill.
good,"The management position was demanding, but for good reasons. Both NJ and NY locations give great benefits. When I was there they matched your 401k as long as you put in 5 years you keep their portion."
good,A typical day consisted of restocking clothes and preparing the store front prior to opening. Once we were open I mostly greeted and checked out the customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was how well the employees got along.
good,"I got along with everyone in there , very nice people to work with , I was very new at the time and they were giving me time to develop and start to know how to work things"
good,Its a good place for your first job. not too fast paced but able to learn. It taught me to be more organized and sympathetic towards the customers.....
good,"I worked at the Hollister store on the strip. It is a good first job and is very flexible with scheduling, however, it is very hard to get hours. Also, since my store was on the strip, our wages were vary unfair. We made minimum wage at a large high capacity store and hours were unfair. Overall, it's a good job to have while your in highschool or if just want extra money."
good,"I had the opportunity to work for Abercrombie & Fitch for about 4 years. I enjoyed working at my store alongside my coworkers and the many managers I had the pleasure of meeting. I started as a sales associate and moved my way up to Full-Time Stock. You need a college degree to be a manager so I was being trained until I was able to graduate. Unfortunately, my experience with my store manager was not a pleasant one. I ended up leaving the company when I was offered a position somewhere else. Despite having a poor store manager, I did enjoy working with this company and the opportunities it had given me to grow."
good,"Great work environment, nice and helpful employees, and managers are flexible with all. Co-workers are helpful and managers are open to all questions."
good,This company has poor work/life balance but compensates with great pay and benefits. The company seems to acknowledge this is an issue and is trying to improve.
good,A typical day would be a normal pace of customers. Not too busy but not too slow. I learned from this job that you have to be patience with people and to not bothers customers so much because they just want to shop in peace and bothering them makes them not buy anything from the store.
good,"Abercrombie is a great company to work for if you want to gain manager experience. They work hard to train each manager and help them to move forward in the company quickly. I made friends for life in that job. I also could not maintenance and friendships or relationships outside of work. Scheduled shift is always changing and most of the time u feel sleep deprived. As a manager, work never stops. I loved it and hated it all at the same time. Lots of responsibilities, not a lot of help from corporate and they find reasons not to give you a raise. Eventually, I realized I could take my hard working ethics to another company and be treated better."
good,I needed a job in high school so I'm very thankful Abercrombie and Fitch hired me. the associates were very friendly and it was like a home feeling when working there.
good,"A typical day at work:"
good,"Abercrombie Kids works around your set schedule, other associates are very friendly, management overall are friendly. Hardest part of the job are rude customers but overall pretty easy job. Great for first time job, people with a busy schedule, and easy part time job. Not a longtime job, very low pay."
good,"A typical day at work is usually very busy. Each day you are responsible for a different task. When it comes to hours, they are very flexible. However, being able to have a good amount of hours can be a struggle. They are overstaffed so many people may go on weeks without even getting a single shift."
good,"The biggest issue at most Abercrombie's is the fact that they hire 20+ brand reps to work at a single store, resulting in hardly every getting hours unless you are constantly covering other people's shifts. Management is typically younger and fairly nice, once you can get into the ""in"" crowd with the group of people working there, but it definitely still felt like I was in high school when working here. There is also no room for advancement unless you already have your four-year degree (which is required to be any sort of manager with A&F)."
good,"The days were very easy going but then again I was not part of management, however I did a lot of the same things managers were doing."
good,"Very structured company, the most enjoyable part is the people you work with, the hardest part is customers, but that is retail. It is a great company."
good,as a store level manager i find the upper management in my district to be great. the communication and personal connection between the district manager and store managers/ assistant managers has been very good.
good,"Create more room for growth and allow more original designs from designers.The growth in the company seemed to happen to specific audiences and the designs were coming from thrifted samples, etc."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Abercrombie. I met a lot of great people and made good friends. However, some of the management were very unprofessional and mean to employees. Also, the dress code is very strict even though it says you can wear clothes that aren't from Abercrombie, they almost always made you buy there clothes and its difficult to do when you only get paid minimum wage and work less than 6 hours a day sometimes not even 2 times a week."
good,"Overall, I have enjoyed my experiences at A&F. I love my co-workers, who made every shift a collaborative and fun experience, and I have made many friends at A&F. One thing that I think should be improved - and I believe the company is working on this - is the ""call-in"" shifts. I think these shifts should be elliminated immediately as they were a source of stress and instability in my schedule. While working at A&F, I was also working as a restaurant hostess, and the presence of the call-in shifts made it very difficult for me to make my schedule at the restaurant. I had to devote an entire day to staying by my phone, and couldn't make any other plans on the chance that I was ""called-in"" to work."
good,This was my first opportunity at employment.  It was fun at times but mostly folding & warehouse trips.  Good job for a person starting in the workforce.
good,"all the co-workers were really nice, slow paced, everyone was always very welcoming and there was never a dull day in abercrombie and fitch. the pay was very low."
good,"This was good job to start out with, however at my location the management was awful and in my few months working there we had about 3 managers. The last manager didn't give me any hours so that is why I left."
good,Good retail experience but I worked with a lot of college students that chose partying/personal life over coming to work. A lot of no-shows and call outs.
good,very high paced environment with possiblity of a lot of hours. good pay/benefits.. can be stressful alot expected of each person.  moral can be poor during peak season..
good,I liked working at Abercrombie & Fitch because the people made the job fun. I did not like the freedom of being able to act as a manager. We worked as a great team.
good,"I learned alot at abercrombie, and met a bunch of people. The compensation was very poor considering how much profit the company was making. to be a manager you need an assocites degree which isn't much of a requirement but definitely  unnecessary."
good,"It's been a fun place to work. Have worked for the company for 4-5 years but this position is new. "
good,It was a very relaxed place to work. I was there four hours a day and my managers were very pleasant. I learned how to upsale.
good,"Staff is fun, customers are nice but few hours are given to each worker. I usually work on the register and it has given me experience with customer service."
good,at Abercrombie you learn the work environment from dealing with customers to dealing with different Positions. i was an Impact associate where i dealt with Shipment and processing it as well. i also did modeling from time to time in the store. the required greeting customers to helping them with fitting rooms and working the cash Register
good,"Overall a good place to work if they offer more full time positions. It's not stressful working there, and the company offers good benefits. The management is good as well."
good,The program at Abercrombie and Fitch is great at developing younger talent. They train you on all aspects of management and it is a great starting position to get your management experience. It is a high level of stress job and much is expected from you.
good,"This is a fun environment, but the pay is not good because it is an entry level job. You're not expected to do much aside from keeping clothes folded neat and organized. You also have to keep the store clean."
good,"It was a great place to work, the people were awesome and even better the customer. There weren't long hours given ever, during the holidays you maybe able to work a good amount of shifts other then that, an individual would work about once or twice biweekly."
good,"Handling merchandise, communicating with co-workers and customers. Ive learned how to communicate with people and be more organized. Management is okay. Some are really cool people to work with and some aren't. Co-workers are generally easy to get along with. So many people come and go so you will most likely meet someone new every couple of days."
good,"I've learned you can love yourself by wearing what you desire and what best fits your style . Abercrombie taught me to embrace my beauty and acknowledge it . What I loved most about working there was my co-workers were so caring for one another and they showed an ""I care"" attitude towards customers and I  . They accept you as you are and they are so honest . They help one another with difficult task and they are team players. The hardest thing I should say about the job was watching over customers that were stealing and customers that were difficult to help."
good,"Absolutely loved the environment, great day hours until hours became cut. Loved being active and social with customers and making their shopping easier with the help given."
good,"a typical day was swiping your card into the system to clock in, then go straight to work and barely any talking happened. I learned how to be directly involved in inventory, customer service, and transactions. The management was very helpful and understanding, nothing to complain about. This job wasn't too difficult in all honesty and the most enjoyable part of it was when you got to do your work and talk with the co-workers at the same time."
good,"The typical work day consists of cashier work, folding clothes, and customer service. This is the first job I had that taught me how to be a cashier and work the register. The management and co-workers were friendly."
good,Abercrombie is a fun place to work at but just as a summer job. The hours they gave were nothing serious maybe around 10 hours a week.
good,"Working in retail was a good experience for me to network and learn skills, like folding, and being more opened to meeting new people, etc. The management was professional and easy going. My co- workers were great, we all got along, making sure the work got done on time. The hardest part for me was learning the different techniques to folding the clothing, but I caught on fast and mastered the ability to fold clothes."
good,The job was organized and created a positve work enviornment. Co workers were very nice and helpful as were the management. Schedule was flexible and worked great for mine and all other associates.
good,"Coming in being greeted by friendly staff while engaging in conversation and reading your goals of the day. This job field has made me learn proper and constant organization and teamwork. The managers were very informative and fun to be around. The hardest part of the job would only be whenever someone does not show up to work without calling in and having to fill in for that person, while the most enjoyable aspect of the job would have to be the friendliness of all the employees."
good,"It was a very small store at a not so successful location, so business was very slow. Managers and coworkers were very cool and supportive."
good,"Typical days at abercrombie (particularly at this Branch) were always fast-paced and busy as it's located at a ""tourist spot"". However, it was always still fun because almost all my coworkers, even the managers, were super friendly and outgoing, and we all got along well. In addition, having a lot of tourists come into the store was also interesting because I got to learn about many customers' different cultures whenever I talked to them, and I really enjoyed that about the job."
good,"A surprisingly well-oiled machine. Perhaps that was mostly attributed to the solid team of managers that worked very well together. The associates were friendly and welcoming; easy to be integrated into the culture and community. "
good,Abercrombie was my first job! I learned to work well as a team member as well as take over in emergency situations. The only issue  is that EVERYONE is so young and there was not a lot a maturity abround the workplace.
good,"I would say that A&F is a great place for people to gain management skills. I was able to learn the basics in a fun and exciting environment. "
good,At first it was a great place to work but their scheduling system is way to stupid and the fact that they over hire people was wired and at the end they send most of the people home.
good,barely got any hours working there but its a good place to start. my first job in high school and with the amount of hours i had had enough free time
good,"Learned new folding styles"
good,"A great first job and stepping stool to your next career move. I have enjoyed most all employees I have worked with. "
good,"When I first got to Abercrombie and Fitch, I thought it was going to be a lot a good job but it wasn't. I got paid minimum wage and only got to work on the weekends for short hours and all they did was put me in a section for my whole shift to fold clothes and walk around."
good,"Abercrombie & Fitch was a pretty easy-going retail job that I held throughout college. I learned about communication with managers, working in teams, and staying focused on a task."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of interaction with customers, handling transactions, cleaning, and organizing the store to keep it up to standard. I learned a lot about customer interaction and the importance of creating a personal experience for each customer. My managers, coworkers, had great synergy, and I enjoyed the amount of diversity that my store had. The most enjoyable part of this job was the ability to meet new people everyday, and having the power to make a positive impact in someone's life by putting on a smile and striking up a conversation about a stylish outfit."
good,"Gives you an idea of what it is like to work in retail, laid back except for what the appropriate dress code is.  Strict about breaks too. They also often expect you to work after the mall closes, but will compensate with overtime pay. Sometimes pretty boring."
good,"Typical hours are horrible, giving only 3 hour shifts and sometimes asking to stay later because not enough people could make it. Tedious work. Being asked to do jobs that other people holding those positions should be doing. Treating people as hours and not actual fun loving people that we are."
good,"How to run a business, opening and closing registers, managing the sales floor. Managing hours based on projected business. Creating schedules and managing associates on the go."
good,"At Abercrombie and Fitch a typical day would include creating schedules for upcoming weeks,  re-merchandising the sales floor to make sure all items we neat, in size order and easily accessible to customers. Helping customers find exactly what they were looking for then completing the transaction at the cash register.  Training employees on how to fold, the best ways to help customers and make sales.  Abercrombie has taught me a lot of valuable lessons about managing peers and also those younger than myself.  It has also taught me how to prioritize work so everything that is expected of me can be accomplished within certain time parameters.  The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to help customers find what they are looking for especially since most are repeat customers I was able to build a professional relationship with them."
good,Greeting and assisting customers. Smiling and being in a great mood.
good,"I dont feel like having to type another review of the same exact company, so i guess ill just type whatever comes to mind. Advancement for this company is horrible, why would you need a degree to become a manager? When you work somewhere for a certain amount of time you should be able to move up considering you have learned more than the new guy just coming in."
good,"Closing hours are the hardest shift because you need to make sure that store is perfectly clean for next day. "
good,"In the time I have spent with Abercrombie and Fitch, I am grateful for all the amazing people I have met along the way. The culture of the company is cool and fun, but the people you work with are truly what makes working for the company so great."
good,"A typical day at work includes budgeting hours, organizing stockroom, replenishing merchandise on sales floor, keeping store clean, motivating staff to push sales and provide outstanding customer service, speak to each and every customer in the store and make sure that my co-workers are helping them and helping them myself if need be, managing funds of $1000+, and maintaining business by the hour. I have learned what it takes to be a leader and how to turn unsatisfied customers to happy ones. I have also learned how to run a business successfully by making sure everyone is completing their job duties as well myself completing my duties and setting an example. The hardest part of the job would have to be completing floor sets and updates in a reasonable amount of time while operating the store during business hours. Although this is challenging, its nothing that can't be completed. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing you helped people and provided them with great service. I love when customers thank myself or my workers for helping them. It reassures me that we are all providing great customer service which is our main priority in this company."
good,"ciò che mi ha lasciato questa esperienza lavorativa è stato imparare a conoscere gli obbiettivi di un azienda e l organizzazione del negozio e delle mansioni lavorative oltre alla cosa più importante, ossia l' assistenza al cliente"
good,"* A typical day at work would be standing on the floor greeting customers, persuading customers."
good,If you're ok with working twice a week and last minute call ins this is perfect
good,"Started with the company in Los Angeles where it was a great fun place to work. I then transferred to buffalo new york to help train the district and bring company standards up. Ironically, the first time I heard the company really really caring about its image was in buffalo, not in Los Angeles."
good,It's a pretty simple job. You don't do much but fold clothes and greet costumers.
good,"Abercrombie is a great place to start a career. There are multiple opportunities to both be mentored and to mentor others. It is a great place to learn a lot about not only yourself - there are both quarterly and annual review processes, but also how others operate under pressure. The most challenging part of working at ANF is that things are constantly changing. This can be fun and exciting a lot of the time! However, it can also lead to burning people out. It is definitely a competitive, collaborative, and challenging work environment."
good,"While working at Abercrombie and Fitch, I familiarized myself with current trends in the fashion industry to successfully interpret to customers. I would work  with customers individually to conceptualize their own personal style and helped them recognize how to best assemble a wardrobe that suited their style. "
good,"A&F was once a company that had a strong handle on its customer, as well as its employee.  The company is losing its connection to both.  Enjoyed my peer group but Sr. Management failed to encourage and utilize the ideas of it's field managers."
good,Learned all aspects of business management in multiple locations in Illinois and Germany.
good,"I learned to be courteous and helpful to customers and greet them with a smile. Sometimes management was confusing because there were two main managers, an assistant manager, and a manager in training. So you had 4 people telling you different things.They were pretty laid-back so it wasn't too much of a hassle sometimes. My coworkers were very friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job was working the cash register. The most enjoyable part was folding clothes, greeting people, and helping them find what ever they needed."
good,Abercrombie was a very fun place to work through out high school. It was a good experience to work in retail and inventory.
good,"I left with valuable knowledge of management skills, how to deal with employees, and how to maintain business reports."
good,"A very social place with coworkers that are easy to get along with."
good,"simple job folding clothes, loss prevention, wear the brand"
good,"I got hired at abercrombie&fitch in January. It's February and so far I have only worked there TWICE. This place is horrible. This is my first ever real job and I hate it. I'm available every single day to work and they never gave me enough hours. All they ever give me are call in shifts, whenever I called, they never needed me. I only had TWO regular shifts. I'm so furious with the way this company works. I was so happy when I got hired but the managers always gave me the same excuse about how they won't give me many hours because there's too much associates. It's ridiculous."
good,"a typical work day mainly consists of proving customer service and keeping up with the tidiness of the store. although this is mainly a first-time job, I have gained a lot of valuable experience. such experience I have received would be cash handling, providing customer service, auditing, being able to multitask, and promoting sales. The management consist of young individuals which are not much older than myself. I personally do not mind being managed by people of around my age because they are much more understanding and can be fun to work with. My co-workers also positively influence my work experience because they make working there more exiting knowing that I will have friends at work. "
good,"The biggest priority for A&F is hiring good looking people. In fact, District Managers were required to take pictures of all of their Manager In Training hires and send them to their Regional Managers.  That being said, working with a bunch of fun, outgoing and good looking people is a lot of fun, but that's one of the only positives of working for this company. The company continues to close stores in the U.S. and really pushes for managers to go international, so for someone who embraces change and can leave everything behind for 2+ years, it is a good company to work for. Abercrombie also started giving District Managers more stores, where they use to manage 3-5 stores and now manage 6-9 stores, making it hard to stay connected with all management teams. District Managers work M-F and can usually make their own schedule, which is nice, but the pay is not that great. Tough to hire Managers-In-Training when the only offer a salary of $28k/year, regardless of any previous experience."
good,Very casual attire. Team work oriented environment.  Great place to work.
good,nothing stood out about this job. typical retail job. you fold clothes help customers and go home.
good,Was in charge of the human resources for the store. Every week I wrote a schedule for the 300 managers and employees that we had. I ensured that all weekly updates were scheduled adequately and that payroll was controlled. I created weekly recruiting schedules and followed up with all recruits. I conducted 2 weekly group interviews as well as one weekly group orientation. I ensured all new hire paper work and training were 100% up to date. The hardest part of the job was the short turnovers from shift to shift (working till 3am and then being back to work for 8am). The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with such a large staff.
good,A typical day at work involves me replenishing my sales floor with merchandise in good sizing for my customers to purchase. I also manage a team of approximately one hundred associates on a day to day basis and deal with HR concerns as well as training. I do interviews and recruit for my team as well as train these new associates to learn the merchandise systems requirements. I am in charge of specific projects like attendance and retaining associates.
good,"A good place for a first job. The people are cool and the environment is nice, but it becomes very fast-paced and overtime is unavoidable at times."
good,Greet customers and provide excellent customer service. Process and complete shipment. Produce inventory reports and audit merchandise to increase efficiency of sales. Manage and lead the impact team during a sales update or floor set change. The hardest part of this job was the early mornings and late nights schedule.
good,Every guideline is to give the customer an different experience unlike any other store.
good,"Folding clothes, dealing with messy average people, late nights are NOT overtime pay unless its over 8 hours"
good,"My coworkers were nice to work with, and the work was too bad. when we got busy it was hell on earth and we were al running around trying to get everything done. that was basically the only bad part, except the managers were lazy"
good,"Hours were flexible and training was adequate. Interactions with customers were positive. Merchandise stocking could become tedious, but it was a good experience."
good,"Working at Abercrombie & Fitch was a very tedious job. A typical day consisted of going through the stock room and gathering clothes to organize for the main store. I learned how to fold clothes in various patters while being on time. Management was a loving at times, but could show a harsh side at times. My co-workers were great because they helped tutor when I first started. The hardest part of the job was learning how to do all the various folds. The most enjoyable part was greeting customers."
good,"I was responsible for back room stocking, and customer service on the floor. I answer questions for customers, and assisted them with fashion selection."
good,"Abercrombie Models are an important part of the in-store experience and represent the brand through our personal style, customer service, and being able to maintaining high presentation standards. Responsibilities were multi-tasking, adaptability/flexibility, attention to detail, product knowledge, and customer focus. But we would have to just stand there and fold. It was pretty boring."
good,Overall this was a good job for me. It was flexible with my schedule but due to me going away to school I had a hard time keeping this job. It has a really positive feel.
good,A typical week at work includes:
good,"A typical day at work is coming in early in the morning around 7am trying to have a coffee for energy, get all my visual tools to go on the floor start fixing lights then the forms and walk through floor to make sure all is well before we open. Get better with customers by staying on floor until shift is over interacting with them and helping them out with purchases and sometimes being on cash register. Managers remind you to smile and greet customers to make them feel welcomed. The hardest part is standing up on your feet for almost 5hours straight without seating down and dealing with difficult customers but still manage to be polite, jolly and helpful. when you help a customer and they are really grateful and happy about the way you provide customer service and the smile they leave the store with means everything."
good,"In the morning times we would stock clothes, shoes and belts. the morning time was also for cleaning the store. I learned good customer service . how to assist customers . we had good co-workers and we worked well together as a team . the most enjoyable was giving good customer service and receiving good feed back from the customers that they received good service. the hardest part is when we are out of stock of a item and the store doesn't know when we will restock on that item."
good,Daily responsibilities as Lead Stock include:
good,"A typical day at work would be, making sure the sales floor is full, clean, and ready when the mall opens.I watch over the sales floor and direct associates on what their task is for the time they are their. I help maintain the sales floor to keep it shoppable for customers. Every week two days out of the week, i'm in charge of putting out new merchandise and changing the marketing to ensure the prices are correct. I also do some recruiting along with other managers from my store or around the area so we can have who want in the tore to represent the company. We teach new associates how to do registers and fold, and we make sure each customer gets the best customer service possible."
good,A typical day started out with team exercise to get us moving and an overview of workflow for the day.
good,"You manage a team of 40-90 late teens to early 20s that can be difficult to manage at time but the work can be fun at times but sometimes boring and somewhat too ""easy"""
good,"Abercrombie & Fitch is a fun place to work and the people are great, however the part time hours are inconsisent as you may work 25 hours one week and five the next week. If you're looking for a steady part time job Abercrombie is not the place for you but its a great second job if you want to earn a little money on the side. The job is only worthwhile is you are working there full time as they do have great benefits such as health, dental, 401ks and stock options avaiable to its managers and full time stock."
good,"A typical day at Abercrombie & Fitch would include clocking in at the register, changing into work dress code then going and standing at the folding table and folding clothes required to put out on the floor. Also I had to greet everyone that walked in with a friendly greeting that the store manager had picked out to say and give a friendly smile to every customer that came into the store. What I learned while working there was that it takes a lot to run a clothing store and the amount of people that shop there on a daily basis is unreal. The hardest part of working there had to be stocking the clothing shipment that came in every week. We would get up to 50 pound boxes full of clothes from our producer and would have to follow strict floor plans to place the correct clothes on display for the customers. As for the extra clothes that didn't fit on the floor we had to put them in the stock room upstairs. The stock room was organized according to style color season and girl/boy. Also it had to be folded a certain way so you could recognize what piece of clothing it was so if someone needed it they could find it in the least amount of time. The most enjoyable part of working at Abercrombie & Fitch was that the people that I worked with on a regular basis. They were very friendly and everyone got along for the most part. They were helpful if you needed something and if you couldn't work a day you were scheduled they had no problem covering for you and vise versea."
good,Great social environment and good for building retail experience in many facets. Not a lot for advancement.
good,very good place for getting some experience but the process for advancement is not what one that is a store manager is looking for
good,This jobs was cool as it was my first job. You get a 40% discount which was also a nice perk although the store is not a place as it becomes so redundant and not really worth it.
good,It was a good crew to work with some of the management team was pretty good at making everyone feel better about working when stressed. The scheduling could have been better but overall a good place to work
good,"Great environment & culture. I love the people I work with & I learned a lot. Great amount of PTO. However, the pay is extremely low. If you do not start out in their LDP program, there is little room for advancement, pay sucks, & managers will just tell you what you want to hear to get you to stay."
good,This store specifically isn't great. Hours are absolute trash. I was rarely scheduled to work. Some of the managers are cool but some aren't.  I was a seasonal hire and was told the team would keep me after the holidays but they didn't tell me until I called them myself that they weren't scheduling me anymore. I guess it's an okay job if you're in high school or you don't have the best hours but for me it wasn't great. There were a lot of things I wasn't trained on or if they did train me it was really quick and I didn't get a chance to practice. It was just a very strange place to work.
good,"Working at Abercrombie is a fun place to work in, especially when you don't have much experience in sales. I would recommend this job to anyone to get new work experience."
good,The work environment is excellent but it doesn't give you a weekly shift minimum. Sometimes I'm left without working for three weeks straight to only receive one four hour shift and then three jobless weeks later.
good,"It's a mall job. "
good,Worked at abecrombie for about a year! Made friends for life. I’m generally outgoing so making friends was easy in the environment they established there!
good,I have enjoyed working at Abercombie and Fitch because of the people I have met and having the ability to have a flexible schedule as well their benefits they provide are great!
good,i worked there 3rd shift. my manager was rude . i would fold and hang clothes and make sure everything was perfect for the next day when the store was ready to open. i did inventory check for my manager because he wouldn't feel like doing it himself.
good,"Abercrombie & Fitch is basically Retail-Store Associate for Beginners. It is a job where you can easily apply and schedule interviews with. Once you do get the job, you will be given some tasks by your store manager. Most of them are not that difficult, but mind you that there will be days where it's going to be super busy so you do not want to let your guard down. Team work is key when you are working in stores like this and when I worked there, all I needed to do is communicate with my co-workers and managers on what I should be doing. At the same time, you main task is to assist customers on what products they are interested in and handle returns. From this job, I was able to learn how to use various equipment and able to learn what its like to supervise a team in running a store. Co-workers were nice and calm, but I barely get to talk with them because I am focused on my tasks alone. However, the store had suffered some losses and was an easy target for shoplifters and so my duty was to keep an eye out on the products the store sells and be on the lookout for any shady activity. It was my first time working at a store, and now (at the time of writing this review), I would like to look for more jobs like this so that I can be able to learn how to manage my own store."
good,great time overall the associates/co-workers are fun to work with making your time there worth it. The managers help provide great training and accommodate your time off if needed.
good,"Depending on the time of year, the work environment was either very slow or very fast paced. I was a model so all I really did there was stand in the front of the store and greet customers all day with a consistent flow of cologne being sprayed next to me in the store every 10 minutes. I do not recommend applying to be a model at this store unless you don't care that you are basically doing nothing all day and stinking of Abercrombie and Fitch fragrance."
good,They over hire and their managing is fine but the work environment wasn't always the nicest.They always need more patience and a bit more decorum with their clients and employees. But overall it's not the worst.
good,"It is a place to grow if you're in a managerial position and willing to relocate.It also has a fun work environment as well! If you like fashion, are a leader and are strong at customer service you will thrive here."
good,"Molto giovanile e piacevole."
good,its a fun work place the only thing that upsets most of the employees its the 7.25 pay rate and they only schedule everyone 3 days a week to work. But overall the managers are very friendly and kind
good,"I was a stylist then a model at Abercrombie&Fitch London Flagship store. Part-time, 4hr shifts. "
good,it was my first job so i genuinely didn't know what to expect. I enjoyed the job itself but the hours available were close to none. The scheduling was so weird. either you would have a full schedule or you would have 1-2 shifts a week MAYBE. There was no real gray area.
good,"A&F was a decent job for a teenager or someone with limited work experience. The work was easy and the management was professional, friendly, and accommodating."
good,"only good thing was the paid breaks, i was paid incorrectly an it was not handled.. it is just a seasonal job an a lot of the workers tell you one thing an the information is incorrect."
good,"Working at Abercrombie as an hourly employee was a great first job experience: the people were exceptional, however, that may have been a side effect of the fantastic manager I had. Raises were nonexistent, but the work was fairly straightforward. Overall a good first job."
good,A lot of work when the money isn't matching the work load. Fun when working with certain people but management is cool especially with certain dress code.
good,"typical manager shifts were 8 hours each day, learned how to be business minded, became a leader, learned how to plan and excute and justify any moves in store, hard part of job finding that work/home balance."
good,The days sometimes went by really slow or either really fast. The customers were nice. Management was great. Their wasn't really a hard part about the job. Got off exactly when you are scheduled.
good,"During the period of time I have been at Abercrombie, I have overvall enjoyed working there. The co-workers are always around the same age as I am. We work well together. However, management is sometimes clueless about what's going on in the store. Management would also exaggerate nasty reviews left online."
good,Its a good place to have your first job. It has flexible hours and you can get discounts on the clothes. I learned how to up sale some of the stores products and how to make the customer feel welcome and satisfied with my help. The managers I had where really nice and patient making it easier for everyone to ask for help when they needed so. I learned how to be a great sales person which is great.
good,"Due to the detailed 10 week management training process they provide, I feel this is a wonderful way to start the management career. Working with a younger staff, you have plenty of opportunities to help shape young minds, and watch them grow into professionals."
good,Customer engagement and being a brand ambassador for the company. Store front standards as well as personal appearance were the main objectives for the company. I understood how challenging customers can be and how to overcome difficult situations in sales. My managers were dedicated individuals who worked hard to run their business and always went above expectations. The most challenging aspect was how to defuse disgruntled customers and how to turn their experience from negative into a positive one. My favorite part about my time with A and F was being with a brand that all of my friends loved and how retail has been such a huge part of my job/life experience.
good,"I have an ongoing contract with A&F with a non-disclosure clause still in effect.  Thus, it would not be appropriate for me to disparage the company in any way and I would not choose to do that in any case. .  Having said that, there was much to admire about how the company was being managed when I arrived to help it successfully spin-off from L Brands (formerly The Limited.,"
good,It's a very good job to learn about management right out of college. The environment is very laid back and you'll typically be working with younger/college kids. The only drawback is how ambiguous the promotional process is.
good,"For me this place was ridiculously fun, the environment was very comforting. My biggest problem was just the pay, while we would sell ridiculous amount of items. nonetheless it was extremely fun working there the customers were great and so diverse."
good,"A&F has a great work life balance, benefits and treat employees very well. Only down fall is job security and very little communication with employees. Little room for advancement."
good,"great for high school students"
good,"Very flexible with your schedule, especially if you're a student. If your only available for 1 day a week they can absolutely work with that."
good,"The job is the warehouse life, you dig in and set yourself up. The hardest part is dealing with difficult times of the year as expectations reach their peak along with the work load meaning incredible strenuous activities for long parts of the day. I did enjoy the company as co-workers are some of the most diverse and energetic individuals on the face on the planet, there is a strong sense of teamwork. At the end of the day you have to keep a level head or else the general fatigue factor will wear you down more than anything else."
good,"As a whole, Abercrombie was a fun place to work. There was room for advanement within the company, and that trajectory could happen quickly if you worked hard."
good,"It was a good first job, but nothing more than a first job. The people were very nice to work with. This was my first experience in customer service."
good,"On a typical day, I was responsible for walking the floor and making sure everything was in its place. I also talked to the customers and asked if they need help. Sometimes I would be responsible for cashiering also. The management was professional and nice as well as coworkers."
good,The job was an okay part time job. The hours were horrible but the environment was fun. Overall I would not work again unless the hours were better.
good,"During my time, it seemed upper management always wanted more results with less resources. Could be very demanding at times but overall fun, laid back culture."
good,"This job was fun beginners job. I learned the basics of what it meant to work with others and to have a real paying job. I learned how to fold close and clean up after others. I learned how to manage fitting rooms, the stock room and the floor."
good,"Abercrombie Kids provides great opportunity in personal growth and important experiences you will in your future careers. "
good,"It was a good experience working here. I learned cashier skills and enhanced my people skills. You gain customer service skills. The hardest part of the job is the managers do not communicate well with the associates. They have a tendency to accidentally let you go"" as they put it, and not tell you."
good,"I had worked as a floor representative at different locations in two different cities. I really enjoyed working at the first location, but the second location wasn't as enjoyable. Management changes a lot. It is hard to adjust to each manager. Some managers know what they are doing and some don't care about their jobs. This is a good starting job out of high school. It is a place to make friends easily. This is a job where employees can really learn patience with customers, coworkers, and employees."
good,"Highly structured work environment.  Fast paced environment with customer service as a main focus. Managing staff of 80+, customer service, analyzing sales compared to LY and company plan, merchandising store with seasons latest trends."
good,"Reasonable work days, overly concerned management, Loud environment with reliable coworkers. Somewhat difficult customers and low pay compensation."
good,"This was a fun environment to work in. If you love fashion and customer relations, you would love this job. Store Models are responsible for making sales. Commission type of work is mandatory."
good,Coworkers were fun to work with.  The job gets boring very quickly.  Hardest part of the job are floor sets.  Management is not the best there.
good,"A typical day at work was very busy, learned how to handle money, co-workers were fun to be around. The hardest part of the job is working overtime till 3 a.m. The most enjoyable part is communicating with customers."
good,"New Brand Designers and Brand President so hopefully AF will see a positive change. Leading up to these changes, people have been pretty miserable. Almost every person with whom I worked was unhappy and wanted to leave. Unfortunately, some of those people were let go and were actually happy about it as they would prefer no job versus working for the company any longer. In my opinion, I would award AF for their great benefits, excellent pay, and opportunity to be promoted. (Promotions are not necessarily awarded to those who deserve it. Some people rise to the top and have no business being there)."
good,Working at Abercrombie & Fitch can be very bust at times and sometimes relaxing and slow. But working there overall is very different for me but fun.
good,"Work would be for a typical day interestingly designed. I've learned from working at Ambercrombie & Fitch that communication can progress a sale, as well networking skills can build a rapport with customers and management towards finding one's way through the job market."
good,"Typical work days were very slow and easy to handle. Holiday hours were by far the hardest working days and long hours. Management was great, they helped me understand the business fast. Co-workers were extremely friendly and helpful. We all worked as a team and always asked questions. Hardest part of the job was the smelling the men's Abercrombie's cologne. The most enjoyable part of the job was that is was a fun atmosphere and having a great time with co-workers while getting the job done."
good,"Its a good place to work people are nice, Its fun, I enjoyed the teamwork the positive energy. the managers are cool, but we are required to wear similar clothes to work their. I learned to be organized, responsible."
good,"Many advancement opportunities available upon successful completion of the Manager in Training Program and success in different areas of management. "
good,It was fun . I learned how to make great sales and make the customers feel welcome to the store.
good,"Good company, great work associates. Long wait list for advancement with poor hourly rates"
good,"A day at AnF goes by pretty quickly, co-workers are very friendly for the most part."
good,"This job is very flexible, however the only issue you may have is with certain managers. Some have a tendency of ignoring associates and abusing power. Not to an alarming extent, but it occurs here and there. Overall, it was a good experience."
good,i love this job but i wasn't for me because they didnt give enough Hours and i feel that i have to find something better
good,"Abercrombie has taught me a lot and one of the great things it has taught me is to be opening to different cultural backgrounds. In contrast, management was not fully there, meaning one of our managers were not loyal and was very untrustworthy.  The staff at Abercrombie besides the managers were hard working and dependable people I could count on for anything. The most enjoyable part of work was closing, in my opinion because we would have a blast. We could let loose knowing we did a great job on sales and just have fun because the day is over. The most challenging part of  work to me was just knowing how to work at an accurate pace. I am an extreme perfectionist so when I was told do a job I would not want to leave my station until I knew it looked perfect and spotless."
good,"I love working there, and I love my co-workers but the hours allocated is so limited."
good,"Promoted to Associate Designer in February 2013"
good,"arrivée 15 min en avance le temps de pointé et de se mettre en tenu réglementaire;"
good,"Duties such as managing a team of over 100 people, creating the weekly rota, recruiting, hiring training, dealing with customers enquiries, cash handling, interviewing, delegating, follow up, demand and provide the best service possible, reach and surpass our high standards and targets"
good,"early call time."
good,Abercrombie takes pride in the stores appearance and a usual overnight shift will consist of stocking all the shelves to capacity and neatly folded.
good,"I was a ""Model,"" so I pretty much just greeted people, folded clothes, and worked the register and fitting rooms. It was easy but did not pay much, and the dress code was fairly strict, so I spent a lot of the money earned on buying their clothes to wear to work. I also did not like having to call in an hour before the ""on call"" shifts and ask if I needed to come in or not. It would be nicer to have a set schedule so I know when I need to be in and when I can do other things with my time. Also an hour before is not always enough time to travel to work depending on one's mode of transportation, so the whole on call process is quite difficult to sustain unless you live nearby and have a car and a lot of free time. "
good,"Abercrombie is a pretty fun place to work, I worked with a really great group of people who became my friends. They have a great training program for new managers and all the promotions are from within. Every District and Regional manager started with the MIT program (manager in training). There are crazy days with a lot going on and slower days- it all depends on what time of year it is. The worst thing for me was not really getting weekends, it was difficult at times to balance my work and personal life. "
good,"Easy to get hired, harder to move income ranks. tough to work for a company that only hires based on physical appearance"
good,For someone coming straight out of college it was a good job to have. The work and life balance is not good. You are always there at work. You meet a lot of new people and have fun and make new friendships. It is very good experience!
good,"Working at Abercrombie you work in customer service, upkeep sales and organization, recording sales. The job is alright but it doesn't give a lot of hours! So, the hours is very flexible but if you want to work in an interactive community and like discounts on the store product then the job is for you!!!"
good,1. sometime have to finish five hours job in two hrs which s really a typical one
good,"I've learned the value of responsibility's taking affirmative action with great customer service skills. My Development was very relaxed & management was very Hectic. Co-workers were friendly, easy going, & fun to work with. Definitely respected all positions equally. Hardest part of the job was helping others correct their job, I respected my position & i knew what was needed & required* to get the job done. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to know my team on a personal yet friendly level & somewhat getting to socially know people from all different parts of the world. =)"
good,"Attached merchandise with proper security tags, and restocking to proper location."
good,"The hours are very flexible and there are a lot of employees there, so there is a good chance you can be successful in whatever you need to be doing while also holding down a job here. It's a great way to make some money in whatever time frame works for you."
good,"As a former stock associate at A&F it mainly consisted of unpacking boxes of new stock to place the security tags on the shirt to then place then on there correct shelf, and also take any clothes down that the sales associate would ask for on the radios."
good,"If you have a good DM & RM like I did, this job is really great. If you understand that working in retail isn't curing cancer, you'll enjoy it."
good,"I am leading a team in stockroom, Teaching my associates our daily sales goal, product knowledge and how to boost our sale with proper training of customer service. I keep high standard of organizing stockroom and  Remerchandising the sales floor."
good,"I was in College and Abercombie & Fitch was a really wonderful platform for me to study my craft and have a personality. I am big personality and it supported that as I worked as a cash rep. However, I think they were limited in the image for what is an American audience but I think they have evolved within the time I was there."
good,"I worked as a part-time seasonal brand representative for a year, and the position was perfect for earning additional cash. I recommend for anyone seeking flexible hours."
good,Lo aprendido de trabajar ahí fue a hacer las cosas bien y a ser ordenado y tener mucha limpieza
good,"The company is going through a transition at the moment. Adapting to the needs of its customers has been a setback through the years due to images of its models and 'ideal' clientele. However, the company is doing its best to move towards diversity and embracing different cultures."
good,"Depends on your boss and coworkers, and how much you like to mindlessly fold clothes. It wasn't bad. It was a fine entry level job. But I would NOT want to have this job any age over 20. It was just a part time. "
good,"good company to work for, ANF is an amazing place to work, great culture, integrity, amazing architecture and food! The new leaders are great, driven to make this place a great place to work! The work environment is super positive, and fun, I work in design and I am enjoying coming to work every day! Associates are young and so talented, I feel Lucky to be part of this experience!"
good,"The Abercrombie & Fitch job was a comfortable job while in college, however there is not much room to expand career opportunities. It is fun to work there, but not rewarding."
good,"Minimum wage, must work all holidays and weekends. We get the same discount that anyone that walks through the door, so no real perks in terms of discount."
good,"Al contrario que en mi trabajo anterior, en este caso el trabajo en equipo es primordial. "
good,During holidays you would have to work 10-12 hours. You didn't get to spend a lot of time with family during the holidays because you were working so much. It was especially inconvenient trying to take vacation days.
good,"The people were great to work with, very friendly, with a fast paced environment. There was always something to do but everyone helped out in some way to make things run smoothly."
good,"Getting paid 7.25 an hour was not worth all the effort, calling in, and running around the store. my co-workers did not participate. also staying until 5am to do store updates is ridiculous."
good,"the job was fairly easy, it was a non-stressful job that didn't take a lot of effort. for the most part all I did was open shipment boxes and would tag them and either out them in back stock or out of the floor."
good,"Being a part of the Abercrombie team was great when it came to the culture of the brand but stressful when it came to requested time off and weekends off. Also, being in the small store for 8+ hours was draining."
good,"learned product knowledge, sales skills, build relationships with customers, young energetic environment, high volume of seasonal customers, theft prevention techniques, business integrity"
good,"The management is very accomadating in giving as many hours as possible to all their employees. Unfortunately, as I believe comes with all large corporate retail jobs, there were a large number of staff, so being able to consistenly work was difficult. Shifts were typically no longer than five hours, but store managers typically worked longer."
good,"A typical day at work mainly has to do with the associates you hire and train, the better you train them, the easier your job will be. I am always learning something new every day, whether it be how to deal with customers or how to drive business and make more money. They give us a detailed guideline of what needs to be done for the day and a business plan on how much they expect us to sell. Quarterly bonus incentives are what gives me my drive to make sure associates are giving the best customer service and selling more clothing. It is a pretty laid back job and having a good store manager who cares about assistant managers and their associates are the key to having a more productive and fun environment. An assistant manager here is basically a glorified associate with more responsibilities and a tiny pay bump."
good,"This job was only seasonal for me so I worked from December to January and the managers didn't care to have my help and the other employees were as excited to be there as they were to jump of a cliff. The job wasn't hard, just boring and the managers couldn't have cared less about the seasonal workers."
good,it was a fast paced working environment that taught me a lot of tools with handling things behind the scenes so they function once out on the floor. Had the chance to learn along side the CEO and to teach all the district managers and regional mangers on dressing forms
good,"It is a fun work environment. You get to learn a lot about great customer service, so this might be a great first job if you want a future in sales. The only thing is that they are not flexible with their schedules. I probably work 1 to 2 days a week that most of the time interferes with my school schedule and management doesn't really care."
good,"A typical day at work was great, there was lots of good energy from everybody although not everybody was acquainted with one another so it would sometimes be a mystery about whom you were working with. I learned how to handle money and clothing better. Management would help you out a lot when you didn't know how to do something, although they wouldn't give everyone good hours. The hardest part of the job was definitely working overnight stock because it was hard to stay awake. The most enjoyable part was working with costumers because I love being a help to people."
good,"Abercrombie and Fitch teaches you how to interact with all types of people, whether it being employees or customers. While working there, your co-workers become your friends and makes the workplace more enjoyable."
good,"It was nice working for Abercrombie & Fitch. They had an easy-going work environment, people were very friendly. The work hours were flexible and you could ask someone else to take over shifts when needed. The drawback is that the salary was minimum wage and there were no opportunities to advance in the company."
good,"I was a manager in training and it's so so hard to be a manager.  I had not experience being a manager but it was hard.  I often worked a lot of over time and got out super late and that's the only reason I left.  i'm not a night person.  But everyone there is super nice and cool.  I loved my employees, super sweet young people.  My managers above me were predominantly super nice and encouraging.  It was really nice"
good,"This job is more for someone looking for a part-time job that works twice a week. The pay was not good at all. I did think it was fun to work here, personally I love interacting with people and love attention. Hardest part about this job was the shop lifters. There is a lot of theft in this store, you have to keep an eye out 24/7."
good,"Pretty easy retail job, laid back. Simple tasks, sometimes stressful due to managers, but for the most part, pretty laid back."
good,I enjoyed working as an entry level manager. I learned a lot about retail and customer service. The training program is well rounded.
good,"expecting more work and pay less, lack of management, too much gossip in company. district managers and store managers are not trust-able and take advantage of employees."
good,"Everyday is a new challenge. I gained a lot of leadership experience and it was a great opportunity to grow as a leader in a company. Long hours during holidays, which doesn't allow for a balance with work and life. Overall, I learned a lot growing with the company and will be able to bring that to other companies."
good,"A typical day at work is busy depending on the time and day. I learned how to work on the register, stay organized, and stay focused. The hardest part of my job is cleaning up the fitting rooms. The most enjoyable is working at the cash register."
good,"A typical work day can vary. Some days are more laid back where it is simply working on the presentation of the store and giving the best customer experience possible. I've learned that working in retail has given me the patience when dealing with unsatisfied customers. I've learned that I have emerged into a great leader for my store. I was able to run the store as the only manager for a week and a half. Our district has finally stabilized with a new district manager. I believe that the entire corporation has great potential, but only if the company did a clean out of all the high up people who work at the home office. Most of my co-workers and I have developed strong, positive relationships. Any co-workers that I have struggled to agree with, I have learned a bunch from getting to know them and created an environment to work well within.The hardest part of the job was finding motivation as of late, but by setting myself goals, it has helped me go into work with a positive attitude on a daily basis. The most enjoyable part of job was gaining the management experience and working with a great, diverse group of people."
good,"Well typical day at work was very good. you get to meet new people, show them respect, and if they need help with any purchase or need a bigger or smaller size in pants or shorts then we can look in the back stock room. I learned how to respect others and how to learn when people know what they try to steal at work especially if they act very suspicious around others. The co-workers at work are very nice never rude also we work together when it comes to having a full store of people coming in and out. The hardest part about it is when it comes in having big specials and retailers wants to come in and start buying all the shirts and also making a mess. the most enjoyable part of the job is closing we get to relax and fold clothes and listen to our own music or talk about how better we can get in making our job more safe."
good,"Working at Abercrombie and fitch was a fun experience meet alot of nice people. a typical day at work was assisting customers, cleaning and organizing, cash register , and answering customers questions"
good,Working at Abercrombie was a good part time job where someone can work if they needed a flexible schedule before they started cutting hours. You work with good people and you are given fair tasks that you should be able to complete before the end of your shift.
good,a and f is not bad to work at at all. the pay does suck but its also a fun environment. theres no one thats going to boss you around.
good,"Helping customers, assisting customers in fitting room, cash register, etc.  Management and coworkers, are kind and helpful."
good,"Working for A&F was a good learning experience. The MIT program was very thorough, but you learn most stuff hands on. Most of my co-workers and associates were great with the exception of a few managers who acted like they were in high school. Pay is decent for someone straight out of college. Decent benefits. Can be stressful if you work in a high volume store and/or are understaffed. Visits from RMs, AP, and anyone else from Home Office were the worst. Management would spend days and nights trying to create an illusion for a 10-15 minute visit where the director or RM would say something about your ""good looking"" model, or sometimes not so good looking model. My least favorite part of the job was having to recruit ""good looking"" people. Those usually tended to be the people who didn't care about their jobs at all, rather than hiring someone who actually wanted to work but didn't fit the abercrombie ""look"". If you are good looking and work hard, you can probably get promoted to store manager relatively quickly. There's a lot of opportunity for people who actually like this company."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of a manager meeting first thing at the start of my shift. Then after we discussed the shrinkage (theft), I would make it to my station (mens, women's, cashier, etc.) Here I learned responsibility for the product. It was my mission to make sure the floor was neat and organized, and that I tend to anyone in need, especially suspected shoplifters. It was because of this I learned how to approach uncomfortable situations with caution and patience, never jumping to make a wrong assumption was a key lesson we were taught. "
good,"Learned:"
good,"It's a great place to work at if you are a college student. Some people had a hard time getting hours but if you're a good employee you should have no problem getting 15-25 hours a week, based on my experience. Really social job enviornment. Once you get your degree you can move up to assistant manager if you've done a good job."
good,"A typical day at Abercrombie and Fitch includes a high energy atmosphere and treating customers with top notch customer service. As a manager, I was expected to maintain company standards by recruiting the best employees that I could find to represent the image of the brand. I also monitored payroll, incoming and outgoing shipment as well as keeping constant watch of inventory.  I learned a lot from my years there. I learned how to manage a large number of people as well as how to run an efficient business. "
good,great co workers and great discounts. fun atmosphere. management wasn't that great.
good,"A typical day working at Abercrombie and Fitch would be coming in sign in then checking with whomever is your manager for a 5 minute meeting and for you daily assignment. Within this assignment their may be some changes and or multiple assignments within that day. "
good,"Learning management of part-time associates and business operations of a multi-million dollar company."
good,"A typical day at work starts with 20 min of paperwork, opening registers, and a morning voicemail to the district manager. Opening the store entails turning on the store's music system and opening the front doors. The most stressful part of the day is dealing with customers who may or may not destroy stacks of perfectly stacked merchandise and/or steal hundreds of dollars worth of merchandise. Another stressful part of the job is not having the freedom to take certain days off without affecting other managers' schedules - many days, only two managers work (one opens and one closes). A manager's experience will be greatly affected by the relationship he has with his district manager. The best part of the job is watching things go smoothly and leaving work knowing that you did a great job. "
good,Your typical day will consist of maintaining and monitoring employees in compliance with your daily clipboard of tasks. These tasks fill your entire day start to finish and must be signed off on. Management is pretty fluid with turnover so longtime relationships are somewhat rare. Co-workers are the best part of the job and make the workday fun on even the worst days.
good,"Excellent place to work. I had so much fun with everyone! It's a great environment, a great part-time job for a college kid who just needs a little extra money."
good,"A typical day at work consist of making sure the store is well stock and neat. Receiving and stocking merchandise in the warehouse. I've learned many important skills for stocking merchandise from a vendor such as, purchase order, receiving report and how to read the vendor invoice.Management was pleased with the way I performed my work and never had any complaints from them. My co-workers loved to work with me because I motivated them to keep a positive attitude about work."
good,"I was responsible for greeting customers, product placement, and register. I learned that soft skills are just as important, if not more so, than hard skills. This was a great part time job that I did while doing both a bachelors in International Business at Cal Poly and a Masters Certification in Lean Blackbelt Six Sigma."
good,Great chance at learning how to work in retail. Since I love fashion the job was very entertaining and educational. I enjoyed training to be lead stock before store closed for business.
good,It is a good place to work for your first job. The mangers are nice and the other sales people are easy to get along with.
good,Working as an Assistant Manager had its obstacles but having a challenge is what made me feel more appreciated and accomplished each day. With great employers and Management A&F rewarded me with excellent experience.
good,Hours vary depending on how much management likes you. They cut a lot of hours so it was only ever 1 part time worker and 1 manager on at a time. During busy hours this got stressful since we could not be helping every customer at once.
good,"While it's a great job for management experience right after college, it has a terrible company culture. Recruitment is all about numbers, not about quality or proper training. If someone is more attractive, then they are likely to be hired and scheduled more frequently; regardless of their work ethic. I would have preferred to focus on training and working with those who wanted to work hard and make the customer experience great, rather than the college student who just got the job on looks. Not the mention, they lie in the interview about purchasing clothes from the store. You are expected to purchase the merchandised to advertise while on the job."
good,"I used to work at Abercrombie when I was in high school. At the time, I liked it. I was constantly on my feet making sure the store was neat and the items in the store were accounted for. Management was relaxed, but still managed to get work done. I really enjoyed how comfortable everyone was with each other."
good,"The brand is very popular, but the constant changes they keep on doing, is definitely taking a negative effect. The company does have potential, but they are overseeing the things they actually have to work on."
good,"Hours are skill based, meaning you MUST show them that you are hardworking and have no problem grasping an unfamiliar task"
good,"was my first job at 18 and stayed foe 3 years. I loved working here, learned how to work a register , folding and costumer service. We were one big family"
good,i work at the beachwood and they don't give you enough hours. other than that they are willing work with your schedule bur always let them know ahead of time
good,"Assistant manager for store in Boca Raton,FL.  I learned basically all the operations of running a store and maintaining great employee relations.  The opportunity for growth was defiantly available."
good,People are great to work with on a daily basis. Work as team and always taking to time to help others when needed. Good atmosphere for meeting new people and forming great working relationships with.
good,"A typical day at Abercrombie is pretty chill during the week. What I've learned while working there is dealing with shipment, stocking items, putting out new displays of clothing, recruiting, cashier duties, etc. The managers are very good at what they do. Some co workers can be lazy and sometimes not care to learn new things. The hardest part of the job would sometimes be dealing with rude customers, and the best part of the job would be just learning something new everyday i go to work there."
good,"Colleghi fantastici, ambiente di lavoro stimolante."
good,"Moved to the area and found the ad in the paper, applied for the job and they called me the same day. Interviewed me and I did not find out the job was seasonal till after they hired me. "
good,"A very stress free work environment. An assistant manager's day consists of helping customers find clothing, keeping the sales floor stocked, and building relationships with staff. Upper management is very laid back and easy to approach. The most difficult part of the job is working with other store managers that are lazy and impede your productivity. Overall I would recommend this job to any college graduate that is looking for a position that does not have any responsibilities other than showing up on time."
good,"Abercrombie is a company that offers a lot of experience, and has an open work environment. It is making changes but it is too little too soon."
good,"The company is a good place to start for your career, but not the route for everyone to take. I learned how to more effectively serve customers and give great feedback to employees. The hours are as to be expected in retail- days, nights, weekends and of course holidays. My co-workers were always friendly and corporate always expects you to hit quarterly numbers with great customer service. The hardest part of the job is how to tell your DM and RM that sales are down due to low traffic- without saying that low traffic is the reason! I enjoyed my co-workers and SOME of my DM's."
good,"My first time volunteering was both a fun experience and draining experience. I learned how to take the temperature of a dog, check their vital signs, work quickly, and protect myself. The management was poor. Majority were volunteers so we weren't always sure what to do and the manager always had tasks to complete, like saving an animal who was having a seizure. The other volunteers were very nice and easy to talk to. We were all getting along and getting things done. The hardest part of the job was bringing the sedated animals back to life because sometimes they would go into shock or be completely scared and attack. I watched a pit bull attack one of the managers and that was nerve-racking. The most enjoyable part was being with my friends and knowing that I was saving a life, even if it was an animals."
good,"A typical day at work was easy that people was lovely and helped when ever I needed it. I learned how to use a couple different scanners, how to load the trucks that was mostly it. The management and co-workers were lovely people. The hardest thing about the job was the hours. The enjoyable part of the job was the people there was some great people there."
good,With Abercrombie & Fitch I learned a lot about attention to detail through producing perfect presentations for customers. Here I also enjoyed working with staff to become a warehouse lead and understanding what it takes to be a successful manager. Only down fall to working here was that there is now room to advance to any higher position for long amounts of time but it's a great job to have if your in high school or college.
good,This company is very unique in its own way. They have a bunch of inexperience individuals that work for them because they look like models. I think the company is successful in marketing but high in external theft.
good,"Typical day of work as a (model) - sales associate:"
good,"Company values and culture are a high focus and priority among associates of all levels, inclusive environment and communication, and advancement/alternative avenues throughout company. Typical day at work didn't focus so much on managing people because of high turnover but rather presenting a visually appealing atmosphere for customers. High brand emphasis is a development/training focus because of the customer they would like to attract. Focus on recruiting was daily aspect of position, often venturing out into the city to discover new talent. Most difficult part of job was work/life balance as they unfairly punished hourly assistant and store managers for working overtime (over 40 hrs/wk) with half hourly pay for each additional hour but position often required 45-50 hours a week to successfully attain company standards and expectations. Most enjoyable part of the job were the individuals I worked with in management, all intelligent, career-focused."
good,"A typical day at work"
good,"A typical day at work would consist of just folding clothes and running them out on the sales floor with sometimes helping out customers. Management would be good for the most part, hours are scarce to come by with usually only one day of work a week. Co-workers would be helpful and friendly, never encountered any type of problems with them. The hardest part of the job would definitely be trying to get hours. The most enjoyable part would be the fact that it is stress and drama free. Co-workers go about their business and don't bring personal problems with to work. What I've learned from this job is how to fold and store my own clothes faster."
good,"Fun place to work when you're just out of college, but gets exhaustining dealing with the part-time employees."
good,Some days were very slow and boring. Everything had to be displayed a particular way and the dress code was very strict. My co-workers made it fun but there were always dull days. I didn't learn a lot from this store besides how to neatly fold jeans and shirts.
good,my co-workers where very positive at there jobs. I learned how to back stock and fold correctly. 
good,I would be in charge of budgeting and managing a weekly schedule.  I learned how to manage people.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with irate customers. 
good,"its a diferent job, you do not have that much things to, just make sure that the shop is always in the highest standard. i learned many visual things as changing bulbs, create testers and marketing. the best thing there are the colleagues, they are very friendly."
good,"Working at Abercrombie & Fitch was really fun, the most enjoyable part of the job was helping people with trying to find the clothes that they were looking for."
good,"The focus is on store experience. Great people, fun, young. Opportunity for growth is good. Plenty of opportunity to go abroad. Good benefits"
good,"Overall, my experience with the company was positive. Unfortunately, the location at which I worked was in a less than great area, which definitely had a large impact on my time there. When you work in retail, the store location plays a large part in your job experience, so working right outside of Philadelphia and Camden was rough. I covered some shifts at a much smaller mall and had a way better time there. Pretty much 80% of my negative experiences working here had nothing to do with the company and more with the job itself. Retail just isn't for me, especailly in a mall store setting."
good,"My typical day at work required little challenge. I want a job that encourages you to advance and learn. Overall, I learned customer service, how to manage my time, and how to work the cash register. The management was well organized and the workplace culture was very fun. The hardest part of the job was keeping a lookout for theft. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with people my age (collegians)."
good,"Tips"
good,"pay is not to great not barely good of a employee discount,good team work not enough encouragement from management. pay sucks long shift hours, felt like a slave"
good,"Fun place to work, but little room for advancement. It's a typical retail job - got my resume started. Had a lot of fun and met a lot of great people."
good,"Working retail can be a drag like environment at times, this location tries to make it as home like experience as possible."
good,Abercrombie is a nice little company to work for. Its a busy company not quite fare with its hours. Some employees work little hours and can go unscheduled for about 2 weeks. I say this is a job suited for clothing benefit purposes.
good,The manager is not motivational neither does she provides a positive work environment. Also the discount is not that great and the benefits for the work you do is not worth it.
good,Loved the diverse culture of employees that worked at Abercrombie and finch.pay was good and cafeteria food wasn't that bad either.I worked in the packing Department a multi- pack.the hourly incentive was awesome are my co-workers were easy to get along with management was respectful and very courteous understanding. Work hours we're good 10 to 12 hour shifts
good,"Always a fun work place to be around."
good,"Abercrombie and Fitch has provided me with great skills and knowledge about managing a high volume retail store.  While a typical day includes making decisions that increase sales including re-merchandising the sales-floor it also entails creating game plans to further develop my assistant managers.  I have learned how to identify and recruit great candidates to further build my management and part-time team.  The greatest skill I have learned with this company is the importance of keeping a level head in stressful situations.  Maintaining a calm and collected attitude during high stress times would have to be the hardest part of the job.  Specifically speaking, on Memorial Day of last year we had our computer system crash for almost two hours.  We had to resort to pulling paper USR's and manual charge drafts for customers all while making over 3,000 dollars an hour.  Some of my best friends to date are other managers I have met over my past two years with Abercrombie.  This job produces great people and every co worker I have had is hard working with excellent personalities.  I cherish the memories I have made with some of them for that is the most enjoyable part of the job.  It is a rare thing to go to work every day with people of the same age group and relevant interests and for that I thank Abercrombie."
good,Only allowed to hire employees who fit the Abercrombie look. Forces you to be very judgmental towards everyone. All about numbers and how much volume goes into and out of the store.
good,"Hard work, learned tons of management experience, thoroughly trained. The hours were really tough and you feel a lot of pressure from upper management. Extremely detail oriented, however, you learn a lot. You juggle a lot at once."
good,"I worked in the Hollister Co. division on the Betties (women's) denim team. I really enjoyed my team members and could not have asked for a more supportive and encouraging supervisor. I was able to form a better understanding of corporate fashion with a very particular brand image---what it means to mass produce a product globally with a specific identity. My daily tasks included mocking up samples, updating tech packs, researching inspiration imagery for the next season's mood boards, and writing a bi-weekly fit report to the denim team after a new factory sample was brought in. I enjoyed the steady rhythm and felt as though every process (design and technical) was organized very well."
good,"In a typical day at work, I stand at the table or the cash register. If I am at the table I will have to maintain my section and make sure it is clean. Abercrombie is very strict on folding and they want you to use the folding board to fold everything to ensure that it is done right. When you're at the table you also have to say hello and goodbye to everyone who leaves and enters the store. The co-workers were very funny and friendly. The hardest part of the job would be folding to Abercrombie's standards. The enjoyable part is being able to wear their clothes"
good,"meeting cultures ,nationality company products and service provided by Abercrombie & fitch"
good,"A typical day at work for me is after opening the store and giving my associates their 5 minute meetings, I have to blast the music and prepare for a busy day. Once those gates open people from all over the globe come into A&F and they are excited. Customers are speaking all types of languages and because I only speak English, it can be frustrating at times. Luckily my staff of associates are very divers and speak most of the languages. I have a staff of 160 associates that I manage and three other managers I work along with. Depending on which store I work at, my staff goals and managers may vary. What I mean by that is not only do I run A&F but I run Hollister, Gilly Hicks, and a&f kids, depending on if I'm needed. So I see a'lot of different personalities. To be honest, not one part of my job is hard. I love the environment of the work place and I love communicating with people from different countries. You can learn a'lot about different places of the world by simply conversing with people from those origins."
good,A typical day at work consists of creating the best possible shopping experience for customers and reduce the loss of merchandise. Help merchandize the store and create relevant store design to maximize the experience of customers. The management makes the working environment fun and energetic along with making fellow co-workers energetic.
good,- A typical day would be folding clothes and helping customers
good,"Enjoyed the job, met a lot of cool nice people, but something just didn't feel right, they only want to make the company look good by getting good looking people."
good,"• Promote the brand and manage all aspects of a store including presentation, recruiting, leadership and store operations standards"
good,"Same as above , but it’s an enjoyable job otherwise. Build relationships with your coworkers and customers. You’re able to create your schedule based off your availability."
good,"I started working right when I turned 18 (3 years ago). I didn't get scheduled too many hours at first but as I gained experience and got a hang of things my hours increased. If you were a good, hard worker and independent, the management noticed and would schedule you accordingly. Nowadays we schedule everyone a bit more evenly (which is good for some) but there aren't really any sort of standards anymore. If you're good at your job and don't need to be told what to do it mostly goes unnoticed. If you suck at it, it'll be noticed but nothing will happen. Unless you're stealing from the company or just don't show up, chances are you'll keep your job until you decide to quit. Personally I think it was a better place to work when I started because everyone was pretty much a veteran and knew the drill. Now it seems every week we have new people and with it being summer, we've been very busy and no one is training the new people therefore lowering the standards for worth ethic. The managers are very flexible and understanding with scheduling in advance or if you're unable to make it in that day (family emergency etc) but some people have been taking advantage of that. Overall it's a good place to start if this is your first job or you just need a part time job that's easy and flexible with your schedule but it's not a place to be at for more than a year or 2. We've even had multiple foreign students work under their visas while attending school. The company has been very diverse since I've started working there."
good,A typical day at work included myself greeting people at the entrance of the store and working at the cash register. I learned that working your hardest at all times really catches peoples attention and is simply a great trait to apply to all workplaces. My co workers were also great friends and great workers. They set a great example when I worked their and were very professional. The hardest part of the job was just getting used to a professional workplace in the beginning because it was one of my first real jobs. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with people who I really liked and looking back at the end of the work day knowing I worked my hardest which is the most satisfying feeling for me.
good,"Not a job you can survive off of, it just a job for part-time for college student not looking to make much money. Not much hours."
good,"all around a decent job, they just had to many bosses with different ways of doing the same jobs. none of them would get together to give you the right answer to do anything. had to take a guess and when it was wrong they let you know. when I had a problem with a co-worker they did not do anything about it so I gave them my 2 weeks notice."
good,"Working for A&F is great opportunity to expanding personality and experiences. Some of the responsibilities are greeting customers and assigning their needs in the store such as folding and steaming clothes ,Selling store merchandise including fragrances,accessories  and assisting customers with online orders. What learned from A&F is patience and efficient. Some of positions I was sales representative and cashier Also working environment is very diverse with different cultures and beliefs.The hardest part of job was not enough hours not enough pay  and short breaks  but ,most enjoyable time was greeting customers with a warm smile and providing  a great impression making new friends along the way."
good,A typical day at Abercrombie consisted of me helping customers with purchasing clothing.
good,"Keep security tight because theres always customers stealing, Keep busy, Always help customers, show your face, don't stay behind the register 24/7, & Keep customers coming"
good,I was a model at Abercrombie and I valued what was taught to me here. I was not really into this job but I still take the knowledge gained at this job to other jobs. Such as Customer service and organization skills.
good,"I use to come in and we had to read a motto for today and memorize it, if we didn't we didn't start work until we do. We have a short meeting in the mornings. Then I would go to the stockroom, put away shipment, replenish the sales floor with needed merchandise, and do inventory if needed. I learned how to use my skills within a different work place. The management was horrible. It was more like kids running the company. My co-workers, was awesome people to work with overall. The hardest part of the job, was working only 2 days a week and just being on call, you wasn't really on the schedule to much, which was why I found it very hard to enjoy. The enjoyable part was the atmosphere of the place."
good,Had to work with people of all ethnicity and culture background a lot of customer service and organization needed for this job also had to be fluent in Spanish and English to help customers.
good,"I would not recommend working here. There is ZERO guidance from supervisors and fellow workers. Colleagues were very judgmental of new recruits and customers. They have a very immature business atmosphere. However, I was able to learn on the job, and adhere to their OCD ways of setting up the store, to the point where they wanted to give me more and more hours just after two weeks. It was a work environment that required you to learn quick and execute with perfection, because if you didn't, you only got 3 hour shifts a weekend. After my third week there, I was already a preferred worker for scheduling, which not a lot of the workers would be able to say that as a part timer. Hardest part of the job was adhering to the OCD folding and placement of items, because even though you would do it right, if the manager was in a bad mood, they would just knock the entire thing over, and make you start anew, but with this type of management, I learned patience, and understanding, because one must always keep in mind that everyone is dealing with something, and we don't always understand what is going on with them, so instead of getting angry or frustrated, I would just do it again."
good,"I probably wouldn’t apply there again"
good,"I've worked in retail before, but have experienced nothing like A&F. For starters I got the job in literally 20minutes. I came in for an interview and they asked me if I wanted to start the next day for orientation. I was floored because they knew so little about me, but really happy to get a job. When I started they really didn't give much more orientation they just told me to stay in the back clearance sections and get things looking nice. Little did I know I knew nothing like the proper fold or where the dressing room key was. They kept telling me things about the job along the way. I eventually started working in the front of the store where you just greet people mainly and watch to see if people don't steal. It's a very simple job. "
good,"At the time, I did not have a degree, so the furthest I could get in this company was the ""Stock lead."" The job was rewarding, but hard work. I had no problems with my coworkers or those that I managed and upper management was usually laid back and handled situations well."
good,"This was my first job ever, I was 17. 7.50 an hour back then was a lot! well at least I thought. But as my other friends got jobs I saw they were getting like 10 an hour or more. The management was nice always made sure I was doing ok. The co workers were cool too."
good,"The management and co-workers were very kind, but there was not much foot traffic in the store. This left the staff bored, even. There wasnt much to do."
good,"Relaxed work environment which caused a lot of gossiping. Hourly pay was pretty low but it was fun to work there, especially if your young. I enjoyed interacting with customers because the store was usually slow."
good,Good hours during holidays. Everyone is friendly and respectful. the environment is relaxed and slow paced. Hardest part was the place being understaffed. I'd reccomend it if you're starting out working when in high school or starting college.enjoyable part is the co-workers and making friends with the co workers.
good,"-simple job"
good,"I love this, its a fun place to work at. The employees are easy to talk to and relate to. My only problem is the hours. They scheduling is very strange at this store."
good,Management is awful. Its a great first time job... but managers are rude to their staff. Employees never come in for their shifts. Managers like to cut hours of good employees to punish them. Saturdays and Tuesdays you might have to work updates til 1:30 in the morning.
good,I worked here as a teenager to get some extra cash. It was a very fun place to work. everyone there was wonderful. I loved my teammates. This was the perfect job for my school schedule.
good,training program is only affective with a good SM
good,Not much opportunity for advancement. Hires too many employees.
good,I strongly do not recommend this job to anyone. It’s so much work to not enough pay. They expect so much out of you for very little in return. The worst I’ve had to deal with before.
good,"Abercrombie & Fitch is a great starter job for anyone of the age 18 or higher! However, when it comes time to start having to pay for things, like school, a house, etc.., I recommend finding a new job, unless you get hired onto another position. The hours are very low, as well as the pay."
good,The job over works you for low pay. You deal with rude people always arguing with you about the policy. Managers break the rules yet will write you up about the same things.
good,I was allowed to grow within the company from stock to lead stock and did relocate as a result. Found the hours to be excessive but management to be fair overall.
good,Hours are hard to come by and job security is minimal. Manager turnover is very high. Hard to acquire training when the standard is to schedule employees no more than 8 hours a week.
good,"A typical day consisted of 4 hour shifts."
good,"typical day at work would be opening the store and starting of the opening store task as of:"
good,"Friendly work environment "
good,"a typical day at work is easy going, stress free, and your everyday plain and simple work. Management works in a team of three with one head manager which was probably the hardest part of the job dealing with three bosses."
good,"A&F is a great first job, but I should have been more open to other opportunities. Brand reps make minimum wage and get bad hours. Management at my store is kind of a joke and verbally abusive, but I really do love my job or I would not still be there."
good,"a typical day at work - working on the shipment (in and out), go-backs, censoring, folding, putting stuff away on the floor and in the stock room"
good,"A great part about this company is being able to manage your working hours. Its great when you're a full time student, the environment is great. Youthful and high pace."
good,"Worked for this company for almost 3 years at many different stores around the state, both full-price and outlet stores. The company strives to do great things, running charities, holding events for purpose than praise, camps, concerts, etc. as one would know from looking at the job board in the stock room. It's respectable in the sense that it wants to change it's name/vision from that of a very menial CEO who looked nothing like the people who he liked to model to be the face of the company."
good,"While the job itself was fun, I found the people I worked with to be abhorrent. Lazy and apathetic about the work at bizarre times and could not be bothered to assist unless asked to. Generally, there was a culture of friends that I found myself on the outside of and there was no way for me to push through the membrane. The company, however, was lovely to work for and the clothes very much fit my personal style. I quite liked the management too, however, the bureaucratic system of the company got in the way, oftentimes, of progress."
good,"its a good place to have your first job, but they pay minimum wage and receive no benefits and cannot move up in the company as a part-time warker. It was okay"
good,"Abercrombie has very flexible hours. The most valuable thing i learned was communication skills."
good,Give more hours and stop being so racist toward a certain race we are the same whether people believe that or not. Customers will come in and steal and get mad.
good,"Fast paced job. If you do not like dealing with customers, kids and other thing this would not be the job for you. Also folding clothes that get rearranged 5 minutes later is a big deal there also"
good,this job was okay. fit more for a high school student. the pay is very low and they hire more people than they need.  the job is overall an okay job!!
good,"A typical day at work would be 3-4 hours of just stocking , helping the customers , making sure everything is situated. The most enjoyable part about my job was meeting and interacting with all of the customers. The hardest part I would say was the mark downs really cause I had to make sure the right things were marked down so the customers had the correct mark down prices for the day and they would change around almost every other day."
good,I was kind of glad that was my first job because it taught me how to interact with customers. I didn't have to much complaint other then being in the same spot for so long when we switch positions through out the day.
good,"Hollister is a big company, but it is very organized. Employees are always informed on expectations and goals needed for the work environment. Work attire is casual."
good,Its an easy job and you can get a lot of hours during the holidays. The coworkers are usually cool in the most part. Management is bad most of them act childish. The hardest part of the job is nothing its easy.
good,"A typical day there was very simple and relaxed. Fold the clothes on the floor, make sure they were nice and neat. Help customers with what they want. The co workers were very friendly."
good,"Unreliable work schedule, brand representation required, loss prevention responsibilities, even gender ration with co-workers"
good,"Checking incoming boxes of merchandise, open and scan products and put them into the system. Walk around check to make sure clothes are being folded correctly, and put in their correct bays/shelfs."
good,"I was able to expand my concepts of retail over such a great amount of time. Got great opportunities to open new stores across the US, and to help stores that were struggling to get back to where they were both on a Merchandise aspect and hiring the right fit for the type of management and style of 'Brand Reps"" that we were looking for."
good,"Their are numorous job titles to be part of, some days employees are intructed to work on the sells floors, while others work in the stockrooms. Sells floor employee's help customers, fold clothes, run merchandise from the stock rooms to the sells floor, and also maintain the fitting rooms. Employee's who work within in the stock rooms prep clothes, make sure merchandise isn't damage and sort clothes so they are floor ready. The most enjoyble part of my job is helping costumers. Working at A&F has been a great experince, and all of my co-workers are nice."
good,"come in get walkie talkie and go to my section, greet each customer and help with merchandise. the managment and co workers were alright. hardest part was nothing really and the most enjoyable is seeing the merchandise."
good,"they need a better security people stole alot from there. theres alot of standing fold, and cleaning up involved. "
good,Good place to work through college. I enjoyed the customers and the environment.
good,A typical day at work was greeting all customers and helping them find whatever they were shopping for. I learned that you always had to get to know every customer just a little to get god results in the find. Management was definitely dependable. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep all areas organized while the store was full. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that you helped make someones day.
good,"Fold clothes, work cash register, meet and greet customers, help them find items."
good,I personally really loved working retail this was my first retail job and for the most part everyone who worked there was a student like me. The only downfall was when we did Audits we would be there till midnight or a couple of times four in the morning. As a student with 8 am classes the lack of sleep was a killer!
good,Working with Abercrombie was a fun experience and also taught me about customer relations and diversity.  It was a good first job. Worked well with my school schedule.
good,I usually worked evenings . Make us stay late if one person didn't finish their job.i don't know what to say.   I guess it was an okay first job. Nothing really special.
good,I would work there again if they start to care of more safety concerns . Some jobs are a lot easier than others but you might get paid more for those jobs which never seem right .
good,"Une expérience riche, challengeante, formatrice où le quotidien se renouvelle sans cesse."
good,"near the end of my time there, i had a horribly mean manager. the managers were constantly changing, so the leadership was inconsistent. good associates to work with however."
good,"The management at Abercrombie are very nice and want you to grow in the company. However, you have to hustle for hours and make sure you are the star of the store if you want a lot of hours. A very good discount on clothes and accessories."
good,"I worked as a Impact Team member, great job while in high school but there wasn't a lot of hours unless you payed favorites with managers, plus there was 'on-call' shifts which if business was slow enough they would call you to say whether or not to come in a hour prior. Just advise getting hired for 4th quarter to make money during the holiday season then leave after."
good,The job was very fun at times and always kept me on my toes. Besides the managers handling situations among customers poorly. I do believe the company has a lot of space for improvement. There was times when i didn't feel comfortable because of the lack of maturity from the management team.
good,"Abercrombie & Fitch hires a lot of summer employees every year, which means that hours are spread very thin amongst everyone. It is hard to get more than 20 hours a week. Management changed about two weeks after I began working there, but they were both fine, nothing special. Weekdays were usually very slow and weekends were always hectic, but that's usually how things work at a mall."
good,"This was my very first job. I got hired when I was a junior in high school. My role was an impact team member, meaning I was in charge of receiving new shipment coming in everyday and checking it in so we could stock it in the stockroom and have it ready for when the floor needed more of the merchandise."
good,"This job is great if you don't have many responsibilities because you'll be getting maybe 2 shifts a week being 4 hours each during a normal week. The employee discount is 50% off which is good and they've been doing a lot of incentive based programs at Abercrombie where the company gives employee free stuff! The best thing about the job was the friends that i made, were all the same age range working towards the same goals. Management isn't very understanding that people can't live off of 8 hours a week, instead of giving the loyal employees a consistent amount of hours they instead distribute the hours through a lot of employees, meaning seniority does not count. And there is no room to move up unless you have a bachelors in which case you can be a store or assistant manager. Overall i enjoyed my time here and the environment was amazing to be in and i wouldn't trade it for the world!"
good,"A typical shift would be just fixing all hangers and clothes that needs to be folded or hung. I learned how to fold clothes properly, work as a team and be organized and make sure everything is clean and in place. Managers made sure everything was good for the next day, they made the day very productive for everyone. It was a good place to work at and also enjoyable because everyone got along and everything got done before the shift was over. Working with friends was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Miss the old school Abercrombie. They seem to be closing a lot of stores so moving up seems less likely. They want you to have a four degree to be a ""shift manager"" who makes $12-13 an hour. Its actually kind of funny they require this. Many people have no degree and make double that."
good,"The job is easy work and great for high school students. Management requires you to have a BA in anything or they won't hire you. The pay usually matches minimum wage or a slight competitive value. I worked at one of the highest grossing stores and dealt with customers of many different languages. I had worked for the company for a long time and was consistently told I was an excellent worker, though i was never seriously considered for promotion because of lacking a degree."
good,I didn't have much interaction with other workers due to the fact that the responsibilities of my job meant that I spent the majority of my day working inside trailers.
good,"A typical day a work would be pretty calm and smooth , a little busy when there were a lot of customers . I learned that working and an focus will get you far with custmers and your managers."
good,"As an Impactor I learned a lot about marketing products, shipments, and being able to sale. On the other hand I do believe the job is made for workers of a younger age, Abercrombie and Fitch is more of a job to where you have to look a certain way plus where their clothes in order to get people to buy."
good,Working at Abercrombie and Fitch had its unique taste and foreign clothing style i never experienced. when i started working for them i learned about diversity and about the customers were the top priority.
good,the job is pretty much do what your assigned and get out of there. its a team so the work environment isn't bad at all. i like how a lot of people call out so there's a lot of opportunity to pick up extra hours. i think they hire too much people also
good,"This job is a fun place to earn money and get work experience. It's perfect for students with strange school schedules. Coworkers are friendly and are team oriented. Sometimes things get hectic when the store is busy, but it's never really that terrible."
good,"A typical day at Abercrombie and Fitch is busy and hectic. However, the co-workers and managers make the day worthwhile. Being with the company for three years now, I learned to interact with people, not just your everyday New Yorker, but tourists from all over. The hardest part of the job would be not meeting up to a customer's needs and the most enjoyable part would be getting to know customers from different countries and having moments with my co-workers in between shifts."
good,"My day at Abercrombie was a great learning experience for me. My typical day at work would consist of clocking in, folding clothes and handling dressing rooms. Later on during the day i would go in the back room and handle all the clothes that needed to be prepared for go backs at closing.  My co workers were all driven and very team oriented we all looked out for each other and always got the job done every time. The hardest part of the  job was probably the management. At the time there would be a few miscommunications between the co workers and the management and it got really stressful at times but we never let our personal feelings interfere with our work ethic.The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be working on the floor helping the customers. Each day was a new experience and you never know what kind of person your going to meet or who's going to need your help. I think making sure that the customer was satisfied after they leave our store was the most enjoyable experience of all."
good,"•	Overnight Manager"
good,Fast paced physical work. Modern workspace. Onsite Gym and walking trails.
good,"There is a lot of structure"
good,The people that work here are wonderful. I really enjoy working here
good,"Fun environment for college age people seeking part-time employment. You will meet a lot of people with similar interests. Also, will receive a great discount on their clothes. Management is usually around the same age so its very easy to relate to."
good,"I really enjoy all of my co-workers. We all have a great time laughing and talking together and we even hang out together every once in a while outside of work. Even though we have fun at work, we still make sure everything is complete in an orderly fashion and in a timely manner. The managers here are excellent. They always make sure that we have our work complete and that the store is perfect. At this job, I have learned to work quickly and efficiently and lay myself aside to please the customers. It is not about me,but about the satisfaction of our customers. The hardest part of the job is making sure that everything is perfect. Nothing, absolutely nothing, is to be out of place; therefore, we must always double check our workplace to make sure everything is where it should be. It puts a smile on my  face at the end of the day to know that everything is complete and the customers are completely satisfied with the service we have provided them with."
good,I folded clothes in the proper manner and put them in their appropriate places. I kept the back room organized. My co-workers were friendly. 
good,• Maintained low shrink level
good,"A fun place to work with good benefits. Very ""culture"" oriented. Abercrombie is not for everyone as the only real chance for advancement is to be an ""Abercrombie type"" which is essentially a good looking person and nothing that can be taught or worked towards. Your born to succeed there or your not, plain and simple."
good,I transferred from this job to Hollister because my previous manager got hired at Hollister. It was a busier store so i could get more hours.
good,I really enjoy working at Abercrombie especially since I enjoy wearing their clothes. I have met several nice customers and working here has given me the opportunity to build new friendships with my co-workers. The hours go by quickly for me because I am surrounded my so many positive people and always have a great time!
good,"I myself felt like I went there more for working with the people, my coworkers. The job itself, working on the lines, was okay. Having to feel like you had to have a contest who could keep the highest numbers was pretty ridiculous. Also, when you are seasonal it seems that there are issues when you try to get your W-2s from them. Overall, if I had the chance to go back , ""if I were still looking for work"", I might go back for the people whom I worked with. Doing the job really is too difficult, as long as your back is in good shape and you can stand for a while."
good,this place was very slow at times with very little customers to help. And maybe the prices where too high cause we would have a lot of people coming into the store looking to shop and look like they were leaving with nothing.  then all of the sudden we would see security tags pulled off at times.
good,"Overall a fun work enviroment with a flexible schedule but little room for advancement, no benefits and bad pay, and bad management that left little room for error."
good,"- offer the best customer service possible"
good,"Friendly environment, love my co-workers, and discounts are great. Most people you work with are around your age and the management can be pretty laid back sometimes."
good,Hard to get hours after awhile. They keep replacing people so they can keep the illusion that a lot of people wear their clothes. You have to be attractive to work here (they don't directly say this) but you are reviewed based of your look.
good,"When working at Abercrombie you have to be prepared to stay late due to reruns from customers and once received at the end of the day you have to put everything back out on the floor in it’s appropriate place. During spring, summer, and fall hours a good and there is always work however once December and January come around hours are cut due to constant returns from Christmas and the company has to cut hours which makes it a bit of a struggle"
good,"Although I think they have changed many of their ways since I last worked there (so I don't think what I'm writing applies anymore), it was a pretty cool place to work."
good,The atmosphere was very chill. They pushed us to make sales and advertise to meet the goals for the week/day. The dress code was very laid back despite the color scheme we had to wear.
good,No room for advancement here. It is a poorly maintained retail store with prejudice motives. If you can get past the vain approach to customer service you'll be fine.
good,You have set hours every week. The culture of the company was very exciting. The workplace was very loose and relaxed. It was important to be punctual with your work schedule.
good,"Working overnight at Abercrombie & Fitch is not bad at all.  It's just that some days are more productive that others. The rules are not always followed by the leads,  but we as regular associates have to abide by them."
good,"It is a good place to meet new people (co-workers) while you're in college. "
good,"A typical day included working the cashier, helping customers, and working with fellow employees.  I learned customer service, and my managers didn't exactly train me, so I learned a lot on my own.  It was a nice and clean place to work in, without too much difficulty.  The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting customers."
good,"The days here were typically short, very easy days and everyone was friendly. Discounts were nice but hours were not given steadily. Management was nice."
good,"Een tof bedrijf om bij te werken. Collega's waren ook super , maar zeer weinig werk."
good,Fun place to work if you are younger. I made several friends and enjoyed my time working there until the managers changed. I liked the atmosphere and most of the people I worked with.
good,"it is an okay place to work, did not really fit my style. money was not bad. was in high school so I just needed a job. they atlas took care of me and worked with my schedule."
good,"Even though the dress code is strict and, at times, seems a little ridiculous, it is still a decent place to work part-time. It is mindless work of folding clothes and greeting customers, but if you are looking for a job while in school, I would recommend checking them out."
good,"Was in college needed a part time job. The staff was young, and that is typically what you would expect at a mall retail store. Nothing out of the ordinary. Gives entry level people some experience."
good,"Abercrombie was a nice, fun place to work. The managers were nice but most of the time had no idea what they were doing. I enjoyed helping guests find what they were looking for."
good,This is a good introductory job right out of high school. Good to gain customer service experience. It's a chill work environment and the managers when I worked there were chill as well.
good,"I was rarely ever scheduled, sometimes I wouldn't work for 3 weeks and then only get one day the following week. I learned how to sell merchandise and how to work with customers on a more personal level than ever before."
good,"Working as a manager at Abercrombie I learned many skills. the MIT program is excellent for those seeking management skills, the company goes above and beyond to continuously educate its managers on progressive coaching and training techniques, not to mention you get to operate a multi-million dollar store"
good,I did not get enough hours because there was way too many employees and the pay wasn't good so I wouldn't make much money in a week but the people I worked with were great and the costumes were really easy to deal with
good,a typical day is spent helping individuals find clothing items and create a style. you are often times allowed to style mannequins. the management is fun and outgoing. the hardest part of the job is doing floor sets. the most enjoyable part is the freedom of dress code.
good,"Working at Abercrombie & Fitch helped with some networking among colleagues as well as  the in-store managers that come in from time to time to assist with daily operations. Overall, I'd say that there is some level of professionalism that can be developed between brand representatives and the store managers and valuable skills dealing with retail operations and customer service is definitely learned."
good,It was very relaxed and laid back. There was a lof of people working there so you hardly saw the same people working with you. The mangers were nice and very understanding.
good,"Workplace Culture:"
good,Working overnight was a very fun work place. The managers made the job super fun and I enjoyed my time there. Great job for young people in college or high school.
good,"A&F is a very unique place to work. The headquarters is set on over 200 wooded acres and the grounds have a ""camp-like"" feel. During my eight + years at A&F I felt like I was predominately surrounded by high performers. Everyone really collaborates to ""make it happen."" It can be a stressful place to work at times but A&F is great at celebrating success and recognizing associates for great performance at all levels.  Work/life balance, career advancement opportunities and top-down communication continue to be points of concern that the company is actively working to address."
good,"my job was great."
good,really was not too bad of an experience. heavy flow of people sometimes made it a bit hectic and sometimes they can be quite strict on their appearance requirements but overall not a poor place to work
good,"A typical day at work was to come in 5-10 minutes before your shift, clock in, and check the board in the stock room. Ask a manager what task they want to be fulfilled, and get to work. It was a busy job but coworkers made it enjoyable and it wasn't at all stressful."
good,"This job doesnt give you much pay or hours, but its a good side job to do because its easy and fun. You also get great discounts off clothes. Management is nice and fun. Overall great place to work."
good,"All three of these companies treated me well as a student. They all were very flexible and accommodating of my school schedules, allowing me to exceed in post secondary school, while simultaneously being able to make some money on the side. "
good,"A typical day at work consisted of customer service and being a cashier. I learned to communicate effectively with others, including customers and co-workers. Management seemed to be more concerned about quantity over quality. The hardest part was dealing with angry customers; however, with keeping a level head, I tried to assist the best I could."
good,Abercombie and fitch is perfect for first time workers.You meet alot of fun people and work with great clothes.Its a simple part time to add to you resume
good,"I dont understand why they cant pay managers more or employees more. There were employees there over 8 years still making min wage.  Its so sad.  The  culture was amazing, everyone was fun but H&M pays managers way more so I wouldnt suggest to start here."
good,I stood in place for most of shift and folded clothes while greeting customers. It is very slow placed. not a lot of transactions occur. I did not receive many hours because it was so slow.
good,"Really easy. You do not do much, get paid to stand around and fold clothes. Management does not know what they are doing at times"
good,This company was great a real laid back culture. we were provided with clothes and paid time off and other great benefits.
good,Great company just wish the benefits were better and more overtime also great managers great co workers love the location.
good,"Our typical day was to not have a typical day.  As a Brand we were moving so fast that your daily plans were normally void by 10am."
good,"-Organizing Stockroom "
good,"I loved working for Abercrombie Kids for many reasons. It was a fun and laid back environment and the people that work there were fun too! The only problems I had were that I was with the company for 2 years and didn't get one single raise. I also wasn't given any respect by people that were ""higher up"" than me. I also hated working weekends. "
good,"a typical day there is always busy."
good,"A typical day at work would be just fixing clothes and putting clothes back to where they belong. You help customers with what they need and open a fitting room. The work place is like a home to most employees. My co-workers are fun to talk to and they're just around your age group so we all understand each other. The management is good. Depending on the manager, you are either working and doing something every minute or else just folding clothes and be on the register. There's nothing hard about the job that I can tell. They don't challenge their coworkers so it's pretty a easy job. The most enjoyable part of the job would be just the co-workers you're working with and managers."
good,"Poor management, Favoritism"
good,"Customer service, Cashiering, Folding, Cleaning, Up sold products, Restocked sales floor, and Back room inventory."
good,"i have really good working experience here, met new people and everyone is really friendly, apart from the management they don't care about their associates specially overnight staff, they are only concerned about the work, poor management and favoritism is on its extreme"
good,"Abercrombie is a very faced paced environment which takes place Overnight, anywhere from 9pm - 11am. You have your own space to work and the job is almost like high school. Employee's have fun laughing, sharing jokes, while still working hard."
good,"greet customers"
good,"It was great working at abercrombie, the only thing I Disliked "
good,"Managers are willing to work with you and your schedule, full shifts (6-8 hours each), I had a great manager who was amazingly understanding. it was always fun to work there, at least the store i worked in."
good,A typical day at abercrombie was fun and busy. we had alot of customers and a lot of work to do most days. I learned mostly all of my customer service skills there. also how to work a cash register and how to fold clothing in a very neat manner. management was okay. there were too many managers in the store at once. sometimes it was more managers than associates. my co-workers were very nice and respectable. the hardest part of the job was inventory. inventory was hard but it was only for a short period of time. the most enjoyable part of the job was breaks. we had a lot of fun on our lunch breaks as a team.
good,"Organizing garments "
good,This is a good place if you are in high school or working though college.  Really like all the other people that worked there.
good,"It was a easy job. The managers would give us our tasks and then teach us how to do them, if we didn't already know. Then after teaching us, would watch as we tried to complete some of the task on our own, while giving good criticism to better us for the next time."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of greeting and folding clothing. The store plays music extremely loud so you can always dance a little while the day is slow or fast. There were no hard parts to this job, it was fairly easy. They pay and work really didnt add up so I think this job will be great for high school students not college students with cars and apartments to pay for."
good,I loved working there i just never got any hours and when i did it was only two or three hours at a time.
good,"Working at Abercrombie was a whole new experience i enjoyed the retail coming in and getting an opportunity to represent the brand in my own way but it was kind of boring just coming in folding clothes got kind of old quick, the loud techno music, and the cologne was overwhelming."
good,"Processed sales, handled cash and credit card transactions, including return items and gift cards. Addressed customer questions regarding clothing and other merchandise. Kept the store in an organized and orderly manner, suitable for good client relations"
good,The work experience was okay. I appreciate the chance to work for such a huge company but other than that I'd work somewhere else next time if I need a part-time job.
good,"A typical day at work involves managing anywhere between 5 and 15 employees and ensuring that they are tasked out in certain areas to strengthen the appearance and feel of our store to incoming customers.I am constantly floor supervising to greet and interact with customers and assist them in any way that I can. I have learned various skills from Abercrombie such as management, time management, multitasking, customer service, cash register, stock room organization, auditing, interviewing, hiring, training, holding others accountable, processing payments and returns, setting out new merchandise, marking down clearance, brand loyalty, loss prevention, etc. My co-workers consist of various teenagers from the ages 17 to 24. The hardest part of the job is the long weekend hours and lack of vacation. The most enjoyable part of the job is the energetic atmosphere and the employees I work with."
good,• Greeted customers on floor and enhanced customer service
good,"It was a little different for me because im used to work a;day and not work every now and then. I mean if you like to be lazy at work and do nothing most of the shift then this is job for you, I did like the people you be around. they keep a upbeat and happy lifestlye."
good,"The most enjoyable parts of working for them was being able to improve on my customer service skills, and meeting new and interesting people from co-workers to guest."
good,My favorite part about working here was all the experience I got dealing with customers and with money. I have always been passionate about helping people especially with their training.
good,Gave me the opportunity to work on my leadership skills.  Had the chance to grown from a big company as a leader.  Without the managernial skills I wouldn't be where I am today.
good,friendly environment easy to learn how to do jobs. managers and staff are really nice and open to helping anyone. flexible hours and good pay. good for high school students
good,The hours really depends on the season. In December I worked 40hr weeks and when January hit hours were cut to 25hrs a week. You can’t receive a raise because of complaint policy so the only way to get paid more is move up in position.
good,"I enjoyed the clothes and merchandise, people were very friendly and helpful. Excellent place to shop. The setting and overall feeling of just being there is wonderful."
good,"Abercrombie was a fun place to work at, a great company for young adults to gain work experience. Also it was an great place to network with fellow inspiring people."
good,"You get to schedule what days and hours you want to work. "
good,"Une journée travail typique à Abercrombie se résumait à:"
good,"Although this position does not elaborate on my laboratory skills, it helped me build communication skills with customers and other employees. I was in charge of greeting customers and helping them with their purchases."
good,Abercrombie & Fitch was a good job but since I was only working part- time extra shifts were rare and I simply worked twice a week with low pay and received attitudes from the lady managers.
good,"Abercrombie & Fitch is a good place for a young person to enter the workforce. You learn how to work as a team and how to engage customers. I would say the only negative aspect of the company is the lack of inclusion. If you didn't look a certain way or have the ""company look"" then you were practically invisible."
good,It is a nice starting job. You get to meet so many people and practice your people skills while taking care of customers. There is always something to do and even if work requires a fast passe it is still enjoyable.
good,co-workers would be on their phones not paying attention. Managers would talk to employers. Didn't give much hours to people and they had their favorite that would get the most
good,everything is overall good just beware hours can get a little wonky. Most of the managers are nice and reasonable. The turnaround is high too. Overall good time when I was there.
good,"... or a good job as a manager if you are a recent college graduate. There is growth opportunity with this company. The job is not hard at all, the company has everything laid out for you. All you have to do is show up and perform the assigned tasks."
good,"When I worked there, the manager was always smiling and happy. She would make the entire shift laugh and we all had fun while we worked. Even during the updates we had fun."
good,But when I was there it was intense and amazing. Leadership was all over the place but the culture and people and opportunities or advancement were unmatched.
good,"during my time at Abercrombie I had great associates and great managers which made my time spent there great! It was a good place for a"
good,"this is a great place for someone in high school or fresh out of high school, its a nice way to learn responsibility and the skills you will need such as time management communication and organization for future career goals"
good,"Work environment good fun, lots of people the same age so makes it a better environment for part-time workers. The staff discount is good and you're not required to wear the brands' clothes like you were before."
good,I learned a lot working for Abercrombie and Fitch. The management skills I learned through my career there helped me progress quickly as a manager both there and in my experiences with future careers.
good,Daily upkeeping the store while managing stock and inventory items. Learned cash handling and register experience helped pursue future job opportunities.
good,Hours were flexible based on employee need. Management always had a summary of what was going on and how everyone needed to act. Vacation policy was never truly explained by employer.
good,Abercrombie had a positive environment and everyone was very helpful. we worked as a team to complete all tasks and had the customer's best interest in mind.
good,Abercrombie is a great place to learn merchandising fundamentals and to partner with design and be creative. Critical to also learn production & product development.
good,"• Team leader of 35+ associates and responsible for recruiting, hiring and training diligent professionals, committed to high principles of customer service and performance"
good,"Just a seasonal associate, but i barely got hours as there were so many seasonal associates, I had no idea I'd be working less than 10 hours a week, sometimes even less."
good,"Abercrombie and Fitch is, admittedly, a great place to start off your work experience. The atmosphere is light, but can get a little heavy during holidays and special promotions, and you meet a lot of different and fantastic people. The only thing is, if you're not an assistant manager or the store manager, this job is absolutely temporary. The pay is minimum wage, and not exactly great from most of the work you end up doing, and frankly, dealing with customers all day long can really wear you down. But if you need some experience in the work field and want to have a good time too, I'd definitely recommend Abercrombie & Fitch. Of course, another tip is that not all stores are similar. I love the store that I'm currently working at, but I also know there are other stores that are a nightmare to be employed at, just do your research and try not to think too hard, after all, this will only be something short term."
good,"I worked in the stockroom, and it was fun and lots of laughing going on. A typical day would be doing shipment almost your whole shift. Bringing pieces to the sales floor that had missing sizes in a particular item. Putting the shipment were it went on the stockroom shelves. Management was always fun, and they would help in the stockroom to get shipment processed faster if we were short staffed. The most enjoyable part was in the stockroom because it was relaxed, you could sit, talk, and the music in the back was different then the music on the sales floor."
good,Management is okay. You only get a discount on a set amount of items  a month and will usually work under 20 hours. Shifts are almost always 4-5 hours.
good,"It was a good place to work, because of the people, peers, etc. One of the cons is that they do not give you sufficient hours a week, so basically you earn nothing."
good,I work there when I come back home for the summer. Great summer job to make some pocket money. Managers were nice and helpful. Great group of people working there. I enjoyed working there.
good,"Abercrombie helped me build my customer service skills as my first official job. Although it was many years ago, I remember the group interview. I was probably fifth in line and had to find away to not repeat the answers of the four people in front of me. Redecorating the store and mannequins for holidays and back to school is tough but rewarding when people walk by and admire them. Black Friday is like a scene from Jumanji but fun nonetheless."
good,"As an opening manager, you're responsibility is to have a set check list type of schedule to have all the tasks needed to be complete by the end of the day. You are the set example on how the store attitude should be through out the day. You must control the problems the store will bring whether it is angry customers, systems that are down, theft, etc. As closing manager, you must help the opening manager complete as much tasks as possible as well as keeping all associates zoned out correctly to make sure you have less situations to deal with. When appropriate, give redirecting feedback and positive feedbacks. Not all these tasks were easy, for the store was a high volume store and especially during the days where you are understaffed. The associates made working enjoyable and helped out plenty to where, there is one less problem to worry about. The hardest part of the job was having to be one of the worst stores with theft. But with the help of loss prevention associates, we learned quite a lot to prevent future instances.  One con that I came upon working for the company was that I do not have my degree yet, but I was good at my job, as to where the company would hire those with degrees that did not know how to work efficiently. I myself had to train those who got the job so easily as to where I had to keep pushing myself to become the equal position that they were in. Having to deal with cases of stealing and the thieves become verbal with myself is yet another part of the job that was not enjoyable what so ever. I learned plenty of skills here with the technology used, knowing"
good,"Worked there throughput high school, loved it for a while, depends on management. Min wage. Not enough discount opportunities for the requirements of the dress."
good,The staff was very friendly and fun. Management was relaxed. The only con was there was no room for advancement unless you are willing to move out of state.
good,It was a great place to work at with lots of different faces from all over the world. The diversity culture of the company helped to build up my confident in expressing my thoughts in front of groups. Working together as a team with 200+ associates was the most enjoyable part of the job while unstable working schedules was the hardest part of the job.
good,I worked here in high school and I loved it. The flexibility of the hours was fantastic and the environment was awesome. The tasks were super simple and they played fun music while you worked. ALSO after your second day you dont even smell the cologne anymore.
good,"Hours here are very limited. The job calls for operating the register as well as maintaining the appearance of the sales floor which requires a lot of attention. Most days only you and one manager will be at he store at a time which means while managers are taking care of their duties, it is up to you to take care of guests and keep everything clean and organized as well as continuously returning items to the sales floor in the correct fashion,"
good,"The job was tedious as all clothing store jobs are. Place was majorly dominated by older associates which was a drawback. 50% off on the clothes was a great incentive."
good,"Everybody working there is very friendly and we help each other make a busy day go by as productive and efficient as possible, by meeting all the management targets and tasks of the day, while also having fun."
good,"As a young teenager, Abercrombie & Fitch was the perfect retail store to start up in. It provided an ambitious yet comfortable environment to start the retail career."
good,It was a tempoary job and i only worked 3 shifts there. They work with your hours and the staff was cool. They even helped me get a discount on this jacket I wanted.
good,"If you like walking around all day and having friendly conversations with customers, then this is the job for you. This company was a pleasure to work for."
good,I felt very comfortable and it was a great place to work at. The staff was very nice and I would recommend that as a first job for someone. Great place
good,Good to swap shifts and this helps at exam time .the discount is good. they could treat staff better from head office down. there is alot of young people workuing there so its good social life
good,great place to start can't move up though they hire people with 4 year degrees to manage salary is nice but not worth it if you're trying to make a living great for students!
good,I love working at A&F the only thing that bugged me about working there was the lack of pay. The pay was not in any way reflective to how much responsibility one had working.
good,Great job for a young student or individual looking to make some seasonal cash and learn about customer service techniques for future jobs. However very low pay!
good,"It was a great first job. It gave me the foundation of retail and customer service, along with learning many other things throughout my time being there. The company is organized and is a great place to start!"
good,The work environment has a more laid back feel to it. For the most part you would be organizing the store when there are no customers needing your assistance.
good,The salary isn't enough for duties that are assigned.Its a part time but 8-14 is the most you'll get in a week and you can never get a hold of pay stubs.
good,There is always room for growth in this company and with the work environment continuely adapting it leaves room to learn something new everyday. This job you will receive what you put into it and the company looks for quality over quantity.
good,"The world of retail fashion is not one that operates slowly or without intention. Working at A&F is no different. Driven and creative people will excel in the workplace, along with those who appreciate strong team environments but can also function independently."
good,"Working at Abercrombie & Fitch was a good first job experience because it was a relatively fun and easy work environment. However, hours are limited so do not expect to get that many hours. It is a good job to have while attending school because it will not take much of your time. You will be able to gain customer service and problem solving experience."
good,A typical day at work is assisting customers with help with products and checkout. What i learned form this company is you have to knowledge about your company when you are representing a brand.
good,"I worked for Abercrombie and Fitch when people's looks use to sale. Today, they have a new philosophy with the company, si I'm not sure how it is to work there anymore."
good,"A typical workday would be about 5-6 hours for either 3 or 4 days a week. As far as the workplace culture went, it felt like being back in high school the way the employees were so close knit. After all clothes were folded, the managers would just ask me to stand in different rooms, basically doing nothing."
good,In entrambi gli store ho riscontrato una grande professionalità e meticolosità ed ho acquisito i punti giusti per integrarmi rapidamente all'interno di un contesto lavorativo a contatto con numerosi colleghi.
good,This is retails all day you a basically folding clothes and selling them. You will get some snobby customers of course but what job doesn't. I actually really enjoyed working here because it was kids and seeing kids pick out their outfits thinking they were grown was just so cute.
good,"The work is very easy and the shifts usually range from 4-5 hours which worked for me cause I was full-time in college. The other associates were really cool and fun and the management was nice. However, I would not recommend getting this job as a job to pay the bills. It is good for spending money and a phone bill and thats about it."
good,"i loved the clothes and the cool kid ivy leage culture, to some its a turn off, but it really depends on the person, butthiings have changed since i have worked there as in ceo and such so.."
good,"Pretty standard retail position. Organized and stored clothing based on the type, and made sure customers were able to find and purchase the merchandise that they liked."
good,"This company was my first job. I learned to balance cash registers. I also learned a lot about customer service. There were hard days dealing with customers, but it was a great experience. If you have allergies I do not recommend working here."
good,"Open/ Close the store."
good,It sometimes get crazy in there especially weekends or holidays. And the managers have their ups and down sometimes at work.
good,"This is a great starting point if you don't have a job lined up after college. You learn the basic business metric for measuring sales. I learned a lot and would recommend this company. ONLY as a starting point, NOT as a career!"
good,"A workplace filled with young people, working environment is very sociable - as a result of how young the people working there are."
good,Very fun and chill place to work. Staff and customers are very friendly. Company offers a great discount and thorough training. The typical day was quite breezy
good,It was a good part time job and had good discounts for employees. It was a fun place to work but also could get boring when it was a slow day. Management was very nice.
good,"A typical day consisted of greeting and helping customers, and providing them with whatever they needed. Then I would procede to check out customers at the cash register."
good,"I worked mostly in the back with inventory and shipments and usually end up on the floor helping out customers and doing changes to walls to put up new products. It was pretty good, easy job and the people are mostly the same age as you so they are easy to relate and talk too."
good,The workplace is fun and you meet really nice people who not only become your coworkers but also becomes your friends. Overall it's a great first job experience.
good,Your basic retail job. It teaches you the basics of interacting with 'clients' and being on a team. I enjoyed working with my coworkers and learned about being flexible in the workplace.

good,I was not a fan of being in the retail world. The environment was enjoyable. In the location where I worked  at had a diverse cultured climate which was what I enjoyed the most.
good,Abercrombie always started the day with a routine meeting where we went over goals and you were assigned to either a part of the store or a specific task. Managers came and went often but it was always a very comfortable working enviorment
good,"The management at Abercrombie Distro needed a major overhaul. Employee concerns and complaints fell on deaf ears almost all the time. The employees that you work with make the job bearable, out side of those complaints the job I had was easy. Heavy Equipment Operator involved picking orders and retrieving them from the shelves."

The management was great and they pushed the team to succeed. My co-workers were also great and worked great together. The hardest part of the job was the short handed days, where i had to take on more responsibility individually. The most enjoyable aspect was the location being the mall."
good,I learned to manage and lead. You can have relationships with people but keep personal business to your self. Hardest part is moving up if there is no available openings.

My co-workers were awesome and it was a pleasure working with them.  The hardest part of the job was the sometimes boring working routine for that day.  The most enjoyable part of this job was the music and have good interactions with co-workers and customers.
good,"good at the time, but personally not something id see myself doing in the long run. it can get hectic at times, like any store management position. Most sales associates hired were 17-18 so that can also be challenging to deal with."

good,"A typical day at Abercrombie & Fitch is different each day. Depending on what shift an employee gets scheduled, there are different projects to be done. Before open hours, we would change an entire room with new products to be sold and had to do it in a timely manner. During business hours we made sure that everyone was greeted as they walked through the door and let them know what our specials were for that day. Folding clothes all day can get quite repetitive but at Abercrombie & Fitch, we made it fun. During the Olympics week, we decided to have an Olympics of our own. We would have different teams and different obstacles we would have to fulfill in order to win. For example; we were each given a stack of shirts and whoever folded them, from biggest to smallest, put the correct stickers to show the size, and made it look flawless in a certain amount of time, would win."

The most difficult part of my job is standing for ten hrs. I enjoy riding on the equipment and the fact that espn is on in the main break room

Management was just time management and how fast you can get your piles of clothes finished before the day is over. My coworkers did the same thing and we all got along very well. The hardest part of this job is when Black Friday came around, the store was swamped with customers picking clothes and dropping them on the floor if they don't want it.

good,this is a retail enviroment with alot of customer service involve
good,I have given my time and effort to Abercrombie and fitch for 1 year and 5 months going on now and the benefits are not a factor. As high priced as the clothing is we should get a higher percentage off and more benefits for college/high school students.
good,"Gained helpful interaction skills with customers, organization, and cashier experience."
good,"VERY frequent overtime. Have to come into weekly meetings even on your off day. Compensation is good, benefits are great they provide the best for health, vision, dental. Job security is comforting, as long as you're a hard worker and do your job. Management tries to be intimidating but they're around often and helpful, load you with things to do and are very detail oriented (duh!). Culture is cool and prep on the outside but core values are pretty discriminatory. A&F has their reputation for a reason. They've become more inclusive as far as racial diversity but are still focused on great looking employees. You will be judged on appearance. Point blank. Oh, and recruiting is mandatory. on the clock, off the clock."
good,"Very fun place to work, with flexible schedules. I learned a lot about supervising other employees and delegating tasks to them. Management is easy to get along with and makes you feel welcome"

Finally after 120 days the news was released that my contract would not be extended any further due to fiscal reasons."
good,"Abercrombie will teach you about standard and presentation. For the most part, it's an easy and laid back work environment. There are days where you will have to stay late to help with floorset and things that change throughout the season, but it was always fun working there."
good,"In a very recent situation at the retail shop that I work at, I was back-stocking the stock room when one of my co-workers called me to help with a difficult customer that was not satisfied with the price adjustment they received. They knew to call me because I am bilingual (the customer only spoke Spanish) and am always able to multitask. I was able to juggle my back-stocking work from the back with my customer service experience in the front of the store. With this experience, I was able to provide the customer with the correct information they needed in a timely matter and that customer left satisfied when before they were on the verge of calling a manager. Overall, I was able to provide my great customer service skills to prevent a problem becoming bigger than what it needed to be."

good,it was slow during the non holiday season but things like black friday and the holidays were really busy which is okay.
good,"On a normal day I would leave my house ahead or time to make sure I find parking and wouldn't get stuck in traffic. Go in, put my belongings away and then clock in. Once I did that, I would approach the manager on duty to ask if there was anything out of the ordinary or any tasks to be done first. If the manager was busy with assisting other co-workers or costumers I would start with what I knew had to be done. It would consist of folding and back stocking over flow of items, pulling and preparing merchandise needed on sales floor, maintaining stock room organized and clean, censoring and back stocking new items. On other occasions my task would be to assist with ""floor set"" witch would consist of building walls, closets, tables, moving items to new locations, marketing, lighting, form presentation, preparing items for floor set in a orderly manner so that it wound flow smoothly. Due to the regulations of this company we would always have new hires, this was a bitter sweet regulation. I enjoyed seeing new faces and learning of new cultures however, the training department needed a lot of improvement. It was challenging at times to finish my task on time when I was being timed,assisting customers, and helping co-workers with there own task and showing them how to properly do there share. The absence of management communication also brought a few complications I enjoyed the up-beat environment, new play lists, making new friends."

good,Work hard play hard mentality.  Work life balance depends on the department you worked in but overall very nice above other companies.  You will learn a lot very fast every day.
good,"I worked as a Brand Representative and the job was very easy, although they did not provide a lot of training. You had to figure out how to do things on your own. They let you choose your availability but will not schedule for more than 32 hours a week (even if youre available for 70) unless you're available 24hrs/day. I was typically scheduled for 25-29 hrs a week. Slow weeks only had 12-15 hrs, so not a great source of income. Also, the pay is very low. Managers are usually young so it's a fun place to work but they WILL CHANGE YOUR SCHEDULE days before without telling you, so it's hard to plan for your personal lives as your days off might become working days (they change it a couple of days before and don't notify you)."
good,"ANF is a comfortable place to work in Columbus, Ohio. The workplace culture is relaxed and it is a beautiful campus to work at.  It is located in the suburbs so it's a bit further away from downtown but usually is a reverse commute."
good,"A typical day in the job was always busy, many things to do. However it was fun to work with the people. The hardest part of the job was that you had to work in the weekends and if the climate was bad you still had to go in to work."
good,I started back in 2012-2017! I was hired as a “model” which was primarily just folding clothes and looking good! Occasionally customers could get sassy but managers typically took over the situation. They do pay minimum wage and rarely do they ever give any type of raise. Never have I witnessed any discrimination.
good,"Great place to start off your career. Great opportunities for advancement, although many people hit a wall and cannot advance. Doesn’t have a great reputation for work/life balance."
good,"Managers could be a little bit nicer to employees, especially to new ones and less favoritism. Coworkers are very nice and friendly. Stores are always nice"
good,"I had a good working relationship with management, but a lot of other employees did not. I enjoyed my time with them and learned a lot throughout the years and advancement with the company. Good benefits, pay is decent depending on the position. You'll work a lot of hours during peak seasons."
good,"Good company to work for and get experience In Management but no life balance. Also your experience will depend if you have a good store manager."
good,"Good place to work for, just not many benefits and the pay makes it difficult to work here without having another job.  It just doesn't pay enough.  But everyone was friendly."
good,"Definitely a job for teenagers who need some sort of income. Most don't stick around well into their twenties unless they have to for the money or they move up into Corporate. Compared to other retail companies, benefits for part-time employees are not up to par."
good,"A typical day at work consist in helping customers, working the cashier and fixing the clothes. You need a degree to advance in the workplace but the work environment is grate."
good,"A typical day is when you can't make your hours because of limited work load. Management is awesome. The hardest part of the job is when you're reading to meet your production goal and the system breaks down, and the most enjoyable part is the yearly sale for employees."
good,great for ages 18-22 if not looking for anything serious. The pay needs to be more improved but it is a friendly workplace and easy to do that any body could do it.
good,I worked for Abercrombie for almost two years. It was an easy job and I left smelling good everyday. The people were generally nice. My only complaint is that you can't move up to management without a higher education. Even if you have worked for the company for many years.
good,Great place to start as a first job. Teaches you a lot in retail and great place to learn about retail. As a brand representative you basically learn how to do all positions and jobs.
good,"Opener: Gets in sets up store for success. lots of little tasks that take up lots of time, that they don't give you additional time for with all the other morning paper work you are supposed to do."
good,"Work is pretty fast paced and you need to be somewhat of a fast learner. There are opportunities for advancement, however, it can be biased. Management is terrible."
good,"Mostly maintain rooms. Provide customers with advice. Service customers. Its fine for a first job. Not something to consider long term, unless you are a manager. But again."
good,I enjoy working at Abercrombie & Fitch because it is a respectable company but because they are a more expensive clothing store i feel like associates should get paid more than they do. All the managers are friendly and work around associates lives but their time management could use some help. I have worked late almost every shift.
good,"Management positions offer a strong opportunity for individual skills growth if young mangers have supervisors who are dedicated to consistent training."
good,"Abercrombie & Fitch is a very good company to work for. The environment is well based I have no complaints. Overnight hours are good, you can listen to your own music be in your own world."
good,"Working with a tight knit team of talented, dedicated, designers in a fast paced and ever changing environment. The hours are long but the people you work with make it all worth it."
good,"Can be very rewarding when you workwith a great team. but hiring PT associates can be frustrating because turnover is high being in a college town but when good oens come, they are amazign!"
good,"Great work culture , up beat music , not fast paces expect during holidays, the hardpart of the jobs is staying busy busy doing something when its really nothing that needs to to be done."
good,"Its a fun place to work if your in college and just need some extra spending money. I don't see anyone make a career out of it unless you get into upper management, even then, ehh, no thanks. But it is a fun environment and you make a lot of friends working there. You don't get very many hours though. Most people were only scheduled 3 days a week and you only worked 4 hour shifts. There were somedays you could come in at 7 and work a 12 hour shift when they were redoing the floor plan but other than that its just 4 hour shifts. Its just like any other retail place in the mall though, you'll almost always get a text every couple of days asking you to cover a shift, so if you did need hours they weren't very hard to get. On the other side of that, if you wanted the day off or didn't feel well, you didn't have to worry about calling a manager or anything like that. As long as the shift was covered they didn't care who it was working it."
good,"you get to wear whatever you like, very comfortable store. I learned a lot but was not able to move up because I did not have a four year degree......"
good,"Working at Abercrombie was a good place to work and I loved being there. However, I am looking for a job that will pay more and give me more opportunity."
good,"The job was overall fun but the management and hours weren't up to standards. Many members did not show up for work so, I was called in constantly. No one was really nice to one another. There were cliques in the workplace which was very unprofessional."
good,"This is a great company to gain management experience. They have an awesome manager training program that really gives you the tools necessary to run a store. Downside, there aren't very many new stores opening so the opportunity for advancement above the assistant manager level is very slim. A store manager in your district must vacate their spot in some way or another for an assistant to move up. So it easy to become bored with it seeing that you have very few opportunities to move up. Eventually, most people just outgrow the company and decide to move on."
good,I learn everyday how to talk to different people and be able to handle even the most difficult customers. It is very easy to get a long with everyone. The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude people.
good,"It takes time to understand the management with home office and in store management."
good,"days are very repetitive, you learn basic management functions, the people you work with are usually pretty nice, the hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers"
good,"Specific performance objectives based on the job description"
good,started as a full-time stock and wanted t move up in management. they wouldn't because i didn't have a bachelors degree. i knew the store in handout and loved the company until there was no growth for me with the company
good,Its a good environment very friendly coworkers and managers. They don't spread there hours out well enough and there not considerate of the schedule they give out.
good,If you are in High school or are looking for an easy first time job this is perfect for you. Working anywhere in the mall is pretty easy. I worked here for a few months in High school.
good,The co-workers were very nice and we got 50% discount on the items. The most enjoyable part of this job was picking outfits for clients and meeting sales goals.
good,Abercrombie and Fitch was an amazing place to work at! I loved the managers and employees there. I had a great time talking and helping out the customers.
good,"Abercrombie was THE place to work in high school. The pay wasn't great but the discount was worth it. The job was not difficult, it was folding clothes, making sure shoppers found what they needed. I liked to be in the back especially during the holidays. Less chaos."
good,"Abercrombie is a lovely company that is great for starting your career, or just trying to get out in the workforce. The people you have the opportunity to work with are from all walks of life. The customers are the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of moving a stack of clothes from one side of the shelf to the other and listening to costumers complain to me about the price of the clothes."
good,"A job where you make great experiences."
good,Always a new experience working as an impact team member. From helping customers find that one special item to giving feedback on a certain style.
good,"I worked at abercrombie and fitch when I was still in high school. I wanted to do something other than nanny. I wanted to get out in the work field in retail. I learned patience, working in an environment where not everyones personalities get along with important for me to learn. I learned honesty. I never realized how many people actually try to steal and take things from the store. It is always better to be honest than lie, cheat or steal. Hardest part of the job was long work hours. The most enjoyable was working with friends and getting a discount on your favorite clothes."
good,sorting and stocking clothes taking inventory reviewing stock my coworkers were fun and outgoing management above me were very insightful
good,"A typical day at work would be getting there and checking our sales, seeing how much money we need to make for that day. Then getting a five minute meeting from the manager to see what needs to be done for the day. I learned how to communicate with people who don't speak English because Park City is a tourist town and Abercrombie is a huge tourist store. My co-workers were great I get along with pretty much anyone. The hardest part of the job was trying to communicate with people who don't speak English and who have no idea what you are talkin anout, trying to figure out what our US sizes are in their country. Most enjoyable part was meeting people from all over the world and hearing stories of how different and unique they all are."
good,Fun place to work throughout college. Learned how to communicate with customers on a daily basis. Management was very knowledgeable.
good,"Es una buena empresa para trabajar, horarios flexibles y tareas variadas. Buen equipo de trabajo."
good,"Facilité de modulé les heures de travail"
good,"Good work place, great management teams and people that work at the stores, excellent customer service standarts which will reflect in profit and reduce internal / external losses"
good,"Interesting working as a sells associate.  I had many managers, but all of them were very interesting in their own way and excellent in the way they treat it us"
good,"At abercrombie and fitch, I was exposed to the world of retail and truly gained an appreciation for those behind the counter. A lot of work goes into offering excellent customer service, which is what my time at AnF taught. You always value the customer. I was considered an in store model/associate and was responsible for providing customers with a pleasant shopping experience while also enforcing company regulations and rules. My mangers knew what they were doing and would always teach me how to operate correctly. Additionally, my co-workers were all around the same age as I was and we would always be helping each other while creating professional and comfortable relationships. The hardest part of my job would have to be to always be pleasant and have a smile on your face despite your experiences and always offer your clients the best service you can. And I honestly just loved the work environment- it honestly didn't feel like work."
good,"worked here for many years, i am definitely the exception as i worked many hours but management loved me and i worked very hard. since i've left the company, i've heard they've become a lot less stringent which they needed to be. was way to uptight when i was there."
good,A good job when you are in high school working with friends. would like to get raises. You get a lot a retail exp and benefits. You can transfer stores to get extra hours.
good,"Each day was something new at Abercrombie. I was always learning how to do something new and came across many different types of people working there. The management is okay. Many of the managers are very nice, there is a little bit of a problem with scheduling. Almost all of my co-workers were very friendly people and I got along and worked very well with them. The hardest part of my job was language barriers between myself and some of the customers and just the everyday challenge of making sure the customer was satisfied with the service there. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting all of the different people and getting to see ahead of time what was going to be ""in"" for the next season."
good,"I have worked a Ambercrombie and Fitch for 2 and half years. My typical day includes taking packages off of shipping lines, opening the packages and making sure the customer was getting exactly what ordered. I learned to match items by sku numbers and how to tell who was making mistakes. I have not learned any management duties. The hardest part of my is trying to reach a high number of units. The most enjoyable part of my day is talking to co-workers at lunch."
good,There  has been alot of changes in the company and it has improve the customer service for the customer. The company has finally worried about the workers and what they have to say.
good,"I would work on the cashier, fitting rooms, folding clothes, greeting people and etc. I learned that not all customers are nice and calm working with retail and not everyone is the same. My co-workers were nice and responsible, some of them didn't do much. The hardest part of my job was folding some of the clothes; because you had to fold them a certain way. The most enjoyable day of my job was greeting customers and helping them find what they wanted."
good,"Great company to obtain skills from. Good pay and amazing benefits.  There are high expectations but opportunity for advancement.  "
good,"Fun place to work and meet coworkers from all walks of life. Amount of hours started off small, but if you put in the time and effort, you would be rewarded with more hours. Large sense of self direction and communication, always worked as a team."
good,It was good place to earn money while I was visiting family for the summer. I met a lot of nice people and the management was cool.
good,Great place to learn different areas in IT.  Most days are predictable. My co-workers/team are great to work with.  Overall a good place for entry level IT opportunities
good,I feel that the particular branch I worked with was managed well. I had the opportunity to work with and meet many new and interesting people. I enjoyed the many different duties I was expected to fulfill. The hardest part of  the job was the short breaks.  The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with new people on a daily basis.
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job included interacting with customers"
good,"great benefit, hands on traning, very competitive pay rates and the people are just great, the corporate culture is relaxed while there is a major feeling of benig a part of a team"
good,Just get the store ready for the next day fold a lot of clothes and clean closets and fitting rooms.
good,"Working with warehouse management system (WMS) using RF gun to ensure that shipping orders to the store in a managed time. When a PO order fails to be entered into the system properly, it comes to my department to be researched, fixed and reworked. Working and completing daily goals with management would is the most challenging and rewarding part of the work day."
good,Fun work environment and great benefits for after acquiring a BA.
good,I would start my day with cleaning the store and folding clothes. I would then stand in the front and greet customers. I learned how to present myself and communicate with customers better.
good,Working here has been a very eye opening experience. There are many opportunities for advancement once you meet there achievable requirements. The managers are great and understanding. The co-workers are from different backgrounds and ethnicities. There is never a dull moment there.
good,I would just fold the clothes ready to put them out on the shelves.
good,Great job during my high school days.  Loved being at the mall so why not get a job and the biggest and famous clothing store in my local area.  Staff was very friendly and diverse.  Most of the people I worked with were all in school still (college or high school).  Pay was minimum wage but you were pretty much working there for the discount.  Only boring part of the day was folding clothes.
good,Folding clothes was a main part of the job. Gained more customer service experience here and learned some problem solving techniques as well. Had to work with a team of employees on how to present the store neatly and in a quick manner.
good,"Pairing up with floor supervisor to give the part-time associates schedules breaks."
good,"I started as like Manager in Training, then i got promoted to be Visual Assistant Manager, after a year i got promoted to be a Store Manager at the kids store."
good,"Floor supervising was my main responsibility as well as associate training and shipment processing.  Staffing was always a constant struggle, we were always recruiting for more people to work for our company and finding the right associate to work was my goal.  I as a manager like to create a fun filled work place where my associates like to work with and for me, thus my workload was less and my job was made easier."
good,"Working at Ambercronbie and Fitch was not a bad experience per say. its just rules used to change so often, it seems that the management team was unprofessional, and young minded. though they were good people. i just disagreed with how they handled certain situations."
good,"Overall it was okay, I just wish I could have gotten more hours."
good,I have worked as a manager in training at Abercrombie since May. It is a great company with a great direction and employees. Unfortunately the store atmosphere caused me to leave. Other than atmosphere i had a great time and learned a lot from my manager. I was able to gain some great leadership skills from this experience. 
good,Simple tasks are assigned with guidelines to ensure simplistic and quicker finished product. Management is super helpful with all co-workers to make sure there is a team effort in every task. While working here one will learn fast pace organization skills.
good,It was a good environment. the people I worked with were really fun to be around.
good,"I had a good time while working at A&F. My co-workers where fun to be around, and just the job in general was pretty easy."
good,"I was brought on as an Assistant Manager in 2012 and have enjoyed my job for the most part. I was assigned to work at a local Hollister store. Christmas season can be miserable, the pay is enough to live on your own with but not much else, the benefits are great (full health, dental, vision, vacation time and 401k options). There has been a lot of turn-over with managers in my district lately, so there isn't a lot of overlap with managers, and that can make things even more stressful."
good,"The company provides the tools necessary to manage your business in any situation. The company culture is youthful, energetic, engaging, and aspirational. There are many business principles young managers can learn while they help manage one of the best known brands on the planet."
good,It was a fun place to work. It's a very youthful company to work for.
good,It a medium sized company back in 2009. I enjoyed being in a technical environment and i tried to learn what i can during my working period at Terascala.
good,I really enjoyed working hereI had to move to the awaesome city of New York. Although I have really falling in with love the city of New York and what it has to offer to the average person.
good,"Worked in a face paced environment with strong workers. The management was friendly and organized. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with happy, dynamic people. The hardest part of the job was the long drive."
good,Desempacar cajas llenas de ropa y darlas de alta en el sistema.
good,"Great first job with a lot of good incite to how a business works. Good place to gain costumer service skills. The employee turnover rate was very high, I saw many different workers there over the time I worked. Everyone who works there Is very young and fairly inexperienced so mistakes do happen."
good,"In my time of working at Abercrombie & Fitch, I found that they treated you fairly and allowed you to interact the easiest way you feel comfortable. if you help was needed, the management would pass on some helpful advise in order to help you adjust to a certain situation."
good,Met a lot of really great people and was able to really advance my social skills  I know have the ability to talk to anyone and feel comfortable in any sales situation
good,"- fun and relaxed environment"
good,"My work day consisted of organizing the store, closing/opening duties, and cashier work. It gave me a lot of customer service experience and was a fun place to work."
good,"While working in Abercrombie and Fitch I learned how to dress the mannequins, also how to help the customers and showing them other options in stores that they might have liked in case we didn't have what they were looking for specifically."
good,"- assigned a section "
good,"Working at Abercrombie was really fun. The reason why, is because everyone, including the managers were always so friendly and in a good mood. It always made me feel at home."
good,"It is a fun learning experience, which young beautiful staff and great friendly coworkers to interact with daily.  I enjoyed every day at work, however, pay was lower than what I was aiming to achieve, and when surrounded by staff of that age group, it kind of takes the motivation and hope of earning a promotion away.   I prefer to learn from the more experienced in my professional career, such as mentorship and such.  At Abercrombie & Fitch it felt more like a summer camp high-school party, than a career building experience in one professional life however."
good,"I worked seasonal as a Brand Representative at a kids store in San Diego. I really liked the overall environment at the store, it was pretty laid back. My co workers were some of the nicest people. Pretty much the entire staff were women, we had a few guys but it was definitely a female dominant staff. The general manager was pretty cool, she was nice and not crazy demanding. Now when you hear those stories about an immature atmosphere, in my case it was sort of correct. There were a few people who definitely had that high school in their twenties mentality but overall it wasn't horrible, it wasn't the entire staff, just a few coworkers. I basically folded clothes and greeted customers 99% of the time and did some cash handling and customer pick ups. Didn't get that many hours but what I did get was pretty decent. I would say to just stay on your toes if you get a job with the company and just mind your own business and you'll be fine."
good,"I was a key holder when I worked there. Most of my co-workers were fun to work with, just keep away from the drama if you can. It's routine day in day out - do opening or closing tasks, fold down the store, ring up customers. It's an easy job but can be a drag if it's slow. I left after upper management switched. The old district manager  told me I would move up to an MIT within a few months. Never happened even with the new DM and after constant talks about it. It was a waste of time going back and forth."
good,"a lot of good training "
good,Management would quickly decide if they liked you or not.  If they did you had great opportunities and work was enjoyable.  If they didn't you were not included in conversations that could be useful information for your job.
good,"I would work on the cash register, give excellent customer service. great team work skills. selling credit card and memberships, answering phone calls"
good,"team work, management was very helpful, I was tried to move up with the company due my experience but never got that opportunity I could be huge help for the company but never got the chance"
good,great place for kids working out of high school. laid back job. cool place.  fun and young staff. a clean place where the male employee has to be clean shaved and girls can't wear anything other than stud earrings
good,Was fast passed so time ran out quick which is great.... I left Because it was too much of a commute for me. the company is fine I enjoyed working there
good,"This was my first job, so I didn't really have anything to compare it to or have high expectations. I learned a lot of things from this job that I could use for the rest of my life. It primarily forced me to be more extroverted and to work more with people, which was something I wasn't too comfortable with at the time being the introvert that I was. Most importantly, I learned a lot about customer service and how to deal with people which is something crucial for most jobs that exist out there."
good,"Tout s'est bien passé dans l'ensemble, mais je suis dans le monde musical en parallèle et je voulais changer de corde de metier car une opportunité s'était présenter a moi du coup j'ai choisit d'arréter la vente."
good,Abercrombie and Fitch is a wonderful place to gain experience in customer service. They are very flexible with hours and hire numerous associates. Overall it is maybe a 6 on a scale of 10.
good,"As an employee at Abercrombie, the higher ups don't treat you any differently and give you a fair amount of responsibility depending on what type of worker you are. They essentially let you make your own schedule so working and school was possible."
good,"While working at Abercrombie and Fitch, I spent my time working on putting shipments of clothes in the bays or pulling them to restock on the sales floor when ever required."
good,"How busy you are varies based on holidays and time of day. I ended up training a lot of the new hires instead of the managers, which ended up being good experience for me. Everyone hired is a lot of fun and usually become friends outside of work- could seem cliquey to new hires at first."
good,Es una marca de lujo muy buena lamentablemente algo costosa y muy demandante en cuanto a lo laboral
good,"You are heavily involved with engaging with customers and have to be quick on your feet when problems occur. You do a bit of everything from handling the customers at the cash register, giving advice, tending to newly arrived merchandise, and fixing the store."
good,"esperienza da Abercrombie molto buona, buone capacità acquisite grazie ad essa."
good,"Abercrombie and Fitch is a good job for a younger person. its upbeat, easy going and very laid back. I enjoyed the job overall. the work was pretty easy and the managers were nice and very helpful."
good,"I love working here, it's a family environment. everything is all good except the hours are trash. If they gave us more hours less people would leave annually."
good,I enjoyed working at Abercrombie and Fitch i learned a lot while working there. I learned how to work well with others and i was very customer focused.
good,"More of a during high school type of job."
good,"Interacting with customers, loud music, dark lightening setting, fun, good hrs, can go to school and work this job, if interested in modeling good job to work in. Theres overnight shifts, and you get free clothing."
good,a typical day at work management work culture everything fits if you're looking fir a good part time job also if youre in school they flex your days and hours weekly
good,"The job itself was easy enough. However, company policy required only one manager and one brand representative on shift at a time, making shifts at times feel understaffed. At other times, the culture of the workplace would change with employees, from friendly to somewhat clique-like."
good,"Abercrombie is a great place to get a job that is not too demanding and very flexible in terms of hours. Dress code is very strict, but that's to be expected in an environment like that."
good,Being a  brand Representative is a good first job for college or High school students. The work place culture is relaxed and managers promote flexible schedules.
good,"always creativity flowing, fun and positive. The is always something to do whether its cleaning helping customers or at least trying on clothes to understand the fit of all styles and knowing how to pair and style customers."
good,"I liked working at Hollister Co. except I had different days off than my boyfriend which is why I decided to quit. Otherwise, I had a very positive experience in the MIT program."
good,"I would work for this company for part time work, very relaxed, mangers are okay , the tables are super heavy for overnight, also they should give more hours"
good,"it's not bad for a high school student as a part time job. very easy and laid-back environment. However, some managers play favoritism. It really depends on they like you or not. they give you more hours if they like you otherwise you will not get many hours, or you only get closing hours or opening hours which requires cleaning."
good,"A lot of time spent on your feet doing a range of different things like completing transactions, cleaning out fitting rooms, putting back clothing, cleaning up areas, etc. Can be stressful at times when District Managers are coming to evaluate, but overall a good experience."
good,"You get to work with great people, and the company has effective management that provides flexible hours that fit with a busy school schedule. The environment is laid back yet productive."
good,"it was great working there. Helping out stressed out customers during the busy hustle bustle of the holiday season always seems rewarding. The only downside was trying to find parking in the crowded mall parking lot, other than that it was a great job."
good,"Hardly ever busy, didn't receive proper training, coworkers weren't so welcoming or friendly. Easy job, know how to fold clothes and keep the store clean and greet every customer."
good,Relaxed place to work at. Had a good time even though the pay wasn't too much I met alot of people that i still keep in contact with today. Interesting job to say the least.
good,I spent 5+ years within the company and I enjoyed every year but the last. I developed friendships that have lasted years but the hardest part of the job was dealing with 4 hour shifts that were given to everyone at least 4x a week or more depending on the schedule.
good,"Learn about sales for that day, greet customers and make sure give great customers service, learn about our objective that goal, keep busy and make sure you are greeting every customers."
good,"It was very easy for me to get hired and I think it was a great place to start. I used to love the job but there's no room for growth. I was also uncomfortable with how often management changed, new managers wanted to change how the store was run completely and I lost interest."
good,"It's a good company to work for and there is great opportunity for growth."
good,"Be sure that you can work accordingly and efficiently, working as a team and you will have to work with customers occasionally. Get comfortable with working customers."
good,Had to deal with a lot of customers. Some of them were nice and some of them were extremely rude. Had to fold and organize clothes. And the managers were very pushy about it.
good,I was able to enjoy a fast paced environment and be in my relaxed wear and listen to music and still get work done. Different transition from a call center
good,The job was enjoyable overall but the lack of flexibility of their hours made my experience there stressful. The hardest part was finding inventory in the stock room.
good,I basically loaded boxest full of clothes in a tiely fasion. a tyipical work day consists of walking up and down isles putting clothes into boxes but doing it very fast.
good,"10 hour shift from 6am to 4 pm, but it depends on how many orders a day the wahehouse has. Nice supervisers, attendance bonuses, good place for work for people who do not have any education"
good,I was very pleased to be working at Abercrombie and Fitch in many different aspects because I was able to build upon my customer relationship skills and understand the culture beyond than shopping in the store.
good,Started as a regular mode (employee) that greets people in the front and worked my way up to stock part time manager which was great. It is a fun environment to work in due to the people there and how the platform is. Really easy to balance with school and work because they work with you.
good,"great for a starter job. the managers are cool, and they hire cool people as well. everything is positive and teamwork. make sure you do your tasks and complete them in an orderly fashion."
good,A typical day at work was busy most of the time. The employees were nice and friendly. We all got our work done and there wasn't anything hard about the job. I would have stayed there but at the time I didn't have reliable transportation.
good,"Great campus with wonderful atmosphere. Great for people just out of college, but after about 5 years or so people look to move on to other things."
good,I worked with A&F for a few months and it was a really great and upbeat environment. The employees and managers are really great. I highly recommend to anyone looking to start a job in retail.
good,Fun place for young adults(18-25) to work at while attending school. A lot of organizing and setting up for each season. Good job to gain experience in the retail sector.
good,"Great first job out of college, but people often tend to get trapped. Take it for what is and move on after a year or so. there is a lot of opportunity for advancement, but you must be willing to make drastic moves."
good,Had a good time working there. Made a lot of friends that I am still friends with today. No real complaints about the staff and manager. Wouldn't mind working there again
good,"My time spent at Abercrombie and Fitch as an associate was a enjoyable time. The job was very social and you got to interact with customers daily and I found that to be very enjoyable. However, I found that there was very small oppurtunities for you to move up in the company past a certain point."
good,"A typical day of work for me included the completion of various tasks, including: maintaining the store, greeting and assisting customers, and promoting the overall safety of the storefront. While I was employed there, I learned that I had the capacity to be assertive, preventing theft on multiple occasions, as well as the ability to converse with any individual. My managers highly respected my work ethic, giving me approximately forty hours of work each week, which vastly exceeded that of my fellow employees."
good,"Hardest part of the job having awful customers"
good,"A typical day at work includes a few sweeps of the store to make sure there are no missing security tags (due to the fact we don't have security cameras in the stores). Your coworkers are most likely  attractive, young males and females. Requires communication with customers as far as making sure they are enjoying there shopping experience and are up to date on online and in-store sales promotions. We are very high maintenance on keeping inventory up to date and making sure our stock room is neat and organized. Restocking the store is also very important especially the stores with high volume. Sometimes you have a manager during your shift, sometimes you don't so you have to be a self motivated, independent worker and stay focused whether you're supervised or not...that's my favorite part. The least enjoyable part would have to be scheduling mishaps and miscommunication between managers. Overall good quality job to have if you're a student with not many bills."
good,"Handle shipment, stockroom, customer service and give associates task for the day. Young environment with co-workers in highschool or college. Managers are recent grads. Job can be very repetitive. Days off are on Tues and Sunday. Can be moved around once in a while."
good,"Overall this is a very enjoyable job. A typical day at work consists of helping customers, keeping the store neat and clean, and check people out. This job has really helped me with my social skills and the importance of time management skills.The management is great at work with my schedule. I enjoy working with majority of the staff and have built many great relationships. The hardest part of the job would probably be having try and please unsatisfied customers. The most enjoyable part would definitely be getting to work with a great staff and making many new friends. The only downfall to this job really would be the pay."
good,"The home office is always willing to have you back to work, which is great for periods in which you are off of school and have time to work. A lot of your experience depends on your own attitude. Most people I worked with were great, but some people tend to slack off. Sometimes you will be given hours at very odd times of the day as they always need people early in the morning and late in the evening. Overall, it's a good job to have throughout your late high school/ early college years, but sometimes the music and smell can be a bit much."

good,"Un chouette esprit, une bonne entente avec les collégues ainsi que les managers."

good,I worked here when I was in high school and when I came home from school during college. It was a part time job and there's really no strong input regarding this job
good,Working at Abercrombie and Fitch was very easy to me it was maintaining clean and folded clothes the hardest which to me i consider easy. I enjoyed the register and helping people management was very laid back and co-workers had an awesome attitude.
good,"My first day on the job was nerve wrecking, I didn't want to mess anything being the new hire and all. After getting trained by a fellow employee on how to work the register, fold the clothing the proper way and how to keep the inventory intact. The management could have not been better; it was well maintained and kept up to par with what was needed to be done. The hardest part of the job is keeping a smile on my face even though some costumers can be difficult, other than that, its a fun place to be employed at."
good,"Its fun, you meet new people, you get to work with wonderful co workers, and its a pretty laid back place to work at. Does not pay much, but as long as you're happy all is good."
good,A typical day at Abercrombie and Fitch is never a stressful one. The relaxed atmosphere makes it easy to accomplish goals and maintain a positive attitude. I've learned important management skills.
good,This job was a very good starter job for me. My typical day was to show up to work and stand for hours while people took pictures of me. I learned that I dont want to work in the clothing business for a carrier. The management structure in stores was pretty good. The co workers for the company were fun and out going generally. The hardest part of the job the lack of activity. The most enjoyable part was the easy part of the job.
good,"Fun job but did not give many hours. The three years that I've been there, I have never received a raise. Also, being on-call was kind of a hassle."
good,I was responsible for managing and training all assistant managers as well as up to 60 associates. The most enjoyable part of the job were the people I worked with. I also enjoyed the recruiting/hiring process to ensure we had the best team.
good,I helped with visuals and customers service. Was a cashier and merchandiser. Loved the layout of the store and visual concepts. They had a decent associate discount. Had a good team.
good,"My experience with A&F was not a negative one. The managers and nice and laid back young people, and my co-workers were nice and upbeat individuals too, but the company culture was not a good fit for me."
good,receiving shipments. security tag clothing items. organize stockroom. i learned that teamwork was very important to get project done for the whole staff to be involved makes everything easier for a team member individually.

good,Typical day at work would be I would go into backstock where the clothes were separated into different bays. Then I would fold the clothes to make them look perfect and set them up so photos could be taken of the required clothing. Everyone was really friendly always joking around but in a positive manner. There really was not a hard part to the job.
good,This is a fun place to work for if you are looking for a part-time job. It is very upbeat and you will always be busy.
good,"I worked here during my college years. Very flexible. Upon obtaining bachelors, you are able to apply for MIT position."
good,"Great coworkers, executive management are a bit out of touch."
good,"A typical day at work, I walk in and greet my team members. I then go to the back and put my belongings in a locker. From there I check-in at the cash register and begin the work day by doing inventory and restocking the shelves, as well as reorganizing the clothes already out. I learned to work with others quite well and the management here was ok, I wouldn't say the best. My co-workers were welcoming and open minded, they taught me many techniques without being asked to. The hardest part of the job was being young and impatient, I'd want to leave and hang out with friends and check my phone. The most enjoyable part was being able to work in this environment as well as getting paid for it. This was my very first job and I had to cut it short due to athletics in highschool."
good,"I was cashier and was on the sales. It was a good place to work at, it was always busy so there was always something to do at the job."
good,"Working at this place was great in most ways. If it had not been for a  specific VP of Design and Construction that lacked diversity training it was great. The culture even for older people was vibrant and fun. During my time there it was always an exciting place to be. You worked hard, but it was worth it in the end."

good,"I learned the ins and outs of running a business from my time at Abercrombie and Fitch. They have a Management training program that allows you to learn while working hands on in the store. I loved my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is the retail hours (weekends, nights, and holidays). Customer service skills are a must, otherwise you'll hate your life. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I got to work with and learn from, and wearing jeans and flip flops to work."
good,"Abercrombie and Fitch was my first management position right out of undergrad. This is a very detailed training plan for future managers in a great, fun , fast paced environment. "
good,"You come in grab a lift and pull orders for that day. Co workers are great everyone is willing to help out if you need help. the hardest part of the job would be the fingers line, they never put enough people to do the job correctly. Best part of the day is clocking out at 345."

I learned how to use a cash register, how to properly fold clothes and became more confident talking to strangers.  My manager had a great balance of making a comfortable and enjoyable working, and getting us to do our jobs.  My manager was an expert on motivating and galvanizing her employees.  All of my co-workers made working fun and enjoyable.  I've made a lot friends working there and built a great chemistry which got a lot of work done.  The hardest part of the job was closing after the customer had finished going through the store.  Other than closing the store, I enjoyed every aspect of the job."

Also gained experience in using inventory maintenance equipment in order to maintain a proper balance of stock within the stock room and on the floor."
good,"This job teaches time management skills and helps build up a person's communication skills while interacting with customers in a professional manner. Abercrombie and Fitch is a diverse and flexible job where an individual can easily adapt to their job duties once they are hired. My co-worker are extremely friendly and very helpful. I grew a close bond with them outside of the work environment. I would say the hardest part of this job for me is the lack of hours I get when the company has no hours to give to its employees. Moreover, there's are also enjoyable part of this job. The few likable part of this job is working with people the same age group you. Additional, getting to interact with customers on a daily basis and producing excellent customer service. Last but not least, the 50% discount we are provided with when it comes to employees purchasing their triple A. Overall, I have learned so much working here. I have even gain a better understanding of the retail lifestyle and what goes on behind it. I have even developed a love for personal growth and helping others."
good,"Typical day at work would simply involve me standing in front of the store greeting customers and just walking around to see if customers need or have any questions. After a while, I would tell them about sales and tried convincing them to buy things at our store. If I worked in the morning we wouldn't have many customers so I would simply just sit in the back and take care of shipment for people in the afternoon. Also less coworkers in the morning so it was very slow, but most of the time the mornings went by pretty fast. I can honestly say for the first time ever in a job, I enjoyed everyone at my work place. Everyone was fun and outgoing and we just did what we had to do. "
good,Typical day at work started with a five minute meeting then read what I was doing for my shift and then got to work. I learned that work can be tiring but you should never quit. I also learned some tricks on how to work retail. Management were nice and friendly. So were the co-workers. The hardest part of the job were the inconsiderate customers and the most enjoyable part was the music
good,"Managing a multi-million dollar business and creating the best in-store experience, recruiting, creating diversity, human resources, store operations and visual merchandising. "
good,I think abercrombie was an ok job. but iwasent getting enough time to work and i was getting minimum wage.
good,A good first job for a college student. Most of the employees are similar ages and it is a cool laid back place to work.

good,Coworkers were great and fun to be around. I was never a boring day when i was working their. We would always make each other laugh. The management was okay. The managers were mostly strict but loose up after time.
good,"Over all while working at Abercrombie, i've liked the experience. As a first job it was a smart decision and i have learned a lot while there. The diversity of the people made me learn to appreciate others a lot more and made the work experience more fun. The management is usually very nice but strict, as it should be. The hours are usually very flexible and fair. Most people were pleasant. The job wasn't really hard so long as you completed your tasks correctly the first time. I really enjoyed the music and clothing, the atmosphere of the job is one that makes people want to work there. It has been a great experience in the past two years and i do enjoy going back to work more frequently when i am not always away due to school."
good,I learned the importance of diversity.
good,great management but very strict on time rules but overall a good work place.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job at Abercrombie & Fitch was being around people. I love to help people in difficult of easy situations. There is always a positive outcome after every situation.
good,While working for Abercrombie and Fitch my responsibilities mainly included helping customers find the products they were looking for and making sure they had a positive experience while in the store. My secondary responsibilities was maintaining the stockroom and making sure it was kept in an orderly fashion.
good,"A typical day would be a lot of work, and no play because it is the employee's mission to provide great customer service, and make sure the store is in perfect condition. I've learned that working there is that you need patience, and time to figure out what you have to accomplish. The co-workers were peaceful, didn't have any problems with them. The hardest part of the job was having to stay late, and prepare for the next day. The most enjoyable part of the job were the people and customers."
good,"Most of my time with this company was spent helping customers choose outfits that best fit their body compositions. At the end of the day I would help clean the store and make sure that it is presentable for the next day. Throughout the year, I learned how to work the cash registers and handle the money. Most enjoyable part of the job was the people I got to interact with on a regular basis. My co-workers were energetic and positive, and the customers were always lively and pleasant to chat with."
good,"A typical day at Abercrombie Kids would be, you clock in then ask the manager what needs to be done, after you are done with one task you ask for another one. Also you fold clothes and organize the piles that are on the display tables or put more clothes out there if there is a small pile. What I have learned at Abercrombie Kids is that you can not really make friends there because its alway busy or they just do not want to communitcate with you. The management is very strict and they are all about detail when it comes to folding clothes and organizing the clothes on the display tables. The co-workers are not very talkative or they just do not want to talk to you so it is pretty have to have a conversation. The hardest part of the job is keepin gup with the detail because everything has to be perfect. The most enjoyable part of the job is doing the shipments because you get to listen to music while you are unloading so it's not boring job to do."
good,make sure the store is organized
good,Working at Abercrombie & Fitch was fun retail employment. I enjoyed helping customers put together outfits and assisting their every need.

good,"I loved going to work everyday, and enjoyed the customers and coworkers, as well as the merchandise!"
good,fun environment for recent grads/current students that need just little extra cash
good,"The MIT program is a good start for who doesn't know anything about retail and want to learn more about retail operations, visual merchandizing."
good,"The job is great if you need a flexible schedule because you get to control the days you are scheduled so you can always preplan your future days off so you can usually find someone to cover for a shift. However, since the company constanly hires new people, you dont always have a stable amount of hours to rely on unless the scheduling manager favors you."
good,Overall good experience I only wish some managers actually respected my time considering the fact that I go to college taking 16 cred courses but other than that most days its cool and customers will be annoying
good,"Abercrombie & Fitch is a fast paced clothing store. My only problem were the customers & the pay. Before minimum wage was pushed up to $10-15 an hr., I was receiving $8 an hr. The customers were all so messy, rude, had foul scents. The environment was great, though."
good,Great pay for peak season associates and lots of giveaways during that time if your looking to make extra money during the holiday season. We have an easy and quick interview and hiring process.
good,I worked for Abercrombie years ago when I was in high school and it was one of my first jobs and it taught me the bases of working and the structure of how the work life will be in the future.
good,I love working at Abercrombie! It’s a great job especially if you’re a high school or college student. They managers usually work with your availability and schedule you accordingly! It’s a very friendly and welcoming environment!
good,Customers and fellow employees are very nice. Awesome 50 percent employee discount. There is pressure to meet sales goals but its not unrealistic. Overall enjoy my job.
good,"I love working here but the pay is not enough for what a brand representative does. There is no opportunity to work up on the pay. Minimum wage is $7.25 in PA and it is not worth staying at the company for long. Especially for those who have stayed for more than a year, there isn't even a $0.25 upgrade in pay. NOTHING. That is definitely the worst part about it"
good,"It was great working at A&F especially since they re-vamped the store into more spacious and brighter. The management was great and understanding when you couldn't work some hours due to school. The only bad thing was that people were either barley had hours or given hours almost everyday of the week. They hired too many people for the holidays which caused half of the workers without hours. Co-workers were constantly calling off, so that was annoying."
good,It was a good place to work.  It was a temp job for me to make some money before college started.  It was in a heavy traffic area so you stay busy.  Great eateries around it too
good,Job was extremely fun and you get to meet a lot of people.  The pay is very low starting off which makes it hard to pay student loans and rent at the same time.
good,Loved the people I worked with. Everyone was friendly and they were willing to accommodate my pregnancy requests and had patience. They understood my situation and was a very cohesive team!
good,"I was a member of the staff team so my job was to help all our clients, fold the clothes, and charge in the cash register. It is a store of high renown worldwide so it was an unforgettable experience in my life. I learned to deal with clients in this type of circumstance. As a member of the team of managers, I was responsible of teaching other colleagues different work techniques for greater performance."
good,"Stocking and helping customers was a very typical day at work, learned how to manage my time while working and busy situations. very diverse culture with strict store policy. Hardest part was close and most enjoyable part was running cash registers"
good,Good relationship with colleagues and having communication with customers from different backgrounds.
good,A productive team of people all pushing to reach earning goals. The management team continued to work with associates in order to help see the entire location prosper.
good,Abercrombie & Fitch at West Town is a great job for students. They are super flexible and will work with your school schedule. It is a low-stress job that provides an opportunity to gain social skills and customer service skills. The managers are understanding and easy to work with. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people that work at this company. The hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult customers.
good,"It wasn't as bad as I've heard it to be, but when ever people called out it does seem to become a little too much. The people were great and the benefits was worth working there."
good,"Learned how the retail work works."
good,It's great working there. Definitely a fun work environment. Management could be a little difficult to work with. I learned how to work with several different cultuers
good,"Honolulu, HI: Respectful and laid back working environment, nice coworkers, managers are very understanding regarding work/life balance. Employee discount (60% off).  RECOMMEND at this location as an entry job. "
good,"Great experience and great people! The Abercrombie corporation has a negative stigma attached to it, yet over the past 3 years the company has made strides in improving this. Great clothes and great people."
good,working at the kids store was very fun and relaxed but also taken very seriously. working in the adult store was more fast paced and demanding but the coworkers were helpful and nice
good,"It's a fun environment, the focus has shifted from good looking people to the actual product which is the right direction for this company. I hope that this company sticks around for a while longer."
good,"Abercrombie and Fitch is a great company to work for as a first job, or a transition. The work environment is perfect if you’re looking to improve your customer service skills. Management was very friendly and understanding. The brand associates are mainly people  who are 18-22, so they are easy to get along if you’re just starting off. The store I worked at was usually busy, so there’s always something to do too stay productive."
good,"overall a place that is accommodating to a large mass of employees. Highly organized and task oriented job description with simple guidelines that are provided to ensure both customer satisfaction and employee ease. "
good,The job was not very hard at all. the managers at the florida mall are amazing and the employees are competent. if you're looking for a first job that is flexible with school and that is not too hard then this is the place to work.
good,This company was pretty good it taught me a lot when it comes to customer service and how to deal with a customer even though the customer can be rude.
good,In Abercrombie I help customers find sizes that they need. I help with finding items the customers can give as gift. I also help with returns and answering the phone.
good,Easy to manage job with flexible hours but not always guaranteed hours. I found this job to be very good to work with my school schedule and it is a good first job for anyone just starting to apply for jobs
good,"Very fun places to work, music upbeat, co-workers very friendly, easy tasks, great learning experience, working with a lot of age group, great products"
good,"Management is okay depending on the day. Associates get along pretty well. Discount is okay again depending on the month. Overall decent job, if you're looking for an easy job"
good,"this retail / sales associate job is a good first job"
good,"when I was hired in Abercrombie, I was so exited because it was my first job. the first day my manager learned me everything about the store and what should I do. I learned many things from there. like when someone came to store what should I do and what to said.i learned about customer service."
good,"This happened to be my first real job experience, I worked approximately 20 hours a week. It was a good way to learn customer service and leadership skills; however, I wasn't paid enough for the work I had to do."
good,Everyday I improved my communication skills with the customers. At the beginning it is very hard to get in touch but by the end you have a nice conversation with a customer.
good,"For a first job, Abercrombie & Fitch isn't too bad. The people are all really nice and for the most part, managers are easy going and fun to work underneath. However, I wouldn't recommend staying any longer than a year to two years. Raises aren't offered to part-time staff and advancement opportunities are scarce to nonexistent. The same can be said for full-time positions outside of management. Benefits are also not offered to part-time staff, aside from 401ks after working for two years with the company. "
good,Probaly a good place to work as a a full time employee but I only was offered a seasonal position with a chance of a full time offer at the end of the season. Only weekend and evening shifts were offered at the end of the season which did not meet my needs.
good,A great job out of college to gain workplace experience. Store operations very organized. Hardest part of job is keeping store up to company visual standards.
good,This is a place to work where you're in college for the first two years. You learn basic of a firm along with real life example of customer service. Most of the consumers will your daily sales.
good,"La mia mansione consisteva nel fare cassa, quindi ero in cassa tutto il giorno (più sistemare i tavoli davanti la cassa e i profumi) e a turno si andava in camerino, per controllare i capi che i clienti provavano.  Inoltre capitava di aiutare in magazzino o di fare l'apertura del negozio, quindi mettere il profumo su tutti i manichini del negozio, rifornire le casse con i sacchetti e portare delle ceste vuote dove poter mettere i resi delle persone."
good,"As an impact at abercrombie kids, I would be in the back helping with stocks, folding and arranging gear and accessories, and doing any tasks on the list that we were all provided with."
good,"open and close the store, recruits, interview, develop and train staff, do floorsets, working with the people was the best part of the job because you chose who you worked with"
good,i enjoyed working for this company i just wish i had a higher pay i also needed more hours. this company is very flexible and understanding but very difficult to get hours
good,a typical day at work would require you to clock in and receive management introduction. then a follow up of the daily agenda and afterwards folding inventory
good,"Had to partner with Store Manager in performance appraisals and setting goals. Maintain business awareness, and drive sales in order to achieve and exceed goalsFacilitate hiring and recruiting; actively attracting and attaining talentManage and maintain a high standard for overall Customer Care, and Loss Prevention. Educate the staff on all Home Office operational communication and initiatives"
good,"Typical day at work is starting opening procedures, and cleaning tasks, then getting the day started. Workplace culture is intended to be a very helpful one, especially, if you have a team that truly works together, and each one picks up each other, and everyone holds each other accountable. Hardest part of the job is the intense, fast-paced, work-load, especially, when there are deadlines to meet. Most enjoyable part of the job is meeting many new faces, considering that the company hires a lot, since many associates come and go quickly, and the roster, depending upon the brand of the company can range from 40-120 people. Definitely though, the greatest part was getting to meet so many people, and learning a lot about them, and the diversity one gets exposed to, which made the work environment so much more fun."
good,"You get to learn a lot working here. I worked at the Fashion Show Mall location, and I was able to assist guests from all over the world. Management age gap is not too far off from the associates, so they completely understand our current position. Everyone got along well, and overall promotes a very friendly environment. "
good,A typical day at work would involve folding clothes attending new customers that walked in informing them with the specials the store had. What I learned was how to understand people's needs even more than before. The hardest part of the job was keeping everything presentable after customers came in to keep the store presentable. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to make customers happy in funding things they needed.
good,During my time at Abercrombie I'd sweep and wipe down any messes in the store. I'd also meet and greet nice and interesting people from different parts of the world. Also at times I would have to check a customer out after they've finished shopping. It was a wonderful experience in which I was able to interact with others and learn from them.
good,"If you are looking to learn all aspects of management, great place! however there is not a great work life balance in retail. "
good,"I learned how to work very hard at Abercrombie. I would go in most days to open up at 6am and it we would go nonstop for the entire shift. I learned great customer service skills, including patience. I enjoyed the culture and environment as we were located in a good area of Dallas and the business was flowing."
good,"Good job but really boring when it is not Christmas. Do not expect to be full time, nobody but managers are. Managers are not really strict and are reasonable."
good,My position was somewhat monotonous. My brand reps were all teens and they taught me how to work with different kinds of people with many different attitudes.
good,"Great atmosphere, but communication to the masses is not successful. Mostly done word of mouth through the gossip mill or from another department, rarely from your own team."
good,"Typical day at work is about a 4-6 hour shift maintaining a sales floor.Immediate management is really nice, most are flexible and work with employees"
good,Not bad place to work. can get very busy and it can be very demanding at times. But all in all it was a great place to work breaks could be a bit longer other than that loved working here
good,Other than the constant loud music and cologne being pumped out through the vents this place was great to work at. Fun environment and great people to be around.
good,The hardest part of this job is trying to multitask when the store is busy and kids are running around and you need to help new employees and stay in control of everything going on wether you're on the phone or cashing a customer.
good,"After a few months, VERY hard to get scheduled; they are always overstaffed but the work enviroment is lovely. Everybody gets along, and since the store is smaller, easy to remember all the setups"
good,Good atmosphere great music just keep a positive attitude every day if you like dealing with people. Sometimes the managers are really nice but it's the best time to work every season
good,"They work very well with your schedule so its up to you how much or how often you allow them to work you, the longer your there the more hours you can get. Through the times I've been there they have employment rate up and down often as well as times with lots of management then back to one or two managers. Register is easy to learn and you catch on quickly once put on register during rush hours. if your wanting to make a lot of money this isn't the place because you never get a raise no matter how long your here and it will never change."
good,There is always something to do so time at work goes by fairly quickly and you never get bored. People there are great coworkers and great managers. Overall good environment to work at.
good,For managers it is strictly about running the business from when you come in till the time you leave. If you have a good management team and train your associates well and hold them accountable your job is a lot easier.
good,"This was a fun work environment the staff is really friendly and easy to talk to and easy going.  The work was confusing and hard to learn at first but when i learned it, it was doable.  As impact I would stock the back shelves with purchased clothing and re stock the purchases on the floor."
good,"I worked over night from 9 pm until all the fixtures racks,tables and clothes were neatly folded and fixed. Size stickers were placed on all items .certain items had to be folded certain ways . Alarms to be placed on the clothes"
good,"Very fun place to work, you meet a lot of people and make a lot of friends. Management is not very hard, but gets boring after a while. The pay is not enough to feel safe in the long term."
good,"Good managemnt. Work with nany toung talented people."
good,Great atmosphere. A lot of customer service experience. Worked with a variety of clientele to meet their needs. Interfaced with a lot of customers. Sold a lot of clothing. Helped customers meet their needs. Did inventory and stock management. Organized the displays in the store for presentation.
good,"Friendly environment, but work place was under managed. The actual manager did not feel like showing up for work so they had to get a last minute manager to fill in from another store."
good,"For a retail store I had great experience with them. Management is great Very helpful, especially, when your attending school. There are many different types of diversity and great way to see different cultures when customers are purchasing items. Co-workers are amazing. It is a great company to start with."
good,"Typically kept store neat, assisted customers, and worked the registers. Learned how to be open and talk with customers really well here."
good,"I've always wanted to work at Abercombie & Fitch, I like their clothing style & the quality of the clothing is good, i've never had to throw away any of my Abercrombie clothes, you get what you pay for."
good,I was firstly wanna apply MIT in this company and the management team are not really care about their employee and their needs. So I've been told to wait for the district manager and have further conversation with him. And I am still waiting.
good,You get promoted quick and learn everything on the job. Overnights are hard but beneficial. Meeting new is always fun for tourist stores.
good,"Working for Abercrombie is like working with your family.  It is very easy to build relationships with your full time and part time team.  There are great opportunities to learn about visual aspects of a store as well as the business behind the store front. A typical day at work is running the sales floor and directing part time associates to provide great customer service.  The most enjoyable part of the job in my opinion is setting our floor sets and changing the visuals in the store, it is very detailed and you have to be extremely aware of time management.  The hardest part of the job would be hours management, but as soon as you understand the impact on the business and how to calculate possible additions you will be fine for the rest of the time.  I have learned how to communicate with all levels of management as well as customers and associates.  Dealing with difficult situations has provided great insight for other situations that have come along the way in my years working for the company.  I have made amazing relationships that will last a lifetime and have had great experiences that have helped me grow as a person and a manager."
good,"My typical day at Abercrombie & Fitch would consist of checking new merchandise ,folding and arranging clothes , stocking and providing customer service when i run the sales floor to replace merchandise."
good,Nice place to start learning about retail and merchandising. As well as how to deal with different personalities and cultures.
good,My position at Abercrombie and Fitch was a model or in other words a sales Associate. The job was temporary throughout the summer like most of my other jobs. In a typical work day you are usually maintaining the overall neat and cleanliness of the store. Sometimes you would have to operate registers and also provide the best customer service you can possibly give to people. The work environment was great because you meet people of all different personalities and backgrounds which helps the store have a happy and safe environment.
good,"Une journée de travail typique commence à 6h et termine à 10h. Malgré le travail en matinée tout le monde est de très bonne humeur et l'équipe est super. J'ai travaillé avec un contrat à durée déterminée et j'avais d'autres projets après cela. "
good,Worked mostly with the development of people at multiple locations. Performed overall store audits and reviewed business opportunities with managers at each store. Conduct interviews as well as recruiting candidates for full time positions. Working with an amazing team was definitely the highlight of the job as well as all the exciting places the company has sent me to further develop the business and my skills.
good,"a typical day for me is always meeting someone new ,knowing people really makes work go by quick. "
good,"Not half as bad as the media portrays it to be, fun atmosphere, great learning experience and enhances leadership skills"
good,"I had worked more during the summer than I do now and each day was a lot of fun. Most of the days were on again off again busy and very fast paced during then. Customers were easy to talk to and coworkers and managers made the hours go by quickly! I appreciated the managers as individuals, but the management itself was too much. I felt like they weren't clear in certain employees positions, whether they were taking a part time job or seasonal. They hired too many people too often, and I almost felt like each time I came into work, I worked with a new employee each time. My coworkers were a lot of fun and I felt like I was pretty much working with friends. They understood what each of us went through and they were able to share the same pros and cons of the job. I think the hardest part of the job was working cash wrap in the beginning, since I wasn't comfortable doing it. But, it was also the most enjoyable part of the job, because I have always wanted to work at a cash register. I also just loved working with others to make customers happy and satisfied!"
good,Home office is a fun environment to be a part off.  The best part of the job was being able to work with cross functional teams to impact the business.
good,"Working in retail is a great job to help pay your way for school. Abercrombie is extremely flexible with hours to match your outside life. Management turn over rate is fairly high so you tend to have multiple within a short time. The manager you do have though are very kind and enjoyable to work with. Stock is much more demanding compared to the sales associates on the sales floor. An average day includes receiving and processing shipment then placing items either out on the floor right away (according to audits performed when the box is scanned in) or back-stocked in the bays, filling the sales floor based on items sold, maintaining order of the merchandise within the bays, helping out on the sales floor when needed, and other miscellaneous tasks such as cleaning and taking out the trash. Performing audits on the sales floor to ensure all product is out and ""remerching"" closets is done from time to time. Sales floor updates, transfers, and pricing merchandise is also done from time to time."
good,"I started out as a manager in training and moved pretty quickly from an assistant manager to a store manager.  Its a great entry level job with hands on training and skills that I think are helpful in the workforce. I learned a lot about leadership, management, recruiting, and hiring.  Coworkers are the best part, its a casual environment and you work around young people. The hardest part is managing people around your own age."
good,Great company with great benefits. Company employees young collage graduates with little or no experience.Enjoyed working in a friendly environment.
good,Typical day at work would be greeting people helping customers with whatever needs they have. The hardest part about the job would be learning product and remembering where everything is because its never in the same place for long. My co-workers i worked with were very fun and outgoing. It really made work fun and go by fast.
good,"aprendizaje en Ingles, buena direccion de la empresa, muy buen ambiente de trabajo con diferentes culturas ya que es una empresa internacional en la contratacion de su personal incluyen a personas de diferentes lugares del mundo y eso es muy enriquecedor tanto cara al publico asi como tambien a crecer en el ambito personal."
good,"∴	Gestion de 50+ employés et réalisation d’un chiffre d’affaire annuelle de 2.2 million d’euros"
good,"I started with this company when I was 16, it was my first payroll job."
good,"The work environment at Abercrombie and Fitch differs every single day. One thing I've learned the most working at this store is to be flexible and ready for unexpected changes throughout the day. I've learned how to have exceptional customer service and maintain fun yet professional relationships with my staff. The hardest part of this job is balancing work and personal life. Because of the long hours, days off changing every week, and working holidays, my work life definitely over powered seeing my family and friends. The most enjoyable part of the job is that there is always something to do. Floor sets, audits, standardizing, schedules, recruiting, are some of the few things that we do every day. Management changes quite frequently within the company, since the company only promotes within, so i've been through many co-workers at the two stores i work at. All managers are friendly, outgoing, and ambitious. A typical day consists of customer service, recruiting, tasking out associates, overseeing stockroom management/processing shipment, cleaning etc."
good,"Typical day includes scanning shipment of new clothes, helping customers by answering questions or finding clothes for them, and restocking clothes onto the sales floor at closing time. Being an employee can be fun with the current managing team and other employees. The pace can be fast at moments, but overall the atmosphere is pretty calm and operational hours go smoothly."
good,"I was able to meet people from all different backgrounds, learning different cultures. Enjoyed my time there."
good,"Typically as a manager we open or close the store, and work 40 hrs a week.  The flow of customers varies daily as well as tasks sent in by home office every morning.  We have a small management team of three, and we work well together and can keep our schedules flexible each week.  The hardest part of the job can be dealing with uncomfortable or difficult situations with unhappy customers, but on the other hand, successfully solving any customer issues is gratifying.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the people we work with.  Associates and managers work well as a team and have fun working together each day."
good,A place good for beginners searching for a job and requires no experience. You basically can choose to be a model or Impact Associate which you will mostly work in the back if your to yourself.
good,"•	Model - Represent the brand by providing great customer service and maintaining presentation standards. "
good,"great work environment, very professional but casually dressed."

good,"Have had good day at work,learned to work with co-operative manner,friendly and helpful co-worker."
good,Talking to customers selling the brand. Amazing employees and lots of face to face time with customers.
good,"Managing an Abercrombie & Fitch is a very demanding job from the time that you spend there to how much is expected of you. You are given all of the tools that you need, but in order to do well you will spend a huge portion of your personal time recruiting and getting calls from the store."
good,"The Place was cool ,coworkers are very friendly and lay back"
good,"Nice experience working with team members"
good,"management is great"
good,From the time the store opens the customer complaints is mainly about how dark and how loud it is all day.
good,"Be ready to Fold! A Typical day at Abercrombie is very tedious. From the moment you walk in the door to the moment you leave your folding clothes or giving a customer ""a great store experience."" Management always varies. You can have the very laid back manager but gets work done or the super uptight manager who takes their authority to seriously. co-workers are always great. the hardest part of the job is that over time it gets very tedious. Its none stop folding. The most enjoyable would be working with fun loving people."
good,Everyday is hard working and productive. Co-workers are kind. The hardest part of the job is standing in one spot for that long amount of time. The most enjoyable was getting paid and my days off.
good,Was able to stay informed with fashion and current trends. I enjoyed helping design and answering customer questions about fashion. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the customer leave the store happy with their purchase.
good,"-typical day get busy around 12 and will remain busy until close"
good,"A typical day consists of maintaining the stock room, engaging with customers to promote sales, and maintaining the sales floor. At Abercrombie I learned how to fold several varieties shirts and how to work with a diverse community of people. The management at Hollister were unique and organized, mainly because they were always open to assistance from employees. My co-workers were like a family to me. We had fun on the job but when it came down to our job description we took it serious. We were workers at our best. The hardest part of the job would be when I had to manually look up items for customers on the sales floor in result of our faulty input devices. The most enjoyable part was just working there in general, networking, and the best clothing discounts offered."
good,You build great friendships with coworkers and if your in high school its good job that you balance both school and work
good,I loved working here! I met so many of my friends while working there.
good,"Learned how to fold clothes better, the management was good, got along well with everyone. my co-workers were fun and friendly. The most enjoyable part was getting to know the workers, learning about different races."
good,always stayed busy assisting customers. Had really good management and enjoyed working with co-workers.
good,"A typical day at work would be stock room maintenance, cleaning, preparing the sales floor for new arrivals, working long hours but it was worth it, had lots of great co-workers and there was no part of it that was hard."
good,"A typical day at work would be to come in, find out what needs to be done to the store (closet changes, clothes that need tobe moved around or taken out, or marketed down), find out how you are on hours as far as if your under or over for the week. Another thing is to make sure everyone at work knew what they were supposed to do and was knowledgable of our company."
good,"Working at Abercrombie and Fitch allowed me to work with customers as well as handling money. I also was asked to do tasks which may seem easy enough, such as folding clothes, but there is a standard to be held in all the clothes which one must learn. I became very good at the jobs given to me very quickly which helped my credibility as an employee."
good,"As a manager you are trained on all of the essential aspects of running the business. You learn time management, operational organization, interpersonal skills and peer development. Great entry level job with awesome growth potential for those who work hard. Work life balance is not great, you're usually exhausted at the end of the day, but thats high volume retail anywhere. The benefits are great. I really enjoyed not doing the same thing every day. Yes, the same aspects of the business have to be addressed daily, but daily business and working with different managers, part timers, and customers help shake things up."
good,"As my first job, Arby's taught me to multitask and become people orientated person. Day to day task included taking accurate orders, and fulfilling customers wants."
good,If you look to chill & manage your peers this is a great place. Hours do suck but it is retail so you will get use to it. Great opportunities within.
good,"- Once clocked in, a manager either puts a sales associate in the front to great patrons, onto the cash register, the fitting rooms, or in another room to fold down."
good,"working as a floor model at Abercrombie & Fitch is a nice environment to work in with great customers service , I learned acouple skills while working there as far as properly folding clothing , managing sales at the cashierand sofort."
good,"A typical word day would consist of maintaining the showroom, and preparing the stock room for easier accessibility for my co-workers. Throughout my employment with the company I have learned to work better within a team environment , and gained a better sense of independance and initiative."
good,"A typical day at work at Abercrombie & Fitch was rewarding and fast pace. As a store clerk a few of my responsibilities were: tending to customers, folding clothing, taking inventory of product, amongst other things. My co-workers and management were easy-going and made working fun, but always got the job done."
good,"Depending on what time icame in i would change into my work attire, clock in, check with my CSL who would then tell me which floor i would assit that day, then i would go out and make sales! I've learned you have to be patient with your customers being that we had lots of tourist come into our store daily. The managers were ok, could have been better, they didn't really interact as much with us as being in employers. My co-workers were always awesome. Hardest part of the job is having to multi-task between 5 floors and giving your equal attention to every 5 million customers who walked in and out the doors. The best part of working for Abercrombie, it was always busy which kept me up and going throughout the day. Their was never a day i can say i was tired or bored cause i was always kept busy."
good,A typical day at work consisted of greeting customers and organizing the room I was assigned to. I definitely learned how to deal with different personalities. This job helped me to strengthen my customer service skills immensely. It was nice to work with co-workers and managers who were of the same age. Everyone had fun with the job and made sure the customers were attended to at all times. The hardest part of the job was making sure no one was stealing. The most enjoyable part of the job and most rewarding part was preventing thieves from being successful.
good,"Management is constantly changing with the high turnover of new college grads. At typical work day consisted of folding clothes, setting up the marketing, organizing displays, and interacting with customers. I learned about loss prevention, a tremendous amount about customer service, and a bit about selling."
good,Loved the employees
good,"I learned people management skills, organization and time-management."
good,"What i learned at the workplace here at Abercrombie and fitch is how to be responsible, more accountable, and how to manage my time wisely and break down my day since our team sometimes got off at 4 or 5am in the morning which intervened with my school. This was the hardest thing from the job i would say. I did alot of management when updates/floorsets took place."
good,"I loved it there. I worked there for 3 years. Then I realized that I wasn't moving up in the company, in fact you can't move up unless you graduate a 4 year university and still then your salary sucks. So I had to move on."
good,Served as a resource for general product knowledge to all customers and staff member Assist in the preparation and completion of accurate physical inventory Followed department store sales standards and guidelines Adhere to store policies and procedures
good,"It's a great place to work, where you are put in a fun environment. A lot of learning opportunities with great management."
good,it was fun and got to meet a lot of girls. hated to fold the clothes because my back was hurting
good,"This job was one of my first jobs in life and I held my position for years because it was easy and fun. You had to abide by the dress policy which changed colors based on the season but other than that, the job was pretty much great."
good,It was a fun place to work but there was no room for advancement and the pay wasn't that great. I enjoyed meeting all of the new people at the store that worked at. the hardest part was making sure that the store was clean and maintained throughout the day.
good,Its a good job for a high school student. They give decent hours and makes it very possible to juggle life and school.
good,"Slow during weekdays and steady during the weekends. Learned great customer service skills with the help of managers, assistant managers, and other brand representatives. Progressively skilled at opening and closing tasks. Learned what ""Going the extra mile"" meant for assisting customers. The work culture was very inviting which made easy to learn how to work and have fun."
good,I learned a lot each day. Management was excellent. Coworkers were amazing and the workplace was fun and safe as well. The most enjoyable part of the job was becoming apart of the team.
good,"Good experience. great place to work, great team to work with. It has been  a wonderful experience . I started here in about 2 years ago and I have leaned a lot."
good,This was my 1st job and I enjoyed it. The people that worked there were great and most of the managers there were aswell. This job taught me good customer service.
good,This was my 1st job and I enjoyed it. The people that worked there were great and most of the managers there were aswell. This job taught me good customer service.
good,"Abercrombie & Fitch is a great place to work. The work is manual labor, so if you can constantly lifting this job would be perfect for you. Listening to music while you work is allowed, this helps other people perform better. This company once hired on offers you more PTO then any other company I have worked for. The people are great as well. This company even allows me to attend my college courses. I am very happy as of now where I work."
good,"This job teaches you a lot about patience, dedication, and work ethic. Learned how to use cash register and how to properly talk and sell items to customers."
good,"Abercrombie and Fitch is the best job to date that I've ever had, From meeting amazing customers to Coworkers. When the news fell that the store I worked in was going to close, I fell very sad. I had networked myself with a good amount of people that the hard news didn't affect my income, yet it was crushing. Many loyal customers were devastated by the news that they got angry that I didn't mention anything. I wasn't allowed to say a word about the close, which was very weird. All around this company is amazing. My wardrobe is more than half Abercrombie now."
good,"Overall a good job, not to tiring. It does get boring at times and have little benefits. The environment is chill and it is a friendly group of people to work around."
good,Working at Abercrombie was a great experience.  The managers were very instructive and understand when it came to learning new tasks.  All of my coworkers were friendly and I had a lot of fun working with them.
good,"My experience at A&F wasn't bad, it was just a bit overwhelming at times. The reason I say that was because of the bad timing of things, other management issues(that got solved) and some personal issues that all happened around the same time. so when I first started working there, I didn't feel much stability, in the management area, and because it was my first time working in a clothing store I didn't know much about procedures, and I had a training book don't get me wrong but thats not how I learn. so on top of that my training wasn't hands on then they let me go on my own and it was safe to say they had more faith in me than I did. I am glad I was able to work with the people that I did because my coworkers were extremely understanding of how overwhelmed I was with handling all these tasks as well as trying to keep an eye on everything and helped me until I was able to get a handle of things. so all in all I loved the people and the environment, I just wish they either gave us less tasks to juggle at the same time or more hands on deck to handle them."
good,The location I’ve worked was my first job and enjoy working there. The managers were always professional and friendly and value their customers and the company. Always a happy atmosphere.
good,This was the job I had kept from High school through part of college. Very flexible hours and they are always sufficiently staffed. Management was always easy to get along with and coworkers were generally very friendly.
good,"Abercrombie was a clean and fun place to work. "
good,"It's fast pace at times and sometimes it's very dead. You have to be able to do both, management was great. Sometimes the customers are the hardest part to deal with."
good,"It was a fun environment for me as a young, single person. Once I got married and we started talking about kids, being a store manager didn't sound as enticing, due to the long hours on your feet and the mandatory clothing requirements (definitely no maternity department at abercrombie haha)"
good,flexible job for high school students. a lot of work for such little pay. associates practically do everything. it's a very friendly environment to work in.
good,"Get close to the managers and become their friends and beyond that anything is possible. Including calling out, going home early, taking coffee breaks and getting several more hours than the associates that they don't like as much as you."
good,"I had the opportunity to work with an extremely diverse group of individuals. Everyone was young with a strong willingness to be successful. The work space taught me organizational, communication, and team work skills. The difficulty I faced was the scheduling. They would over hire and it would be difficult for people to get hours."
good,good job team. we did stuff. idk why this website is requiring me to do this but it is what it is i guess. the only real improvement we could do is maybe get like a staff puppy to keep in the back. name him like Sprinkles or something
good,il s'avère que j'ai été obligé a travailler sur des chose qui n'était pas dedier a mon poste.
good,Good job overall you get a really good discount and are able to take any days off (just as long as its 2 weeks before the date). The only bad part was being forced to get a certain number of enrollments for the rewards program each day.
good,The managers there were super fun and chill yet they know when it's time to start getting serious about work. Loved being at work even when it was busy.
good,A typical day at work is very customer focused. We care a lot about our customer and providing them with a excellent shopping experience. There are also daily tasks to complete to ensure the operational piece of the business functions properly throughout the day.
good,"This job was much like any other retail job. It was laid back, and a good place for a summer job. You also got good discounts on nice clothes, which is always a perk."
good,Very good job with flexible and understanding managers. You are able to learn to do all the basic necessities for a retail job. The busiest day is usually Sunday because the NJ malls are closed.
good,"A&F is a fine retail job as an associate. It's pretty much like any retail job, the coworkers are friendly, and the managers were usually nice and knew how to do their job efficiently."
good,The sweet playlist of music playing in the store made work less stressful. The dress code was not strict. You were just required to wear clothing that had a similar style to the clothing they sell.
good,I learned how to interact and greet customers as they walked in. I learned to always have a smile on my face. A typical work day consisted of making sure everything was folded and back to its place.
good,This was my very first job. I enjoyed it and met a lot of neat people at work. I did not enjoy the low salary but I do realize it was a minimum wage job.
good,"very fast paced environment, definitely learned how to handle hard customers or how to be calm even in a fast work place. I enjoyed my management and co workers a lot, I usually looked forward to seeing them when I'd go off to work."
good,"Mi experiencia en Abercrombie & Fitch fue excelente, no tengo quejas sobre la compañía. Mi cambio de empleo fue mas buscando una oportunidad donde pudiera poner mis conocimientos y destrezas profesionales en practica."
good,They really acknowledge and appreciate their employees. The facility itself is convenience. They cold and hot lunches for you and they provide breakfast at only set times but that's still high quality.
good,Fun place for young people in high school or just wanting to work during school breaks. Great discounts and usually working with people around your age.
good,"I've been working with the company for three years now. I started as a part-timer, and worked every role in the store up to their new Key Holder position. Overall, the company is good. The diversity & inclusion, organization of business operations and career advancement are the highlights of this company. I do feel like all store associates are severely underpaid for the amount of work we do, and the level of expectation. I worked as a part-timer for over two years and never received a raise. It seems that Home Office is entirely too concerned about employees that work on Campus and not so much with the employees that are actually in the stores making their money for them 8+ hours a day, 40+ hours a week.  I also wish that corporate would hear out the store employees more often too because of this reason. The hours are flexible, every day is different and poses new challenges, and I think that's why I like what I do for this company. By far this is the least stressful job I've ever had, although the holiday season is absolutely crazy. Bonuses are given quarterly and other incentives every now and then, which is great."
good,"sometimes i would come in 9pm and do shipment unload the truck. until the processors would come at 12 and start censoring clothing while i would put the clothing in its proper floor and bay."
good,"The people were fun to work with. However, sometimes managers and associates got too close, favoring certain employees, and creating an awkward environment. It was very much like highschool. Very young girls, who were not too inviting at first, but once you get to know them, everyone was great."
good,"Abercrombie and Fitch was a fun company to work for, especially if you have an interest in their clothing products/fashion in general.  Although the pay may not be the greatest, I don't believe this is a job intended to support a large family.  It's great for kids who just graduated high school and is a job one can easily work while also attending college for some extra spending money.  For most employees the discount you receive on the clothing as an employee is enough incentive to work a few days a week there."
good,"clean,fold clothes,organizing my station,helping the customers with their outfits, make sales on items, fitting rooms, cashier, stand on my feet long period time."
good,Working at Abercrombie was an excellent learning opportunity and I developed my skills and experience in numerous different ways. I also learned a great deal about handling customers.
good,"Good job, as long as you perform well. Shifts are long and breaks are short. Pretty laid back warehouse gig. Pay raised annually, based on performance."
good,Working at abercrombie is great for a first time job. Most shifts are only four hours and we got about three shifts per week. Some people only got one day a week it depends on your work ethic. Its a fun job because everyone is around your age and you meet a lot of great people. Work didn't feel like work because I got so close with my coworkers. Managment is pretty laid back. We swithced managers often. I worked summer of 2016 and when i had returned summer of 2017 there was a whole new managment team. Most managers quit and find new jobs because theres really no growth at abercrombie once you've been working their for a certain amount of time. Nothing was really hard about this job. Some people struggle with talking to customers but if you're a good communicator it shouldnt be a problem.
good,"Everyone was very nie and patient when it came to teaching someone new stuff, The only reason I left was bevcause it wasnt paying enough and didnt give me enough hours also i was moving. Other than that the company was fun to work at. All the employees were nice and understanding and very helpful."
good,"This is a good job for high school or college students. It's easy and the hours are flexible. The pay just isn't that great and you don't get that many hours off the bat. You kinda have to work for them. If you have real bills to pay, I'd suggest getting another job as well, or just not working here, because my checks were never enough to pay my bills. "
good,This job is great if you are going to school or just graduated college/high school. Not great for advancement without a degree or if you don't fit their look policy.
good,"Llevo trabajando en Abercromie & Fitch más de 6 años."
good,"Busy workplace and enjoyable as well. Fun to work and everyone is very respectful. Great benefits as you get to buy their clothes at a discount. Mainly processed shipment, sensor clothes and pull."
good,The work environment is great. Only stressful during the holidays. Chance of dealing with shoplifters is high. Good teamwork involved. Great for college students because they work around your school schedule
good,"Management there is nice! They are genuinely invested in their worker's lives and bettering them as individuals and workers. They are engaging. It was very evident that if you were a good worker, the management would enjoy you more. Lots of brand representatives so it was hard to get large chunks of hours. Needed stock associates."
good,a typical day varies quite a bit but the work generally doesnt change you're standardizing greeting customers and making sure everythings done to make sure the customer enjoys their visit and the place is as nice as possible. I didn't learn too much new besides some people are easier to work with then others as i've had other retail jobs before. The management was awesome to a good extent sometimes though they seemed abnormably stubborn or would get mad at you because you were just in the wrong place at the right time. The culture is interesting if you can't stand strong cologne smells i suggest you look elsewhere. The hardest part was probably keeping an eye on all the customers to make sure nothing got stolen. The most enjoyable was probably seeing a customer walk out with a smile.
good,"The work here isn't really stressful, you just greet the customers politely and help them find the products they need. Maintain the sales floor and always make sure each product is in the right place. They are very flexible with scheduling which is important if you're a student."
good,"Journée dynamique dans la quelle on fait plusieurs taches varies pendant la journée en ayant  un contact  directe avec nos employées  qui nous donne l’opportunité de créer des liens professionnelles avec les quelles on peut influencer de maniéré positive dans notre production."
good,"Being on the job was a great experience to develop social skills and improve customer service performance, it helped me to approach to people easier and it motivated me to achieve great customer service. The easiest part of the job was being on time, the hardest was endure long hours at work. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that I helped people with their concerns and satisfied their shopping experience."
good,"typical day started at 7 am till about 3 or 4pm. stood in the same place for many hours, putting clothing into totes to get boxed up and sent to customers."
good,"I enjoyed this job very much, however, I am always looking for room for growth. At a clothing retail job, it is pretty stagnant, and I feel I wasn't learning all I could. It was a great summer and holiday job. It consisted of organization and representing the company well. It definitely encourages confidence and productivity."
good,Ok place to work. Great people who you can easily relate to and have fun with as managers hover over you and (sometimes) hound you over failing to fold some silly piece of clothing.
good,Abercrombie & Fitch is a great first management job after graduating from college. You can learn how to manage people and what it's like to manage a store.
good,"Abercrombie is a comfortable and calm environment. The coworkers are friendly and optimistic. Although the pay is low compared to the prices, I still bought a few items to show off the brand."
good,"I enjoy the overall vibe of Abercrombie. Working in retail can be stressful at times, but Abercrombie's cool atmosphere mediates the stress. I've always enjoyed helping others, so customer service is a breeze."
good,"-Truly a great company to work for."
good,I went through the MIT program. They give you allot of responsibility straight from the start and its a great way to learn about how the retail industry works.
good,"Working at Abercrombie includes great customer service and learning skills in every area including back stock, working the register, pricing, and distributing clothes. The most enjoyable part of the job is assisting customers."
good,"you get to work with kids your age so it creates a fun environment and the managers are usually only a few years older than you, so everyone becomes close, good friends"
good,Requirements of the job are very clear. Most tasks are simple to complete. Company is very good at explaining exactly how they want your job done. Fun place to work.
good,"Typical day at the work is all about customer service, customer focus, maintain the floor and stockroom. I learned how to deal with customers and how to be patient with them, how to handle stressful situations etc. Management and workplace culture are amazing. The hardest part of the job is customer service and dealing with people but that was also and the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,Great entry level job with a good culture and environment.Management was very reasonable and helped myself grow as a professional. If you are looking for a job to jump start your career i recommend.
good,"When I worked at Abercrombie, I would only work 20 hours a week. I thought it was a nice place to work at, but they paid a little bit. Everyone who work there and the managers were super friendly and kind."
good,"meet a lot of new people"
good,Typical day at worked was doing shipment and having my headphones on. No one bothered and I was able to do my work. Management was great.
good,"Working here was amazing because  have flexible schedules and willing to work toward your availability. A typical day at work would be checking in, getting changed into a brand representative outfit and going to a manager to see where your are assigned. There are over 5 managers and they rotate every hour  to manage each floor. There are amazing and caring managers who are willing to discuss your work.The job is very big on diversity. The best part of working there is interacting with customers and getting to meet new brand reps. Everyone is friendly and it is an amazing environment  to work in."
good,When I first started the job I was thinking it's going to be hard because getting up at 4:30am was rough but made it happen the job was starting with a work just to get your mind moving some people don't like getting up but folding shorts in paints in hoodie's isn't that hard you got to keep up with the pace and hit your numbers to keep up with the day move around to another spot to help others with there stuff it's a good job I would go back if I had the chance to......
good,Absolutely amazing company to work for if you want to start a career in retail/fashion. Strong training for managers. Great career opportunities. Inclusive culture.
good,"Recommend coming here straight out of college. They are great at training and including new recruits into the company. There is a wide range of job opportunities and advancement is fostered. The hours are long, but you will learn a lot and meet great, intelligent people along the way."
good,This environment was very motivated. It was really fun and the co-workers were great. The day was always full of work but also laughter.
good,"Good, place to work, nice people always a positive work environment to work in! This company is good to work around a busy schedule and is able to give its employees flexible work hours. Also, the management is good always friendly and very nice. It is a clean place to work its not dirty very well kept."
good,"Abercrombie and fitch  is a great  place to work, there are many things to learn from working there. it was a honor to work with this company. the clients and friendly and customer service it the upmost important thing."
good,"Working for Abercrombie & Fitch is one of the greatest things that has ever happened to me. I started with the Manager in Training program that teaches you everything you need to know about managing a multi-million dollar business. You also get to work with people who are genuinely nice and helpful. Once you become a manager, it doesn't just end there. You can be sent to other stores to help or you can explore other career opportunities within the company. Career development is also great since your supervisor will be there to guide you and give you constant feedback. We also have an associate discount which is awesome!"
good,"Abercrombie Kids was a nice place to start off. It was definitely my style, and wasn't too fast paced or busy. It was a calm work environment with lots of great energy. We got good discounts on the clothes in the store and also at Abercrimbie & Fitch. We got minimum wage pay, which is the only bad thing."
good,Une ambiance de travail jeune et cool. Notamment dans ses débuts.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of stock associates to scan in shipments, and properly sensor items and put them on sales floor or stock room. You learn about time management and using every minute efficiently to get tasks done."
good,"-High volume, fast paste environment"
good,"Usually its really slow. I built up good customers service because of the amazing managers there. Coworker are cool, but really judgmental. Really fun, but hours there suck. I only get two shifts a week that are only 4 or 5 hours."
good,You start your day with a brief 5 minute meeting with the manager on the floor and they assign you to an area. I learned how to interact with customers and make their shopping experiences more enjoyable. Everyone is very friendly which makes the work environment fun.
good,"Great company to build and grow with! "
good,"i would start my day by looking at how much shipment we received for the day, and have a quick meeting with the manager that was there at the time. i would then check the EUSR gun to see how much items i would have to replenish. depending on that number i would either replenish the sales floor or start with the shipment. If i chose shipment first that means there wasnt much to replenish but i would check the numbers on the gun hourly to see hows business. if that time came to replenish the floor i would stop shipment for an hour or so (usually less) and take care of pulling the items to the sales floor, and go back to taking care of shipment. On most days i would have to watch the sales floor and take over as supervisor and zone out the current associates to handle a room while giving the utmost care to customers. the job was pretty easy but there would be some days when the work load would just be extremely overwhelming,and i would be the only person doing everything for stock. the hours for regular associates are terrible. the thing i enjoyed the most about abercrombie was the diversity there were so many different people from different cultures and it was fun meeting them."
good,"This was a great place to work as the management was always fair and would work with your schedule. Co-workers were respectful and we would have fun in and out of work. I wouldn't recommend working here if you can't deal with randoms influxes of customers created high pressure situations. If you can pull together under stress though, you will be fine and enjoy your job. Not a job to join if you want to grow or move up, unless you are hired as a manager."
good,"Definitely recommended for people who don't have a lot of time, and for kids who focus on school and need a job that they can forget about once they leave work."
good,"fun place to work, great hours, flexibility, variety of tasks to perform"
good,"It's a nice place to work if you don't want really no hours, that's a good place for you. But if you are the kind of person who wants hours every week you want get it."
good,I would stand up front and fold merchandise and greeted people as they came in. The management and co-workers were very nice to me.
good,"Great management, great co-workers. I learned how a business is ran. The most enjoyable part of the job is building relationships with co-workers."
good,"Entreprise qualitative rendant l'art de la photo accessible à tous. "
good,"Abercombie offered me my first career opportunity as a LPM for a flagship store in New York.  I developed and advanced in the company thanks in large part to the people I was surrounded by.  I ended my tenure as the youngest Director of Loss Prevention in the companies history.  My territory finsihed with the best results in the company upon my departure. "
good,"It was great seasonal job opportunity, i loved the workplace and co-workers. The hardest part of my job was during the holidays, some days i would work 14 hour shifts and have to fold and organize large shipments of clothing. One thing i learned while working there is too take pride in my job and presentation."
good,"A typical day at work :"
good,Enjoyed working here. A lot of things you can learn working in retail. Helps you understand the workforce and also helps you and your communication skills with every day people. Helps you know the importance of a product.
good,"A typical day was doing ""projects"" under the management where we were able to complete them in our own freedom as long as it was timely and efficient. The co workers made the days fun and productive."
good,"The work life balance at A&F is notoriously bad. I worked extremely long hours, which is not sustainable. The culture can also be very high pressure with a lot of criticism. There were many upsides to working for this company though. They give employees a huge amount of responsibility which allows you quick growth opportunities. "
good,impact team member would have been a great job if it was during the day you could only do it at night this had an impact on going university or training for football the next day because some days was revision and couldnt go but the experience was a good experience
good,"The typical day consists of you only doing your job, depending on what your title is in the store the work sometimes can be a little over whelming but not difficult. The co workers are any where from ages 18-24 so its easy to get along with a younger staff. The management was well and overall friendly plus good at there job."
good,"Working at Abercrombie and Fitch is fun! A typical day might be slow, but most of the employees are nice and easy to talk to, including the managers. You learn a lot about marketing, management and just typical retail tasks such as floorsets and inventory. The hardest part of the job would be floorsets because sometimes they can be confusing. However, I enjoyed working there a lot because I made friends and got to help people on a daily basis."
good,"As a manager all the issues and concerns of customers and employees go to the manager. I learned to time manage, create schedules, identify specific task that need to be completed and direct associates to specific taks, monitor sales and hours gained or last by sales, conduct interviews and decided the perfect candidates for the job. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers that create a hostile environment and are an asset protection hazard. The most enjoyable part of the job are my associates."
good,"This was my first job so it taught me the basics of communication with customers and working a register.  I also dealt with inventory, making sure everything was in stock.  The hardest part about this job was speaking with customers since this was my first experience where I had too."
good,"One of my typical day was that I was given a challenge  to manage every thing on my own for a day, the entire Store floor was left on my shoulder's to get it done to start a new challenging role for me. Coming to my Management, one of the best experience and the privilege to work with them, I learned one of the most needed quality and that is Time management and Versatility The atmosphere on work was covered with Multi-culture people which is one of the most important part to learn different cultures and languages under one roof. The hardest part was the day of our CEO visit,and the most enjoyable part of the job was also the day of our CEO visit."
good,"A very good atmosphere to work at.Nice people,customers."
good,I worked in a young and dynamic team and learned how to work in a warehouse as well as how to advise customers. Another tasks were to maintain the Merchandise flow and to provide presentation standards.
good,I would arrive at work to take care of customers and answer their questions. I would keep the store clean and organized all day through the shift. Cashing people out when they are ready to be cashed out.
good,"you can pick your own hours but, very low hourly pay.  some co-workers are good and some are completely useless."
good,"A typical day for my position of what they called ""model"" was to stand at the front of the store and greet all customers that entered and exited making them feel welcomed as well as assisting them with their needs. Also you were to keep the front of the store looking presentable such as folding clothes, dusting, and restocking the shelves on item that were low. Sometimes even open dressing rooms for people. You are required to wear something of Abercrombie's or close imitation but the tag or label can not show if it is from another brand. The only bad thing about the job was that the only shoes you are allowed to wear are converse or flip flops. If you have a bad back or use to a good supporting shoe this may not be the job for you. Long hours in a flat shoe was death for me because I am use to wearing good shoes because of track but that is what shoe insoles are for. The most enjoyable part of the job were the employees as well as the managers. This could just be my particular location but the employees were cool laid back students like myself so we all got along well. Also you are on call 24/7. They will text and call you like crazy if they need someone to come in. The downside of working along side with students is that everyone will call in with an excuse that they can't come in or just not show up and others have to pick up the slack."
good,"Abercrombie is a very strict company, but i was lucky enough to have a great team. Management, always made work fun. If your over the age 22 i would not recommend this job if you're not looking for management positions."
good,"a typical day consists of you interacting with customers, bringing out new merchandise and keeping up the overall maintenance of the store; making sure things move quickly. Through this job, I have learned better communication skills and how to use a register which I picked up very quickly. Management is rather spontaneous. Its usually a young group of managers so you can usually relate to each other. The co-workers are usually cool people to be around which are also usually a young crowd. The hardest part is mostly hang to deal with shop-lifting and difficult customers but thats usually rare. The most enjoyable part is the fact that you make quick friends with the co-workers and sometimes even the customers."
good,"Learning how to create designs with metal, and install air condition units.  Meet new people learn about different cultures."
good,"A typical day as an assistant manager with Abercrombie and Fitch is like no other retail job."
good,boring at times but the co workers made it fun but it was a great experience and showed me how important and education is.
good,"The work culture at A&F is diverse and I experienced welcoming arms when it came to learning and working with customers. It is a friendly environment and a place to really feel at home."
good,A&F does have a great great friendly working environment. We worked freely and co-work were very kind and nice.
good,"I worked mostly in the back room. The big parts of my job were taking in new inventory, scanning it, censoring it, folding it and storing it in the right spot in the back room. I was also in charge of replenishing the sales floor with products from the back room that had already been purchased. Once every three months or so I would have to create new floor sets. This meant I would have to steam, un censor, and hang all the new clothing being laid out on the tables and put on manikins. I would work long shifts back to back days to make sure everything was done. Other aspects of my job were running the cash register, explaining our sales to customers and folding clothes on the sales floor. "
good,"I loved it as a company, I felt as though I mattered daily in what I did. It's a company that you can really build your resume up from the ground up as long as you're willing to dedicate the time."
good,"This place was very energetic and a fun place to work. While it was fun while it lasted, there are great opportunities this company requires."
good,Work is typically fast paced and filled with tasks. I've learned to manage my time well. The management is very strong. All my coworkers and friendly and easy to work with. There really aren't many hard points in the job or at least not that I can't handle. The most enjoying part of my job is the personality that I experience.
good,"Greet any customer who walks in. Attend to customers. In charge of the fitting rooms. Transported money to other stores. The toughest part of the job was maintaining the stores appearance, You have to refold everything while attending to the customers. The most enjoyable part was being in the atmosphere."
good,A empresa possui excelência no setor em que atua. Possui uma equipe muito dinâmica e com grandes diversidade.
good,"A typical day at work, starts off with paperwork cleaning and getting the store ready for the customers to shop. The management team is okay, the associates are great at the tasks that they handed. It nothing really hard about the job."
good,typically I would walk into work and be asked to work on a certain project within a team to move and organize items within the company. I learned to interact with many races and cultures. management was friendly and helpful. My Co-workers are nice and diverse. The hardest part of the job was learning how to do things because they kind of just throw you into it and hope you learn it. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the co-workers.
good,Working at Abercrombie & Fitch was a great experience. It was my first job . I was pretty excited to be part of the team. I learn to tolerated standing on my feet for learn hours of the day. Learn to get us to cashiering and keeping the floor cleaned. Made sure that the merchandise was folded and neat. Management was nice and very forward and direct on the necessary things that was needed to be done. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping and assist anting the customers .
good,"Come to work on time and talk to my floor manager he/she tells me what floor I will be working on, who I will be working with, and what tasks I will be assigned. I learned how to fold, ironed, organized, retail merchandise such as shirts, sweaters, skirts, scarfs, jeans, shoes, hoodies etc. Management was cooperative, respectful, and professional, helped me out and explain to me in details on how to do the task correctly and made sure that the team was on task and working in a timely manner. The work environment was comfortable most of the co-worker were polite, helpful, respectful, understanding and easy to talk to. I made friends. The hardest part of the job was working with some of the co-workers. No communication, lazy, and disrespectful. Because of that work does not get done on time and the whole team will be penalized. The most enjoyable part of the job was the work schedule, the people I have gotten to meet and work along side with. Abercrombie and Fitch is a company where there is communication, culture awareness, respect, and opportunities. I will love to work with Abercrombie and Fitch again."
good,I enjoyed working here. The managers were all interactive and hard working. You had to deal with waves of people coming in due to the name of the brand but your coworkers made it easier to deal with. The hardest part of the job was the pay but the best was the atmosphere and coworkers.
good,"Walking around in store as life-size models in company clothing to market the brand; nothing more, nothing less. Flexible scheduling for the hundreds of college students who are employed there. Overall, an extremely fun environment to work in up until you outgrow(about age 23) the amateur natured place. The pay is limited just as well as the hours given."
good,"I started at Abercrombie as a sales model. I worked on the floors selling clothing and accessories to customers. I also was a cashier, then was promoted at 17 years of age to Back Stock Manager. Tasks as a Back Stock Manager included: shipping and receiving, censoring shipment, organizing received shipment in stock shelves, restocking sales floor shelves, conference calls, new hire meetings, management of stocking crew, filing paperwork, organize and distribute ""floor change"" items, and much more. "
good,"As a Manager-In-Training, Abercrombie organized a day to day routine for me to learn the business when I first began to work for the company. They have a very hands on approach to training up managers as well as associates and because of the training I received I was able to be promoted in less than 6 months. I began to train and manage other managers and part-time associates. I hired and conducted interviews while maintaing company protocol and perspectives of my fellow managers and subordinates.  Managing the number one Abercrombie Kids Store in the country was a great opportunity for me. The complexity of managing people, budgeting hours, ordering supplies, maintaining stockroom procedures, and receiving shipment on a daily basis required me to use my time efficiently. Overall, it was a great company to start learning how to manage a business and I enjoyed every minute of my time that I spent there."
good,I enjoyed this job. I was the Stock Supervisor so I was in a leadership role. I had a great team. Mostly the employees were college aged and enrolled in college. The company offers great benefits when your are full time. However you need a bachelors in order to advance to a manager role.
good,A typical day at work consisted of a number of tasks and maintaining the store. I've learned through this company that teamwork and motivation are the most important in giving quality customer service. The work environment was friendly.
good,"Loved working there, Great Atmosphere, Everyonr helps everyone."
good,I would it was a pleasant place to work due to the fact that they were extremely flexible. I would go in maintain the appearance of the store and help the customers. The hardest part of the job was doing stock in the back.
good,"You will be smelling like there favorite cologne, but the culture is good, no nonsense company, in loss prevention its about teaching associates about policies"
good,"It was a great place to work, very fun with good music, meeting and greeting new people. A typical day at work would be using the cash register, greeting new people, and helping people find new styles of what would look good on them."
good,"Running the business is a typical day at work for me. I make sure every associate is tasked out doing what they are suppose to be doing so the business is running at the best it can always. I've learned how to work with a bunch of different people and how to make it into a great place to work where everyone has fun and gets along but also does their job and does it well. The management team is great, we all bring different strengths to the table which is great. My co-workers work hard and are taught by me or another manager how to do their job well and i train them to be successful. The hardest part of my job is dealing with a lot of different personalties and making everyone gets along and to run a smooth business. I handle the situations very well and fairly and all the employees feel as if we are all a big family but we get out work done and enjoy being at work. I would say that the best part of my or what makes me happy at my job is training a new hire and seeing them grow into a great employee that works hard because they enjoy their job. There is nothing better then a customer coming up to me and telling me that my employees are very nice and helpful and they are great to be around. That means i am doing my job with managing them well and also running a business where we are being successful."
good,Great company to start gaining management experience with good benefits. The only difficult part about the job ties back to the irregular schedule and retail hours around holiday times.
good,Somedays i stand out in front of the store and other days i am working aa a cashier. Abercrombie and Fitch has a strong team of employees that get the job done. They could be more flexible on hours due to college schedules but everything else is satisfactory.
good,"Usually involves folding clothes, helping customers find items, letting customers into changing rooms. Black Friday is obviously the busiest, working twelve hour shifts."
good,Fun but strick workplace.
good,"Days are long, but does give you the basics on running a business. Would definitely recommend it for anyone that needs to learn the fundamentals of business and leadership as you can apply it anywhere in any job."
good,Fun environment! Stylish clothing! I learned how to fold a variety of clothing. There are many ways to fold things!
good,"I loved the culture of A&F and their clothing, but my most favorite thing about working there is the visual marketing tasks."
good,"Abercrombie and Fitch teaches you pay attention to detail. Its a very customer driven company. Working in Abercrombie also teaches you, to stick firmly to companies guidelines in personal appearance and rules of conduct."
good,I loed working at Abercrombie and Fitch there was always someting going on
good,"A corporate culture that genuinely values its people and promotes talent and growth. Among the industry's highest expectations, and compensation and tools to achieve these goals aren't always in line with those expectations, but a place I've learned a lot from."
good,Great place to start a career at. Everyone is energetic. Reliability of employees is sometimes a negative but can easily be overcome by having enough employees on staff. Good entry level management job.
good,"Great first job teaching you how to communicate with customers or guest, also teaches you team work. I had no issues with abreocmbie overall a nice job."
good,Working for Abercrombie was by far a good job I loved coming into work enjoying my time their but they only thing was the paying wasn’t to good at all.
good,"Not enough hours good job for high school students and teens simply can not live on this if you have real bills( rent, car note) needs to also be more diversity."
good,0 hour contract so well suited to my hours. Work was usually consistent. managers were relaxed and other colleagues easy to get on with. Decent training.
good,Working at Abercrombie and Fitch has given me the opportunity to improve my customer service skills as well as being able to be cross-trained in various areas.
good,Would work here again. Didn't mind the work or the management. Very few opportunities for advancement. I worked until I found something that paid more.
good,"•	Maintain merchandise flow, filling and presentation standards throughout the store and the stockroom"
good,Working here was fun it wasn't stressful as I thought it was going to be during the holidays everyone worked together and made it work. I like the place just not enough hours.
good,it's a good place for someone to experience their first job but not really a forever place. all that is really asked of you is to make sure you are speaking with customers and keeping the store clean.
good,Abercrombie and Fitch is a fun and exciting place to work at. I learned how to work with customers and make sure their needs are met. I enjoyed working with my coworkers as well.
good,"As a sales associate you will be assigned a task that could take up your entire shift or up until you complete the task. Those tasks being cleaning up a specific section so that it is presentable to customers, providing fitting rooms and running go-backs, checking customers out at the register, or greeting customers and assisting in finding sizes or specific garments they are looking for."
good,The overall experience was great! I would definitely come back to work. Management positions are easy to fill. I learned how to better my customer service skills and time management.
good,"Overall fruitful time, experiencing a fast-paced culture and learning to interact with people. I learned how to make the most of a full work day, and be efficient when getting things done."
good,"I enjoyed working as a team, experiencing something new. It was my first job, and overall amazing experience. I learned how you put the alarms on clothing in a fast pace, the hardest part was getting a certain amount done and finished on time."
good,"Working at the home office has been a great experience.  Management really cares about you, as an individual, and helps with career development.  There is a lot of collaboration as well.  CEO has helped to create a great working environment."
good,Once clocked in you used the tablet and gun to check what was assigned to you. There was a certain amount of workload that each person had to finish before the end of the shift.
good,My experiences here were pretty good. I liked my schedule and my pay but I had to resigns due to transportation issues. But when I got my transportation problems back in order I was disappointed in finding out that A&F places me on their ineligible for rehire list. So I guess when you obtain employment here you better keep it.
good,Working here was a great job to have while also having a fun working environment. More shifts are given out during holidays and does slow down afterwards. The pay varies on how much you're scheduled for and is also bi-weekly.
good,"Shifts are convenient to my schedule, constant customer service performed, steady inflow of customers, multitasking environment, moderate/ fast pace, and a overall upbeat environment."
good,"I worked for the brand for 9 years, I fell in love with so many different things the company had to offer but I think the pay in unfair mostly because I busted my butt at one of the companies high volume location and I get paid the same as an SM whos store makes only a couple $100's a day"
good,"Its a pretty easy position there are times where things can get a little hectic in the store due to us not having enough coverage on the floor, however if you like short high paced burts its totally doable."
good,"Abercrombie and Fitch is a great place to work especially if you are in school. They work with your schedule, and you make cool friends. It was a great job when i was younger."
good,"The store would have its downtime regularly so there was always time to finish a task and socialize with fellow co-workers. The job did not entail any difficult activities, only the necessity of keeping the store looking presentable."
good,"I learned very helpful skills at A&F and it allowed me to connect better with people. The hardest part of the job was working the weekend rush. However, talking to customers was my favorite part of the job!"
good,"This job is ideal for a high school student or young adult. Flexible hours, however the pay is rather low, as expected. The flexibility of scheduling is what attracts people to this job."
good,Good work environment with nice colleagues and nice management. Experience that helped with my personal organisation with my work and increased my skills with customers.
good,"A dynamic, friendly work environment. Opportunity to learn how to effectively customer service and maintain a sales floor and stockroom. Flexible availability and wonderful management."
good,"I thought I would enjoy working retail in a clothing store. I like good quality clothes and knew I could sell them and I did. Using my motivational skills I could sell clothes, especially to women. I managed a small team and enjoyed the job but again needed more money."
good,One of the greatest companies I have ever been selected to work for. Lots of room for growth and excellent health benefits. The schedule was not flexible.
good,I worked part time for about a year at A&F. The experience was fun. My managers were really nice and willing to help. I loved working there but it was only part time job and the salary was not satisfying for me.
good,"Abercrombie is a great location to get your foot in the door of the management world. Youll learn how to train and maintain your staff and operate a retail store. I recommend working here for management, but not as a sales associate."
good,your coworkers will become more like your family and your work will become a place where you look forward to being. The management team was very generous and flexible always willing to teach you things you are unsure about an help out when necessary.
good,Good Chill enviroment to work in.Most of time is spent around clothes.not a bad workplace enviroment.must be prepared to spend time with customers.Must be a pro a folding shirts
good,"It was great experience working there, I didn’t have no retail experience at the job but they saw something in me that they like & they also believe that I had potential to learn fast once I start working"
good,"Working at A&F or Hollister Co is a simple retail job. Entry level, just about anyone is capable of getting in, and many that aren't necessarily good at their job manage to stay. Management is hit or miss, you can have good ones, and you can have bad ones. I personally went through about ten in the years I worked there. Turnover rate is relatively high, but that is due to it being a gateway company to better opportunities. This being the case, it's a wonder why the company hires from outside rather than within. Plenty of promising Reps and Stock Associates that put in 40+ hours a week were never offered positions of advancement. Management requires a college degree, no amount of experience seems to sway the company, even if the experience is directly related to working WITH the company."
good,Hard fast working workplace. Great place to make new friends as well as working very hard on day to day shifts. All managers are nice however as a 0 hour contract on some weeks there is a lack of hours.
good,"clock in, learn our goals and just customer service and recover items. Unless there was a floor set. If there was a floor set our managers would assign us to what we needed to do and we would team up to get it done"
good,"With the flexibility options for scheduling, I was able to work around my school schedule to reduce stress and finish school in a timely manner. They were also able to change my schedule based on each semester I was in school."
good,"I work as a overnight stock lead. For the start of the night all the stock leads would unload the merchandise from the shipping companies truck. We would scan the boxes in and separate the boxes by stock room floors. Next, we would bring the boxes up to their set stock room floors and begin to scan for unit of clothing that belongs on the sales floor. After replenishing the clothing on the sales floor we would begin to sensor the new shipment of clothing. Lastly we would take the sensor clothing back in its right place in the stock room . If there is more time left for the shift I would get my associates started on different task to keep the stock rooms organized."
good,This was a fun working environment. I really enjoyed the staff and got friendly with many of them. This was a good part-time job for me. I learned how to greet customers and use the register to check people out.
good,"5 minute meeting before shift. then check floor plan, great workplace culture. friendly atmosphere. decent breaks. best part of job was friendly staff and customers."
good,"Over the 14 years I was employed, I went from a first time warehouse worker to an experienced inventory control specialist. I was a trainer in both of my home departments  & a backup lead.I worked successfully with other associates to problem solve and develop new  more cost effective ways to complete tasks.The hardest part of my job was the lack of communication of changes that occurred within the company. I enjoyed the ability to work in a department that allowed the associates to problem solve & communicate with other departments to put solutions into practice.The management teams put stock into our opinions & considered our experience when communicating with others . Many of the supervisors were understanding & easy to get communicate with concerning work issues."
good,"a typical day at work is folding down the store, and talking to customers. I learned how to work under pressure and the managers are great. The hardest part of the job would probably be running around when the store is crazy packed, plus a lot of customers that come into the store dont speak English so that is difficult too. The most enjoyable part would have to be the co workers. we all get along well and it makes long work days go by quicker"
good,Some days were really slow but having fun people to work with always made it better.  The managers were down to earth and always made sure we were supported.
good,"Although most positions are part-time, this was a great job. Felt almost more like a family or a group of friends than a job. Managers are easily approachable and understanding of any concerns you may have."
good,"The hours are decent. i learned retail skills here such as stock, sales. workplace culture is fun. I hardest part of the job are early morning shifts."
good,great ooputunitues to grow and they are a team player based company. Awesome to row and the advancement to challenge yourself  and meet your goals as a person
good,"Throughout the day you just fold clothes, when a customer ask for assistant you help. Watch out for shoplifters and when its time for a customer to check out, check them out."
good,"I enjoyed working there. My coworkers were a lot of fun and it was a great way to meet new people. A typical day at work including processing shipment and assisting customers to create a pleasant experience for them in the store. I learned how to work collaboratively with other associates and my managers. I think the hardest part of the job was trying to assist multiple customers at the same time when we were shorthanded, which was pretty often, considering we are a small store with most of our associates coming from my college. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting the coworkers and becoming friends."
good,Working for Abercrombie & Fitch was an amazing experience. Starting out here with my passion for fashion. Working closely together with very diverse people is a experience I’ll never forget.
good,"The store serves as nice beginner for any college or high school student, however if retail is not your forte I would not suggest remaining unless you wish to become a manager. Overall it is a nice workplace however stock associates I do not agree are paid a fair wage ($7.25)"
good,"You have to be willing to stand on your feet all day. Which after 8 hours of work can become very hard , my feet would hurt every day after work , and you have to go behind people and fix the same stuff all day."
good,"I had a positive experience and had some great managers and great co-workers that made my experience so great. The job was pretty demanding, but those that worked hard were rewarded with promotions and great pay. They paid above average and that makes you want to work harder. The culture was great. I worked with a lot of ambitious young people that I enjoyed working with and spending time with outside of work. I learned a lot and had it has proven to be a great experience that I have used in future jobs."
good,"Filled with fun, outgoing young people. The environment is pretty clean and enjoyable. The managers are super helpful and supportive. There is music in the store!"
good,"The workers there were very courteous, hard working, and ambitious. The customers were friendly and nice. The management team was very accommodating and attentive."
good,"One of my favorite jobs due to the freedom of working at nights. overall a great learning experience to be exposed to how to be a retailer as well as to a great stock associate,"
good,"A typical day at work would be fun but getting work done. I learned how to be even more patient and open minded with people. Managemet, in my opinion would be having a great work environment but also getting work that needs to be done squared away, management , is the person who's suppose to step in if someone is disrespecting the company name or any of it's employers. My typical workplace would be fun and relaxed environment but also a busy environment. I rather stay busy then watch the time go. The hardest part of the job is slow paced places, I am use to just not stopping working till it's time to clock out. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be meeting new people. I love to meet new people and I am really good at adapting to others so they don't feel uncomfortable to ask for help or feel out of place."
good,"This is a really good job for students and during the seasonal times, you'll be getting good hours and making good money. But during the slow season Ive been scheduled 4 hours per week, which is NOT a livable wage for someone who is wanting 25-30 hours a week. I understand this happens in retail but you'd need a second job to pay bills. Management is really good here, but there are times where there are scheduling issues whether it be not enough hours or scheduling out of your availability."
good,This was a good starting job for someone who is interested in a sales or fashion career. The environment was very laid back and had a good workplace culture.
good,"For a part time job it doesn’t get much easier. You just fold clothes, check people out at the register, and help people find what they’re looking for. It’s a laid back environment and the managers are all very supportive. It’s minimum wage with no raises though."
good,Always on the move. You always have something to do here. Management was great. Had great discounts. But with retail you would work crazy hours. Never be the same shifts
good,Work was fun and challenging a lot of the time. It was always different and you took each day as it came. Friendly staff and a clean environment made for quality shifts that everyone enjoyed.
good,"It was fun and gave me a fruitful experience."
good,"Great corporate culture filled with people who are genuinely dedicated to turning the business around. My take is that they're trying to accomplish too many things at once. The product has improved immensely, but processes are still lagging behind. Merchants recently had Production responsibilities taken off their plate which is good. Management is enthusiastic, but there seems to be a disconnect between top-down strategy and bottom-up execution. The talent level is there as is the design vision."
good,I had fun working for this company. I interacted with a lot of customers and helped them with their shopping. I kept the store clean and organized and it kept me busy.
good,Bei Abercrobie&Fitch herrschte stets ein angenehmes Arbeitsklima. Das Management motivierte seine Mitarbeiter regelmäßig und viel!
good,"This job taught me a lot about customer service and how to communicate with language barriers. However, if you aren't used to fast paced high intensity work, the adjustment can take a month or so. Knowledge of another language is beneficial for the locations in the touristy areas and it definitely increases your chances of being manager sooner given your natural versatility knowing another language. The vibe is great but you might have to get used to the way things are organized and how policies effect your consumer relationship with the company. Cool place to work, you'll definitely get a lot out of the experience with or without advancement in the company."
good,Typical expectations for a first job you would have. Minimum wage pay and very few hours given so job wasn't stressful but is more something temporary
good,I just enjoy the family i gained through this job. They are a lot of fun and the managers understand the college/work life. They sometimes have your future best friend as co-worker.
good,"Fun workplace with decent benefits . I worked part time while A full time college student, so the hours were very flexible for me.  I recommend to anyone who is in school and need a non stressful job to cover tuition cost."
good,I will recommend my friends  to work there . They have very flexible hours. Good management. Friendly environment. Very good hours during holiday seasons but not during the rest of year.
good,Good if your looking for a job fresh out of college. When I started the Management in training program was for people with degrees only. I quit because I found another job that paid more.
good,If you like dealing with customers face to face and trying to make a sale then I would recommend working hear. It is generally slow in the winter months but once it warms up it gets very busy. You really need to be on the floor helping customers at all times.
good,"Responsibilities of this job were to dust, vacuum and tidy up store before customers arrived. Greet costumers with the appropriate greeting as they enter and exit the store, dress mannequins and displays on tables, straightened and fold all clothes on display floor and cashier."
good,"I love working for the company, I've worked for the company for 8yrs (5yrs part time, 3yrs as a manager). Its a great place to work if you are willing to put in the effort."
good,this place was work cant say anything bad but that it was my place of work just went to do my job make sure all of my work duties was fulled i got long with everyone no promblems with any one there
good,"Ever team of the store was awesome, and great work environment. Met some great customers from around the world, and they gave me great memories. Awesome job."
good,"I enjoyed my time with Abercrombie, although it was just a summer job. I loved getting to help people find clothes that fit their personal style. I also enjoyed being apart of the whole store re model, getting to change the store layout after work with all the employees was fun time."
good,This is a place that is always busy whether it is on the floor or in the back stock room. There is always something that needs to be done. Working here makes the work shift go by faster because you are always moving.
good,"As this was my first job, it was a great experience for me. I learned a lot about customer service and retail. Cash handling became super easy for me because of this job."
good,"Greeting Customers, helping to create friendly shopping space."
good,The environment is a great one for a first job. There are great Management programs that give alot of training for improvement and growth within the company.
good,My day consisted of helping customers with prices on clothing and make sure the store was clean and presentable and greet customers and assist if askd
good,Pays minimum wage with a different schedule every week. Some weeks might get 8 hours where as others weeks might get 32 hours. Easy going management and coworkers.
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with. As a manager, I was able to advance from MIT to Assistant Manager to Store Manager within a year. "
good,"You have to keep up with greeting, cashier, fitting room and just good customer service. This place got me learning more about work ethic and how much customer service is important in the retail industry"
good,I enjoyed organizing merchandise here. The work was straight forward and my coworkers were easy going. The hardest part of the job was getting enough hours.
good,"Work was easy, fun, and bearable. Hardest part of the job is learning where the departments for each apparel belong to. Management was excellent and I enjoyed my stint there."
good,Pretty boring work but everyone was nice and considerate. Easy work and flexible hours. Pretty good considering the nature of the job (tagging clothes and folding all day)
good,the environment at A&F was very chill and laid back.  I already liked wearing their clothing so selling it was not hard at all.  Coming out of high school this was a great retail job to learn about inventory and auditing.  talking to customers was a pleasure as well
good,"A&F was nice. I learned how to properly fold clothes and handle money for the first time. The employees were sweet, but there were not many hours available."
good,"best work enviorment if youre attending school or college. managment was the best really helpful and enthusiastic, the hardest part of the job really is staocking large piles of clothes."
good,"This was my first job as I turned 16. Great experience and great place to build character. "
good,"As it is located at the Fifth avenue location, the store attracts many tourists all year round. There are possibly about 50+ part-time brand reps, this does not include other employees such as full and part- time stock associates, managers, night-shifters, and cleaning staff. Although it is a big working family, each and every person is friend and looking out for each. Managers are great at managing their floors, and keeping contacting with everyone around them making sure we as employees give and receive 100% satisfaction."
good,I took a semester off from school and they accompanied that by giving me more hours to work. They also give their associates options to work in any part of the store.
good,In A&F I had learnt and worked on New tools and technologies. Had hard days being on Support but njoyed working with chanlleges. Good fun place to work too.
good,"My first job and well worth it even though the pay and hours were not great, it showed the importance of being presentable at work and keeping the work area clean and organized."
good,"I learned a lot about the textile world and how to manage a big shop."
good,"At Abercrombie, a typical day would include arriving early to open the store, attending conference calls with other stores and corporate, and organizing and directing all of the other employees as they arrive.  The workplace culture was great, with fun music, young, outgoing employees eager to help the customer, and professional and caring management.  The most difficult part of the job would either have to be working with customers who sometimes become unruly or aggressive, or trying to enforce loss-prevention in such a busy store. The most enjoyably part of the job was working with such positive, friendly people, and being able to help so many customers in such a busy store."
good,This company is very accessible to all people. There are tons of jobs of all types that are open to the people and may lead to many job opportunities.
good,"Abercrombie was a very laid back environment, i loved my manager, i learned how to supply good customer service to customers. The hardest part of the job by far was the customers, the best part was i just loved working for abercrombie, even though the pay was horrible."
good,"Surprisingly diverse and you wear what you want, given creative freedom and room to grow, fantastic communication and relationships with other departments."
good,"Greet customers, make sure the environment looked neat. The smell attracting the attention of the store which brought new people. I learned a lot about original sales and deducting prices for sales."
good,A great place to practice customer service and a great way to learn time management. Every one is friendly including the managers.
good,"Great staff and cool management. Sometime the hours get the better of you but how they set up their schedules, there's something for everyone."
good,Attitude de travail strict avec beaucoup de règles de conduite à suivre.
good,This job prepared myself for different customers demands. This job also called for a lot of thinking on the spot and has stuck throughout all my jobs including this one.
good,"NICE, smart employees Collaboration and Face to Face communication is part of the culture. Employees genuinely care about the success of the company and strive to make it a better place every day."
good,"Great managers who are always willing to help you out. Extremely flexible scheduling system where you can input your availability online, which is perfect for people like me with schedules that change regularly. Co-workers are fun and easy to get along with, but also get the job done. My favorite part of work would be the environment and the people I get to work with. I have made many friends at this company. A typical day at work is not too stressful, although weekends and holidays can get hectic."
good,"My usual workday consisted of correcting clothing for optimal presentation, greeting entering customers and processing their purchases in check-out. Management was really good, I was never confused about which task I was assigned to and what I had to do."

good,The training is excellent to provide the employee with effective knowledge and skills to provided a good customer service to the customer.
good,"The most enjoyable parts of this job were learning the inter-workings of a national brand retail store, and interacting with customers."
good,"This is a retail management position so everyday consisted of opening/closing the store, money management, making sure customers are happy, assessing business metrics and daily trends, preventing shoplifting, training associates and holding them accountable. I was able to learn basic management skills as well as how to successfully run a multi-million dollar business. So the experience was well worth adding to my resume. My supervisor was based in Texas and I worked in Oklahoma, so I only saw him about once a month. We communicated over the phone everyday which made my performance-based feedback objective and limited. One goal I had running this business was to create a fun and enjoyable work environment for all employees, which contributed to an overall positive moral at work. I thoroughly enjoyed working with every single person at the job. The hardest parts of the job were the long hours and the inconsistencies in operations from project to project delivered by the home office. The amount of shoplifting in the mall was pretty high and preventing it seemed to consumer my day sometimes. Although, everyday was enjoyable due to the people I worked with and the basics of the job were not too hard to grasp."
good,"If your looking for a fun part time job, this is the place. co workers are friendly and also very talkative. So do it and apply today you definitely will not regret it."
good,Be ready to deal with all kinds of people. Shy or overly aggressive they're always right. And you cant argue back other than that fairly simple and easy job.
good,"During my time at Abercrombie & Fitch I gained an exceptional amount of work experience. Many job responsibilities required while working as a brand representative consisted of; customer service, answering phones, working the cash register, maintaining the store cleanliness, greeting customers, being a team member, understanding and being able to execute tasks given by management, money verifications, and being able to do all those tasks in a timely manner."
good,Just making sure every customer hears about the new products that are for seal with a smile and I'll be folding clothes with not speaking to customers multitasking.
good,"Working at Abercrombie and Fitch was great, but I felt like I needed to work someplace that related to my future career as a nurse."
good,"Abercombie was a great company for me. I grew from associate to Management. With the company taking a huge toll in negative numbers, it was time to go. But I have only great things to say about Abercrombie and my experience there. The Cons were more out of our control."
good,I really enjoyed working with my coworkers late at night. This was an overnight job where we would stock merchandise for the next day. It's a nice job to interact with coworkers while getting our jobs done on time.
good,It is really just your basic retail job. The only problem I had with the place was I was not able to get enough hours. Everyone was very nice and the technology is pretty easy to understand.
good,"Well, I like working for Abercrombie&Fitch because it gives me a chance to learn new skills i.e be crosstrained in different work areas. like picking, full case forward, outbound. The typical day at work is from 4pm until finished M-THURS.The managers give there associates praise for a job well done and recognize associates for helping out in other areas."
good,"It was a good place to start, you can gain experience interacting with customers. It helped me with my speech and shyness."
good,"the work was repetitive but your fellow co workers made up for that, and there's a laid back atmosphere to the whole place."
good,"Fun place to work for high school students and maybe first year college kids. The environment changed when the ""look policy"" changed. What i mean by this is that the brand sort of changed its appearance in my opinion because now instead of hiring people because of their good looks and work ethic, they now hire pretty much anybody whether they look good or are ugly defeating the ""exclusivity"" of the company. Other than that, its still cool to work there because of the cool people and pretty lax work enviroment."
good,"-Co-workers were great and fun while at work."
good,"I would start by reading the unit and sales number after clocking in at cash rep. Then asking a manger what needs to be done by the end of my shift and having my 5 minute meeting with the main floor manger that day. I would mostly start with cleaning up the racks and re-sizing the clothes. Then I would go to the fitting rooms and put back the go back clothes. Always going up to customers asking if they need help and greeting customers. cleaning the fitting rooms and sales floor. answering the phone and helping the customer find what they are looking for. I was always being doing what needed to be done but always got told what I was doing wrong and not being awarded for what I did right during my shift. I always felt like I wasn't doing my job right but I have many years and skills with retail and thought I was doing what is right,"
good,"A typical day at work for me was on the cashier or trying to get sales. I welcomed each customer, showed them around the store and made them feel comfortable to get me whenever they need help with anything. I learned a lot actually, i learned how to cope with customers, i learned how to ring up customers at the cashier, i learned how to do stock and i learned how to talk to people in general. The management was great, i love my managers they treat me amazing, always have a smile on their faces. My co workers are also great, we always have something new to talk about and they became my friends outside of work as well. The hardest part of the job is trying to communicate with foreigners that know no english at all, but i still find ways to talk to them and make sure they get the help that they want. The most enjoyable part is being able to meet people from all around the world, I've met people that open up to me and feed me interesting facts about their country and how it compares to Florida, i absolutely love it."
good,"fold floor"
good,"I didn't mind working here, but the pay was not enough for the amount of hours I worked. It as fast paced and I liked it. but the leadership was a bit harsh."
good,"The working environment is ideal, everybody is super friendly and very relaxed, there are so many people that you get to meet many different people."
good,Clock in Start folding back stock and having conversations with my fellow co workers help the day go by quicker the managers are pretty easy going not to hard as long as you get the job done. the hardest part of the day is when we have lots of back stock to put away and were short staffed the most enjoyable part is hearing different stories from different people
good,Working in a big store such as A&F on 5th ave gave me the experience to learn how to work in a fast pace. With skills I can carry on to each and every job I have from now on.
good,Plenty of advancement in certain roles within the company.  The occasional beer truck on campus is a great way to network within the company.
good,provide excellent training with customer service and safe and friendly environment with coworkers and manager relations.
good,"Great MIT Program for college grads."
good,A terrific job while in High School or even College. But make sure if you take the A&F plunge that you are willing to dedicate everything to Sales of clothing.
good,"fun, easy going, steady incoming calls, Nice management, work wasn't really hard. coworkers are nice, the most enjoyable is when we had free time"
good,"I enjoyed my time at Abercrombie. The employees were great and the customers, although annoying, could really be nice people. As apart of management you take on the responsibility of the entire store and it's employees. Be prepared to stay long nights and work early hours. Oh! and a very strict dress code."
good,"Most of my typical day was working on assignments given to me by my supervisor. I learned a lot about interpersonal communication and corporate security. Management was great and they were very easy to work with. My co-workers were hard working and knowledgeable. The hardest part of the job were the hours that I worked, The enjoyable part of the job was getting to work with a diverse group of people and experiencing different points of view,"

good,"- Búsqueda e incorporación de candidatos adecuados al perfil de la empresa, tanto para puestos de trabajo parcial como "
good,"A typical day at work is busy with welcoming and assisting customers, answering any questions, operating cash registers and answering phone calls, and most importantly keeping the store organized and clean.

good,"really nice company, fun to work , organize, treat you luke a person , manager really nice like as supervisers, good place work with people"
good,"Responsible for daily work lineups, carryovers, workload balance, etc.  Can be a fast paced environment to work in, but I work best under pressure in meeting time lines and the demands of the business."
good,I would say as an Abercrombie & Fitch associate loved the place. Great atmosphere an great people to be around. Very clean and tidiness place you worked at your own pace long as you met the requirements an were good at what u did.
good,"I started working here during high school and it was fun for the most part, until they tried to get me to come in during my school hours. Co-workers, some are pretty genuine people, others are not as nice because they have this sense of entitlement just because their tag says model instead of sales associate."
good,"This company provided me with great experience coming out of college.  Although I was only a manger with the company for a little over a year, I had 7 years experience with the company.  A lot of room for growth if you are willing to relocate to the Ohio area."
good,"Typical retail environment. Would come in for the day and complete preassigned tasks for the day. I learned a great deal about time management when it came to completing tasks for the day. Also, learned about inventory management. There was nothing hard about this job, the company was very organized and laid out day to day task very clearly. Most enjoyable part of the job was meeting my wife."
good,"•	Being the lead stock I had many responsibilities such as maintain the entire stockroom, restocked inventory, handled shipment, supervised and trained employees, assigned schedules and hours occasionally, issued assignments and operated the cash register. With my knowledge from the company I was able to fulfill each task given on a daily basis. "
good,"The main aspect of this job was customer service.  The customer always comes first.  When there was not a customer to help, the store needed to be kept tidy.  Folding clothes was also high on the priority list. This company merged many religions, races, cultural background into one store.  I enjoyed learning about different people's lives and where they came from.  The people I worked with becomes some of my good friends.  This was a great first job, as it opened my eyes to the many different people of the world. "
good,"A mainframe programming work environment using COBOL, JCL, DB2, SQL, VSAM, IMS, CICS and Changemon.  The people were young and friendly.  Skateboarding from building to building.  However the barn like work environment and constant loud music was distracting and made it hard to hear others.  Overall it was a fun place to work but hard to hear others the closer you are to the center of the building."
good,Had fun working there.  The culture is not your normal retail culture/environment.
good,A typical day at work will be making sure all items are stocked and prepared to be put out on the floor for costumers. My managers are very cool and laid back but we all get the job done. There is a diverse group of workers in Abercrombie&Fitch which is a very cool experience because I am surrounded by different cultures. The hardest part in my job is climbing up and down the racks to get cloths and the most enjoyable moments are when I know we completed the task for the day.
good,"•	Kept records of promotions, sales and policies related to interactions and payment"
good,"fun work environment, no  way to move up the ladder so to speak"

It involves completing tasks as directed by the program regarding stockroom organization, salesfloor presentation, or leadership training. You will direct models and impacters to perform tasks and provide customer service. You will work with assistant managers to accomplish everything needing to get done to maintain a well-organized and efficient-running store."
good,I liked the people. Everyone was friendly. The coworkers were all around my age more or less. Models did have to stand for most or all of the time we worked. The shoes we had to wear aren't exactly made for comfort either. Working part-time afforded me very flexible hours though sometimes the hours were very long.
good,This is a good company if you are looking to gain experience in the retail business.
good,completed all tasks on times like write-ups and when we did write ups is when we design a closet and make it look decent for the customers to take interest and maybe purchase the product and i also did USR- Replenishments is when I go to backstock and restock the floor when a item is purchased and I made sure the backstock room was always clean before my shift was over.
good,I assisted the doctor in relaxation therapy and x-rays. I scheduled the appointments and handled all outpatient communication. I  learned a lot about the chiropractic field that I never knew before. I had one other co worker who was fantastic and the doctor was great as well.
good,"Took care of stock and sales floor duties, trained new employees, and prepared/informed the stock room manager and store manager for the day."
good,"-A normal day in the work place would consist of lots of customers coming in and out looking for something to buy and very often my opinion would be taken into deep consideration by some of the customers for potential sales, ranging any where from advice on what looks best for an individual to what are the some of latest trends."
good,if it wasn't so far & I didn't go back to school I would still be there. I miss them
good,Flexible hours and the management is always willing to work with students

good,"A typical day at Abercombie consisted of register training , running go backs , ringing up customers fast friendly and efficient . greeting customers that entered the store and my work area for the day. i learned a lot  from working at Abercrombie & Fitch , team work was the main and most important thing that i picked up from working here. engaging more with customers and learning how to be more involved with different people. i gained a lot of friends , from working here , this was never my intention but my coworkers were extremely friendly and helpful . the hardest part of my job at the time was training others on the register , but i finally got the hang of it and now its a piece of cake! the most enjoyable part of working at Abercombie was the environment , everyone was friendly and upbeat , it really made coming to work fun and enjoyable."
good,"I learned customer service skills here."

Daily staff meetings with associates to go over what has to be done for the day. Weekly management meetings to go over new things happening within the company."
good,"It was a fun Job although I didn't enjoy it too much; even though the environment and people were entertaining, because there were not many working hours."
good,There is always work to do. Never a dull moment. Coworkers are somewhat friendly. 
good,"This workplace is very flexible with your schedule needs. a typical day is just keeping the store in order, making it presentable to the shopper and make items visible and easy to find."

good,"abercrombie is a fun place to work, it is like being in a club. If you need a career a place to grow Abercrombie is not the place for that."
good,"I got recruited from college to work here and I enjoyed it very much, especially for my first job. I was a model/sales associate, so sometimes I was used for greetings and other store promotions and other times I did the normal job of a sales associate, folding, organizing, cash register, and customer service related tasks like helping customers and answering phones. The management staff was strict but nice and I appreciated it. They aimed for perfection so they made sure that we were always doing our jobs and doing it correctly. It was a great environment for me and the other employees, we were all friendly and hung out outside of work, but we knew when to be serious at work."
good,the tyipical day at work was a day of folding cloths. i dident really learn any thing that i dident already know. the managers were quite young so they was not really strict. the coworkers we all very friendy. the hardest part of the job had to b putting away the cloths at the top of the bays. htere was not really anything to enjoy it was all quiet simple and ordanery

Along with working alongside and supervising team members in the store, I actively recruit teenagers at Rock Valley College to come work for the company and conduct interviews along with the store manager.

good,Abercrombie & Fitch has great Management I would have to say the hardest part of the job is keeping your body is hydrated.
good,Fun work atmosphere. The position has helped me strengthen my management skills. As a manager I am responsible of running a multimillion dollar business. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with my co-workers. Hardest part of the job is leaving my co-workers behind when getting promoted to higher volume stores.
good,At Abercrombie & Fitch I made sure customers were satisfied. Such as greeting customers and
good,"It is good to work with this company. I enjoy every single time to work here...the manager is very good, I have only one problem with this company that is less work hour."

good,A typical day included being around customers and setting up the floor. I learned that communication is key and you have to have that with your co workers. The hardest part was stacking the clothes and making sure everything looked perfect. The most enjoyable part was the music playing and being able to work in a high brand store.

good,"My primary role was to make sure the business was running smoothing as I marked down sales of clothing while stocking them where they belong in the store. In addition, I also was able to audit items by gathering information on the brand's sales volume, sales trends, and stock levels. I had the ability to overlook other employees, as well as get my word out as to what the store needed to do to improve. When sales were going on, I put up signs to advertise. I was not only able to speak my thoughts and concerns but I was able to listen to the customers needs in addition to communicating effectively with other coworkers. I assisted with phone coverage and had the knowledge of working the cash register.The hardest part of the job was multitasking where I had to answer the phone if it rang, assist customers and work the cashier."

good,Its a very productive place. Helped me to see how a business reaches there goal as a whole. Everyones hard work counts.
good,"everyone was happy and preppy with good humor. for the most part, this is an easy job. if you don't mind folding and putting things away constantly then this should be no problem."

good,"If you are looking for a payed back retail position, where your coworkers will become your friends and you will laugh along side customers, try it out!"
good,"Cool place to work, if you have a good team. If you don't youll hate everyday. DM has clear goals, she will hold your hand till you can walk. Company is still changing. I liked it better in the old days when we cared more about marketing than people."

good,Working at Abercrombie allowed me to gain customer service and sales skills that will help me in future endeavors. The team is welcoming and very helpful. The management did a good job of training and was flexible with schedules.
good,"I feel as management, you cant really have a life outside of work, your life its spent at work doing overtime. Always on your phone checking in on your team/store/DM."
good,"Have worked at Hollister & Co. as a Brand Representative (sales assistant )  for 3yrs. Very flexible working hours, 0hrs contract, can choose to open and close availability, all scheduling is done online and very easy to use. Very good for students as can transfer between stores, and able to swap shifts with other employees via FB group if unable to work shifts. 50% discount on 10 items of clothing every month and 20% discount outside of these 10 items can also be used by family and friends, store dependant if the employee is present. Management team very friendly and easy going, all young staff between 17 - 25, shift scheduling often dependant on performance whilst working, which can be difficult when first working for the company, so have to work hard when first starting out and pick up shifts from other employees to ensure a continuous working schedule and good relationship with management. Progression within company very good, with many associates being offered the opportunity to apply for the Management Training Course which would elevate them to the role of assistant manager, company promotes heavily within."
good,"+ Freundliches und familiäres Team auch Management "
good,"AnF is a great place to work, a family oriented environment and extremely fun to work. The only downsize to it is the hours their trash, They can afford to give more hours so why not."
good,"A typical day at work consists of building customer relationships, working with interesting/friendly people, greeting and assisting customers, cash-register operations, cleaning store at the end of the night. Workplace culture has changed a bit over the years and its become a more inclusive environment. It is a fun, easy-going work place and most people are friendly, interesting people to work with. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to meet new employees and making friends at work. The hardest part was when store drama arises, whether it's with customers and employees, or drama between other employees."
good,I really like working at Abercrombie because it is a fun place and all the workers get along with each other really well. The managers are really caring for their employees and like to have fun as well.

good,"working at Abercrombie you learn many types of culture as well as you get to interact with many people. The staff is amazing to work with and you create an amazing bond with most of them ,"
good,"Interesting and fun place to work, however salary leaves more to be desired for young professionals. Despite this, it is a good place to start a career and gain experience, in order to move on to other retail and corporate positions."
good,"A pretty  good place to work. They work with your schedule as a part-time employee if you are in school."
good,"Shifts went by pretty fast, breaks were reasonable. Tasks are completed at a leisurely pace while assisting customers. The managers are relaxed, nice and fun but still expect you to get work done."
good,"Different warehouse duties "
good,I worked here for 6 years 5 years part time and 1 year assistant manager. I have no complaints about working part time. When I became an assistant manger I liked it but the demand from the company was to much they want you to do things in a certain amount of time that isn't realistic.
good,"Highly recommend for young adults.. Decent management and of operations. The managers actually paid attention to employees. Also, opportunity for advancement very slim."
good,"I love working at Abercrombie. Everyone is nice and outgoing, even the management is fair to communicate with. It makes it very easy to work there. Now, I would stay there only if I was working more hours and if they paid me more or the equivalent to my last job."
good,"Multiple tasks depending on the requirement ."
good,"So, I don't know honestly,I personally want more hours. personally I don't like the people telling gossip to the manager here its definitely not nice."
good,The management team and fellow associates make coming to work enjoyable. I like being a stock associate. I also appreciate being cross trained on register.
good,"Amazing group of people and lots of career opportunities at a young age. Mid-management can vary based on department, with some being better than others. If you want to be in retail, this is a great place to start."
good,"I learned how to prep,and shelve mechanise for the store.I also worked on the floor asking customers if any help was needed.I learned how to read inventory codes,and learned how to scan and shelve the particular items in appropriate spot.after I would finish one job, I quickly got to the next,while keeping all work stations in order. I had fun at work with the people  I was with,and I learned a good amount about being opened minded to new things in our job."
good,"Abercrombie and Fitch was a great company to work for and start out at. I have learned so much over my five years there, from learning to communicate with customers to learning how to manage others and execute floor plans and scheduling."

good,les contrats de travail sont très intéressants (max 25 heures par semaine) et la durée d'heures de travail dans une journée n'excède pas 5 heures.
good,"Abercrombie had strict rules, but the culture of the job is fun and enjoyable. The management there is great, and they offer you as many hours as you want."
good,I came into the company at a time of transition from old corporate views to the ones they hold today. I am proud to be associated with a company who is willing to make extreme changes to their corporate policies and practices to satisfy the complaints of potential customers
good,Working at A&F was an experience. It taught me how to be very detailed and organized. Management was very nice. The hardest part of the job would i have to say is spraying the store with the signature fragrance. The most enjoyable part of the job would be assisting customers.
good,Fun work place and great place for gaining experience. Management is very nice and supportive and teaches you how to do job correctly. Co-workers are also very nice and get along well with each other.
good,"The overall company is very methodical, very organized."
good,Abercrombie & Fitch was an amazing experience as the working environment was very friendly plus the managers would make us feel at home.There was work load but no work pressure as I was never forced to complete multiple task at a time and the tasks were all divided and wouldn't be a burden.
good,"Awesome place to work, with fantastic staff but they ask so much of you for such low pay along with not enough hours to give everyone, bt great for people looking for a part-time job"
good,Fun work place with supportive teams. Truly values people and relationships. Undergoing much change over the past year and is more in tune with customer and employee needs.
good,"From day one working in Abercrombie and Fitch I was made very welcome in the sales team. The managers were very accommodating to my needs, ensuring they could work the schedule around my main job, helping me with any issues I had, and being completely approachable at all times. It gave me great experience and pleasure working for such an established brand and also a brand that I feel very passionate about. I loved helping customers out and helping them style themselves and giving them ideas on what to wear. We had to push products which at first was daunting when approaching customers and informing them of our promotions in the shop, as I felt sometimes I was annoying them. That feeling quickly disappeared and I was very comfortable in pushing products and helping to reach our targets each day."
good,aberrombie and fitch was an interesting place to work. I often felt left out because of the whole culture of the place but overall it was an easy job all I had to do was fold clothes and greet customers.
good,The managers are always there to help if you ever have trouble with a customer and you usually will have trouble with a customer.
good,Providing excellent customer service to promote the brand. Tracking business trends to create schedules without exceeding any payroll restrictions. Recruit and oversee a staff of 60 or more associates to keep the pace with a multi-million dollar company.
good,Delegated and managed sale associates throughout the day while giving excellent customer service in a timely manner.
good,Abercrombie allows for growth within the company. The people who work there are enjoyable and friendly. Upper management is very helpful as well.
good,"A typical day at work consists of providing exceptional customer service by ensuring to greet every single customer and assisting them when needed, as well as continuously maintaining my work area to make the store look appealing at all times. I learned that having interpersonal skills and being able to work with others is very important for this job as it is all about engaging others and providing hospitality. The management team is extremely effective in a way that they build relationships with their employees making it a comfortable work environment."
good,"I leaned a lot from working at Abercrombie and Fitch. I learned some extra communication skills and people skills. The managers I worked with were fantastic. They were very helpful in explaining things to me and other employees, and they were very kind and understanding towards customers. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers who weren't so kind and understanding. Also, making mistakes and not knowing how to fix them on your own was difficult."
good,"i would pick the things that needed to go in the order and put them on the cart.i learned how to pick,the management wasnt bad but they really need more people.my co workers were alright i didnt really get the chance to talk to them.the worst part about the job was we only had to breaks in 10 hours."
good,"Impact team members maintain merchandise "
good,"Learned categorical systems and how to continue to output very high quality work regardless of work volume. Managers were down to earth and allowed music to be played in the stockroom, but would not let you sacrifice work quality or become idle. The job was as enjoyable as you made it, don't complain about having to pick up pace or help out where assistance is needed. Once you get into the routine there is no difficulty."
good,"I love working at Abercrombie. It is so much fun working with people around my age, and everyone is really friendly and helpful. We work as a team and that's our strongest point. There's no individual's goal, we work together and help out each other when one in need. I've learned to organize everything in the most easiest, effective way for customers. I've learned to be more patient, be a good listener and always have a smile on my face in difficult situations. My manager is very understanding, helpful, and always so nice to everyone. It is a great working environment."
good,"I assisted customers in purchasing clothing, assembled retail displays, and worked as a cashier. I learned a lot about retail and had to follow a company standard as a representative of Abercrombie and Fitch. As an on the floor sales associate we were hired as a store model. There was a strict dress code since we were a representative of the company, Management was supportive and very laid back. This job was not demanding and the work environment was wonderful. My co-workers and I shared similar aspects being that we were students. The most enjoyable part of the job was my employee discount which most of my paycheck went to."
good,"The work is very detail oriented.  Most work days are the same, recovering and restocking merchandise on the sales floor but there are frequent changes in order to rotate the new merchandise.  My co-workers are all mostly around the same age as I am and show a lot of support and pride in their work.  The management is fun and laid back but strict in reinforcing productivity and sales.  The hardest part of the job is the unexpected work load each day due to consumer interaction.  From working at this establishment I have learned how to become more detail oriented.  I have learned how to efficiently and effectively manage my time."
good,"Process shipment and properly fold in stockroom in correct placing, keep order and cleanliness in the entire stockroom, keep bays organized and neat, responsible for auditing merchandise to the floor, assisting managers."
good,"Took a job in finance right out of college.  The people were all nice, laid back culture but still worked hard.  Got a lot of responsibility early but some was due to high turnover.  Work life balance was great, rarely worked from home/on weekends.  Beautiful campus, young company, overall a good job."
good,This place has great people to work with and management to work for.
good,"I feel as though working at Abercrombie is more of a social thing than it is for actual work experience and pay. The work is boring and monotonus, but you get to meet cool, good looking people while working."
good,"I worked at the one in springfield, mo back in 2004 when techno wasn't mainstream, but i LOVED it! Music was awesome, good looking and fun co-workers, fun customers, pay was atrocious, minimum was 5.25 back then and I spent my whole pay check on the 60% off discount I received. I couldn't help it. Gas prices were 1.50 a gallon back then so it made a little more sense I suppose. A&F is just a fun all around place to work. Great place for 1st and 2nd year college students to have before parents cut you off and forced to wait tables."
good,"A typical day at Abercrombie & Fitch in the stock room is you have to sign in then go to your folding spot and start pinning alarms on clothes until its time to go home. They give you an hour break if your working pass a certain amount of hours. While working there i learned how to work in environment with a lot of people in a small space. The management there is OK, The co - workers help each other out so it's not a ""all for one"" work environment. The hardest part of the job is finishing 150 units of clothes in a hour. The most enjoyable part of the job is the benefits and the pay is great for the amount of working your doing,"
good,The focus is on store experience and what goes into it. Great opportunity for growth & travel.
good,"Abercrombie and Fitch represents a definite brand and marketing technique. The company helps managers by creating a clear path that if followed, will lead a manager to a definite raise."
good,I have only been associated with AKIRA Chicago for a few days now so there is not much that I can add to the review. The company is a booming fashion and clothing company that started in Chicago and is now in various countries and cities around the world.
good,this job is great for someone looking to gain more experience in retail. The customer service is astounding and the employees are so helpful. I would highly recommend for a first job
good,the workplace of Abercrombie and fitch is very customer pleasing and they care a lot about your service in the store and your experience with us also.
good,"Abercrombie offers a great environment to work in. Upper management cares about your growth, and helps you to excel. I've learned a lot of leadership qualities by working here and how to build a team of people that help the store achieve its target goals. The most enjoyable part of this job is definitely the people you work with."
good,"An exciting, muti-cultural and vibrant place to work. The London Flagship store attracted an eclectic mix of customers and colleagues. This was a  dynamic and interesting role that allowed me to learn a lot about people and the work environment."
good,"Words can't begin to describe how much I've enjoyed working for this company, especially my store. The managers I've had and learned from have been extremely driven, understanding, passionate about what they do, while also having fun! I've always loved the staff I   worked with as well, management does an amazing job at finding people with the same upbeat and hardworking attitudes that makes the workplace not only fun but successful. I   genuinely loved going into work everyday, I   even wished I   could work more and wish they hired more full time brand representatives. One thing I   do wish is that the pay was more. My first year I   was paid minimum wage but then transferred to the new prototype store and was paid a dollar more. It would have been nice to be offered at least a bonus for good work. Brand reps are usually paid minimum wage. Overall, this is a great first job for younger adults or even high school students. Not a great salary but I've learned so much and it was very enjoyable"
good,"when I first got hired at Abercrombie, I was super excited because I had never worked in retail before. Mostly all of the brand representatives and stock associates are very kind and genuine people; I've made a lot of lifetime friends there. Work bonding outside of work was happening too. Sometimes, hours wouldn't be great, and a lot of time is just spent helping foreign customers and being on your feet for a long time at once. Shoplifting was kind of a big thing at Abercrombie; we would always have to be calling security. Management is great for the most part- a couple of them are very close friends now."
good,"A typical day at work is productive.The management team and co-workers are always friendly. Holidays are a lot more fast paced than regular days, when it is fairly slow."
good,Abercrombie and Fitch dealt with cleaning up the stores and folding clothes to perfection. We had to clean dressing rooms and check out customers who wanted to buy products.
good,Abercrombie always had a welcoming environment with many opportunities to meet new people since my store was in the heart of all the tourist attractions in Honolulu.
good,"Very good place to work. There are many cliques in the workplace and that can be frustrating at times, but the benefits and advancement are very good."
good,"For my first real job, working for Abercrombie & Fitch taught me a lot. I was 20 years old and had never worked in retail before and not really knowing what to expect going into it I was pleasantly surprised at how thorough and exact the company is and the many opportunities that the company afford (for example: Many of the models in the ads actually work in the stores and many of them have been discovered and are doing bigger things now!). The entire store got along and operated as a big blended family which was great. My particular duties included back stocking, processing shipment, building shelves and closets, organizing the store, preparing and help assist in floor sets, cleaning and other duties of that nature. I would say the hardest part of the job was I was not a particular ""natural"" in wearing the brands clothes as the brand was not my particular style but I learned that I loved being ""behind the scenes"" making sure the ship ran smoothly, honing my organizational skills and on occasion delegating task when necessary!"
good,"Entering this career right out of college was both rewarding and difficult in a good way. A&F really pushed me to go beyond my own expectations for not only myself, but for the company as well. I loved that everyday at work was different, had a new challenge, and new people to interact with. A&F showed me the great parts of being a manager and leader, and also worked with me and helped me through the tougher parts."
good,"very interesting place to work , everybody know each other which makes it easy to work together . the shift are flexible and the managers very understanding."
good,"Minimum wage, folding clothes over and over again. If that sounds nice to you, you will love it. For a retail job, I highly recommend. They  won't force you to sell products."
good,I have worked with Abercrombie and Fitch for over 5 years. My continued employment with the company has allowed me to meet a variety of affable young professionals with varying ambitions. The relaxed atmosphere has made my time spent in various positions quite beneficial; I have been able to develop strong organization and communication skills.
good,Everyone has a role to play in the store on a daily bases. It is important to make sure you are doing your work at all times. Managers may call you to assist on other task while you work and you may get caught up with helping customers- this happens to me too often. Weekends are crazy so pick your hours wisely.
good,It is a perfect first job. People are nice and friendly. They help me and show me everything I need to get things done. Being a stock associate is easy enough. All we do is to organize the stock room and make sure to refill whatever is sold. The managers are all kind and patient. Great working experience overall.
good,The dress code and expected behavior was quite specific at Abercrombie. I enjoyed working in a place of high standard and demand
good,"A typical day at work would be to greeting the customers, folding down the store, putting away any go-backs, keeping the customers happy and always keeping a positive attitude. Coworkers are amazing and so are the managers. It gets boring when its a slow day, but overall its a cool place."
good,"We have four managers in total and each manager is responsible for floor supervising for certain time frame within a day. Floor supervising includes zoning associates to designated area to cover the floor with great customer service, making sure every customer is being greeted and assisted, and lastly making sure the salesfloor is shoppable and visual merchandising is in good shape. As an assistant manager at the store, I needed to respond quickly to incidents that happened and solved them in a calm and professional manner. I needed to leave sign-offs to my District Manager every time I opened/closed the store, notifying him on how we did for business and how we have managed hours and what we could have done to increase sales. The hardest part of the job was to ensure part-times associates are constantly showing up for their shifts as they were only high school students with exams and assignments to work on. I enjoyed working at Abercombie overall as I have learnt a lot not only when I was a Manager in Training, but also my leadership and management skills have greatly improved throughout. Also, our senior would write out a career development plan with me every 6 months to ensure our hard work was being appreciated and what we could improve on."
good,"Strong costumer service culture which the employee needs to be talkative and willing to help the costumer as much as possible. "
good,"fun work place with supportive management."
good,"I worked for Abercrombie&Fitch for 16 1/2 years a good company to work for with excellent benefits I learned a lot about retail we all worked hard and had fun at the same time, what I liked most about the company was my Co-workers I really miss all of them."
good,I've learned what it takes to be a manager from Abercrombie. It definitely opened my eyes up to how much work is put into managing a store that has high volume of traffic each day. This job taught me so much that no matter where I go I know that I can perform the duty's that are presented.
good,This was a great place to begin working in the customer service world. I was there for four years and gained great communication and organizational skills during my time there.
good,"A typical day at work includes: folding clothes, making sure the store is clean, handling the cash register and controlling the dressing rooms. The managers and co-workers made the environment enjoyable and comfortable to work in."
good,"Great place to work!"
good,"-everyone is respectful"
good,"Coming into A&F, I usually lock my belongings into a personal locker, go onto the main store floor and clock in through the register. I get assigned to my area of the store and start to organize and greet customers. Working here I learned how to fold neatly and approach people. Management were extremely nice and outgoing, they make you feel super comfortable. My coworkers were also approachable and easy to talk to. Seeing that this job was only part time and I was getting paid minimum wage, the hardest part of this job was that we had to buy the clothes which were expensive and took most of my check. The most enjoyable part of this job was when we switched locations of the store and all teamed up to open up the new store."
good,"Every day I transfer in new merchandise, refill the merchandise, and transfer out merchandise, this requires bookkeeping skills.  I am also in charge of the marketing of the merchandise, and organization of it.The best part of my day is dealing with customers and making sure that they leave our store with not only the merchandise they were searching for but a wonderful experience as well. The hardest part of my job is question of when shipment does not come in on time, it slows down our business. The workers at this facility are great and it makes my job a lot easier when they are so willing to work hard."
good,"Working at Abercrombie is enjoyable. As I worked at Abercrombie I've learned to work as a team, become very organized and developed an outgoing personality . Although I haven't done the process of becoming a manager I wouldn't mind the responsibility. My co-workers are very fun, outgoing, and hard working people; we all help each other out no matter what. I honestly don't know what could be the hardest part of my job, I guess it could be when I first started all the things you needed to memorize but I don't really feel like anything is hard, its just the matter of learning and getting used to everything. The most enjoyable part of my job would have to be listening and singing to music with co-workers while getting the job done and making the job look right."
good,I maintained the floor while I helped customers who needed help find what they needed. I also ran the cash registers and stocked in the back.
good,"Good job with good people. Definitely need to be experienced in golf."
good,"I enjoyed my short time working with this company which, unfortunately, I had to quit due to my recent relocation. The team members were friendly, management was pretty good and the job taught me time management and prioritizing workload skills, and even some new, more efficient was to fold!"
good,"Had a great time working with kids and fashion,helping parents to enhance their child's appearance."
good,"SPLENDID discount! 40% off can't beat that if this is one of your favorite stores. A lot of work in my opinion for little pay(minimum wage). Although if that works for you, you give in what you put out there's room for advancement. At the time I didn't care for management but I heard it is better. Great coworkers, always willing to help. Little to no hours."
good,"A very enjoyable, fast past working environment. Get to work with amazing people! Company provides an amazing training program when first becoming a manager, and provides all the tools necessary to learn the position. Many opportunities to excel throughout the company, especially since they only hire from within."
good,"a typical day will be to come in and help the managers with shipment, floor sets and update. sales floor replenishment and drive business projections"
good,"great benefits, bad pay, young inexperienced management team"
good,Learnt to utilize my skills and potential which greatly enhanced my professional abilities.
good,loud but lots of fun if you have the right staff. pressure to recruit can be a drag. love and miss working here though.
good,Days are full of customer interaction and maintaining store standards. you get to work with a team of young and fun people who always keep you in a good mood.
good,A typical day would be helping customers and achieving sales goals throughout the day. I was able to strengthen my customer service skills. The most enjoyable part of working there was the energy of the team and how we were all able to get things done.
good,Overall Abercrombie is a great working environment. The managers are friendly and I don't have many problems with the work its easy and keeps you busy.
good,At Abercrombie & Finch I found it difficult to stay busy. The company and location of my store was at a slower pace than I am used to. I would often go to the backroom to organize or find something to do to pass the time.
good,Sometimes they will cut your hours short. Hours aren't consistent. The staff is amazing and have a well organized management team. They're very hands on with training.
good,I loved working at A&F. I enjoyed styling and servicing customers. I always had an adrenaline rush making my sale goals. Working holidays was the hardest part because I couldn't spend it with my family.
good,"I liked working there, but I had a lot of family emergencies and also an important day. I told management ahead of time that I could not work for that one day, but they still scheduled me"
good,"Such a great company to grow your career. "
good,"A great place to work to get your foot into the high-paced retail environment. Great company, great products, great employees, and great customers. "
good,"Everybody works together, has a great attitude, and has a lot of fun together. Even when there are tough customers or there is a lot of work to be done, there is a great community within the store and everybody is passionate about the brand."
good,"I had a part time job as a brand representative and sales assistant at the retail store, Abercrombie and Fitch in London, Regent Street. I was trained in customer service in the busy London based store such as managing the cash register and working as part of a team to ensure good sales and customer service."
good,"Typical day at work"
good,"Every job has typical day at work but what i learnt at Germany was life time remember, in a 2+ years of experience was very knowledgeable and applying my experience in india"
good,"It was very fun working with them, the workplace culture was like a big family but there isn't a way to advance. Management had favorites that they would joke around with and they weren't very inclusive but exclusive"
good,"I worked as a visual Merchandiser here. It was my first job. At first I was intimidated by the very good looking people here, it seemed they only hire models lol but I then became accustomed. They are really big on customer service and employees using the provided employee credit card  "
good,"As with any other job in retail there are plenty of slow days and a few incredibly stressful days. The upside of having downtime on the slow days was that we really got to know each other. As stressful as it is to prepare for a huge set or sale event such as Black Friday, if you believe in your team you'll be golden."
good,The hours were good but the pay was bad.  feel as though retailers deserve more compensation for their work in keeping the store in tact. I love that the managers would let you come back after leaving for college.
good,"Working in a retail store you have to really know about your clothes and fashion and be ready for any type of request the customer may be asking for.  "
good,If you are young And looking for a fun job where you can grow and learn customer services this is the place for you. Very fun place to work relaxed environment and great team building job.
good,"The people you work with are all young and fun. It's a relatively easy job, but depending on your city you will either be busy or bored."
good,"short hours"
good,"The week was consistent, it was not flux at all. It is a pretty easy job, because you are surround with people that want to help you succeed. I think the most enjoyable part of the  job was when I socialized with others."
good,"Tending to customers on the shop floor, prepping clothes, chatting to customers and colleagues."
good,"In a typical day, I log in and take care of usual tasks (cleaning, answering the phone, folding clothes, etc). Management always keeps employees updated with latest deals, schedules and daily tasks. The job is relatively easy, the only challenging part is acquiring a good amount of hours, especially as a college student."
good,"As a Store Manager at Abercrombie and Fitch, I was given the opportunity to learn and grow in a fast paced high-end retail company. I was trained in a wide range of daily tasks involving the company. These tasks include, but do not limit to, scheduling associates for both shipment and floor associates, stockroom managing, running and assisting in various floor sets. With such a large range of tasks at hand, I was fortunate enough to work with some of the most humbling, helpful and competent co-workers. My co-workers were the best part about working at A&F. Having great people to work with, lessened the rough task of having to work a lot of overnight shifts for floor sets. Overall, I enjoyed the fast paced and demanding aspect of retail."
good,This job was awesome and i had my style but the shift changes alot and they never give me any information about somethings. Was a great a job but no communication!
good,"With a smaller staff, you become very close to your co-workers and management. Reliable people and an great give and take work relationship and trust with everyone."
good,"when i worked at this job before they closed, i've always worked at the back. Abercrombie & fitch is always a good first job, the company is very laid back. co-workers and managers are nice to you and always give you what you ask for."
good,"•	Inventory Control"
good,"Daily duties included customer service, marketing, stock, inventory, cleaning, and maximizing profit. I learned how to accurately serve customers, create apparel displays, and enforce marketing techniques. My co-workers were friendly and we worked as team. The most difficult part of the job was helping with the seasonal floor-set, however, it was also the most enjoyable part of the job because all employees worked extra hours and we worked hard in order to execute the work faster."
good,"it's very extravagant, and never a dull moment which is good when you doing a job you love, i learned how to greet customers, and make them feel as is they need to come to that store more often. The management is great honestly cause the mangers are very fair. My co-workers where very nice and fun to work with definitely when it was time to work. The enjoyable part is when you are allowed to pick out their outfits so you can be able to wear."
good,"The position of assistant manager was different depending on the shift I was working, night or day shift.  If I came in the morning I had to make sure the store was up to standard and ready for business, the employees arrived on time, tasking the employees to work in certain areas, and making sure the register had the proper amount of funds.  Mid day shift, I would get an update from the assistant manager leaving, and drive forward with what they delegated to the employees.  Night shift is the same standard to include closing the store down, ensuring employees were cleaning, restocking the floor, finishing inventory on any shipments, counting registers properly, and ensuring the registers had the correct amount of funds. "
good,"A very precise work etiquette is required to work here. Perfection in the store is a must, it's the Harvard of folding skills. No make up, nail polish, piercings, and clothes must be from the most recent associate catalog. Managers were fun and outgoing, made the day go by fast. "
good,"Overall, just a great working environment for college students looking for a good part time job."
good,"I worked overnight, so i was always a laid back work place. from previously working at abercrombie i learned how to fold clothing in a different way. he management team was very welcoming and assisted you with anything you needed. my co-workers were individuals such as myself; young, fun,responsible and ready to work. the hardest part of the job was becoming used to working overnight. The most enjoyable part of the job i would say had to be knowing that my hard work paid off."
good,Helped with the retail experience and knowledge to sale retail to better help my experience is sales for career.
good,Awesome day working. Managers are super friendly and help out when needed. The fun part is getting to meet new people from different places.
good,I loved working here because most of the staff was around my age and my store was small so we were all friends even outside of work. The company allowed workers to go to castings for modeling opportunities and was very flexible with scheduling and acknowledging that many employees were highschool or college students.
good,"Monday through Friday type of schedule. Every day is always something different. Depending on the people that you meet, you could learn a new word in a different language. I've learned on how to use my time effective and efficiently. Through the tough days, it always how can you get the picture across to another person to a way that they can understand it and apply it to their daily routine."
good,Day to day life at A&F is very relaxed yet focused on the work and tasks. A&F pushes employees to advance within the company rewarding them with very competitive salaries and a good amount of responsibility.
good,Good place to work.  They give great hours and pay you very well.  Management and other staff is good.  They teach and train you very well. Employers and other employees will respect you from time to time.
good,"I worked at a rather slow location so most of my work days were spent doing a lot of folding, but the management and other brand ambassadors were all very friendly and made working there enjoyable."
good,"As I continuously tried to complete my task, I wasn't able to finish. But, although through my failures I gain experience every time. To always approach the task with no hesitation."
good,"I've worked at Abercrombie & Fitch for 8 months now, and I absolutely love it. The only thing that bothers me is the minimum wage. Besides that, my managers and co workers are amazing. The sales at the store are amazing. Our discounts are bomb. You couldn't go wrong here if you want to get some retail experience. Extremely fun and easy environment."
good,"i was very well appreciated"
good,There is a very cooperative management team with flexible shifts and hours.  The training is fast and the discounts cannot be matched by any other clothing company as far as I know
good,"Fun company with a big opportunity to grow. Although the pay is weak, the atmosphere & the people make it worth while. "
good,When I first started working at Abercrombie I lean how to work a cash register for the first time it was a great first job for me everyone was nice and respectful I also lean how to work the seals foor the manager was cool and she also showed me how to do so much at Abercrombie.
good,Very uncomfortable to work as a model here. The managers are always harassing you.
good,At work I would do USR and replenish the sales floor and help customers with sizes that they needed. I also steamed the clothes and worked on shipment. I also took out the trash at night and cleaned up stock room. I learned a lot about product knowledge and how a stock room was suppose to run. The managers were fantastic and communicated well. The most enjoyable part was learning about the product.
good,"The Home Office campus is spectacular and a place that anyone would enjoy working. Some of the departments worked long hours, but everyone really seemed to enjoy their job. Also, you can't leave out the beer trucks and food trucks that will randomly show up on campus after quarterly meetings. I now work in a regular office environment and wish every day that I was back on this campus!"
good,they're aren't really any typical days because everyday is different. the management team is really fun to be around & they actually care about your opinions.
good,It is good place to work. I work the weekend shift The pay is good.
good,"This position provided a great work environment, and excellent wardrobe. My job was to display clothing by wearing it, and showing individuals what looks good on them. Telling people certain Abercrombie clothing made them look better was encouraged. I used great clothing, and my personality to be successful. There was very little stress with coming to work, and just being myself."
good,"It’s a nice place to work. The schedules are pretty good, the work environment is amazing, the pay is just low and hours aren’t guaranteed. Otherwise, great company. I got hired on within 3 months."
good,Working at Abercrombie Kids has helped me develop more communication with the customers. Every day we have a different goal and they give us a meeting on how can we achieve.
good,"it a fast pace diverse environment, a normal woking day includes timesheet, supervision, and great customer service and protecting the brand. the most enjoyable part of the job is meeting people from different backgrounds from across the world"
good,"Fun, and friendly environment, and very flexible. You get employee discount. You will usually work with people your age or around your age. Management is understanding and nice!"
good,Got a job here and liked the atmosphere right off the bat when I joined. Nothing was too intense and easy to learn. With hard work I was able to adapt what and how to do organizing clothes and talking with others after working a lot.
good,"A lot of stuff I had to learn but throughout time I mastered every single detail, I don't worry or stress anything when I'm at work. Managers say I work hard and I learn things quick."
good,Wonderful place with great clothes. Very welcoming place.
good,"My typical day on the job would consist of walking into the store to look for a manager that is on duty so that they could help me punch in. Then I would be analyzed from top to bottom to make sure that I looked the part just to come into work. I couldn't wear any other nail polish besides white, red, or navy blue. Jeans had to be plain denim with pockets clear of any logos or designs. Or they could be jeans directly from the store. I worked as a stock associate in the back of the store. Stock associates are more of a team where we would split up the different sections of merchandise bought by customers among ourselves. We would pull the clothes, fold them or hang them according to their spots in the store and we'd place them out on the store front. The hardest part about the job was basically coming in everyday just to be analyzed and criticized about jeans not being the right color or the right season or whatever other minor problem a manager may see fit. It doesn't really matter as long as you look presentable & get the job done. Employees never stay at the job for long periods of time for the average I'd say about 4-6 months at a time. They hire everyday which makes it easy for people to get hired within a few days."
good,"It a very slow pace place. "
good,"I liked my job. It was fun and kept me moving. They treated the employees great, and did fun things for them. The only bad part was, it was seasonal."
good,"I learned how to successful interact with the customers and their needs. "
good,bad work life balance. shifts change weekly. most people are very friendly. job duties change weekly sometimes work is slow and other times the time constraints are not attainable
good,"It is SUCH a fun work environment to work in, my co-workers are awesome! The smell does give me a headache from time to time. I don't complain cause I'm getting used to it. All of our managers are super nice and respectful. They are also very helpful, whenever you need help with something, they will be more than happy to help you."
good,Easy and stress free job. Great for college students who have a busy schedule and just want to make some extra money on the side. Get to work with people your age and overall management is relaxed.
good,"Most days, working at Abercrombie Kids doesn't feel like actual work. It's a fun environment, filled with a great group of diverse individuals."
good,"Fun place to work, very flexible . Easy not very hard to pick up on"
good,The management in this company needs an upgrade. There wasn't much respect from the management towards its employees. The job culture is exactly what you'd expect from this store.
good,"If you're looking for a job that you don't mind standing on your feet during, and being bored out of your mind during the dry sections of the day, this is for you! Lots of freedom and friendly staff. Flexible hours."
good,A typical day at work went by fast. I got along with my co-workers and we got our work done at the time it needed to be done. Working in the stock room was sometimes a little hard when things got messy or having to change the season or clearance but we always made it work.
good,i loved putting my time into working for Abercombie & Fitch but this company wasn't at all good at letting the employees know their hard work has paid off. All the managers care about is getting new models that are attractive.. i don't think that is very professional.
good,"For a part-time job, Abercrombie provides a fun atmosphere where a person can learn a lot about retail."
good,"It was a job i took during high school and much of college. Met great people and learned great knowledge of management, and retail experience"
good,"Very typical retail, opportunity to build and create outfits. Also good way to gain retail experience. Opportunities to advance career if needed. Would recommend."
good,I worked here . when i was getting out of school a good warehouse job to get my foot in the door.  They showed me the ropes its actually where i drove my first forklift so im forever grateful for the opportunity to work there
good,I worked at two different Abercrombie and Fitch locations and had an overall great experience! It's a great job for college students looking to gain experience and they have killer discounts.
good,"Very busy, located at the mall of america. The enviroment is very interesting. Able to talk to everyone and suggest merchandise. Friendly co-workers as well as managment."
good,The most up to date fashion stylist work here! I loved the holiday season and crowds! Very upbeat and I enjoyed the employee discounts. My co workers were awesome.
good,"Installation,configuration,Migration and Support of Oracle 11g and 12c"
good,"It is a friendly and competitive environment. Definitely a great opportunity for young men and women to gain some experience. The hours are not great, but the overall atmosphere is awesome."
good,"Nice summer job for pre teens and teens looking for a goo pay check. Manageable hours for you to work, meet tons of great people here. Really has a California aura to it. Easy going staff and great music to listen to."
good,"The work place had horrible management but the coworkers really made the location for what it was. There wasn't much mobility to up your position, I got very unsettling."
good,"everyone at the company treats everyone equal and want u to be the best u can be, overall alot of growth and have lots of opprunity to become a better person"
good,"I enjoyed working there , everyone was very sweet , caring and helpful. If I didn’t have a family emergency and had to move away I would have definitely stayed working at that place."
good,Great place to work. Helps you strengthen your people skills. The whole process within the store is conducted very efficiently and easily. Gives you very good customer service experience.
good,"A great place with low stress work requirements, where one can make friends and enjoy a retail atmosphere. Tasks can be completed at reasonable pace, hours are flexible enough and longevity with company is valued."
good,It was a Great company to work for. Management was great. And communication was good between staff and management. I would recommend working for your first job.
good,"great working environment, excellent coworkers, nice facilities, nice discounts, happy employees, good schedules, OT available but not required, quality products"
good,I learned how to properly help and associate with customers to maximize sales and satisfaction with their purchase. The environment was very lively and I enjoyed it very much.
good,My time at Abercrombie & Fitch taught me so much besides regular duties. Due to my experience there it gave readied me other forms of work besides retail.
good,Fun place to work for. Managers can be friendly at times but the company focuses too much on the employees appearance rather than their work ethic. Hours can be long.
good,I thoroughly enjoyed working at Abercrombie&Fitch.  I gained excellent customer service and communication skills working there and I had fun.  It was fast paced and always exciting.
good,"After the daily meeting with the floor supervisor, we either work the cash register or help with the upkeep of the store which includes folding down and running go backs."
good,Abercrombie is great company that gives its employees many incentives for them to thrive and grow in such a healthy work environment. It's not like the company overhires so each employee only gets 7 hours per week.
good,You gain knowledge about the store and how to perform your duties as a Brand Representative. You also get to improve your customer service skills by interacting with customers from beginning to the end of your shift.
good,its great working for a place where you get discounts on clothing.  worked for a great manager but horrible co-workers.  loved the environment and manager.
good,"Worked at A&F while in high school and enjoyed the work and school life balance. They are very relaxed and will work with student's schedules. Make sure you articulate your schedule ahead of time, so the managers are able to plan when you need your shift covered."
good,Everyday at work here was a blast. The managers were super fun and laid back yet still got their jobs done. They tried to make it competitive for the sales Reps and enjoyable too.
good,"Fun crew members, very organized and clean. the only complaint would be not enough hours. Fun place but too many associates with too little of payroll."
good,Long Hours and but a great fun work environment. Good Salary and lots of overtime if you want it. Very stressful retail environment but the people just made everything that much better.
good,"My personal experience working at Abercrombie was great. It honestly depends on who your managers are, and the people you work with. I was lucky to be apart of a great team. The job does get very boring, and floor-sets are always a pain."
good,been working with abercrombie and fitch and hollister for over 5 years now and truley one of the best places i’ve worked the employees are like a huge family
good,I liked the job because its my favorite clothes brand. The pay is too low and you can only work part time. Your only getting paid 7.00 dollars an hour. You can only work full time if your a Manager.
good,I loved working here and it being my first job out of high school. My manager was the absolute best and she took time making sure i knew the basics or customer service and how to keep developing
good,I thoroughly enjoyed working at this location - I worked in sales and I reflect back on my time with this company with a positive feeling. Working in stock was also an enjoyable part of this job.
good,"A day consists of folding, talking, cleaning, and repeating."
good,"Very chill days, continuous customer flow. you get time to learn the store, your team, customers, and how the products fits you. Management is extremely helpful."
good,"Met new people from all parts of the world. Had the chance to learn how the retail environment works - sales, targets that need to be achieved, stock, fitting rooms as well as met people who are now some of my closest friends."
good,"Abercrombie was a very fun and productive place to work at. It was my first time working in a wear house, and i loved it. Everyone was easy to get along with and everyone always wanted to get the best numbers that we could produce each day, which made everyday go by fast."
good,"what i learned from working here was that you always got to be opened-minded about anything, also the customer is always right. I miss working here because of the people i was surrounded by every shift, they made it feel like it wasn't work."
good,"Good experience; fun environment, great manager, good starter job. The business was well staffedand a positive environment to go to work everyday. It was fun."

good,Abercrombie is a great place to get started in management. They have a ten week training program that teaches you how to run the business. Very causal place to work with fun co workers.
good,"I've worked for Abercrombie since 2013. In my time here I have grown exponentially. This company has helped me to become a leader as well as a manager, and all of the skills are transferable."
good,It is definitely a great place to work. Perfect for college students. Flexible scheduling that allows students to not worry about if they can participate or not.
good,"Good hours"
good,"I had such a wonderful time working for this company. I met a lot of amazing people and every day of work was extremely fun. I learned a lot about visual merchandising, everything from lighting to fun and creative ways to design the store."
good,A place where you can manage not getting your hours and still make a living. There is no job there that is hard. Everyone that I work with are easy to get along.
good,"I did this job in college, it was a great opportunity for me to learn more about a retail environment and what it would be like working for a corporation."
good,Working here is like working in your favorite store the customers are easy to deal with and the staff is almost like a family. Best times to work are honestly the holidays due to how many extra hours and incentives you get
good,"•	Operating the cash register system"
good,This was my first job in high school and had a great management team. They were all so helpful and great and when I told them I was moving to Los Angeles on short noticed it was nothing but kind thoughts!
good,Very fun work place. I made new friends and there was not a heavy work load. The mall i worked in was also very nice and the store managers had good character and work ethic.
good,"Relación empresa/trabajador muy correcta."
good,Good for students. This is a great company.  I learned great customer service skills.  I learned to be versatile on shift.  The culture is friendly and supportive in the workplace.
good,Working as a financial strategic intern at Abercrombie and Fitch is a very good experience. I anticipated in the project on analyzing the competitors and the financial strategy on company.
good,"Very fun workplace, however it is hard to balance work and home life with the given hours you are required to work. You will meet awesome people who will become life long friends."
good,"This company provides its employees with a reasonable wage with respect to their experience.  However, you must wear their clothes - duh - and must keep receipts with you for the garments you are wearing."
good,Abercrombie significantly helped me grow in the customer service industry and also as a person with growth and development of social skills improving. Abercrombie truly showed me the value of customer service and how good or mediocre service can effect a company no matter the product.
good,Great managment and great customers! I've learned great customer service skills! The typical work day includes folding clothes ad restocking and folding in the back greeting customers and making sure the store looks neat and clean!
good,Great place to work for and everyone was extremely nice and helpful. My supervisor was great as well and the entire atmosphere of the store was great.
good,Don't really have much to say about this company. I wasn't with them for too long but for the time that I was all of management was very friendly and the job task was explained pretty well. It basically was a temporary job for me.
good,"A fun environment to work in. A good starting job for those who are still in High School and in the beginning of college."
good,Great flexible hours for students. The work requirements are easy and you get experience with a lot of customer service. Nice environment to work in.
good,This place has taught me the value of teamwork. Staff members are awesome and helpful in many ways. Management is understanding and attentive to their employees needs.

good,nice environment to work in. everyone works together to help customers find what they need and answer any questions they may have. Everyone works together in a good team
good,"Enjoy the people, the staff, and the work environment. The detailing and the layout of the store is amazing. Fun work environment."
good,Nel mio attuale lavoro ho imparato molte cose sopratutto lavorare in gruppo che per lazienda e molto importante e sono organizzati molto bene e sono molto contento di aver fatto questa esperienza
good,Working at a kids store was awesome because you got to help out boys and girls find their own unique style and help them create a look that makes them feel awesome.
good,It was a good place to start working and it got me involved with cashiering and allowing me to learn more about different job types inside of one job.
good,"While working at Abercrombie and Fitch, I experienced a very decent atmosphere that I assure most employees do not get to experience"
good,"internazionalità, multiculturalismo, dinamismo, creatività"
good,"Great Company to work for! Promotes from within, and on a performance based system. Would strongly recommend to anyone looking for a career"
good,"You come in when the store close, and you restock the tables or walls, re-fold and make sure the store was up to par for the next work day. management was easy, they gave task and overseer the job."
good,"A typical day at work would be walking around the store trying to help costumers as much as they needed, also would use the cashier and handle money. I learned everyday at Abercrombie from finding a size, how to help more than 1 person at the same time. My co-workers always wanted to help, they always asked you if you needed help with anything or if you had any questions as well. The hardest part of the job was incase if there was any problem in the store we would ask the costumer to leave and if they didn't leave we would call security, or when the security alarms would turn on we would ask the costumer if we could check their receipt incase they stole from the store, this was hard for me because I never thought someone could cause problems or even steal. The most enjoyable part was my amazing managers were always happy, they were always there for us, my co-workers always had a smile, I was never tired of going to work, I enjoyed my time there."
good,"It was a fun environment to work for, and the people that worked there were fun as well. The music was repetitive, but you had the most random things happen when you worked there. You met the most interesting people across the world, and had to work late hours when it came to floor turns."
good,Fun work place but management often changed. My position was an impact which is a stock room worker but I was often put on the schedule to be a model which is a front end worker. I learned that Abercrombie and Fitch are very selective and tailor their clothing to a certain demographic. My co-workers that worked in the stock room with me were a few of my friends but for the most part I worked my shifts alone. The front end models were very beautiful and those employee that got hired for front end model but weren't as good looking were only given one shift a month. My favorite part of the job was working with my friends and meeting new people. The hardest part of the job was dealing with multiple managerial changes and getting used to new managers when they changed so often.
good,I loved working for Abercrombie and Fitch it helped to diversify my work ethic and personal experience with working with different people from various backgrounds.
good,I loved working in this field. Able to understand what was going on and getting the job done it was better than working in fast food.

good,"IT is great work at ANF home office.It is always a learning curve on a day to day work, interacting closely with the Development team, project management team."
good,"I really enjoy working at Abercrombie however trying to get hours has a tendency to be difficult at times. Great environment, great management. Pay is $7.25 They do expect a lot from you for a simple 7.25p/h. Management is great, and its an ideal job if you are in college however getting over two shifts a week again can be a challenge. physically job is easy. Black Friday will be your worse enemy."

good,"As a part time impact employee at Abercrombie & Fitch, I faced several responsibilities on a daily basis, most of which involved maintaining the sales floor to the highly professional stands expected of us at all times. This includes finding missing items from the sales floor, properly and neatly folding them, and making sure they reach their designated location on the sales floor. During heavy business hours we would find ourselves overwhelmed with the amount of work piling up and find difficulty keeping up with the customers. Through proper communication, hard work, and assigning specific tasks, I (as well as other employees) have overcome these challenges. Management is quite competent in dividing the tasks and solving unexpected issues. I have learned a lot concerning customer service and working as a team and I hope to carry these ideals with me to future positions."

good,A strong company that provides solid opportunities with various areas in finance to pursue.
good,"Abercrombie is a great company for those who are just starting out. As assistant manager, you learn how to manage employees as well as work with the corporate office to ensure the store is performing at company standards. Working for the Abercrombie company was a great experience."
good,"Definitely learned a lot about retail and sales. Worked closely with my managers who taught me almost everything I need to know about a retail store. The environment was great, everyone is friendly and lively which also made me want to be there even more. Without the live vibe from my coworkers, I wouldn't have a lot of great memories to share about working at this place."
good,As a textile designer I work closely with designers and merchants to design artwork for clothing that is relevant and brand appropriate.
good,Great atmosphere with customers and co-workers. We all worked well together and became close like a family.
good,I learned to work under pressure and with good teamwork. I loved meeting people from many countries.
good,"Upbeat co-workers who are fun, cool, and very nice. The work can get busy or slow depending on the day and season, but the environment is very ""go with the flow""."
good,It's a great company with a clear vision that drives it associates to work to their full potential.
good,I enjoyed working for the company. The coworkers are great and they work well together. The regulars are friendly and fun to help out. The cashier system is easy and simple. The hardest part is dealing with shoplifters.
good,I liked being a sales associate however after the company restructured I left due to bad coordination and misunderstandings. Although it was a fun place to work they were way over priced.
good,Easy place to start in retail if you've never worked before and it's a super young environment. All of my managers either went to the same high school as me or just graduated from college.
good,"This was my first job, so great for beginners wanting to have some experience in the retail environment. The work environment is fun, and easy to work into."
good,"The shifts are 5 hours but because of the number of people it was very helpful. If you needed hours someone was giving them away. So it was definitely an advantage. I've learned everything i know about customer service here. I refer to A&F at any interview i attend. Management was good it's a one hand washes the other. So you have to work together. The most enjoyable part of the job, was meeting the people for all over the world, hearing new languages and still managing to get the customer what they want. Also the Leads they build a bond with you because that is who you closely work with."
good,I like the flexibility with my schedule and also interacting with my co workers as a team to get the job done through out the day.

good,it was a nice experience only setback was it is a nice job sometimes you can be tired doing other stuff during the day so that was the only setback i occurred working for Abercombie & Fitch
good,Great job out of college. Advancement is rather fair and happens quickly when you do well.
good,"Well being a manager of a high volume retail store was extremely fun. I always had something to do and a customer to interact with. My workers, a staff of about 80 to 100 people is what I kept up with. Everyone was happy because I treated them like people and not just workers. If you have the ear of the staff, they will do anything for you. So I made sure of it. Management never came around and if they did, they were always mad because of my excellent performance of handling the store. My store was always on Top and I had the pleasure of giving my staff lots of parties for great work. My down fall was support from management when needed. They were never there and it seemed as though I was alone in everything I did. But great job!!"

good,FUN atmosphere but very limited hours worked at the front door as a greeter
good,The hardest part of this job was learning the rules/regulations of off-shore rigs.
good,"Abercrombie & Fitch is more of a temporary job for people in school. They have tons of employees, but they do not have enough hours in a day for them-- meaning you did not get great hours. However, it was a fun place to work in. It made me realize I enjoy customer service."
good,"This job started out great in the beginning, however, when things took a turn I lost interest. Hours were not given out as much and it became difficult to keep up with my bills. Great service, friendly people, warming customers,however, not a lot of working hours."
good,I really did not like the job. Pay was minimum wage with no commission. So i was basically standing for hours doing absolutely nothing at all because nobody shops there.
good,"This has been the longest job I've ever had. Although it was a very productive job that you had to always be focused for, the working environment was very comfortable. I've learned most of my skills such as time management, customer service, working under pressure and marketing working here."
good,"I was inspired by this college job. It brought me to focus on bruce webber a photographer who shot almost all the ads that mad A and F what it was, lead me to fashion. I also learned the way clothes move while working here. Learning how to look at clothes and style floor sets, mannequins each week."
good,I worked at AnF kids as a high school student. It was a fun easy laid back atmosphere that was great for earning some extra cash. People and managers were fun and easy to work with.

good,"I really enjoy working for this company. I thrive in this retail environment and my customer service skills were enhanced greatly. There is no difficult part of the job, it can be tedious work sometimes but that is retail. I now know what good customer interaction looks like and how to give the customer a great experience in the store. I have learned how important customer interaction is from the moment they walk into the store until the customer leaves."
good,"the environment is very chill and laid back, you have to keep yourself occupied when there are no customers in the store but overall it is an easy job and very enjoyable"
good,"Working at Abercrombie & Fitch was very relaxed, management was very understanding of schedules since they knew mostly everyone was in school. Working here was really fun and got to meet so many people."

good,"Help all the customers you can making sure everyone has received proper service. Really get to know what customer service is all about, great first job."
good,"This job kept me busy with many different task to complete each shift while being on the sales floor communicating with guest. I would usually come in and grab the new boxes of shipment first to sort, sensor, and back stock the new clothing items. Next I would have to ship items out from the store that customers bought online. Last I would refill the sales floor of the things that were purchase by customers throughout the day."
good,"Great management, great hours for a second job. The only thing that was difficult living 40minutes away was not being able to call in to see if you needed to be to work for your call in shift until 1 hour before."
good,"A working team that strives to make targets everyday. As a stock associate i've learned the importance of controlled merchandising systems and the replenishment of the sales floor. I worked with people from all over the world everyday. Learning about each others culture and religion. That created a very respectful workplace for us all. Probably working very hard all day to achieve daily targets set and not reaching them, was probably the hardest thing about my job. Personal growth is something that  I value a lot and working at Hollister as as Sales representative not only taught me customer service but also the importance about team work and that was the most enjoyable part of my job."
good,"My overall experience at Abercrombie and FItch was fun. The managers were always great, always got along with my co workers. The hardest part of that job would had to have been trying to stop the theft that happened. We always had to watch closely and pay attention."
good,"I worked Monday to Friday. Shift started a 9pm, we had to clock in at 8:45pm. The whole late night crew worked to restock all displays in store. I learned as a team we can accomplish a lot. There were nights were we had to stay late due to owners and investors coming to the store the following morning. The pay was good and hours were always available."
good,I've been working in retail for about five years and I enjoy it. I have great customer service skills and a lot of patience.
good,I personally enjoy working at Abercrombie the management is very laidback and chill and the associates there are fun to be around. The work is also really easy I just wish there was more hours though
good,"An average work day would be in the front room greeting the costumers that walk in , offer to help them find a clothing item in our store or check other stores near by. Through out my shift i would work the registers doing money transactions. The most enjoyable part of my job would be the co-workes and managers we all had a great relationship which is why our store had a good atmosphere, where everyone knew it was a team effort. The hardest part of my job would be if a costumer was not understanding  how our store policy is when it comes to returning an item, then they act in a bad manor towards you, then  to explain and try to get them to understand the rules of our store could not be so easy. From this job i learned a lot of life lesson to help better myself as a who i am in everyday life, and as well as how to run a successful business it is a team effort to reach and exceed goals as a company."
good,"a typical day is folding  and helping customers"
good,"Très bonne ambiance entre employés, management parfois absent et faux. Cadre et emploi atypique."
good,"i've learned a lot, and encounter with many people all over the world. Abercrombie is the number one store in the U.s that attract tourist. ive also master the cash register, i know how to deal with unhappy customers and try to accommodate their needs as much as possible. i love working and styling. that was the best for me it gave me a lot of excitement to help put outfits together  especially when they loved what they picked out! it makes the company, my manager look good and i love the brand!  Abercrombie isnt for me because they pay minuum wage, i feel my expertise and expereiece desrve more than that, other than that Abercrombie is a great place to start in retail and gain your experience to expand your job experience."
good,"-having to know the products being sold in the store and informing the customers about it as well"
good,"Working in this field is very enjoyable, at times this store does get very crowded and stressful during the holidays. Your co workers are always a pleasure to be around."
good,I enjoy working there everytime my co workers loved working with them
good,"Great entry level job"
good,"Slower volume store, not as as as the other outlets. I recommend starting here first."
good,"   I worked for the company for more than 2 years and I loved it. I was able to build my interpersonal and organization skills while I worked for both stores. My responsibilities included welcoming the customers, style the new customers and organize clothng. I also learned how to organize the stock rooms and help unhappy customers. The management team there were amazing we all worked great together. My co-workers were very professional and nice. The hardest part of the job would have to be when we had new merchandise and we would have to re-do whole walls and reorganize  the storage room. The most enjoyable part of my job was all the different people that came in and the people that would travel to the US just to get their children Abercrombie clothing."
good,I liked this company - an overall good company but I was not ready to make a permanent move to Ohio.... Beautiful State but I have all my family and friends here in NY where I was born & raised.
good,Everyone that I worked with was very easy- going and I had a great time working with them all. If there was ever a shift that you needed covered or switched there was plenty of on staff that were willing to help out.
good,a typical day at work for me would be. me walking into the store clock -in and start maintaining the sales floor. watching over cash and fitting rooms and just fold cloth all day help customers find the sizes they need. take a break come back do the same thing over again. close at 9 and start folding down the store room by room until everything is folded down help with the go-backs. clock out go home and do the same thing the next day
good,Positive workplace with young coworkers and a positive vibe. Allowed for flexible schedules and decent hours.
good,"The management is great and friendly. The management  really helped me learn my way around retail. At times the environment around the store could be sketchy, not because of any employees, but when boosters came into the store."

good,"Working Retail is a fun and new experience. Working with people around my age. There's a lot of good experiences, and I've learned a lot about being responsible along with working with customers."
good,Abercrombie & Fitch was a fun workplace. I handled the stockroom with inventory and shipment. My management team was very collaborative and dedicated to teamwork.
good,With the exception of a few bad employees the store was a great environment to work at. The management was great and very easy to talk to about work and they always value your input on the store.
good,"A typical day at work included helping customers find what they need and more and also folding all the clothes in the store. I learned how to talk to customers of all sorts, ones that knew they wanted, ones that didn't, and ones that were just rude and trying to cause problems. The management is the reason I stayed at this company. They made everything so easy and were laid back. The workplace culture was that you had to take the job serious but also chill because the store was only busy busy around the holiday time. The hardest part of the job was the hours, but only when there was a store update until 3am. The most enjoyable part was talking to customers from around the world."

good,Great company to work for aside from the fact that the job security isn't exactly there as the company is struggling and has been struggling for some time. It is a relaxed culture and environment at corporate office. It is a work hard play hard mentality. They treat their employees great!
good,"Very unstable recently due to leadership shifts and changes in expectation. Wonderful training and great people to work with, but now isn't the time to start working for them."
good,Working here you will be working harder finding items for the floor or getting sizes. If you're on the floor you will be on your feet putting items back onto the floor.
good,"Good environment to work in, easy to work with others and very friendly environment, the easiest part of the job is to communicate to customers and to work with others. the hardest part of the job was actually staying up to the shaving."
good,"Love the atmosphere, the music, the people you meet such as the customer's and your co-workers. The work is fairly easy such as Stockig(folding clothes advertising clothes by wearing them). Answering customers questions even if it's hard to understand them due to their native language. Just being in that atmosphere lifts you up and mostly you can catch everyone dancing and vibing to the tunes."

good,"Probably my favorite job ive had. stock and shipment most days, but  every other week to every week there would be a floorset or a update so it was nice to change it up a bit. the management is great and the coworkers make it more enjoyable. the hardest part was it was part time only usually. my favorite part was floorsets because you come in before the store opens so it was nice quiet time and you feel the accomplishment of finishing fixtures and seeing how they turned out."
good,"Once i'm clocked in i start from the the top and greet customers after 30 min i move on to the middle of the store either i do cashier or help other customers. I've learned to give excellent customer service and manage my time throughout the day. The most enjoyable part of my job is my crew, we are all a big family. We all have a great relationship."

Working as a trend driven designer being the first to identify emerging trends and translating these into fashion stories. Working closely with the Buying team and our Suppliers to capture the season’s must-have pieces.
good,Folding clothes isn't as easy but got used to it. Strong in closing procedures and updates for season. Got a long with the co-workers and the managers. Very friendly.

good,Work here is hard but once you know everything it becomes easier.  The co-workers and managers are really helpful and I love working with them.  The hardest part of this job is when it is not busy there isn't really anything to do.  The part I love the most is shipment.

Abercrombie & Fitch is excellent at coordinating and keeping all merchandises organized. My co worker's were easy going, sociable and very helpful. The hardest part may have been completing all task but with the assistance of my co workers and managers I was able to fix that and become a better person. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to converse with customers. They open my eyes to many things and it feels great to be an assistance to others."
good,"A typical day for me was opening the stock room, processing shipment, taking inventory and censoring clothes. I learned how to manage employees, how to deal with all kinds of customer service and how to work retail in different aspects. Management was fun and always worked with you  on projects. The hardest part was balancing a work and school life. After school I would be at work 6 hours a day or sometimes more after a full school day. I would have continued to work here if the store had not shut down."
good,"I am part of the overnight team and specialize in the stock department. My job is to ensure daily shipment is received, processed and back stocked in a timely and efficient manner. "

The managers are really nice and flexible when things come up. It's also pretty easy to get shifts covered or switch with people when need be.
good,the hours and pay were not very good but i enjoyed the work. I enjoyed interacting with people and i absolutely love the work environment the managers created for us.
good,This job was friendly. I learned how to properly fold clothes the way companies do. I learn certain ways that companies store their inventory. Team was amazing and helpful. Very friendly. Interaction with the customers.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was gaining better customer service skills and learning how to work as a team. However,  a far as training goes, I feel as if there could be some improvement as to making sure the brand reps are capable of doing majority of the tasks that need to be done."
good,"Good workplace culture, easy and flexible hours, company's mission is very clear. Workers and staff are friendly. Constantly updated on news, issues, etc."
good,"if you're and adult with a life/lifestyle. its not the best idea. bur for young adult just finding their way, starting out its great. not long hours and it allows for a young adult to have some money in their pocket and pay a bill or two.. give them a bit of finical freedom."

good,"My typical day at work is coming in and clocking in. Then I would go fold down clothes and make sure the front of the store is nice and clean. Then I would migrate towards the back of the store and the fitting rooms. I help customers find their best fit and help them with anything else we can provide. I often work as a cashier as well, and that is my favorite part. I like to stay busy at work so I always want something to do.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers, and the most enjoyable is being able to be yourself and use my communication skills."
good,"Un día cualquiera en el trabajo estaba compuesto de muchísimas tareas en muy poco tiempo. Era muy desafiante intentar acabarlas todas y a la vez controlar que los empleados estuviesen terminando las tareas delegadas. Esto me hizo aprender a priorizar y completar las tareas que más impacto tenían en el funcionamiento de la tienda y poder estar a la vez controlando el trabajo del equipo. La cultura laboral era lo que más me gustaba de Hollister. Te sentías como si estuvieses trabajando con tu familia y amigos porque te apoyaban y motivaban en cada momento y la vez sacando lo máximo de ti. Lo más dificil pienso que era preveer continuamente para que las ventas siempre estuviesen en su máximo potencial, sobre todo en Navidad o temporada alta de Verano. Por ejemplo, organización de horarios, control de stock, que la mercancía este bien presentada y con sentido, la tienda limpia, que los empleados terminen sus tareas, el marketing...etc. Continuamente, día tras día tienes que estar muy encima pero es muy gratificante porque luego ves los resultados."
good,"Handled store sales, organized stock, and interacted with customers. Managed a team of 5-10 people at a time, organized shipment, and interacted with customers."
good,"I loved working here, going to work was exciting as the people who worked here had a great vibe and were also very easy to along with. Many were all students ranging from 17-27. working on the floor was fun as the store is usually maintained pretty well, back stock was even more fun cause you're doing your own thing, task given down my the manager to reach the goals for the day."
good,"Best company I have worked with, you are able to gain a social life and good if you are going to school. the staff became a family to me. it was amazing"
good,"A typical day would include folding the clothes, putting away the inventory where the clothes belong in the store, ringing customers out at the register and making sure they know about any sales, and cleaning when it got slow. I also loved my managers and co workers, really nice and patient people. The hardest part of the job was working during the holidays when it was busy. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was organizing the clothes and helping costumers pick things out for their daughters or whoever. I also loved the atmosphere of the store, it was a good working environment."
good,"Everyone is open hearted and kind. You learn communication skills and you grow to be more open and expressive. Co-workers are like family, everyone always gets along. Hardest part a huge amount of customers at one time."
good,"A typical day at work would be folding and fixing clothes. I learned how to connect with people. My co-workers were helpful. The hardest part of this job was fixing women clothes, they were so clumsy and not foldable. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to listen to music in the back as I work."
good,"Working at this company meant  opening the tore and closing the store, which also meant cleaning all ares of the store. in addition, working here required to say their tag-lines when greeting customers. When hired here, there must be some experience with the cash register. Moreover, Abercrombie was my first job. What I learned here prepared me and my work habits. I learned to come on time, use the cash register, talk/help customers with apparel attire, and restock items that were bought, damaged or stolen. All my managers were really cool, although most managers either quit or transferred to different stores in the time frame of 4-6 months. I still have great relationships with my co workers today. The most challenging part about working here is maintaining a clean environment. This type of retail store is known for its organizational skills, so keeping everything organized is a challenge, considering most customers throw the clothes anywhere they want. The most enjoyable part of working at Abercrombie is talking to the customers. I learn so much about people when I am engaged in the conversation."
good,Fantastic work as there are very flexible hours with the focus groups and so on. Not enough work though and only in the holidays.
good,"une journée typique"
good,"Atypical day at work consisted of a lot of phone calling and emailing."
good,"A typical day at work is fun ,  i love going to work. I meet new people with different background , with different cultures.I have fun with my co-workers , its just a great environment."
good,"Sales representatives of Abercrombie and Fitch were responsible for promoting their passion for the brand by having strong product knowledge, appearing well groomed with professional poise and attitude, and upholding to the fashion standards set. Outgoing personality, strong interpersonal interaction skills and attention to detail helped to engage customers in a dialog, creating an environment that focused on their needs, promoting their value as loyal patrons and soliciting the sales of merchandise. A&F employees needed to have a strong work ethic, be flexible and adaptive to a constantly changing working environment; in a single shift an employee could be assigned to cashier, sales floor, marketing and stockroom. Additionally, A&F sales representatives were key components in loss prevention. Close attention to floor presentation and using proactive thinking to collaborate with team members helped us to protect the company’s assets and obtain minimal loss. In the case of a theft it was our duty to use clear and professional communication with suspects to recover store merchandise while not making accusations of a crime."
good,I work with a great team who are very knowledgeable and efficient at what they do. They have all trained me and helped me to become a much more well rounded agent.
good,"very productive "

good,Everyone at A&F is very welcoming and mostly attractive. Sometimes there are hectic days but not all the time. I learned to count on yourself to get the job done. I did not receive a yearly review or a raise which is the reason I quit. Very enjoyable workplace. Lunch is easy to get.
good,"- Always need to have a smile and great customer service. "
good,As my fist job AF prepared me for what to expect as I grew older.Most days we would fold many clothes or have top stand for hours as a greeter. I met MANY people who worked there. Since AF hires multiple people during interviews.
good,"For the three years I was employed by the company, I can say that it is the most fun job one could have. While expectations to perform were high, the environment was perfect for workers of all kinds to reach their maximum potential."
good,"Abercrombie & Fitch flagship was a fantastic work experience. A typical day consisted of providing outstanding customer service to ensure an unparalleled experience that will preserve a positive reputation for the company and benefit a steadfast international expansion. Management was friendly. Co-workers were enthusiastic and competitive in reaching sales goals. The most difficult part of the job was the earlier hours and holidays that are necessary in retail. The most enjoyable part was undoubtedly the customer and associate interaction. No need to be so serious. Laughs, smiles, and even a little dancing are encouraged by management and help maintain a fun environment."
good,"A typical work day included walking around the store to watch and greet customers, folding clothes and organizing tables, handling financial transactions. I learned how to use the cash register. The managers were all very friendly. All of my co-workers were nice. The hardest part of the job was folding clothes perfectly.

good,I have been with this company for almost 3 years and it has been nothing but a great experience. The company hires great managers that know how to work well with first time workers who have never had a job before. This is one job I have truly loved since the day I first started working there.
good,"I Loved working here while i was going back and fourth to school. The schedule and hours were flexible, and the management was so organized. The Company was so diverse that i met new people and did well learning new things"
good,"A typical day at work starts off with for  surveillance of the store customers and employee transactions. I was in search of possible dishonest employee, fraud transactions by dishonest shoppers or shoplifters. In between camera work I was responsible for store operational paper work which consists of one on one meetings with employees to discuss loss prevention initiatives and the business of the store. Before the day is over I would usually do awareness meetings with employees in my  L/P Alerts and operational compliance based on my audit results. I would finish with a one on one meeting with the store manager."
good,"Independent, neutral, calm, and friendly. Easy work pace environment."
good,Everyday at work at Abercrombie & Fitch is different from the previous one.
good,Although sometimes working hours are long it is easier to work in that state of environment. Working independently helps for more productivity for the company.
good,this was one of my 1st jobs... i loved it. my Managers were awesome and if you love Abercrombie & Fitch you would have noo problems working here. if i could go back i definitely would !
good,Abercrombie & Fitch was the best job ever. It is a great fun environment that you get to go to and get paid. All the employees are best friends like a second family. The management is amazing and does not treat you as if you're beneath them like other retail does. The co-workers are the best part. It is just all around a wonderful place to work.
good,Whenever it was time to work I was always ready to have a good time.
good,"Its a very fun place. The diversity of customers as well as staff are something that keeps me looking forward to work. Its nothing like ive ever experienced. I reccommend this job to fun loving people.,"
good,I loved working with the Y and if I could've kept that position and moved up by now I would've.
good,"The management is very understanding of college students schedules. They try to make it fun during closing hours by listening to music. Everyone there is very nice, but the store can get a little chaotic especially during holidays so patience is needed."
good,上班不用打卡，时间相对自由，公司文化积极向上，同事关系也很友好。有免费的咖啡有的时候还有小点心提供。
good,"The work environment was good and welcoming and the management team worked hard to achieve goals, I learned a lot of skills there and developed many friendships."
good,"Everyday there is something new to learn, it has a welcoming environment, and has some nice benefits. The company definitely allows you to grow. They're flexible with hours."
good,"Abercrombie was overall a great job experience, i got to work with customers on the daily, helping them find new outfits and taking them out of their comfort zone, or something they couldn’t find. I really enjoyed being able to help others try new things."
good,"Very low lights, loud music, models dancing, busy atmosphere, neat folded clothes, beautiful/ diverse employees, pay for your uniforms, group interviews."
good,Abercrombie works really well with me being a college a student and allows me to have a job when i return home from school. Very laid back environment for the most part
good,"A typical day can range anywhere from good to bad. Depending on who your working with in management , it can be very fun and productive when its slow in the store. When busy things start to get hetic and attitudes are formed from the customers where you have to learn to have patience/"
good,This was a very fun work place with lots of room for advancement if you have what it takes. The hours are scarce but work is always fun and you learn a lot about the real world.
good,"Working at Abercrombie is a a fun working environment that helps you talk and meet new people on a daily, and help increase your people handling skills every time you work."
good,"I loved working here. employees, district manager and manager were always on top of everything. The schedule is so flexible people are very friendly.."
good,Not a bad place to work. You have to be willing to work at a fast pace and you have to make your numbers and your attendance is amust also. It can get very hot in the building.  You have to work overtime during peak season. We start anytime from 5:00-7:00 and sometimes Saturday.
good,"cool place to work. lots of friendly and smart people. they do excellent with recruiting. there is talent from all over the world. very competitive, however."
good,"Quello che più mi è piaciuto di Abercrombie, oltre all'ambiente lavorativo, è stata la grande interazione di tutto il personale e la disponibilità dei capi reparto."
good,Time flies if you helped customers find something they liked. People like a helping hand because they don't always know what they're looking for. For me the constant folding of clothes was hard when i mostly enjoyed helping people finding the things they liked.
good,Worked for employer for several years and loved every minute of it. I loved the customers and the management team who were very supportive in all that I did.
good,"My experience with this company was positive it was a great starter job. Some cons were the lay and also the constant change of management, once we would get used to one manger they would leave and we would have to adjust to a whole new management team."
good,A typical day a work for me was absolutely great. I learned so much about the way the store was ran. The management team was great and the workplace culture was awesome. There wasn't a hard part about the job. The most enjoyable part was that everyone got along with each other.
good,It is a very interesting and growth developing franchise. You get opportunities of different responsibilities and develop your interpersonal skills. You get a chance to work with your customer service skills and improve the satisfaction of not only yourself but the customers as well. I recommend for someone looking to start their first job.
good,"I was a senior designer back in the days when the original CEO was still there and business was great. It was very fast pace and a lot of pressure to do ""what the expected"" was to be done and how it was suppose to be done. If you would do your work a different way or deviate from the Abercrombie way, often you'd be looked down on like you don't know what you are doing... Well, now we see who didn't know what they were doing as stocks plummet!"
good,"Awesome place to work, especially for a first job. Tons of college students there just trying to earn some extra money, and make it through school."
good,"Management was great with understanding environment. Being able to deal with customers who are not very friendly, as well as with customers who have impairments or do not speak clear english. Co-workers who have been there for a while are very helpful and work hard. I learned how to deal with very many different customers, give good customer service, relate more to the customer to better understand their likes and dislikes as well as knowing what they are looking for and for who. Most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and getting to know them and where they are from if they are out of the country. I enjoyed being able to communicate in a friendly environment."
good,"Greeted customers and determined their needs and wants"
good,The managers made their position clear but were also able to make sure that they related with us on a personal level. Everyone got along with each other. We all were able to work and have fun at the same time.
good,Manager-in-Training program offers upcoming individuals hands-on experience without requiring prior experience. The program offers a sweeping overview of many situations that managers face on a daily basis as well as many different tactics to handle the given situations diplomatically and genuinely.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of me mostly helping customers. I would walk in, clock in and report to my manager that I had arrived. But, before doing so I would briefly walk through the sales floor to see what the sales were for that day. In addition to that, there was a paper posted on the wall in the back room that listed the sales of that day last year, and the sales we were trying to reach this year. At the start of the shift, my manager would ask me questions about the sales; this had to be done every shift. "
good,"A typical day at work started with reading a bulletin review of the week. Then get my punch list of duty's,and begin completing assigned tasks.I learned to properly stock and display merchandise.It was a great working environment and I enjoyed interacting with my fellow employees,as well as the patrons.However the hours were very minimal,and I was a seasonal employee."
good,"- peaceful laid back environment "
good,"AS&G, once a small company, is on a rapid growth path.  They go beyond the normal standard to meet and exceed the needs their clients.  This dedication to client satisfaction has fostered a strong reputation in the TPA industry and recognition across the United States.  Despite AS&G's steady growth, they maintain an uncommon level of loyalty to their employees.  I am proud to list AS&G as my employer and to have been a member of their team."
good,"Start with Opening E-mails for all Latest updates of ANF Buyers on work culture."
good,"Your average day consisted of receiving tasks to build or take down display shelves and then re-stock them. You would almost always fold clothes, and fold them better than any other store you'll ever walk in. I learned how to steam clothes, receive shipments and stock them in the stock room, tag and discount items. The hardest part of the job is keeping in mind that it is a job and not a club. The most enjoyable part is all the time. The people and the atmosphere are very exciting, and the work is very simple."
good,"Abercrombie/Hollister was a surprisingly wonderful place to work. The only downside is for those who are not into the ""culture"" offered by the establishments. The management are often secluded to back room areas, so this is only really an issue if you are a part time salesperson. The pay was an exact trade for the amount and type of work you do. Often management would only work 5 days a week and there was never an issue with being short on employees. The coworkers were always fun to be around and genuine (though these stores may have been exceptions) and upper management was always on point. Morale was good. The hardest part of the job was keeping a small team of friends on task in a fast paced environment."
good,Cashier. Salesperson. Customer Service. Customer Care. Cleaning & Maintain the visual appeal of your store. Develop positive customer relationships.
good,This is a great place to work I have gained a lot of management experience.  The people are what make this company so great.  It is like coming to work with all your best friends every day.  Customer service is the most difficult part of the job it is impossible to please everyone.
good,"a tpical day at work is fun and laid back "
good,I really liked working here. I always thought that it was a good place and the people where great.
good,"Daily checkups on marketing material, from lighting, to merchandising. Co-workers were great, considering they are almost always your friend outside of work. The management team was great and did a great job ensuring everyone was happy with schedules and tasks. The hardest part of this job was the travel, and the constant challenge of recruiting quality management."
good,"Every night at Abercrombie was different. There was tons diversity in the type of employees they hired which made each shift awesome because you met someone new. The managers were always organized and helpful, I thought very highly of them. I learned how to manage my time wisely, when it was floor set time and the walk throughs were right around the corner you had no time to lose. The hardest part of the job was leaving, they are very flexible and my co-workers were a blessing. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to create my own schedule, that enabled me to go to school full time and work part time."
good,Loved this job every one was so fun and friendly. Management was grate.
good,"Started working here at 18 years old. Made great relationships with managers, and coworkers. They had a really good corporate structure and hired great people. They taught you a lot about the history of the brand and what a brand means to any organization. Great exposure to retail/sales."
good,I enjoyed my 9 years w/ A&F and the people I worked with.
good,I learned a lot in this temporary job was a very good experience with an excellent team.
good,"I Assisted customers with store purchases and item selections along with helping Display /greeting customers with samples of colognes,and other store promotions, Performed point-of-sale transactions and handled customer inquiries regarding pricing and purchases, Re-stocked shelves and ensured beautification of designated areas, Hardest part i would say was when the lines got really long and crazy I was stuck at cashwrap alone with out any aisstance, I believe the most enjoyable part would have been getting to know my co-workers and having fun while working and greeting the customers as the entered the store."
good,I enjoyed working for this company. It was a wonderful retail experience.
good,"when working there I've experienced a nice work environment with loving caring  people to work with."
good,"It was a good experience to work in this store, it is a nice place to start building your career. People is nice, and it gives you a lot time to have a balanced life."
good,Overall great company to work for. Store manager was accommodating. Fast paced.  Ever changing. Always busy. Great learning and work experience. Organized.
good,"Very fast paced store. Always a lot of movement but working with the other associates makes it fun. I learned a lot being there, like how to properly address a customer and help them find exactly what is is that they are looking for. I also learned a lot about shipment priority and marketing that is a huge part of the business."
good,"Everything was really straight forward, if you have a fun personality and enjoy interacting with people then it'll be a piece of cake. Most of the time, you're organizing the store and packing online orders."
good,management is great. the work place is very relaxed you meet amazing people who work here. everything is pretty easy here. A great place to start working at
good,Abercrombie was a great environment. The only drawback is that I got caught up in mass lay offs twice and it no longer made me feel secure so I had to seek other employment.
good,"It's a great place to work at if you are a young adult or student trying to work part-time even full time. It's really good pay for what the job is, super flexible hours, and relaxed nice management who is super supportive when need be. The only problem would be trying to get more hours as they typically over hire and have employees usually scheduled for only two or three shifts which are only four hours long."
good,"Hours aren't' terrible, there is an hour open and close, great opportunity to move up in chain of management, but you have to have a degree for assistant manager"
good,Friendly and social environment drives the skills to better perform store duties at an optimal level. Promotions and a sense of good fashion had been learned in their perspective to benifit my career ambitions.
good,"I am happy that I waa workin with Abercrombie and fitch since 2016 and I enjoyed,  relaxed workin with them but unfortunately there are no enough hours per week every thing else was perfect"
good,A&F is a great place to work at. I worked as a brand representative/sales associate. Everyone was very friendly and close. Managers were the perfect balance between maintaining store presentation/customer service and making sure people enjoyed their job. Managers were always willing to work with you on availability/scheduling.
good,"La empresa Americana de tienda Retail mejor conocida como AnF.Es el lugar, donde muchos adolescentes y jovenes adultos consiguen sus primero empleos. La diversidad cultural en un país como Canadá se ve reflejada de manera impresionante. "
good,"You don't apply to work here, they hire you based on how they think you will be as a worker in the store so you must be somewhat charismatic for a manager to approach you at random. It is extremely competitive and Woodfield is one of the largest malls in the World."
good,"Was a great place to work as the company grew from a few Abercrombie & Fitch stores through the development of the Brands of  Hollister, Gilly Hicks & Ruehl."
good,"I loved working at Abercrombie and got along with everyone, however there is definitely favoritism within the company and you have zero work/life balance."
good,once you go in you clock in. then its go time! you will never have a dull moment! every moment is awesome! if you're having a bad day i promise it will change! the managers are always willing to help you wither you're having a bad day or if you're having trouble with the register. you learn how to sell and even back stock in numerical order. the best part of the job are your friends you work with! awesome co-works that work with you!
good,It's rare to get cross trained depending on which location you're at and what experience you've had with retail in general. Depending on how much of a fast learner you are genuinely depends on how fast you move up in the company which is difficult to do. Sometimes you are tasked to do things that managers are supposed to do. Some managers will help teach you whatever they can and others will just leave you to learn somehow on your own. It's highly suggested you pick up a second job as you start out with 8 hours a week until you can prove that you can earn more hours.
good,I love the environment that Abercrombie and Fitch shapes. They provide great work ethic and for me personally I thank my manager for creating my outlook on workforce. It was a great introductory job.
good,Ambiente familiare e forte presenza di spirito di squadra .
good,"Learned about how to keep a customer happy, cater to customer to help them find the best fit for what they are looking for. Got to work with great people in a great, clean, fun work place."
good,"Everyone is valued at this company. The work culture is fun, social and collaborative. There is a strong connection between the brand and feel of the home office."
good,"I loved this job. Being my first job it was a little scary at first, but the coworkers and managers were nice and supportive, while offering great constructive criticism on my work performance. The work was easy and simple but the bright environment and fun coworkers made the work engaging. Helping customers was great and helped me learn a lot. All and all, great place to work, would still be working there for sure if I didn't go to college."
good,"A typical day would include coming in to work and clocking in. Next I would meet with the manager on duty and ask them what it is that they need to get done in the store, or if the store was not very busy I would start folding clothes and making the store look more presentable. I would adhere to any customer needs and provide a one-on-one shopping experience for them. I really enjoyed the management because they were very respectable and knew that they would only need to ask for something once and it would get done. I learned that I must always put the customer first, no matter how busy the store gets; while it is important for the store to look nice, the customers' needs should always be the first priority for me. The hardest part of the job was handling too many customers at a time, but the most enjoyable part of the job is seeing a customer's face light up when you help them out. This includes helping them find an article of clothing they've been looking for, or simply providing a very happy and positive experience that they hope to come back."
good,me encato trabajar aquí recomiendo este empleo para principiantes que buscan obtener experiencia.
good,英語を活かしたり、マネージメントを学びたい人にはオススメの仕事です。仕事環境や職場の雰囲気がとても良く、働いている人の質が凄く高いです。外資系なので趣味や副業等が出来るところも魅力的です。
good,I liked working at abercrombie it was a good place to work very relaxed and my coworkers where pretty cool. I was cashier here and also i worked the backroom stacking boxes
good,Working here has put me around a different type of cultural group. A typical day at work exposed me to different races who shopped at the store. The hardest part of the job was when a customer would try to steal.
good,The store itself was awesome. I have always loved their clothes so to work there was exciting. Work was fairly easy until the holiday season came around.
good,"Starting out in your journey of life, this is great company to work for. It helps with team building within a work environment. Its steady and if you're willing, the chance to work overtime was always available."
good,"Great company to start building retail experience with. I worked with them for about a year and it was great they were so flexible with hours and as a 16 year old getting paid 9$ an hour (in PC, UT) was great!"
good,"Meeting with staff to go over store checklist, fold and maintain store appearance, work cash registers if needed.Learned time management and interpersonal communication skills."
good,"Abercrombie is a great first job, awesome individuals and a productive work environment. The only cons would be the compensation which is minimum wage, and the possibility of advancement which is contingent of the receival of a four year degree."
good,my first full time job. I enjoyed it and had great managers. 10/10 would do it again. Benefits offered and opportunities to move to cities where they need staff
good,"Great job to start out with.. however they are very picky about the way you look. It was a fun environment to work in, pay isn't great, usually just minimum wage"
good,"  December 2014 to June 2015 "
good,I enjoyed the friendly staff and the upbeat environment. Though I was only there a short time I really enjoyed getting to work in a customer service retail business. I learned a lot about retail.
good,"I worked extremely long hours working for A&F as a manager then. Many days, many overnights, many floor sets, I did three store openings for A&F during my time there. I met the president of the company on numerous occasions and did many floor walk throughs with him."
good,"I enjoyed everyone I worked with and got to meet, it was a great stepping stone to opening up and developing my skills set. Taught me a lot about what kind of manager I would want to be"
good,"It was fun working as a sales associate, no one judges.. easy and stable part time job. Taught me how to fold my laundry better."
good,I would tell anyone that Abercrombie is a great place to work. The only reason why I'm looking is because I need a 40 hour a week job and working at Abercrombie we are only required to work with what the business has. So we have busy times and we have slow times. I need a job that has 40 hours every week.
good,The hardest part of the day is making sure to keep ourselves busy while the store has died down with no customers. we usually would refold a table and make sure the floors had no trash and dusted a bit. and when customers came in we made sure to welcome them
good,The atmosphere is a positive and entertaining place. There are many opportunities and company events that are fun and entertaining.
good,"A typical shift is spent making merchandise available as by unpacking clothes from newly arrived boxes of shipment or by pulling them from the stockroom shelves. I learned the inventorying and loss prevention strategies of my position by stocking merchandise according to the SKU system ( comparable to the dewey decimal system for books in a library).  While I did not hold a management position there were times I had to assume management responsibilities in the absence of a manager as b training new hires while manager is on a conference call.  My co-workers are serious, socially responsible, and reliable.  The hardest part of the job is to challenge yourself to get even better at your job and to never give up on trying.  I loved making the clothes available to our customers."
good,"A day at work , would be to attend customers by helping them find what they are looking for. I have to promote the store promotion to receive more sales, as well as advertising clothing. There are many tourists so its very important to be diverse with other to communicate. Working with other employees has been good . Its a good environment , the only hardest part of the job, is when it gets busy. Busy Is great , because it set a challenge for us and improve those who need to work well with communication issues."
good,"My position is great because you get to manage the stuff in the back stock rooms. However, it gets a little old, and the hours are very demanding and detrimental to one's life because you'll work until closing every night. It leaves little room for relationships, which in turn effects work performance. Decent pay, but alienation of worker."
good,"Abercrombe & Fitch es una empresa muy flexible. Te permitía hacer horas semanales que necesitabas hasta un máximo de 40h combinando horario de apertura, horario de medio día y de cierre. Cada año te subía el sueldo y había muy bien ambiente en el trabajo. Los superiores eran personas muy cercanas y siempre estaban pendientes del buen funcionamiento del departamento."
good,"Typical work day would start with a team meeting and breakdown of what team members would have to do during their shifts.I would go through my zone, adjust lighting, correct any display errors. Thirty minutes before the store opens the entire front end staff had a meeting to discuss ways to be more productive and store sales goals. When the store opened i had to greet guests, maintain the sales floor by keeping the clothing displays presentable. Interactions with customers involved listening to their needs, wants, getting items they wanted, and making sales pitches."
good,"great job to have , fun experience and always a wonderful time going into work, always opportunity to move up in the company , great management and work enviorment"
good,"Worked with nice and active people.....getting the day job done by load and parking containers for shipment..Co-workers are smart, we all work as a team and try to build a happy conducive environment"
good,"Pick orders for customers that order online "
good,"The environment was very diverse, you learned something new everyday. Managers and associates are very respectful, although you get hours based on your performance at work. Teaches you customer service skills which you must need to work at Abercrombie & Fitch Co. or at any retail job."
good,"A typical day consists of cleaning and interacting with customers on the sales floor, as well as processing shipment. The management and co-workers make my job an enjoyable experience. This job taught me the ins and outs of retail, teaching me what was required on the sales floor as well and in the stock room."
good,"I absolutely loved my managers and employees. If we made sure that the work was done on our part they would let us hang loose. It was a great first job, because it gave me a good foundation for everything else."
good,"If you're looking for a job with flexible hours, this is the place for you! Its a great first job! You're typically working with younger people and having to learn how to talk with foreigners who are on vacations. You also will learn how to board fold and keep company standard to the max. The management is really nice and very relaxed. The coworkers are also pretty nice. The hardest part of this job is keeping up with standard, it is a challenge but after a while you nail it every time. I enjoy everything about this job!"
good,The company was a very good place to work. It was fun working with a diverse group of people. It was a great work environment.
good,Great place to work however I am currently part time and I'm looking for full time
good,"I've worked for the company since May 2007 starting out at Hollister Co. The culture that Abercrombie and Fitch, the parent company values shows a great deal why those who are looking for work experience as well as working in a stress free environment makes this place a good starter place to work at when you are still in school. I still work there because I enjoy the people who I work with. It's not my full time job, the discounts are nice, job advancement is fair to good. If you have a college degree you can get into their management program. I elected not to because I wanted to explore other options out in the business world."
good,Sit and stand there in the front and greeted customers. Possibly the easiest job you can get.
good,MIT program is awesome for recent grads. You learn a variety of knowledge that can definitely help you in many different ways. Job sets you up for future success. Well recognized company.
good,"Love the team work and management, Really fun environment but wished the pay was higher. I received a lot of hours so definitely no complaints at all."
good,"Sales rep and cashier. "
good,"Good company to work for, easy to balance life , school and work. Compensation was good , the shift schedule for 1st shift and weekend shift was a good thing."
good,Abercrombie and Fitch is a sister company with Hollister.
good,"Working for this company was a great experience. Everyday I got to meet and help people of all races and backgrounds. I learned to adjust to the needs of customers and work in an retail enviroment. Management was very friendly and helpful as well as the co-workers. There was really no hard parts for working for this company. However, the most enjoyable part of the job was helping and interacting with fun people."
good,"i most enjoyed the job during holidays because we would work so hard that we didn't have time to do anything else then by the time you knew it , it was time to go home for the night."
good,"A typical day at abercomebie would include folding and steaming cloths running the register, doing inventory and back-stocking. As this was my first job I learned what it was like to work for my own money and learn responsibility. Management was always friendly to me and the rest of the employees they treated us more as equals and did not at like they were controlling us which I thought to be very kind. My co-workers and I always worked well together setting up rooms and folding cloths for opening and closing. The hardest part of working at abercombie was when I was scheduled as the greeter where you stood by the door your shift and only greeted people as they walked in. The most enjoyable part was the overnight sessions around hristmas where we changed the entire floor set."
good,Opening Closing store
good,I cleaned in the mornings & i had to straighten the store & greet customers with a friendly attitude. Did registers & helped customers when needed.
good,"Get to the store before it opened around 7 am, start redlining on all clearance items, fold back stock items and put them in the bays that they went in, around that time it would be time for my shift to end. I have learned never try to work more than one job, never take on more than you can handle it will only result in bad. The managers there were cool the only problem was the way they gave me the runaround about lying and saying that I could get back on the schedule when the whole time I was let go and no one had the guts to tell me. The co-workers there were great we acted like a close family. The hardest part of the job was some of the clothes were hard to put on the manikins. Most enjoyable part of the job was the environment I loved working fr this company!"
good,My most enjoyable moments at work at all of my previous job was assisting the customers. I love to help people and make people happy. Satisfied customers makes me feel like I made a big accomplishment.
good,"Time went by fast at work, I learned that working with others takes alot of patients and communication. The management was vary good and working with other employees came very easy. The hardest part of the job was maintaining and organizing the store, the most enjoyable part of of the job was talking and helping/assisting employees and custumers"
good,"Abercrombie; always had new clothes, new chores to arrange the store."
good,Great Experience working with people from overseas. It was an advantage for me being bilingual.
good,"Abercrobie and Fitch is really a fun and friendly place to work. They do not discriminate and race, colors, or religion."
good,"You need to learn store promotions. Greet customers, fold tables and keep the store clean. You will need to learn how to use registers and apply discounts to customers."
good,The management team and my coworkers here were always easy and fun to work with. I started not knowing a thing about retail but after only a couple weeks I was well trained to do a variety of different things such as maintaining the stock room and working the registers well.
good,"I've been working here for almost a year, it's a good job for starters,  I think but I don't see myself staying for so long. Very nice and understandable managers, everyone understands that situations happen where you may not be able to come in."
good,"Loved working here, co workers and staff, as well as manners were all so welcoming . Would definitely recommend to other to work here  I would definitely go back in the near future"

I have also learned how to manage my school hours and work hours here. I also have learned how to work and bond with my coworkers and help one another out. workplace culture is pretty good. Their isn't areas that are hard due to the fact that everyone helped each other. Everything there was enjoyable and pretty fun.
good,The people who worked there always kept everyone up with their high energy and kept us motivated to work hard and reach the goal that was need ed to be met at the end of the day
good,Flexible hours with a friendly environment with a passion to succeed. Manager and coworkers are respected and encouraged to work their hardest to improve sales and customer satisfaction.
good,It was a great experience i had great coworkers and we got discounts on apparel plus my boss was very understanding of everybody scheduling and was able to work with everybody.

This, unfortunately, is very impacting on the overall team status, especially during holiday seasons. The end expectations are, however, clear and the relationships that are built on the sales floor are important to having a successful career at A&F. In regards to an outside live from the company, though demanding, their values are consistent with family/work balance and taking time for oneself is important. The benefits for full-time are great, and the support for part-time staff is awesome. And as far as the company re-branding is concerned, the company is going in a very positive direction."

The building and grounds are beautiful and the campus setting is very conducive to collaboration and creativity. The caliber of talent is literally the best in Columbus. Ivy League grads, internationally trained designers, and associates from the top business schools make up a good part of the population.

Not that out of the ordinary to put in some long hours...but you are rewarded for it."

After that the manager will assign us to either work on the men/women side of the store, assign us to work in the fitting room , or help people at the cash register.

good,"Getting everything ready on time and follow protocol."
good,"Start off by getting to work a few minutes early, to get a better idea of what I will be doing for the rest of the day before I clock in. Through out the day keep an eye on the last project I worked on that same day because customers want to find easy ways to steal even if that means asking a lot of questions to distract employees or follow employees around the store. Work at a steady pace. Do not hesitate to say something to a customer whether it be because they are stealing or making a sale. Stay on top of the upkeep of the store. Clear fitting rooms and organize displays. I learned more on systematic work meaning I learned how to make changes to the store based off of what managers had planned on changing by using charts and guides through out every day. Co workers were always just as comfortable talking with me just as I was with them and the same with managers. Hardest part of the job was the time crunches. For example having to change displays within a few minutes, no problem because I came to like the job more and more. The most enjoyable part of the job was always the mornings. Peaceful."

good,"Deciding to work at Abercrombie and Fitch was one of the best decisions I made coming straight out of high school. Usually at Abercrombie they tend to hire a lot of people but only hand out of few hours a week. I remember at my interview my manager telling me that A&F would be a great 'second job' but at the time I wasn't able to have two jobs. I remember coming in to work my first day and I remember saying to myself early that morning ""I'm going to work so hard that they wont have a choice but to basically give me full time hours, I'm going to be the best model!"" I kept my word and my managers loved me, before i knew it I was getting 38-40 hours a week. I loved it, I really did and the best part about working for Abercrombie was having such a down to earth manager, My manager was so supportive, so kind and so encouraging. She made me feel like my work was being appreciated. I admired that. I learned so many skills working at A&F. I learned how to manage the cashier, how to maintain the stockroom, how to do marketing, forms, tasks, fashion, and etc. The hardest part about working at A&F would be maintaining the floor while customers are shopping, It tends to get really messy and Abercrombie is really big on their standard board folding and keeping the floor perfect."
good,I worked inside Lehigh Valley Mall doing retail for Abercrombie And Fitch. I also cleaned the shop when i get the chance.
good,I was a model at Abercrombie and Fitch and my basic job duties were just greeting customers and folding clothes! Great part of the day was working with tons of energetic people and being able to be enjoy a great time at work.

A typical day managing at A&F would consist of managing store hours in the morning and throughout the day; calling in Sales Associates if the store is under hours and cutting hours if over. Managing for this company requires superior work ethic and motivational skills. The most difficult part working at A&F was making innovative decisions when your store was over hours but you only had 2 associate's closing a very large store. Do I call in more associates to close the store or do I keep the individuals that are already here longer? It was a decision that wouldn't always be the same but the store had to be cleaned before the morning crew came in. The most enjoyable part about working at A&F was being able to see the customers leave with smile on their faces. A&F is a very diverse company that welcomes everyone.
