rating,review
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,Co-workers are very rude and lazy. Managers are always locked up in the office doing nothing and get mad if we go to them for help. Lots if unappreciated favoritism!
bad,Management sucks co workers don't appreciate each other management belittles you if you make a mistake I got yelled at for being 2 minutes late one day
bad,I strongly recommend that you don't even give this place a thought skip over this and run! Don't even think about applying here they treat their employees like absolute garbage they could care less about you they view you as a way to get money not as a way of a person because they don't see you as a person they see you as a machine so whatever you do do not apply here!
bad,"If you want to be treated less than human work for Panera bread! Management had 3 different ways of doing things, and you were blamed for getting it wrong. None of the managers are on the same page!"
bad,I do not recommend working at Panera. There is no quality of life and managers are only used as labor. There is no help or direction given by upper level managers
bad,"Sucks, managers a child and employees are jerks ,  ten cent raises and they kick you out the door as to not get any extra time in ,even if you are not done with what you were doing . Racial divisions ."
bad,I hate working for that Panera. It has been one of the WORST experiences of my life. I wish I had NEVER started working there. The managers are liars! I have been off of the schedule since December. I was working there to help pay for school and they knew that. I kept asking for more hours and even adjusted my availability TWICE so that they could schedule me. I see why they have a high turnover rate. I absolutely hate that place.
bad,"I had a limited availability when I applied for the job and the managers knew this. I was never treated like an employee. I usually stayed past curfew , I am a minor, to clean up the store and I was not allowed to leave until a manager came and checked if the area was clean or not. I was usually scheduled to work during school which I could not make my shifts and had to get someone to cover my shifts. I never got a name tag or a temporary name tag. I was eventually let go because of my scheduling conflicts."
bad,"If you value your life in all aspects don't work here."
bad,"If there were zero stars available to choose to rate them... that's what they would receive from me.  It is the closest thing to slave labor to which I have ever been exposed.  I would be forced to work 10-12 hour days with barely time to go to the bathroom, eat, or even get a drink of water.  Breaks were few, if ever.  I could not leave until the work for the day was finished... usually starting at 3-4am until 1-3pm. Constant bigotry, favoritism, and racial discrimination allowed at All levels of employee interaction, including management. Employees are allowed to get high and come into work high every day!!  Gratitude was Never expressed, only berating if a mistake was made."
bad,"Panera is constantly trying to save as much money as possible. They will cut your hours and expect you to do the same amount of work in lesser time. "
bad,"I learned that no matter how hard you try, and how hard you work, you will never be appreciated. The managers have there favorites and if your not one dont expect any special treatment. Just know when you are a favorite you get away with murder, and drinking on the job. There is so much drama, everyone talks about everyone. Your suppose to get regular raises and you do but the favorites get the most money ."
bad,"Everything was great for the first month or so, but it didnt last very long. Management was so nit picky and demeaning. Constantly put in a situation with last minute catering orders that would sometimes make bakes go on for 10 or 11 hours. Regardless of the situation you were never given any help with your bake. . Little to no breaks throughout the night, you were lucky if you could sit down for 10 minutes while things were in the oven without fear of not being finished in time."
bad,"Panera Bread was my first job and it was relatively unpleasant. There's a lot of problems with management. They hired a 19-year-old to be a manager, the current general manager of the store has been accused of s*xual misconduct several times, and no legal action or firing has taken place. Please avoid working at this location if you can, especially if you're a young woman."
bad,Worst job I have ever had in my life!  And I was a manager.  Completely unorganized.   The area director must  suck dick to keep his job because he hasn’t a clue how to do it.
bad,"I had spent 5 years of my life with this company. Within those 5 years they wrongfully terminated me twice. Once during a LOA from a nearly fatal car accident I was the recipient of in which I needed 6 months rehab. Yes I did all the paperwork, was approved and then found out later when I went back to work they had fired me. Got the job back. I had been moved to 3 different stores in which drama surrounded me like a black cocoon that upper management refused to free me of. I became trainer after 4 years, finally. Only needed one signature from an Asst. Manager to become a superviser, but she told me no because she simply didn't like me. I transferred to my final store in which the open door policy told everyone my private reported incidences to HR over the years. I was physically assaulted and became unemployed for 7 months."
bad,Poor training practice.horrible  manage ment..Unfair work practice and very prejudice. Always set up to fail...I called employment services when the problems start happening called three different times and the never ever ever even call back courtesy call.
bad,It was okay just the management was trash but the experience was good for a first job. Food is good and the discounts we received was good just does not give you enough hours.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,I worked there for four years I was happy for a bit but they do not value their employees. They accused me of vandalism and fired me with no proof. Later they fired several other great employees for the same reason and none of us were guilty. They do not value their workers and you are expendable to thdm.
bad,Panera is underpaying employees but yet overworking them. They do not respect anyone's personal life nor are they humane &' ethical to anyone's situation which may affect ones job performance.
bad,While working at Panera there's been many ups and downs but I overall enjoyed the experience and time I had. My coworkers were pretty cool and my managers were very understanding.
bad,Unorganized expired food under payed terrible hours to much for so little pay they expect so much out of you will never ever recommended anybody to work there they like to hire minors  it's not a place for a person that's has responsibilities it's a job for teenager
bad,"While working for Panera Bread I met tons of great friendly people! On the other hand the management was another story. Harrassment, disrespect, belittlement. Unfair. Raises were always promised but were never given. In my 2 and a half years i should have made a total of $1.00 raise. But i was only given .10 cents."
bad,The managers didn’t care about anything but you getting to work and even if I was scheduled 5 to 2 they would make me clock out at 1 and I paid for my own ubers to get to work every morning because they switched me to bakery opener which you have to be there for 5 in the morning and I needed the job so I did it until I found something way better they didn’t care about your needs or anything to do with employees horrible !
bad,They are the worst company to work for ever in life they are just the worst the managers are bad they go on a lot of smoke breaks not managed very well at all!!!
bad,I feel threatened everytime that I come to work. Unfriendly work environment.  Unfair judgement on employees. Unclean work environment. Corpret should seriously evaluate there mngt staffing.
bad,"No one is happy. Negative environment. Apparently you motivate and lead employees by treating them poorly. Only job I have ever not given notice, in 30 years in the workforce!"
bad,I have worked with this company over 3 years and they run you into the ground and don't pay you enough I have nothing to show for all my time being there
bad,Management was messy they all was not professional it was a great environment up until the management changed I would only recommend this job for someone that is in high school
bad,"The job I hold as Team Trainer is a empty ,place holder,position designed to “encourage” me to continue my tireless work for an unappreciative company, for which I am paid barely 2/3 of other employees in the same position in different occupations. The average pay for an associate trainer at a competing place of business is on average $1.50 higher than that of what Panera is paying"
bad,"The time that I worked there I witness the Managers Harass Hispanics and Blacks. People quit a lot because of the same reason. They play with your hours and money. If they are in a bad mood they will yell at you call you names. I really don't know how this Managers still have their jobs. ""They are bullies""."
bad,Panera bread was not a employee friendly company Management will allow the customers to be rude to the employees disrespectful Also as an employee I was threatened by customers on a couple of occasions  and management did nothing about it
bad,"Very bad company to work for, just isnt supportive over anything you do. Need a flexible schedule? Forget it. They will work you raw even if you have school."
bad,Mucho favoritismo  te piden ser parte de la solución y no del problema les das soluciones  y te lo toman a mal por eso me corrieron
bad,"Wow this company is very messed up from district on down,  District mgr in ann arbor cant even spell or use computer.  General Manager is a liar and covers up horrible management situations...racism,...hostile work environment, retaliation, lies what a mess..  I promise the customer is the last in line as far as importance.  Just get the money"
bad,If your looking for an opportunity to improve yourself and if you need to pay bills stay as far away as possible from panera not only do they give you at most 5 hours a week but they also post the schedule the week of the schedule so it's impossible to work another job so I just told the manager I quit through text to save gas because I didn't make enough to fill my tank per week.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"i was with Panera almost 2 yrs then when i push myself to get my job done and it tweeks my knee up and have to call out i get in trouble for it or the fact that i have seen a baker throw a baking sheet full of bagels and still have a job, or a baker who can stick baking racks in the bathrooms and Cuss out the G.M at the store and still have a job... i busted my butt doing my job and i get thrown out like im trash. i dont know how many times my boss asked me on my days of to come cover anothers bakers shift because they called out. this company i feel as if the boss i was working under is a sexist boss only 4 female bakers out of 20+ of us. and the male baker get away with things that arent right but i had a real reason to call out but yet i get fired this company isnt the greatest to work for."
bad,They fired me for no reason without saying anything to me about it. Was let go didn’t receive a phone call on when to come back in or time with me being a new hire. Totally unprofessional.
bad,"The management team was very toxic and rude to the staff. Very underpaid and very understaffed, working here  was a nightmare. I, personally, would not recommend working here."
bad,"It wasn't the job for me, I dont handle having management yell at me over the smallest mistakes well and even if you initially are told that they'll work around your school schedule the moment it inconveniences them they get upset"
bad,"There is alot of favoritism. The employees that have been there forever are very RUDE TO NEW COMERS, there is no organization and no one communicates with anyone so its always a mess when it comes to the business and hours and etc."
bad,At this facility no one supports the other and people are petty and never get fired or written up for what they should be. People could be eating and touching food with their hands and serve it to customers (which happens) and still not get written up or fired.
bad,"Terrible pay, rude coworkers that don't treat you right. They think it's ok to start a fully qualified woman who's been a manager at 10 an hour... Then hire others for 11 for no reason at all other than they needed people badly this time around. Made me infuriated!"
bad,The management is horrible. Customers can be extremely rude. The associates learn off of other associates they don’t even have actual training. The general manager just yells at customers. They are ALL rude. For the amount of not good things associates put up with is not equaling their paycheck.
bad,"No promotion, no raise. No compensation for gas for traveling to different stores. Not too nice store managers and crew. Too much workload for a baker working alone."
bad,Needs work ! Job has potential but it seems like you work super hard for nothing. Great training program but pay is low . Company treats you like a number.
bad,"Don’t get brakes "
bad,"The main reason why I quit was because of customers, people were so rude sometimes I would get yelled at for no reason. Its very sad that most customers treat people behind the counter like they're worthless."
bad,"Started working there and management was great. I enjoyed my time there and even though it was fast paced felt like I could really accomplish a lot and move forward. When new managent took over it became stressful, uncommunicative, and unorganised. It was a constant struggle to pull things together as there was no team mentality. Management liked to push responsibility on associates instead of holding themselves accountable or responsible for their own positions. Will never even consider going back."
bad,"One manager says one thing, a different manager says another. Things are crazy inconsistent and panera bread as a whole treats people awfully.  I have worked here. And know several people that have worked there and they all have been treated horribly more then once. Raises are hardly a thing. And when they are it's probably only about 10 cents. I had a manager pick favorites.  If you werent a favorite, you couldnt get away with anything. But if you were a favorite you could do anything"
bad,"Panera bread has the worst management,  they let snobby, jealous and over all hateful people become managers. two of the shift leads ( women ) harass other girls that they feel jealous of and the general manager does not do anything about it. he only cares about his bonus and not about anything else going on in the restaurant. the assistant manager is probably the worst of them all, she engages with the other’s managers to talk about employees and tells them to do things that are out right outrageous . i wouldn’t send my dog to work there with that mess."
bad,"Overworked, underpaid, disciplined for getting scheduled overtime, weak benefits, and high stress. Originally, the company was okay to work for, but over time things began to degrade more and more to the point where everything is about profit and hardly the customer (let alone the employees)."
bad,They treat you horrible. No teamwork and alot of lazy employee. I wouldn't go back and wouldn't be able to recommend this job to anyone. Look for something else. They work you a 3 hour shift and think you should be greatful for that. I have bills. 3 hours won't pay them
bad,"Overall my experience at Panera was not a good one. I was hired on as a production line worker, my responsibilities were supposed to include, setting up/breaking down the line, and making food (sandwiches and salads) for customers. After around a month or so my job title changed without any discussion at all. I was made the closing dishwasher for every shift that i worked. I was kept till midnight as a minor and wasn't offered a way out of doing dishes. The hardest part of the job was we were always running out of things, because management was poorly run and didn't execute on the issues they needed to."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,Worst job I could’ve ever gotten. They aren’t flexible with your availability and general managers aren’t organized at all. Too much work not enough money
bad,"I worked With this company for years. I was trained on everything possible but being a manager. I get considered for the job only to get turned down by someone with no vehicle and only knows line. The employees don’t get trained properly and if you’re someone that actually goes to work to do their job, good luck because they’ll just make you do everything so they won’t have to do anything."
bad,"After I asked for a day off due to a family tragedy, the manager never scheduled me a day after that Friday I had taken off. Scheduling is quite a issue."
bad,When I was hired I was told that Panera was a family and not just a job. When I had to miss 3 shifts due to my mother in law having a heart attack and having to have heart surgery. I notified my manager around 9am the day of my 1st shift when I was not scheduled until 3pm that day. I was fired the next day. So much for beong a family and beong understanding.
bad,"So at first it wasn't bad working for Panera, the employees were super nice and the pace was fast and fun. Nothing was really that hard to learn except for the money handling and the weird computer systems they had. It was like they put in a lot of unnecessary things that just took up more time than needed. The work and home balance for a manager really wasn't there, basically they owned you and if they wanted to move you to a different location, they could. You weren't assured of anything. I didn't like working for them as a manager, would've loved working there as a teen though."
bad,Amazing at first then they were bought out and the new owners were very cheap with merchandise and our raises. Me personally I just liked the hot press sandwiches
bad,"The work/life balance was nearly non existent, due to the fact that Assistant Managers and Shift Supervisors carry no responsibilities and there is NO help from District Management because they are spread way too thin in each market to make an impact. As a store General Manager you can expect to work endlessly - over 60 to 70 hours per week - 13 to 15 hour days - to compensate for lack of quality staffing and the level of responsibility required to maintain a cafe. The bonuses are nearly unattainable, as they are based on criteria that are mostly out of your control. Bottom line - the atmosphere is toxic and the money is not worth the stress and level of responsibility."
bad,Manager will hire new people at a higher pay than an employee who has been there almost two years. If you have a life change or something comes up and you bring it to management they'll just fire you instead of working with you. The GM has a bad anger problem and snaps at all of his employees. He is very unprofessional and rude. Comes in with a bad attitude every day.
bad,They hire teenagers who refuse to work and they misuse the work ethics of people who cared. They chose who and when to enforce policies. They cut hours and leave you alone. Just not a good place to work
bad,Panera Bread in Hampton Bays was the first job i ever had . They were very unprofessional and  I was only working one day out of the week. The manager was very nasty at times because I didn’t know how to work some of the machines.
bad,"Was a very poor place to work for various reasons. Management, pay, hours, benefits(none). Co-workers treated you like you were below them. Especially managers and supervisors."
bad,Through my time at panera i have seen a lot of ups and downs but when it comes down to it the qork isn't worth the money and the managment is set against you from the beggining. No room for oppurtunity.. as well as many workers get shorted on their checks and some people not seeing their checks for months(myself included)
bad,it sucked so bad they didn’t even my medical bills i wish i could take back the time i worked there i wasted so much time there they pay low and don’t care about you at all 0/10 do not work there
bad,This was my 1st job and they had very incomplete choppy training then expected me to close along after watching someone close once before. They are very inflexible with their schedule they expect that life doesn't get in the way of anything as one day I had to be 40 minutes late after a family issue and I was later berated about how my manager had to bribe someone to work this extra 40 minutes and she would bring it up every time she could.
bad,If you are a teenager or a college student then this place is great. If you’re in your 30s or 40s then you’ll be treated like the younger employees. I for one do not like being treated like a child at my age so I left the job.
bad,"Over Worked on top of being a full-time student. Rude & Highly disliked scheduling days off. Don’t care about your responsibilities, schooling, health"
bad,"Okay this job is an absolute disaster!!! My 2nd day of working there I was put on dishwasher duty, I have never done restaurant dishes before so I dont know the mechanics behind operating it.. So when I was sent to do dishes I thought my trainer or someone was going to instruct me on how to use it and where dishes went... NOPE... completely by myself not knowing what to do.. And all the meanwhile being rushed by the incompetent manager!! Wirst job I have ever had in my entire life!! Please avoid working here"
bad,"Management is horrible the cafe is dirty and supervisors are minors, they dont rotate product and the bakery is not fresh. The employee are under paid for they work they want done. The drivers that cater dont have the proper insurance and the all the cafe are under staffed."
bad,"This job is terrible, poor management and even worst hours. Even if you're not promote to trainer they ask you to train new members anyway. Management comes in and out. One of my managers constantly hit on the younger cashier's who were sometimes still in highschool."
bad,"Panera is a privately owned company and it shows. They will work you to the bone and ask why 10 other things weren’t completed. it’s a horror show, if you don’t like suffering on an everyday basis when you go into work then I wouldn’t recommend it."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"only good thing about working there was the other employees. other than that the managers are terrible at their job, nobody knows what's going on half the time. did i mention the managers basically do nothing and throw fits if something goes wrong. meanwhile all the employees handled it fairly well"
bad,Once you're hired you will be put on dish for months before you're moved up to better positions. The management doesn't take into account family emergencies and are unable to schedule people fairly.
bad,Management is terrible. Scheduling when you call out. Write ups for improper training. No accepting responsibility. Lack of benefits for employees. Inconsistent placement in the store.
bad,"The main reason why, when you visit any Panera, there are people working is 100% due to the lies the general managers are told to tell in order to simply have a staff!"
bad,Managers will never appreciate the work you do. One manager always had a HORRIBLE attitude constantly and he yelled at employees in front of customers
bad,Panera bread was a good place for me i did not like it though when they keep putting me on dishwasher i was getting tired of it and i switched to a different job
bad,"While working for Panera I was harassed by an employee and customer and told to just deal with it. Definitely a company based on profit not people, work life balance didn't work."
bad,"no comment, franchise and not corporate, they own several stores in the general area and decided to clean house for a lower pay employee with no tenure or benefits"
bad,This job doesn’t care about anyone but themselves if u are sick u still have to come to work if some one passed away in ur family u still have to come to work they don’t care about u so don’t listen to that mess they say they don’t care period
bad,It wasn’t fun to work around the managers besides one of the older men that always closed. We were always told to do things differently by so many other people. They were very unprofessional and management would talk to regular employees about other people and gossiped too much.
bad,I will refrain from speaking negatively. I had no positive experiences at Panera (outside of the customer interactions.. how I miss helping and serving people. )
bad,It was an awful job. It was nothing like it was described when I was hired. It's a 2 person job but they expect only 1 person to do it. It's hard to take a break because you're constantly baking and prepping for the next batch of food to be baked. You pretty much have time to go to the bathroom and get a drink. The pay is awful
bad,Pay was terrible. Managers were rude and super bossy. There was a lot of drama going on. They work you too hard and give you no pay. They make it hard for you to move up in the company or get a raise. If you need to call out they make it hard on you.
bad,"The managers have no clue what they’re doing, they are rude to staff and customers alike, they are impatient and harsh, and fail to properly train their employees, causing frustration for everyone involved. there’s lots of drama among staff, very unprofessional."
bad,"I hated working at panera, they don’t treat their employees as they should be treated and they underpay employees for how much work that they do. i worked 5 days a week and never got a raise for being one of the best employees that they had"
bad,"I worked at the Panera Bread in Columbia, SC. I interviewed and was hired a few days later. I came in for the Orientation, which really wasn’t an orientation. I completed my availability, tax forms, and W-2 forms. That was it. I thought I would be watching videos like some other recent hires watched. One girl stated she watched videos about the company and menu. Nonetheless, Panera Bread is unorganized. This particular location had no training. Panera Bread was recently purchased by Coveli sibthey fired everybody and started over. So everybody is new. I work three days of “training”. On my fourth day, indec to quit. "
bad,"Their training consisted of 4hours a day,mabey 20 hours a week.My trainer was great but mgt.was horrible.was let go or as they put it""parting ways"". they waisted 1 month of my time.hiring me Sept 6, didn't start training me till September 16th, letting me go October 2nd.Their cash reg.are as complicated as their menus"
bad,"I worked in catering for about 6yrs. The management at 600 West Vanburen are horrible... There racist they have their picks and chooses!! If you don’t go by there bad ways they are cutting your hours and days. They make up write ups!! And threatened to fire you if you don’t sign them.. There not good with Communication skills, The manager constantly fire a worker rehire  them back as management.. All lower scores that place was nothing nice ever to work there"
bad,"Work consisted of boring monotony that usually ended up in you doing someone else's job because the managers didn't want to do anything themselves. There were the occasional good days, but those were far and in-between. Some of the managers were good, but not all of them. The employees are poorly picked and create drama that you cannot avoid no matter how you try. The managers that were bad were bad enough to make you not want to work with them or even come to work at all the days after. Some went as far as insulting you or your issues when you were not having the best day at work, and other employees could testify for this."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,Managers are good. Definitely favors more people then others. Senior coworkers are very disrespectful to new or newer workers. Promised hours when first started the cut back a lot.
bad,"this job didn't want to work with my schedule, always put you in positions you don't wants few good managers but mostly poor management, the pay is not worth the job"
bad,"I did not like a lot of the strategies they use to solve their problems. They are not caring for employees, they do not speak to each other with kind words, and they are simply just mean and bitter.."
bad,The management is a joke here.  Employees are never allowed to go home on time.  The turnover rate is horrible.  The cafe is severly understaffed and employees are burned out
bad,You won't ever get a quality of life working for Panera Bread. You will work for people who do not care about you or your family. They pride themselves on being one of the best companies to work for when in reality this is absolutely one of the worse companies to work for.
bad,Worst franchise I’ve ever had to work for. Multiple complaints on harassment and discrimination that they just overlook. Training is by far the worst ever.
bad,You do way more than you should and you barely get paid minimum wage. The managers are younger than your parents and very immature. Your hours are always cut and the district manager tries to get with every young girl.
bad,They regularly will revoke hours from your schedule if you begin to reach or go over 40 hours as a full timer. Little to no discount for employees on food. Management is almost never understanding of schedules and will force you to work what suits them as opposed to what will work for you.
bad,"I have never in my life worked for a worse company. I would not recommend to anyone. I had no work life balance, I was promoted to GM a Before I was ever ready but they had no managers so they didn’t see another option. I worked 7 days a week, sometimes over 70 hours at 38k a year. Ridiculous! I had no managers near the end of my time and they refused to give me any. Worst!"
bad,Management over uses good employees and lets bad employees coast. Management never replaces broken items unless scolded by upper management once a problem occurs. The job itself is not bad but the entire managerial team was a total nightmare and lacked proffessionality.
bad,Co workers were horrible. Blamed everything on the newbies. You couldn't correct them because they would proceed with an attitude. They expected you to know already and you couldn't even ask for help from them. Main reason why i left. One of the managers was horrible. She would often forget to give us break. So we would work nonstop for 7-8 hours. The other managers were nice and understanding.
bad,All and all not that bad. Managers make poor management decisions. Be prepared to work as 4 ppl. Over worked very little pay. They have it set to where in order to move up. They have associates doing managers duties until the feel u are ready. Very manipulative
bad,"My experience working at Panera Bread was dreadful."
bad,I wouldn’t recommend working at Panera Bread. The managers had favorites. You’d get blamed over something that wasn’t your fault. Training is poor. Hours were hectic for part time.
bad,They expect more and more out of you but want to pay you less than they paid the person before you.  No organization in management at allDonotworkhere
bad,"I have worked at Panera for four years, and the turn over rate is really ridiculous.  I have been told I would be promoted from every GM since my first year here, and they always leave.  The next one comes and says the same thing.  When I was 9 months pregnant, I worked 35+ hours a week until 4 days past my due date.  I could barely stand, but still did it.  Now because I have a baby, and have to work part time I’m no longer valued enough to be a supervisor.  All Panera cares about now is the bottom line.  I remember when everyone cared for you, not just numbers and money.  Super sad but hopefully I’ll be leaving soon."
bad,they were very rude. Instead of working together they always blamed each other for mistakes. they never worked around peoples schedules or avalibility and they are very unorganized.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,My store had 7 managers at the time of my departure. This made it so normal associates were given less time and usually meant that we got sent home early due to the store going over budget for the day.
bad,When I was working at Panera a was alright but I didn’t see my self working there for a long time a was just a emergency job so I stay there till I get a better job
bad,My advise if you are working there is to gain the experience for your resume and move on. There is no upward mobility if you are African American. The management team has a type. If you don't meet that type you will not advance within.
bad,"Been working for Panera almost 2 years now and no type of promotion. I was promised a promotion and raise at the beginning of this year, I've completed everything that was asked of me to proceed with the promotion still nothing. The job is extremely stressful by itself. Poor management, lack of communication, no discipline, and basically work your butt off with no appreciation. Sick, have a death in the family, or any type of emergency they absolutely do not care!"
bad,This corporation was not very respectful. They weren’t very clean and they usually were always having minors (me) clean until 3 in the morning on school nights . Would not recommend to high school or college students .
bad,It begins and ends with management. Had a horrific experience with fellow employees and due to my background did NOT listen to my side. Avoid Orlando area Paneras...
bad,"I was treated poorly as an employee. I was taken advantage of because I was a hard worker. Some pay checks, I was shortened my tips because the management forgot to input my tips."
bad,They barely train you at this place.  After a few days you go out and are own your own.  The employees are nice but they are unorganized.  Cleaning was always an issue.
bad,This is to demanding and no benefits and when I was told I could not have a patriotic sticker that made me feel not wanted at all do not apply here!!! The girl was so rude and disrespectful!!
bad,"manager was not prepared for her title ,very child like and has no skills for the job she needed to preform , store was dirty , everything would break , constant fighting among the staff , not a good environment"
bad,Don't work at the Fluer Drive Panera Bread. I was bullied by management and called stupid. I was placed in wrong position.  Was threatened when I quit
bad,Bad place to work because nobody in there would ever answer calls when I would try to tell them about something and they are also we’re unorganized and it’s very frustrating.
bad,"If you are a high school student and want to work a minimum wage job, stay far away from this company. They will be unwilling to work around your school schedule and expect you to spend more time working there then paying attention to school. If you are looking for a full time position, this place offers little to no growth and soon after I left said they were no longer giving raises to their employees. If you care about your sanity, steer clear of associating with this company."
bad,"Very unfair management  Alot of favoritism, they treat new people like they are under them , they talk to you very rudely I felt very uncomfortable every day at work"
bad,"This place had too many young people with too much drama. Cussing in front of customers and making fun of a disabled girl. HORRIBLE! I will never go back there again, not even to order food. That place had nothing but snakes and the manager did nothing to fix that."
bad,Stay away from this company. The cheat you out of your paycheck and then refuse to back pay it. It has happened to me several times before I said enough was enough. And each time the amounts they owed me increased.
bad,Management is young and just takes advantage of you. They only care about how much you can do for them and that is it. No room to advance and not opportunities.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,I told them I had another job before I got hired and I was open anytime they never gave me hours never called to give schedule and I felt they  didn’t want me making money I had a nice car better than everybody car up there and they were stealing my tips when I was out on delivery making me go on deliveries without a tip and taking deliveries I was already assigned to with tips.
bad,Worst experience I had at a job they management skills were off and they let me go off the strength of another worker which I felt was No compromising at all.
bad,"It is basically whom you know place.  It is a place with tic for tac.   They hire their own people and they fire people for no reason. If they can get benefit outside from Panera from you they will give you light duty of work and they keep you. If they don’t get benefit from you, they will fire you"
bad,"I have worked for Panera for some years and the place has gone down since I have been there. I have seen many associates and managers come and go due to poor work ethic, salaries are not good and the management is very unprofessional.  I would also like to add that our kitchen equipment and our barista equipment   Are always broken .. employees are not treated with respect.."
bad,The worst job I have ever had. Did not care about management or employees at all. I know this is not Panera is a hole this was one Panera Bread that I work for that was a franchise but a terrible experience all the same
bad,There was too much drama and not enough maturity. Wasn’t paid enough to deal with half of what happened. Always busy and a lot of mistakes were always made. Lost a lot of customers due to the mistakes. Still hasn’t changed.
bad,I only worked at Panera for a month. It was a very difficult month to work there. I worked at the front by myself. I was constantly stressed with the long lines and making sure all orders were placed in an orderly fashion.
bad,"This was my first job since becoming a new mom. My former GM was very understanding of work schedules and valued hard working employees. When she quit her replacement came in only wanting a paycheck, not caring about even getting to know the names of her employees. She called off more time than she worked, got hung over at employee parties then called off the next day.  She never assisted during peak hours and if asked to , was quite the brat about it."
bad,Poor management like to play favorites went on medical leave came back to be told that they filled my position would not recommend for single moms or anyone with family
bad,A typical day at work depended on which days you worked. Sunday's were by far the busiest days it was a very fast paced environment. I would say our management was very disorganized and very rude with bad communication.
bad,"I don't think the vast majority of workers in the food industry are paid fairly and this job is no different. Management will literally stress themselves and everyone around them because they're so fearful of their bosses and not meeting their expected numbers. Even if you do a great job, something will get nit-picked without fail. Business would always be fine, but someone would always have to overreact when the pace of the restaurant got a little busy and made things a bigger deal than they actually were in reality. It's very hard to respect them and I would go somewhere that cares more about you as an individual. That's simply the indisputable truth."
bad,"After working there for two years,  I was mistreated and not a single raise even though I did what they said I had to to get it.  Once I left they gave someone a raise to cover my stressful position. They don't care about their employees, don't work here."
bad,GM made many promises in interview they were not kept! ZERO APPLICABLE TRAINING!!! Minimal training provided and info changed daily! Massive amounts of favoritism and clique behavior! They should not hire new people in Dover delaware! Horrible place and me and friends will never eat there again!!! Soooo much sugar! Terrible place to work!
bad,"My Panera was the most hostile, uncertain work environment i have ever had the misfortune of experiencing. Managers hated the managers, employees hated the employees, it was chaos. My scheduling manager started giving me one shift a week despite my constant cries for more shifts. The other managers were incompetent, and all you need for a good Panera associate team is a pulse. Good food, awful workers. Work at Panera if you want some stories."
bad,This company is all over the place they don’t pay well. You can work as an assistant general manager and don’t get compensated. You can be accused of things and don’t be aware of it. They will terminate you over hear say. District managers don’t come around enough. Regional managers rarely show there face. Company isn’t been ran to the standards they were set out to
bad,This job consists of employees who find the easy way out . 2 of the three managers don’t work with what they’re supposed to. poor cleanliness and no respect for others.
bad,"This place will chew you up and spit you out! No quality of life, unreasonable demands. Trying to serve quality food with whiny 16 year olds that don't want to work. Constant schedule changes at the last minute. Minimal advancement opportunities unless your're in their ""Good ol boy"" network. Definite favoritism."
bad,"Horrible, Terrible, Disheartening, Unprofessional, Chaotic, Disrespectful, Bullies, Unkind, Dishonest, Abusive, Intolerable, Unsanitary, Disorganized, Toxic."
bad,"Stay away from these stores, Management is a complete Joke, with hardly any experience.  They show Favoritism to employees that literally kiss their Butt. I'm not about that. I dedicated 2 yrs bend over backwards for them. Left and came back, big mistake. There is absolutely no kind of leadership or organization within this company. They keep rehiring Bad employees in a desperate attempt to keep the stores going."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,Started off cool. Then after a while they started over staffing and spreading work hours around to the point where people were only getting 10-12 hours a week.
bad,"This place sucks. They barely ever have you work, (some) of the co-workers are rude and think they’re better than everyone else. I will not ever work here again. They just expect you know how to do everything and you only get a couple hours of training before they put you on cash."
bad,"The management in the past few months has taken a sharp down turn in terms of quality. there are numerous broken appliances, inconsistencies in the quality of service, nowhere in the restaurant is constantly, thoroughly clean, at any given time there are multiple food items out of stock. Worst of all is the work culture. With about two thirds of the staff have a pathetically low work ethic, often if they have nothing to do they just laze around on their phones instead of finding another job to do and getting upset when someone suggests that they work, rarely contribute to the collective effort unless someone directly and often loudly tells them to, and they often leave before the end of their shift with their job undone, expecting whoever comes in after them to pick up their slack."
bad,Always short staffed. Management and employess will walk right past you and offer no help. Managers talk poorly about employess and past employess. Management is very rude and puts you down. Very low expectations on hygiene. Product quality and food safety is not a priority. NO ONE CARES.
bad,Managers and teenagers are the same they both do what they want when they want. Customers were always rude no matter how you catered to them but mostly management  took advantage of the hardest workers.
bad,it was awful working there. the gave me no hours they paid me 8 dollars for one day of working two hours every week. i wouldn't recommended to anyone.
bad,"All of the higher up people in this company act like they have a personal problem with the employees, they are not friendly people to work for. This job was dreadful for me to show up to everyday"
bad,"got a lot of hours first few months then barely nothing after "
bad,you will never get a raise here unless you beg. Management is horrible with barely and structural communication. Company treats associates with disrespect and constantly looks for something to yell at you for.
bad,I was promised a position if I left my other job and worked with them full time with a increase. They did not deliver with the promised job title and only gave me a quarter raise after I was promised more.
bad,"I work day and Panera bread is always on the go,  yes he had to take about a 30 minute break but it is always so busy that you may not even get a break and basically you just clean sometimes prep food and also you get to work on the register ."
bad,"the mangers suck, no one knows how to do their job and when you can’t do something correctly the first time you will most likely get a write up. oh yea and the food they serve you isn’t fresh.. it’s frozen (USF location)"
bad,It sucked I was pregnant I had tp every job no one was friendly and it was stressful u had teach your self too. I leftwhen i was pregnant due to poorangement and pegancy kwwuee
bad,why is it that once a company has a idea that they  screw all there employees as in the delivery then not then back on again the customers never tip and the upper management doesn't care for you
bad,DONT WORK HERE! Managers violate company policies daily and even after contacting corporate HR nothing changes. The managers are told exactly what you said and WILL retaliate against you!
bad,"Takes forever managment to do anything they dont care,  raised prices and rip you off with portions and gives no raises i can go on schedule days for only 3 hours when law states must be more even every day customers have complained about park side"
bad,"This is literally the worst job I have ever had. Terrible management. I believe I was racially discriminated against. I never worked the shift I was scheduled for, I would always be let go a hour or two earlier and would frequently be called to not come in for shifts. HORRIBLY run, if you live in Katy Texas DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!"
bad,"Poor poor poor communication amongst managers, unless its to gossip Most of the adult managers here are miserable, the kid managers can't multitask and get frustrated because they can't do their job. Delivery drivers beware once your motor blows from running your car into the ground trying to deliver their food they won't give a dam about you."
bad,Associate trainer was the highest level they will let you work your way up to.  They hire in management so they can pay them about the same without having to worry about giving raises.
bad,The atmosphere is horrible! Managers treat you like a kid. They don’t care about others working there. There was only one manager that was nice. The assistant manager always yelled at people.
bad,"Rudest management on the face of this earth. They acknowledge the power that they have over you and use that to get you to do the tasks that they were too lazy to do themselves. Trying to get a shift covered was impossible because the management refused to hire new employees even though we desperately needed them. The food preparation area was always super dirty and the same mops that were used in the bathroom were also used in the kitchen... The hardest part of this job was putting up with how unacceptable the behavior of the management was. A typical day at work would consist of maintaining your area of the cafe and taking orders. Occasionally if you worked a closing shift you had to vacuum with the WORST vacuum cleaner on the face of this earth. This vacuum cleaner was so dirty and broken I went home with dust on my face every day. Not to mention when this vacuum cleaner would break the management would patch it up with duct tape... and then it proceeded to break again. Panera accepts tips usually at the cash area and although the customers believe the tips are going to the employees, they actually go straight to the cafe which wouldn't be an issue if the cafe would spend it on something useful such as A NEW VACUUM CLEANER."
bad,They hired so many people more than they should’ve and used everybody and then took me off the schedule and to this day haven’t fired me they just stopped giving people hours and forgot about them and only kept certain people even though I did my best job not once did they appreciate anything anyone does
bad,"Managers were disrespectful, unorganized and the place was unsanitary , the service to the customers was not good, there were always complaints and call outs"
bad,"Everything comes in frozen or in a pre prepped bag. Managers always in office. Meat pre sliced. Nothing healthy at all. Poor culture. Upper management just as terrible if you ever see them.  Transaction count down so prices raised to make up for it. But hey, national brand so people come in for the name. See how long that keeps them in business."
bad,"Where do I begin... For a minimum wage job you'll never work harder. This place has policies and procedures outside of food safety that are insane. The DM of this company has no soul. He has no understanding or compassion for low level employees, let alone the management staff. Don't work here."
bad,"Management was immature, constantly slacking off, and purposely ignoring employees when they asked for help. Most employees were rushed through training and as a result, performed poorly. The customers are rude and unless you are a minor, you are not given a break."
bad,"There are great people there, no doubt but I wasnt interested in working there anymore. I worked for the company as a whole for 7 years. My pay never really increased and it was just a standard job to get me through. Some of the people there are great. But theres alot of drama there as well and I prefer to stay out of the drama. I felt like my voice was unheard there and it just didnt sit well with me so I quit. It's hard to get fired there but it can be done. I stayed loyal to them for 7 years. I'm really good at keeping a job."
bad,"A typical day at work is this; "
bad,The  trainers were awful.  There were never breaks. It was the worse place to work.   A few of the coworkers were great but the rest were awful.  stay away.
bad,I was sexually assaulted twice. The customers were angry and outrageous. Managers can't stock or run the store enough. I can't say how many days I cried or vomited walking in the door to work.
bad,The insurance isn't very good. I got hurt at work and they don't care. They mistreat pregnant women. I get burned almost every day and they don't care.
bad,"Often times several individuals would call off without coverage causing other employees to work later than scheduled. Management was very inconsistent, some managers would remain on their phones and other devices right in front of customers. After requests for time off were approved, the managers would still schedule you for those approved days off, causing conflict with major events (school) outside of work and often times managers couldn't be bothered by said situations, it was still the employee's responsibility to find coverage or work the shift. Most of the employees are friendly, not all managers were unorganized."
bad,"I've worked with the company for over 5 years through high school and college. I would never recommend anyone to work at such a place. They don't care for their employees, trying to get a pay increase was slim to none. I was a shift supervisor that was demoted without any reasoning and received this information through a text message with my general and district manger in it. They are very unprofessional and inconsiderate of their employees feelings, time, and lively hood."
bad,"When you first join, they're like, ""Yeah well work with you!"" Then a couple months down the road, they have no desire to work with your schedule after you've made a change to it. I was working mornings, usually only weekends 5am-11am. 4 hour shifts. I was forced to get a second job because they didnt want to work with me nor provide more hours. When i submitted my schedule change, it was accepted. But then when the new schedule came out, it wasnt what I requested at all. They have horrible flexibility, unless your a ""managers pet."" They do play favoritism as well. But then again, they hire several new people to work mornings and open, force you to train them, then they still have you open when that new person is like, ""yeah I'm okay with opening!"""
bad,"Horrible Management team in the Colorado springs chappel hills area, i loved to come here until a new manager showed up and caused such bad interactions that most his staff left."
bad,"While panera may be an expencesive place to eat, they still wont pay you for all you do. You will be working multiple positions at once and your managers will ask why you havent finished all of them within a hour. They will cut your hours without warning and will never tell you what you're doing wrong until they give you a write up. The discount you get is only useful if you are working that day but even then you cant use your rewards from your panera card, which they require you to have, along with your discount. It is not a free meal either and you can only use it once in the day. I do NOT recommend working here unless you are going for management as they do close to nothing. Beware of trying to climb the ranks if you are not ready to kiss butt and be lead by carrot and stick."
bad,"This company has NO respect for its employees."
bad,"Working here since January, I have seen a lot and a lot of poor management. At least at the store I worked within. The managers are inconsistent,  and they will be more than happy to tell you theyll work with your schedule. However, when you make a slight change to your schedule, they tell you ""no we csnt work with that."" I had to pick up a second job because of how little hours they provide. And they're always overstaffed, which is why I was receiving less hours. I had asked for more and other positions, but was denied. Never called in, showed up late once, and always do what theyve asked me to do. We had our annual meeting back in April and our manager guilt tripped the entire restaurant because WE were the ones costing his job. I swear, he was about to force those fake tears. Also, at that meeting, our GM (the same one who built tripped) praised those employees who Call In. He goes, ""As many times as you've called in, so-and-so, when you DID show up for work, you do great."""
bad,"Nope,I was accused of stealing after I put a phone,left on the counter,in a back room.fired for stealing,after the phone never left the building..good luck with those idiots"
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"Managers don't give a single care in the world about their employees and when confronted they say it is because we are ""replaceable"". Not good for morale."
bad,Worked in Milford CT location managers take their job way too serious really sit there and watch you if you gave one more piece of any items its sad food costs is at every restaurant and food service place shouldn't be a job title nor position for that was transferred twice both times with hesitation
bad,"was guaranteed full time hours when hired on but a few months in, hours dropped to 20. paid 9.00 a hour. don't work here if living by yourself and needing a stable income."
bad,Dude it sucked working there like when I say sucked I mean Im seriously it sucked like i couldnt even begin to tell you how much it sucked working there
bad,"I worked at Panera Bread for around 4 months mainly as a delivery driver but towards the end I started training to become a line cook. The worst part about Panera hands down is the management. They're unfair & don't care to hear what you have to say nor do they work with you when it comes to your schedule. Considering I was place on Medical Leave & was never brought back or paid for my last week of employment, I highly suggest avoiding employment at Panera Bread."
bad,"not worth it, long hours and no breaks unreasonable time frame and if you make any mistakes you get written up, and disciplined by your manager. deadlines for baking are ridiculous and half the ovens at my store were broken."
bad,"This company is a shame to work for, they dont like to give raises. They have favorites that work there and if your not a favorite you are not entitled to anything"
bad,Not the best place to work. No room for improvement or growth. I only lasted there a year because I did not like the company. The kitchen wasn’t clean enough.
bad,"Extremely poor management, employees we’re extremely disrespectful always to the workforce. Overall the worst job I ever had. Do not waste your time working at Panera bread."
bad,The staff at Panera bread sucks. The general manager mya is a complete  and plays way to much favoritism in the work force. I would not recommend working for her if you are not a favorite. Also you dont get a chance to move it up if your recommended by any associate trainer.
bad,"I was paid minimum wage ($8.25) to cashier, bus tables, wash dishes, and clean the bathrooms every day. It was nonstop chaos from the start of every shift. Rude customers and abusive management. If you weren't a favorite, you were in trouble for no reason. Not worth it. Do not work for this company."
bad,The Panera Bread on Garners Gerry Road in SC was an awful place to work. The managers did not care about anything. Everyone was hooking up and smoking on the job.
bad,"at Parana you and everyone else times are on one index card with a magnifying glass and if you miss one day you are fired, it was unfair to a lot of the associates because you couldn't ask for time off because the mad the scheduled month by month it was a vary toxic environment."
bad,Working at Panera Bread for years was fun at first until certain people get promoted or leave. It was always a battle or who gets what in the company and became impossible to have any fun with anything done there.
bad,"I do not recommend working here at all! It as an awful place to work. Pay was awful, management was rude, workers were treated poorly. this is by far the worst place i have worked at and i would never recommend it to anyone."
bad,"i got hurt on the job, took YEARS for them to pay and then black listed (dont say you dont. asked 12 stores in 3 states)  me after going after them just to cover the bills. Should of sued them."
bad,"Almost every single day i was off, I would get asked to come in and fill for somebody. The work environment was survival of the fittest. Management there is absolutely horrible. Very easy job to learn, but it's extremely stressful when a lot of people call off and having to man 4 stations all by yourself is too much. I had to prepare an entire soccer teams order all by myself because the manager wouldn't help at all, the deliverer was making a lot of delivery, and the cashier wasn't trained. I would have to work so much that i would get sent home for having too many hours worked. Majority of the time you won't get a break, and if you do a double shift, you might only get a 30 minute break. You're supposed to get a free lunch doing, but i never did."
bad,"Panera Breads biggest bonus is it does pay well, and while this could have been a state issue, the locations I had the displeasure of working at did not even attempt to support its management beyond the company rule of sending managers to a Training Cafe. "
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,Company believes in favoritism and lying to guests. They allow management to yell at employees. Do not work with single mothers no job advancement. Never allowed to learn new aspects of company
bad,"Hooked on Dough dba Panera Bread has the worst management possible. Terrible hours, no breaks or lunches, work you like a dog and care less about their people. The upper management lacks integrity or empathy...everything is about the bottom line. They re-wrap expired meats and short staff their crew while putting the stress on their managers. No raises or even reviews. They dont know how to develop their people and frankly give the Panera brand a bad name."
bad,"I applied to be a line cook and then when I got the job, they made me a cashier without telling me. They left me alone knowing that I was new and left me there struggling where the line was going out the door. I felt terrible and the manger laughed at me and in a sarcastic tone asking if I needed help. They used my register and always made me short even though YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO DO THAT! I absolutely hated it an even the regulars were rude.  The only thing good about that place was the free drinks and the discount on the food."
bad,"It is hard to find a good place to work with the best managers. This location is not only to worst with General Managers but also with employees. You can find yourself wanting a certain schedule or need a day off but you won't get it because you are not part of the GM's click. The enjoyable part was this, I meet a lot of amazing customers that made my day when I was stressed."
bad,I had a big issue with the management not caring about my health when i had had a seizure. I was not allowed to call out and was required to work my shift after falling very ill.
bad,"Worst job I have ever had. managers were unprofessional, and I was rarely given a break, even though by law, I had to have a break after working a certain amount of hours while I was 16."
bad,"This Panera work location has a stressful work environment. Constantly under staffed. Current employees over worked and poorly compensated and hardly recongized for a job well done. Cuurent Gerneral Manager is guilty of not listening to employee concerns and does not take responsibility for own mistakes. Overall, this store is just poorly managed."
bad,"I strongly recommend you do not get a job here. The system is awful. Management sucks, no raises and I worked there for a year and I had to train all the new employees. Constantly understaffed and the customers are straight up mean to employees. Overall awful job to have."
bad,"I was working for Panera and it was fine. I posted a status on Facebook appreciating MLK day , people from 10 years ago callled my job and said I was racist. My job did NOT get any proof of said racism and still fired me. Almost brought it to court but I didn’t want to work for them after winning the case. Angela didn’t let me work and told me there was no proof. A phone call fired me and my mother is black. My reputation got ruined and now I can’t find another job for false information."
bad,"Working here for over 11 years . Started off making 7.50 per hour my ending pay was 11.50. I first saw how racist the company was when , I had been there for over a year and after my year of being there I trained a white girl and we both ended up going to train the trainer together. That was ok but we when both returned she got 1.00 raise and I got 50 cent raise? Like how does this happen. We both where in high school first jobs and she had Less experience than I did but suddenly she made more than the person who trained her! Panera will work you like a slave and date you to call out. You better be on your death bed!! Panera took my social life away, Panera expects you to work work work for such little pay . I even gotten slapped by a customer and nothing happened to the customer because the customer is always right!! They had me do all this paper work for hr but they told me not to call the police on the customer etc but I still had to be friendly with customers that assulted me."
bad,"This job was the worst place to ever work at. Not only do they have you cleaning the floors, but also the ceiling. The work was strenuous for little pay."
bad,Managers are difficult and manage by listening to gossip. They don't keep their word and are unfriendly. Nobody cares about each other even enough to be coworkers. They hire high school students because they are young and unprofessional. The management is lazy and they don't have to work hard. All the food is premade and they just heat it up. You think it is healthy but it is very processed food.
bad,"This place is a joke The food is not fresh, management and HR don’t care about their employees. No raises, no promotions no benefits no flexible hours"
bad,"GM is very unprofessional,  discriminates against certain employees. "
bad,"Panera are cheapskate millionaires.  A few managers run the place, and associate workers are treated like cockroaches.  Prepare to be insulted, sent home early, and paid the bare minimum."
bad,"I never got a raise, I only worked 2 hours a week for the last 4 months. The only fun I had was when I got to do barista when I finished prep work. They trained me on everything except for line, which I continued to ask to work, but they never allowed me to."
bad,"Panera Bread is a big company country wide, it could be a great place to work in another county, the job of a Baker is very gratifying but also very fast paced and without any breaks throughout the entire night shift."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"The family quality of life is non existant. They pretend to care for you and your family but the reality is they don’t ."
bad,"Most of the Panera's in the South Jersey area are owned by the same franchisee and they would not be in business today if they didn't piggy back on the Panera name. Abysmal upper management.  So many people became gms in 2018 because so many left after being treated like dirt. Extremely high turnover rate across the board. Customer concerns are not addressed and hr matters aren't investigated.  ""Abandon hope all ye that enter here."""
bad,"Where do I even start? I came into this company when my location's management was changing. I hear the old manager was amazing. Too bad I never got to work with him."
bad,"The management at Panera is absolutely horrible, there is a lack of accountability as well as communication amongst the managers that makes the average shift incredibly stressful and overwhelming for regular team associates. This creates an overall hostile work environment that few are able to handle."
bad,"Unprofessional, very dirty, bad customer service, don't know what they doing, very unorganized. They slave the employees. Murene is very disrespectful."
bad,"did not like working here, did not like the way people was treated there someone always had something to say about someone. and i did not like that..."
bad,"Management is horrible, they are very rude and don’t care about you they also have low pay not enough to live off in the long run. They judged you if you do something wrong and keep talking about it  through out your whole shift."
bad,terrible place to work if you dont want to lie to people food is sub par staff is sub par as well not reliable have to hunt GMS down when you have pay issues
bad,the managers are insufferable and impossible to work with. you get short breaks and they harrass you the last 10 minutes of it. it was just awful.....
bad,I was 1 of only 2 black people that worked at this company. Everyone else is Spanish. Talk about racist this company is at the top of the list. They do not like black people at all. They ignore you and treat you like garbage. I would never recommend anyone to work here.
bad,I typically did not enjoy working at Panera I would not recommend anyone to work here. This place does not care about their employees and I just would not rec
bad,I worked as a delivery driver. Most of the drivers were ok. One however was lazy as all get out and the rest of us had to consistently cover her butt. Management picks favorites and is unfair to others.  Was told they were an understanding  bunch which couldn't be further from the truth. When given paperwork to fill out ( for social  services showing I now had a job) I was told they didn't have time and had it pushed back into my hands. It was late and I got I  trouble for that even though they were wouldn't fill it out in a timely manner. When asked a question they treat you like your an idiot ( mind you when  i was new and training) . Was promised full time at hire on and then only given a few 3 - 4 hour shifts a couple times a week. Don't work here if you have a family to support because it's a waste of time
bad,The culture at this location was poor. Everyone was for themselves which is understandable it’s just a job. But the employees were rather childish and created petty drama that even the managers were aware of and did nothing about.
bad,I was extremely disappointed with the company for not keeping their promises. I was promised a salary when I was hired but when I asked about it after I had been working their I got in trouble.  This company does not keep their word and they over work their employees. I would not recommend working there.
bad,"My job as head opener required me to attend work at 4:45AM and get off between 2 and 2:30PM. I was often left picking up after everyone else, doing fellow employees' work, as well as my own. Management was very unprofessional and refused raises."
bad,"Managers overwork minors consistently.  The company takes advantage of loyal employees—overworking them, promising to give them a raise and never following through.  It is so rare to get a raise at Panera that you’d have a better shot at becoming a manager because of the store being short-staffed.  Because every store is so short-staffed, when managers and employees train a new employee, they have to train them so quickly just so the position is filled that the new-hires are usually left to their own devices and made to figure out the job themselves.  The company is so short on managers that if a manager quits, they promote the next person available just to fill the position even if they are completely incompetent, which is usually the case."
bad,"As a driver for Panera, there are a few things that catch your eyes at first. Getting paid daily for tips and mileage is a great benefit for the job, and the 65 percent discount is another great reason to work there. But when you get into an accident because the benefit of the company is more important than your safety. Things start to open up. 65 percent is still making Panera a lot more money than you would think, and their programs to initiate you into the  program they lovingly call ""Planet Bread"" is designed to make you want to work there, as all introductions are, with loving pictures showing the perfect store that runs smoothly without needing any influence.The stark reality is that the job will force you to work more than what you are paid to do, the customers are insufferable and show their dark side when it comes to getting bread rather than an apple. The pay for drivers is less than their associates and carries way less risk of losing a vehicle to an accident. They will advertise 12 dollars an hour for payment, but they're being extremely generous with tips and mileage. Most of the workers I've talked with make about 10, which is still largely under what the line staff make. If they mistake and order and send you out with the wrong items, you must go back and they refuse to pay those mileages. If the line messes up a rapid pickup, they refuse to pay those mileages for sending you out to a job that you do not have a chance of making a dollar off of. Driving for panera was a short, but hellish experience for me and I am glad that I will never have to do it again."
bad,I started at a lower pay rate than the new hires and finally got an increase in my pay after working with the company for 2 years. During my time with the company we had three General managers there was a lot of turn over.
bad,"I worked for Panera as a baker and received great benefits and wage. However, they informed me the day before Christmas Eve that they were terminating my position and giving anyone working my position a $3.25 wage decrease and a decrease in hours as well. I switched to working an associate position and the management was very disrespectful. I was always on time, friendly and did my tasks to the best of my ability but management treated me like absolute dirt. All of the workers were unhappy there and couldn't wait to find another job."
bad,"My time working at Panera was short, and thank god for that, because they give you the work of what a normal restaurant would divide between 2-3 people, and expect you to finish it within a four hour shift. Many times I felt in danger working there, and often times I would question if we were properly following the health code, as there were many rusty kitchen implements and little care taken to avoid burning from hot soups/ovens."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"The managers were always changing and all over the place. Relatives of a supervisor were working there even though they knew they shouldn’t have been, and fellow coworkers were rude and not clean. Overall Panera Bread is a great company but this location is very terrible to work at and I even considered getting HR involved."
bad,"The Panera Bread in Matteson, IL is the most toxic, drama-filled, high-school-mentality-workplace I have ever worked for. Management will act nice and act like family in the beginning, but will stab you in the back if you ever have a problem with them."
bad,"This job was my first real job with an actual company. I was treated poorly but management and my coworkers. i was not allowed to learn how to do multiple jobs, i was stuck doing one thing with no room to grow. pretty sure the best i ever got was the 60% discount on food."
bad,the hardest part of the job was not being accessible to the right tools required to finish the job. learned how to bake pastry's and sour dough breads.
bad,"I was at Panera for a year and some months, i was promised a raised after 6 months by one GM but then she got fired and another came in. this was a long repetitive cycle trying to get a raise, no solution. They went through 4 GM's during my time there, ridiculous."
bad,"The Rocklin Panera is a disaster to work at. Worked there for a year and started out pretty good met cool people loved them and learned how to be good at my job then the new GM turned it into a trashole and it’s going down everyone there is miserable, they are more than 30 people understaffed and half of them are minors."
bad,Every other day we are busy and you dont get the hours promised you have to share the the hours with all the new people when you are not even getting paid what you were promised
bad,The company all together demonstrates an example for how an employer should not be towards their employees. The company has placed inexperienced individuals in upper management positions that have no clue on how to conduct business while providing a good work environment.  Panera in this district has gotten rid of employees that have been with the company to replace them with cheaper labor while providing no room for growth and development.
bad,I will not Suggest this to no one else because Panera bread had bad word going on the all the time so I will not let my friends know about this job at all
bad,"Reading the Employee Handbook.. They don't even follow their own Polices. More of a violation book than a Guideline.  They work too many people on one shift. The Management is at a loss. No one knows who's in charge half the time. They will share your paycheck information with other employees that they have already favored. Your information nor your personal life is safe as long as you work here. There's little to no advancement for this company. You're promised a position in the interview but receive something else that doesn't pertain to the position applied for. Working for a Franchise instead of a Corporate store, there's nothing but dishonesty in the Management."
bad,It was an awful store and for some reason I was running the store and I was the head line opener  not the gm or the am but the people above me were not able to do their jobs well so I ended up doing it and cleaning up their messes for them
bad,Got told a year and a half in to never expect a promotion and that panera doesnt do raises. When I called out for a few days because my mother passed away i got a lecture on calling out even though i had shown back up about 4 days later. Caused me terrible depression to work here. No one who works here is any bit of happy.
bad,"Poor management specifically the General Manager. If they do not like you they will do whatever they can to push you out. I hated working here, customers were great most of the time."
bad,"Panera is a very wasteful company, we throw everything away instead of being aloud to eat the leftovers. We don't get paid enough in comparison to what they have us do. I ask for help on register when it gets busy and the managers say no."
bad,People were not the nicest. 2 of the guy managers were too rude and it made me uncomfortable. They also did not respect my decision to work on the weekends and stopped putting me on the schedule for no reason which is why I quit.
bad,"When working here the first couple months everything was fine but after a year and a half it’s been the most miserable place for myself and my coworkers.  Management doesn’t follow through on promises and the pay is extremely low. New hires usually quit within a month. Associate are treated unfairly unless they’re in managements inner circle. The work environment is extremely hostile depending on your shift. Long story short, working here will suck the life out of you."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"After being hired, they left you to yourself and online certification training with very little on-hands application.  This leaves the employees guessing and trying to figure out how to improve themselves with very little assistance if any at all."
bad,"the supervisors and the leaders are racists with the Latin people they treat you like animals and always look for pretexts if you do something wrong to give you a warning"
bad,Management was the reason i left. They were a poor at communicating and would hide in the office until it got busy so they could show their face. not okay.
bad,"This company hires and intentionally mentally abuses the youth working for them, management is made up of a lot of people who had no ambitions in life and can be very condescending and hard to to take seriously. They Use scheduling tricks to take up people’s entire days well only paying for like 7 hours. 8-12 5-8."
bad,I hated panera. they made everything so terrible to work there. They was inconsistent and always made their workers feel under-appreciated. They would slave people around.
bad,Worked here going through college. Never had a problem with management and most fellow employees. Great food and now delivery positions are available.
bad,i would never work there again. It sucked the life out of me and anyone else who worked there. Pay is horrible and management treats you horribly. The offer little to no benefits and try to keep everyone part time so they do not have to give full time benefits to anyone.
bad,"Just a waste of time, management not honest and will lie straight to your face.  They will make you feel welcome at the beginning only to hide the real truth of the matter."
bad,"Everyone at Panera is always at each other's throats, no one gets along and they can hardly keep any new employees because of how badly they are treated. Not only are the employees treated poorly, they don't care about the customers either, a lot of the time the employees will just throw their food together to get it out of the way, and the managers pretend to care about their employees but in reality, couldn't care less about them, they are constantly bullying the employees and making everyone feel bad. Panera is a terrible place to work"
bad,"Badly run company that doesn’t care about their employees.  They only care about meeting corporate standards. Pay isn’t competitive, hours are hard to come by. Will be asked to do much more than what they tell you at interview."
bad,"I hate it at Panera, the managers always treated us terribly and we’re very rude to even the customers. The place itself was ok and my coworkers were amazing."
bad,"A horrible, dim, stressful place to work that underpays and overworks employees, does little to settle disputes. As a company it has extremely poor ethics, exploiting misinformation to fool people into believing their food is in any way worth the outrageous price."
bad,I work for Panera for many years and I never got a raise never got a promotion. They would take advantage of me and have me work late nights even though I had a young child at home. I could never get the days off that I needed and nobody would help if you needed to switch shifts. The management is lazy and sits there and watches you drowned as a line is out the door and you've got a hundred orders on your screen and it's just you they don't get up to help I would not recommend anybody working for Panera Bread.
bad,"days were stressful"
bad,"typical day,"
bad,Working for the company they make it seem like it's so easy to transition from associate to corporate I have found that this is totally false they take all the benefits that an associate has and hire you as a temp.  In the process of looking for other employment.
bad,Not much room for growth. There aren't any benefits for the employees. The compensation is expected for a restaraunt job. The hours are very flexible.
bad,They are rude and cuss and treat employees wrong. They work you over time like everyday and only pay like 9 an hour.  Threaten To fire you if you make one mistake.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"Got hired to work as a morning bakery opener, never learned front end. My shift was 5am-1pm showed up for work at 4:45am no one was there to let me in till 6am put me up front to run  register never got trained and register  Ask for help and it’s like you’re inconveniencing other people management doesn’t care they treat you like you’re beneath them stay away from that place"
bad,the company let's lazy associates do as they please while working the good associates to death till they all quit then wonder why customers are always mad.
bad,"Not enough hours and management is poor.  Training employees is poor. Wouldn't recommend working here.The food isn't fresh, a lot of it is frozen in bags then thawed in a microwave,  Food should be fresher and not as expensive."
bad,"awful management, tried to address that there was black mold in the drink urns and management got rude told me to get out of their face. they served food that was expired and that fell on the floor. i got in trouble for overtime, so i walked out."
bad,Panera bread in the premium outlets has poor management very rude management they over work and under pay they're  not understanding nor are they caring about the health or safety of their employees
bad,"I liked most about the job at Panera Bread Co. was the tips when I worked the dining room. They loved me and I loved them, they asked for me, great customer service etc."
bad,"While working at Panera for one year then moving  to a different cafe, I was so disappointed in how disorganized the management was and how new employees would only get one day of training leaving experienced employees to pick up the pieces during lunch rushes. It’s a very stressful environment and no way to get shifts covered easily and be punished for calling out or leaving early due to health/etc.. Always under staffed and people just quitting due to mistreatment and short breaks that give you barely any time to eat. No one there is happy to work there due to being paid very low and not being given raises often at all."
bad,"Such a terrible place to work at, at first they make it seem like its a fun place to work but once you're there for a while working, you get  to learn how people really act. Management was terrible, they overwork you without giving you breaks which then leads to health problems, which then again leads to not showing up for work, and then they treat you even worse for not showing up for work due to being sick. I hated working at Panera and i would never recommend anyone to work for such company."
bad,"This place is absolutely horrible. Long shifts with no breaks, Management is unprofessional and they work you like a slave!!! Co workers are mean and rude to you. They don’t even train you correctly and then get mad at you when you make a mistake. They say in the beginning that it’s 9$ an hr plus tips but nobody really tips at Panera. I would never work there again or wish it on my worse enemy."
bad,"I worked there for almost 2 years, worked as hard as I possibly could for nothing- no raises, no promotions, no gratitude. My store went through 7 managers in the first few months I was there."
bad,I guess it depends on the store and the managers. But too years working there I only got a .10 raise. at one point I worked at two store because if you worked at different store you got pain time and a half.
bad,I was hired as a cashier but worked the dining room cleaning tables ane  taking out trash. Lacking training. Lack of communication between employees and management.
bad,"Panera itself isn't a bad company but the franchise company is terrible. Covelli Enterprises only cares about profit. They do not care about you as a person that is working for them. Associates get no benefits and pay is quite low. Turnover rate is terrible. Training is OK but management can be a hit or miss depending on your location. Overall wouldn't recommend working for Covelli Enterprises. Covelli claims that they raise all this money for charities, yet they don't want to spend a dime on their most valuable assets: the employees. If you're a manager the benefits do not kick in until almost a year after being promoted to manager. "
bad,"I worked at 2 different locations, and they both had the same problems"
bad,"Not only are general managers rude, but corporate is rude as well. They treat their best and most loyal employees the worst. We had a need for more workers so they ended up getting paid more than I was even though I was going on two years."
bad,"The 8 months I spent at panera we're heck. I was paid a low wage and never paid the correct amount for the hours i worked. Managers would constantly bad mouth employees and gossip. During rush periods, all the managers would go and smoke behind the store while the teenage employees tried to serve 50+ people in less than 20min."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"this job is a joke"
bad,this place has to be one of the hardest place to really try to get alot of hour's at. you have your trainee's who are in a position for advancement and are still being under paid because the company is trying to fairly give out the allowed hour's to everyone. The key is that your hours are based upon your work ethic. literally a revolving door of people who come and go. DO NOT work here. you will be in a place of waiting TWO WEEKS TO BE PAID and hungry for hours. mandatory bread bash or your will be fired. some manager's can be very rude and sarcastic as well. if your sick you have to stay home and that is hours you have to pas on to someone else four hours before your shift start's. hair  has to be in a bun. there are other places out here for job advancement. this company does not offer health insurance to part time worker's.
bad,For the time that I worked at Panera  the first couple of months it was a good an fun. The people an coworkers were very nice.Then they changed management  an  it was very uncomfortable. I did leave on good terms.
bad,"Clock in, prep food or stock the beverage station or sweep and mop the kitchen area did dishes most of my shifts, cleaned the bathrooms mostly the janitor work."
bad,They hire drunks and drug addicts who will quit one day and have there job back the next day. They don't care who you are or how hard you work you are just a number to them nothing more
bad,"I worked in the most hostile work environment I ever encountered.  I met a few nice bakers along the way.  But I also encountered , in my opinion,three of the worst human beings I have ever dealt with, and in a work environment. It was really shocking.  I reported these instances to the manager.  But nothing was ever done about it."
bad,The management at panera was just like highschool. They all talked behind their backs. the mangers were very disresectful and talked badly about everyone behind their backs and gossiped
bad,You start at minimum wage and are responsible for almost everything in the store. Panera will also have the fewest amount of people working at any time which makes it very difficult to keep up with everything.  Do not work here.
bad,I would never go back to working here. The management was horrendous! They pay was ridiculous for what had to be done. Even after you went over and beyond would still not get raise
bad,"I fell into the trap of thinking that this was a good job. Under-staffed, poorly insulated so it was always way too hot, managers made you feel terrible and openly gossiped, literally works you to death (I actually was worked so hard that I had hurt my feet and couldn't walk to the train so I had to get picked up). They always had me work closing and I never could get hours that fitted my schedule. I ended up dreading each day I had to work because it was such an abusive and hostile environment, like it was suffocating you. I often felt like crying because the combination of hours, the heat, and the vitol from managers"
bad,"Working at Panera only made me a stronger candidate for other jobs. The management was really poor and the gym never paid anyone what she told them they were making. She also paid certain people she enjoyed more, more money."
bad,"Bad management, supervisors gossiping about other people. It's utter KAOS because they have no help for people who need it cause they're too busy on their phones."
bad,"Poor managers, treated associates very unfairly. Played favorites. Associates expected to do the work of multiple employees for low pay and very little benefits."
bad,"This company used to be amazing to work for. Once they got bought out by a franchise they went far down hill. They do not care about ANY employee. The managers and higher up only care about the bottom dollar. Don't like it? QUIT, or they will  just get rid of you. If you buy in to what they are selling you will stay on the good side for a while but eventually they will screw you over."
bad,"Manager is constantly annoyed and stressed out  for problems he largely creates and then he takes this out out on employees. Also, the management behaved inappropriately towards employees and was dishonest in his actions on several occasions, which was downplayed and not addressed by the regional manager when reported by staff."
bad,Worst service horrible management should be shut down so much drama in the work place management does whatever they want and NO ONE WORKS  people should go to work to work never to hang out
bad,"It's alright. The constant business helps get through the day. Management is horrible, one will tell you one thing, then another will tell you something different."
bad,The constant when say they're gonna try in help you But they never do. They constantly make promises that they never   Happen. In the GM is a total  Donkey and doesn't know how to talk to people
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"It's fast food. You'll have 3-5 managers above you. They will never communicate with each other. You'll hear the same info over and over. You'll make the same, bland sandwiches and salads, over and over, day in and day out. Very little chance for promotion, unless you are a yes man."
bad,Typical food/restaurant issues. Customers were always upset (because it's food) then this makes managers upset. Managers were awful. Co-workers were decent. Worst place I've ever worked.
bad,"Upper management does not listen to concerns of their employees. General Managers were not helpful in developing and learning to move up within company. Was worked sometimes 7 days a week, no work life balance. All they cared about was profit and not developing their associates."
bad,"There where not all bad days at Panera, but for the most part managers had favorites. I learned that you have to keep business and personal separate. The hardest part of the job would have been when the breakfast or lunch rush started, and the head manager was there and would start being rude out of frustration and never apologized once for it."
bad,This company does not like blacks and they don't like paying overtime.  I wasted my time at this company. Management yell at the employees and they don't train anyone.
bad,"I do not like this companys managers. It was not bad in the beginning but it feels so good to just openly and honestly say, the managers here SUCK and this job was not enjoyable."
bad,"The sanitation supervisor is a joke! He is rude, disgusting, disrespectful drunk! He thinks he can speak to people however he wants. A bit racist and sexist! Save ur time unless working in production!"
bad,Some of the rudest customers I have ever dealt with and the corporate policies are absurd. This place does not value the hard work done by SOME employees. The only okay part about it was being surrounded by coworkers who had your back and hated their life there just as much as you did.
bad,The Panera Bread establishment that I happened to work with had workers who regularly mocked the people of color who also worked at the establishment and were never told to stop or to be respectful by management despite the management being entirely aware of it. Very shameful and negative environment.
bad,"My very first job ever. Started good but became apparent very quickly  that unless you were a customer, you couldn't expect a lot of help. Because lack of experience and help my job performance dropped and so did my hours as a result. My least favorite job."
bad,They pay whites more than they do blacks. They actually over work the people who’ve been there for years. Their pay scale suck. They don’t do reviews on time. They are very racist.
bad,"Panera is a great franchise its just the company we were under was extremely unprofessional, they were horrible to employees. The company was Kind hospitality inside Skyharbor Airport"
bad,Cant speak for panera as a whole but as far as all the paneras near me and everyone who worka for them that i have met we were all treated lile garbage and underpaid. Not worth anyones time. Dont take a job at panera in knoxville tn unless you have no other options.
bad,"A pathetic company with an even more pathetic group of ""managers"" running it. I was lied to from the interview process right up until the end.No consistent, valuable training provided. no direction except to expect that you get it done. Absolutely no support or ""team"". environment. A group of veterans that expect someone walking in to understand what has taken them years to figure out , to expect that you know that in a month or two...and are surprised when you don't. People that have been in their positions too long and undoubtedly would not be able to survive anywhere else. Managers lead by keeping their employees in fear of losing their job.Bullying is rampant...I could go on but I think the point is clear...a horrible company with an even more horrible future."
bad,"NO hours, little pay, & terrible management, customers are very ungrateful, stressful environment, very unorganized work schedule, food is extremely expensive"
bad,"I hated this job. I would give it zero stars if I could. The management was terrible and they didn't treat me like a human. I don't think I talked to one employee who liked working there. I would only recommend this job to people I hated. I did everything they asked of me, was kind and respectful, and always on time, but my managers were still terrible to me. I always worked at least 30 mins late, but it was most of the time 45 min to an hour. Avoid this job at all costs."
bad,The managers and coworkers didn’t even know who I was and I was there a year and a half because they barely gave anyone any hours!! And hired around 13 people a week it was a horrible job!!!
bad,Managers are always buddy buddy with all the lazy people. They never cared to fix the problem. I learned production line of the drive thru. Closed and opened all by myself. Zone leader for drive thru.
bad,I worked at panera for 4 years and it wasn’t awful but I wouldnt go back. Management is bad. Food is over priced and underrated. Uniform is tacky and the insurance sucks.
bad,I was fired but I was very happy to leave the management did not care at all...I was under paid...the management would complain at the works but would not ever help on the floor...they would always stay in the office order food and laugh and talk all day when the rest of us would do work....
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,They were nice in the beginning and after a while they became very rude and greedy. They wouldnt give me days off when i asked and there was always a ton of drama. The managers are all very childish and immature.
bad,I would not every work at Panera again. They work you harder than you should and will not give you a good pay. Don’t expect a raise either. Had to leave because I was to worn out from working there.
bad,"Panera is a good place to work if you're still in highschool. It your of age they like to give you a hard time an cut your hours for there benefit."
bad,"It was very stressful and negative working at Panera. Everybody was nosey and messy, and the general manager was horrible and lazy. When people would call out other people with shifts had to do two or three jobs at once. If you closed there don't expect to leave at a decent hour. Most of the people that started originally are gone because of horrible management. Even some of the managers are gone now."
bad,"Working for Panera Bread was absolutely terrible and I would never recommend anyone to work there. Once we got under a new manager things went down hill really fast. The turn over rate was insane when I was there. Yes the food is amazing, but I would never work there again."
bad,"Panera definitely showed me all of the things to NOT look for in a work place. There were very few good experiences here. No room for growth, new idea, etc."
bad,"horrible place to work management never listen dirty stores "
bad,"always short staffed, at least one call out per day, super stressful to where nothing is prepared for the day, managers never helped on the line, managers showed favoritism & would ""lock themselves"" in the office and eat. empolyees were treated poorly"
bad,"It wasn't that bad in all honesty. But, being under paid at this kind of job makes everyone un easy of doing what they are supposed to do and expectancy too high. Management was very unprofessional and wouldn't follow up with simple things like breaks, and helping the employees enjoy the working time there."
bad,"I think that just because i am not rich ,and it is in a rich neiborgood .So they have to make people feel as though they are not good enough to even have a job there."
bad,"Awful place to work. They keep the ugly ones in the back, the only way to move up is if you ""fit the panera image"" a total joke, and a waste of time to anyone with a low ego."
bad,Job culture is far from their mission primarily driven by lack of support and development from senior management outside of the cafe. Work life balance is not recognized. Required to work 60+ hours with no compensation or appreciation
bad,"Lol Panerais the best. Loved it. Good people, good food, good everything. I cant compain. I wish they pid a little more but it wasn't that bad.if i had to do it, i'd go back."
bad,"I believe if I began filling this portion out I'd simply get too depressed (and/or) angry."
bad,already reviewed would not work here management is horrible. pay was all right but not worth putting up with the management and the snooty customers that come in there
bad,always rude to customers or staff. always gives everyone an attitude. managers never like to be bothered. managers are always rude to everyone its not fair
bad,panera really don't care about their employees they over work you with no appreciation little hours and most of the time you are bouncing like a ping pong ball from dishwasher to cashier to cleaning tables to prepping food
bad,"Everything was very quick paced, they expected you to memorize every recipe for every sandwich and salad within your first week, never leave work on time, managers were awful. On top of that, if you're a minor they will make you clock out at 11pm (legally minors can't work past this time in my state) and then they make you continue cleaning and finishing your duties, off the clock, and they don't let you leave until everything is spotless."
bad,Panera is a terrible place to work. The employees are rude and will constantly yell at you when you are packed with your own work. The managers do not care if you are yelled at for helping a customer instead of doing what the interrupting employee wants you to do right that second.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"The work was easy but constant. The staff is definitely underpaid and underappreciated. There were a lot of tasks and a strict dress code. I would not recommend working at Panera as a high school student because they are not flexible with hours or rescheduling or the demands of high school, especially at an understaffed location."
bad,"Out of every place I've worked this is the most horrible workplace ever! I worked my butt off every single day working circles around everyone, but then I got into a no-fault car accident down the street from the workplace and they fired me on the spot. So disrespectful!"
bad,"I trained 4 new employees before I overheard from a senior employee that I was supposed to not only receive training to do so first, but also a raise before I started training new staff. You'll work your section alone, even with multiple orders or guests, as soon as you show competence."
bad,This would be an okay job for a high school student.  It is not the type of place I would recommend for anyone looking for a solid place for a serious career.
bad,"They do not treat you with any quality of respect, you cannot call out, or you could get fired. The main manager will get highly angry at you very easily, the other four managers are more relaxed."
bad,the management was poor and had to work long hours. Had to use my personal car to get supplies. I had a hard time working with some of the people because they never had a job before and management kept quitting.
bad,I did NOT like this job other than for the cheap food. I could work a 9-7 and not get a break until 5. We were always understaff. I could work four different sections of the store at the same time.
bad,"A typical day at panera looked like workers talking bad about others behind their backs, secretively going on cell phones, and putting their job off on someone else. I learned not to ""make friends"" and to just focus on the customers. The managers were so rude and disrespectful. They acted like they knew everything even when they were in the wrong. They hardly gave raises unless the managers like you."
bad,"I work 68 hours a week as a part time employee. Not compensated fairly for amount of work done, rarely received a lunch. I would get cussed out by my higher up mangers in front of employee and customers."
bad,Working at Panera Bread was new to me not just the job but the area arpubd aslwell i lived in Anahiem for almost all my life so going to Los Almitos was new. Worked with alot of friendly people but the only bad thing i have to say is that it was very competitive.
bad,Always slow resulting in cut hours. Slim Chikens paid well but no hours given. Don’t. It’s a waste of time and your training. Ppl don’t go because the food is horrible.
bad,Poor management decisions leading to lower quality service. Regional management treats employees poorly. Corporate has done little to aid in the problem.
bad,"the managers like to make you feel bad, its a game they play, you are scheduled 6 days a week but only getting 4 hours a day. the managers think that you owe them your first born for giving you the privilege to work there."
bad,"Probably one of the worst places I have ever worked in my life. The management didn’t care about you, horrible hours and horrible pay. Probably the most stressful place you could work at, it was never worth it."
bad,They restaurant is very dirty. I'm surprised they are even still opened. There is dirty and all kinds of stuff under the table in the eating area..just gross
bad,"The company is fine, its the management that needs an adjustment, they put profits above all else.  Until it comes to personal relationships, thats when profits go out the door, because if you are a friend or related to a person in power you get special treatment"
bad,i worked very hard but as soon as another panera closed we got their employees reducing hours to 11 hours a week.It was a great place to work before our general manager changed.
bad,"management was poor, didn't care about employees, very harsh and unreasonable. A typical day was hectic and stressful. The best part of the job was working with my coworkers, but management made me leave. I had put up with enough of being degraded and treated as a lesser."
bad,they don't pay you enough an if your not one of there favorite you can't get the hours you want to work. management lacks the demeanor needed to be understanding an will slave you out
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"I don't know about other Panera's, but Panera Bread Ajax is a DISASTER. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND WORKING HERE. This is mainly due to management, which changes constantly, and gets worse each time it is changed. There were previous managers who were promoted, regardless of being probably the least trained employees in the store. They don't promote people who actually know what they are doing, they promote people who kiss up to management all the time. When I would request help from a shift supervisor, the response would be they do not know how to do that. If you are a manager, firstly, I should not have to ask you to help your team, thats your job to figure out. Secondly, I shouldn't be better trained than you, because then there's not really any point of you being there. When the store was extremely busy, managers were just sitting down, eating, or running around being useless. Worked shifts with only two employees in the store (including myself), managers still refused to do anything productive to help us, but would yell at us when we made one small mistake. I have never felt so belittled, demeaned and degraded then i did with Panera Bread Ajax management. There was no recognition for people who put in the most work, doing multiple jobs at once and covering shifts for other employees who couldn't be bothered to show up. .  Most staff members were nice, other than managers, but that doesn't make up for the bad treatment."
bad,"I was supposed to work in the chillicothe store instead they had me running all around columbus which I am not familiar with at all. Management was rude wanted me working for four hours off the clock everyday without pay, etc."
bad,"I was treated horribly. Never allowed to take breaks, called names by the management staff. I think they could do better and choose not to. They don't care about workers rights at all and the location I worked at should be shut down."
bad,"in the few months i worked there, i saw 3 different GMs and a total turnover of all over management. ridiculous number of corporate managers who did nothing but walk around and fire people. I saw maybe 5 corporate managers always together doing the job of 1 person. and none of them seemed to be able to be qualified for the job they had. They always cut labor down so low the minimum wage employees could not make food fast enough and customers were always angry. extremely mismanaged business."
bad,"The managers are never are on the same page, everything's a mess. Most of the people that I worked with were very self centered and wouldn't help others. It was always very tense because of the nasty attitude a lot of my coworkers had."
bad,Nepotism runs rampant.  The owners are so overwhelmed they make poor knee jerk decisions .  They accuse people of things without asking for explanations
bad,"I've worked for Panera for a year. Management is rude and uncaring. Rarely get help. Bakers never stick around long. They don't care if you are injured or sick, all they care about is the bake getting done. Pay sucks, very little room for growth. The cap pay for bakers is $18. Hours are constantly being cut for new hires, it's a struggle to make 40 hours a week and overtime is strictly forbidden. Management is constantly yelling at you to do extra cleaning on top of your assigned duties."
bad,The work isn't hard but the employees are lazy which makes your job harder than it needs to be. Management pushes there responsibilities for the store on its associates and there is no structure people call in all the time not even with notice or just not even show up for their shift.
bad,It was my first job and was a good way to get my feet wet in the workforce. Seniority was an issue there the people who were there before me had a much easier time and were given much more slack and never really seemed to pull their weight
bad,One of the managers here was absolutely awful. She had a personal vendetta against me it seemed and cussed at me while I was out front making a smoothie. I have worked at other places with some pretty bad management but this one takes the cake. My first few weeks I would have small questions and the same manager always gave me attitude. Other cashiers were nice. Finally got sick of it & quit & GM gave me attitude when I did saying I should’ve told him earlier. Awful management here and I won’t even come back in to eat. Lots of gossip between certain managers very childish and unprofessional behavior from 2 managers in particular. Others were nice but still would NEVER recommend working here.
bad,After being with the company for two years. I haven't moved up. I transferred at a location in PA and my hours went down by a lot. I'm just wondering how Panera bread expects us to be able to afford a living on only 12-15  hours a week! I'd like to see the CEO afford a living on 12-15 hours a week!
bad,"I opened the bakery most days at five in the morning. I was first a cashier then became head cashier and then shortly after became the associate trainer. My every day experience at Panera was stressful. I found myself doing things and filling in for the managers on issues they didn't find time for. The work environment is one that is less enjoyable than other jobs I had. I will say that I did enjoy training the new associates. They basically spent their first three days of training with me. I showed them the ends and outs of all the positions in the café. I was one of the only associates who was crossed trained in every area of the restaurant including line team member, dish, prep, dining room and my favorite baking pastries."
bad,"Panera is the worst company I have ever worked at, they have poor management. They work you overtime, they do not train properly. Panera was very busy, and very short staffed."
bad,The people i work with are great but the higher management throw anybody deep under the bus withoht hesitation for problems they have caused.i would not keep this job for a carreer
bad,"Demanded that I work extended shifts during 3rd shift because it didn't overlap with my school schedule, with no other explicit reason other than they wanted to and could force me to do so."
bad,"After Franchise Management Inc. (FMI) bought the Panera Bread Cafes in Ontario, the management went to drain. "
bad,Stressful conditions and low pay. Managers will not have your back with rude customers and will put the blame on you for anything wrong. Now they have an updated system but they are not treating employees fairly
bad,"St. Louis Bread Co has a great motto and ideas. But, between the poor management, the lack of being able to have a good hire capability, and the constant adding more work than what I was getting paid for was awful."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"The managers and the job itself is really bad, and they always blame me when it comes to cleaning the dishes, breaking the dishes and cleaning the dining room event though I did not do it."
bad,everyone hates there lives who work here. would never recommend anyone to work here. never got a raise after working there for 3 years. i constantly was being yelled at
bad,"If you enjoy working for a company that runs on playing favourites and cliques, then this is the place for you. If you want to advance your job and get pay raises you better be ready to shove your face as far up the manager's rear end as possible. If you haven't bent over and licked the floor enough, then don't expect anything in return - never mind if you've done the workload of four people because they keep hiring high school students that rather sit in the back dish area gossiping and rolling their eyes."
bad,"long time staff not welcoming to new comers.  Needed to use my own car, no allowance was made for lack of parking at delivery location.  If the car was ticketed, Panera would not pay for it. If parking took too long and you got back to the restaurant after what was considered too long, there were reprimands. I did not feel respected."
bad,"I just didnt like this place, once one of our managers got fired it all started going downhil. Our next manager left us to go somewhere better and then we got a new one that started pushing everyone away."
bad,not a bad place to work. short hours. good boss. good environment. easy hours. easy shifts. nice coworkers. great food. easy going policy. good for students.
bad,I wouldnt recomend people to work here if you are a hard worker they are not going to acknowledge it most people there are lazy and will not do a goood job because there is poor management people are so lazy the cafe is so dirty and nasty theres mold everywhere inside the drawers  i stop getting free food there too everyone crosscontaminate everything they clean the food area with the same bucket they clean the bathroom with
bad,"Working here was not good at all. I have seen other locations treated differently, but this specific location was awful. I was hired in as a prep cook, but ended up being just about everything but that. I was passed around from area to area without care like they didn't have a place for me. I get wanting people to be cross trained, but you're supposed to have a set position or two to work consistently, not a new one every day for no reason. They definitely played favorites and payed as low as they possibly could. They changed how everything was organized weekly so it was near impossible to find anything. It was a very poor experience at this particular location."
bad,"A typical day at work consists of making coffee, ever hour or before. Cleaning up the tables, cashier work & cook line sometimes. The managers are not friendly or respectful."
bad,Worse managment team ever. I would never recommend this job to anyone. Spare the embarrassment and move on. Knowing how bad manage are I would never tell some to work here in fact I regret it. I learned nothing from anyone here
bad,In my opinion I have nothing good to say about this place everything about it was extremely bad I I just don't have nothing else on nothing good to say about Panera
bad,Huge management issues. Don't know what they are doing and nothing is ever the same answer. They lie about everything from the pay to the schedule. Advice is stay away.
bad,"Thankless manager, constant people quitting, working hard not rewarded. Manager are not open to listening to any help will make you work overtime for those calling in sick and still unappreciated you."
bad,"In a typical day at Panera you will work at lest two different positions in a day. You don't know where you work until you show up, there's rotating schedules, favoritism, and chaotic."
bad,"it sucked. management were horrible. never knew what job you had going in that day. they cross trained you on everything and if you refused something your hours were taken away. Hours were very unstable. some weeks I got 5 hours some weeks i got 25. if you ask for a day off, they wont give it to you. the hiring process is a joke. you don't ever get breaks. if you do its either an hour into your shift or an hour before the end."
bad,Panera will hire you and use you and then throw you out with the trash. They will promise you advancement but then they will have you train a manager for the job that you deserve to have. Don't make the mistake of working for them.
bad,"They used to edit my time to prevent me from"
bad,"Panera is one of the most poorly managed companies I have ever been a part of. Incompetent and lazy managers followed by even more incompetent and entitled employees. On a daily basis the restaurant would run out of necessities like cups, plates, silverware, and food. FOOD; if anyone could actually believe it. Mainly because the managers cannot be bother enough to order a full inventory; nor can they make sure they have enough people staffed to make sure the food is prepped for that day, and the next. Save yourself the headache, don't apply to work here."
bad,"Poor management, no free food, used tricks to avoid offering health insurance, not a safe environment, opinions other than that of the company are shut down, does not respect religion."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,I don’t recommend anyone to work here. First off managers are horrible at communicating with employees. Secondly they don’t pay you what they should. Thirdly they have horrible customer service.
bad,"I enjoyed the job at first but quickly realized that the company itself is terrible. For the amount of works the associates and managers do, they are severely underpaid. There are no benefits to this job. It's a fast paced environment."
bad,"Do not work for any location owned by franchise management they do not treat their employees right. You will ve bullied for other peoples mistakes. Work anywhere else but here, new area manager is a creep and flirts with every girl and touchs you places where you dont wnt to be touched."
bad,"Managers make you change the labels of food without changing the actual product. Hostile workplace, consistently forcing employees to stay past their shift."
bad,I don't know how the company survives.  The lack of leadership and overall laziness creates a disgusting workplace mentally and physically.   A lot of wasted food and the nastiest place I have ever worked.  They used the same mop to clean the bathrooms and cooking area.  I couldn't even eat the free meal they offered every shift.  Its sad and should be illegal.
bad,Theres a bunch of discrimination and favoritism. Mangement team is horrible i dont know where they find them their pathetic. Overall i would not work here even if they begged me too.
bad,they do have a diverse workplace when it comes to hiring associates but there was alot of favoritism going on. Certain ethnic groups would randomly call in or request off and not be questioned for the inquiry yet minorities were denied similar requests
bad,"Constant lack of food for customers, poor management, stressful atmosphere to work. No understanding and common sense from management. Rudeness and irresponsibility."
bad,i wouldnt recommend working there to anyone awful customers awfull people especially the managers. Getting tired of trying to answer these with enough words
bad,"If you are looking for a job in the food industry do not pick Panera, all places have poor management with poor training and don't know how to do their jobs correctly or reasonably correct, most managers will become angry with you when backed up on orders when busy while they sit in their office and won't help you in any way possible and will come out and start getting angry and upset with the crew working during busy hours."
bad,"unprofessional, lack of character, unorganized, rude staff, not very sanitary, staff has poor attitudes, scheduling is poor, nonchalant workers and management as well."
bad,I am currently advised not to discuss my catering job with Panera Bread in either location in Florida.  It was with great sorrow and disappointment that I left the company.
bad,"the whole time I worked there was absolutely revolting the kitchen was always disgusting, I had to quit that job because after I asked NUMEROUS times for more hours my manager kept ""forgetting"" the shift leader there always talked to people in a demeaning tone and was very rude all the time (half of the reason why I quit). just a disgusting place"
bad,Panera was hands down one of the worst jobs I've ever worked at. Management was incredibly disrespectful and rude. The environment was always very stressful and unwelcoming.
bad,Unless you want to be worked by a dog and NEVER rewarded for it.. this is the place for you ! Management sucks & employeee ! You will stay stressed!!!
bad,I didnt mind working there! it was just the day time manger that made you not want to come into work and i was always stessing out if i was going to get payed or not
bad,Upper management was terrible and never around. GM I was under was a nightmare to work with or for. They run to many stores with no GM's and no leadership. do not recommend.
bad,"typical day at panera bread would be cashiering, cutting fresh bread with the slicer, I didn't learn much because the management was so horrible. not fun at all. Nothing was hard about this job. Most enjoyable part was seeing my niece."
bad,"I was 17 when i started working at Panera, and the managers had me working 40+ hours a week. While i was going to school. The head manager that hired me was verbaly abusive towards me, and in the end i walk off shift becuase i couldn't take it anymore."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"i was one of the hardest working employees there, i got a promotion within 6 months of working there. but once new management took over, it all went downhill from there. they promoted managers who were not ready for the advanced management roles they were put in, they constantly played favorites, and were very unprofessional, including fraternizing, or having intimate relationships with various employees."
bad,Managers took advantage of young college students' hours by forcing them to stay way longer than assigned. There was a great lack of understanding for these young workers as they have other obligations in life other than work. Many of us would be guilt tripped or ignored if we spoke up against it. Lack of vibrant culture for work crew.
bad,"Most stores won't let you even clean, will often treat you as a baby unable to do your job, and management is poor and communication is low. To try and get anything done is impossible, and idk why anyone would even eat here, let alone work here. You don't get paid enough to deal with half of what happens."
bad,Do not work here. Terrible management and terrible company with horrible wages and horrible work environment. I had a terrible time with this company and i regret ever working here
bad,"HI there! Trainers are on a power trip constantly and have their little prissy noses stuck up your butt. This Paneras managers are munipulative and underqualified and leave the store in the hands of mostly upset and loser like girls who are bossy and unsatified, if you want to be upset and work too much and never get days off, work at this store."
bad,"This was my first real job and it was absolutely horrible.  We were given no HR contact, managers consistently belittled us and refused to help.  The managers refused to give us raises for an entire year"
bad,"this compm,any does not care about your life they do not care if they cause you a issue for bring the load to you late. these people cause more of a headache to you then you start with"
bad,"Do not work at Panera. The company highly overworks its employees, ignores customer complaints and gives terrible hours in order to save money. On more than one occasion I found myself unable to work for almost an entire week at a time due to the management's unwillingness to schedule somebody who had taken two months off to recover from surgery. In addition, they never scheduled enough employees to work at the same time and were always perpetually understaffed."
bad,a work place where you can thrive and learn new things. I learned a lot of new things from working here. Developed more people skills. The schedule would change often.
bad,"Disorganized higher management, unable to hang on to supervisors and workers alike leading to a very cluttered and stressful environment. It was not that way when I started but I outlasted 3 GM's before calling it quits."
bad,"If you would like to hear the complete story then contact me until further notice upon why I left the restaurant, one couple unrelated to my my delivery lied about me talking to them when I was leaving a delivery."
bad,Bad Experience ! The workers are terrible! I suggest no one work here from my personal experience! !!!!!!!!!!'!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Hated it
bad,"No company can be ran correctly with poor leadership.  "
bad,"Food industry is generally not a glamorous career path but I believe Panera to be especially terrible, horrible hours, management, conditions, benefits and pay make for an overall negative experience."
bad,"This place is the WORST place to work. When I first got there everything was great, managers were nice and helpful but then everything started to shift. They don't care about your personal life, they rarely work around YOUR schedule and you're underpaid for all of your hard (emphasis on hard) work. Management will lie about moving up in the company and they don't care about your complaints... no matter how high up you complain. I hated working here, I'm glad I got out when I did. Now don't get me wrong some of the managers were great people (you know who you are) but a lot them were HORRIBLE! Don't apply here."
bad,"great place to work , friendly environment , no benfits but the food is good and we get a half off discount ,and free drinks management isnt that bad."
bad,"Panera has no reasonable concept of how much work and responsibilities one person can maintain. As prep they will give you an outrageous hourly expectations outlined for you that does not include lunch or breaks, and will actively encourage you to work through them just to get done on time. Panera has also ignored on more than one occasion the extra hours I would put in and instead pay me as if I did 8 or less when I would be doing 9 or 10 a day."
bad,This place is not fair at all. You work your butt off FOR $8.00 an hour at 18 years old. Not a fun place at all. Everyone is VERY judgmental. Screw that!
bad,"I've worked at 3 different Panera stores and I do not recommend working at Panera to ANYONE. It's an unfair job with too many workers and they can't give out hours. One day you're working 70+ and the next week you only have 20! There's no stability, and they CLAIM to care, but really they don't."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"Prepare the production line and stock up everything for the day."
bad,"Huge staff turn-over rate"
bad,It's just a line factory and instead of making cars you're making sandwiches which can be good but constant management over you make sure you don't eat the spinach
bad,"After working there for two months my hours were cut down dramatically. I've only been worked once a week for the past three weeks. I've also been sent home often due to poor scheduling. I'm about to start college in the fall,and I have to move to another city. The money I make there is not enough for me to be able to support myself."
bad,"I didn't like working at Panera bread, I was a delievery driver and when I applied it said you can make $12-$15/hour but when I got hired, they was paying me $8.50/hour and when I'm out driving its $6.50/hour, no $12-$15. Then they said you also get mileage and tips but there some days were you only get one or two deliveries, and you don't always receive a tip. Most of the time I was in the store cleaning and washing dishes. Which made the day go by so slow.  And I barely received hours, they had me as part-time but i applied for full-time, i only worked 4 hours a day, 2 days a week. It's definitely not a job where you can make a lot of money and support your family. It's more of a high school/college student job. Definitely not what i expected. Very disappointed. The only good thing was the coworkers were nice and the employee meal discount was nice, they have some really good food."
bad,"As a bakers assistant it was my job to pull all products that need to be prepped from the freezer and prep them for the bakers."
bad,Panera bread is terrible they do not offer good benefits and you get overworked for very little pay. the managers are not genuine and do not look out for the team
bad,Poor management doesn't care at all about their employees. Too much gossip and workplace drama. My first paid job and I was worked like a slave. Non-existent training program - I had to learn everything myself. Only stayed for 3 months until I got a much better job and left.
bad,I only worked for two weeks and the management at both places I was offered the job and found the communication to be unreliable and stressful. I would not advise working here .
bad,"The work is not what you are getting paid, The management is rude and unfair. The staff is miserable and its shows. Stressful work environment. Would recommend for only high school students."
bad,The management is horrible The service is horrible the food could be better especially the portioning and the cleanliness could be better as well i loved it there at a tine but management kept switch until they brought. A racise to manage the store
bad,"If you are ever as desperate as to look to work at a ""healthy"" fast food joint, think again, or look harder for a part-time position. While the employees here appear smiley and fun, the job is anything but. My managers were horrible at communication job responsibilities/protocol for work, the shifts were inconsistent and often shortened due to lack of business-- overall, another corporate nightmare."
bad,"HORRIBLE MANAGEMENT! only the employees that are favorites get promoted, they don't promote on how hard you work or how often you work. the hardest part is the management! the hourly employees shouldn't have to tell a manager how to do her job. The don't consider asking for time off a priority for you. They will schedule you anyways knowing you'll just have to call in."
bad,"Although pay is not minimum wage, the management in North Little Rock location was awful. Refused to change schedule as needed. Fellow employees were not friendly."
bad,"The job is easy.  Enter orders for entitled people. Cut bagels, refill pastries. Stand around and do nothing like your coworkers. Management is awful."
bad,Too much responsibility and not enough pay. The trainers don't even make $8.50/hr so that should tell you something. This job is a joke and the GM is rude and makes you feel like you are very disposable.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,I used to love working for panera I hate it now because I was a caring worker that got taken advantage for basically for being good at my job. I was in the process to becoming a shift supervisor but kept getting post poned. The management is super  scattered  and unprofessional. The turn over rate was worse then ever!
bad,Don't work here this place would drain everything in you the customers was the best thing about this job building a bond with them was awesome never work here
bad,"takes advantage of workers, management sucks. better be buddy buddy with the managers if you even want a good work shift. disrespectful and horrible co workers"
bad,"Working here in high school was what one would expect.  Panera is fast food, but the management treats it like fine dining.  Shift were tough for high school with the minimum shift lasting 7 hours."
bad,This is not a good place to work. The management sucks. They are stingy with giving you raises. DO NOT WORK HERE. The only good thing I can say about the job is I made some friends working here.
bad,"First job in high school and really enjoyed just working. Cleaning the bakery area and filling customer orders, also a barista. Management is what made me quit. I got accused of something when I was off for a week and decided after that, I would no longer work there."
bad,"Was not a fan of working for Panera. It was a different environment than what I am used to, I did not find any of it enjoyable or valuing. Will never return to food service."
bad,worked very hard served customers ran register stocked bakery very demanding job. management not very professional one walked out the other got fired.
bad,You have to be great with customers  and have a great attitude. Working here you have to be fast and tackle everything you have to do. Working here the management has to improve but coworkers where the best
bad,It was always busy. The customers were great but the managers were very rude for it to be my first job. They were not very understanding. Other employees kind of had a clique and were very shady.
bad,Management isn't trained to standards.Too much confusion. Never on the same page. Lack of knowledge. The hardest par of the job was the lack of teamwork
bad,managers where not nice. Never let you clock out on time but also did t pay you over time. Benifets and not even worth it since the food is so expensive anyways
bad,"such an awful workspace with extremely rude managers who have no filters and have no respect for their employees, they can do whatever they want and scream whenever us employees do a simple mistake. very awful place to work think four times before ever filling out that application."
bad,Working at Panera was bittersweet. They don't have the proper training to help associates prosper in the company. There's no type of leadership and no type of authority. Management is weak and doesn't tend to what should be important and that's the store and customers. Also they paid me under what I was working for.
bad,"Most tasks assigned to dining room associates are just unrealistic for one person. They are short staffed all the time and there are periods of little to no hours. Only supervisors eat for free. The proper equipment needed to work was always denied by corporate such as usable sweepers etc. Overall, for how over priced the food is this company has a long way to go as far as appreciating their employees."
bad,Dont even bother taking a driver position. Pay is low and they cut hours so your by yourself. Seems good but its the total opposite.32 cents a mile is a joke.
bad,They could not care less about their employees. No matter how many time you tell them your availability that will still schedule you when you can not work. They will treat you poorly and show zero respect for you. Would not recommend to an enemy let alone a friend.
bad,"A typical day at work was really hectic. i learned from this job, my first job, how to deal with people who are rude to you when youve done nothing wrong. There wasn't really a family like team, everyone just did theyre job and clocked out when their shift was over. The hardest part of the job was being there in general. The most enjoyable part was the lessons i took from it."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"This Company is a terrible company to work for. The hours suck, The pay sucks, and the higher management team sucks. I would not wish this position on anyone"
bad,"Management makes awful decisions, unwilling to listen to the opinions of employees understood to be ""under"" the management. Poor working conditions and shady managers."
bad,they will suck the life right out of you.  not enough workers.  always doing two jobs.  they don't give you 15 minute breaks.  the management thinks that the job should be your life too.
bad,Manager didn't care about the restaurant or the employees at all. Had another manager steal money from the register managers would only allow employees to work 45 minutes into a 5 hour shift then tell them to leave for no reason.
bad,Worked here for 3 months not only did I get no more then 8 hours in a week but the manager didn't even have the common decency to fire me. I had 2 weeks without being scheduled. I finally had to call and ask if I was fired instead of being informed.
bad,"There is a reason why this place has open interviews! Warning right there! Terrible hours, terrible managers that treat you like you are nothing. Do not work here"
bad,"This job was a great learning experience for me. I got to work in a restaurant setting and learned how to create amazing customer service. I got a feel for being a cashier/busgirl and waitress which gives me experience and background for future jobs. The team members and management were very unprofessional once I got the job. The other associates and some managers were always arguing and would talk badly about each other behind their backs. I remained to myself to avoid conflict and drama with others because of this and it made it hard to want to go to work with such a hectic environment. I still kept the job and tried to make things work without everyone else bothering me. Eventually one of the managers called me a dummy and that's when I decided to leave Panera because I wasn't comfortable anymore and I wasn't going to let myself be disrespected. They also didn't work with my schedule at all. While I was in high shcool and college, I was literally scheduled to be to work at the same time I was let out of class?! After talking to my managers about this several times they would never remember to rearrange my schedule."
bad,"This job was essentially a waste of time and made me vow to never work in the food industry ever again. I gained no skills, knowledge, or work ethic from this."
bad,very nice place to work at when you are first starting out. They have a great culture in the workplace and everyone is helpful                                      .
bad,I was involved with opening a new store so I feel that my experience was a lot different because of that.  It was not something that I was interested in staying long term.
bad,was never supervised wasn't trained properly. worked nights and when i started they didn't get me used to over nights. management was bad
bad,Terrible place to work. Stayed for 3 years and finally leaving. Company doesn't care about associates and the staff carries the managers on their backs while managers get all the praise. Save yourself the headache.
bad,this place in fairfield is very bad for driver ..its all nice and pretty wen u speak to the manger but reality is difrent once inside..if nu wan tto know the truth dont believ me but ask a driver in the road or sop a driver and ask they will tell u ..turn over is at its highest at this point cause they want to take driver as  fools
bad,You are expected to do a lot more than you job title and that is perfectly fine and i normally wouldn't complain about a job but when you constantly get passed up for advancement and train those who are advancing for the position they are advancing to its frustrating
bad,"I love panera bread but i will not recommend anyone to work there. The managers are rude and do not care about other people, if you have the position Prep, you will get no breaks at all. You have to call everyday to find out when you work. Horrible place!"
bad,Training wasn't that good. Management was awful and didn't care about employees. Didn't like going to work there at all.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,Nobody has any passion for their work. As a prep cook you will spend 75% of your time portioning out foods. The work is not challenging and the management is terrible. They often run out of supplies and do not treat their workers good.
bad,"They had me ""training"" with someone who wasn't a professional trainer. So I barely learned anything. They had me at a location I didn't apply for as well. Not the job for me. The manager rather text, instead of answering your calls. Very unprofessional."
bad,the management SUCKS! the restaurant is DIRTY and They had to bomb multiple times for fruit flies which is still a problem.
bad,I had a horrific experience at Panera. The management was abysmal and there was a problem with some of my coworkers selling illegal substances to other coworkers in the back. I reported them only to find out the manager was buying from them to. I noticed i wasn't treated very well after that.
bad,"I will never step foot into this place or any of the other stores. And also to NOT recommend this place if someone is needing/looking for a job. I got the interview went to orientation in Dallas (witch I was supposed to get paid for the time and drive according to ALL of the management even the GM). It has been over a month and I still have yet to receive my paycheck and also for taking a 133 mile drive reimbursement for the required orientation. A few days after not hearing from then on when I start training, they said the system messed up my application and that they will call me back in a few hours.... Umm..what???  I was already hired and they keep giving me the run around. I was so proud to work for a company like this....but after them wasting my time and money to make the drive for orientation, maybe they should have just said NO on hiring me, or skipped my application so I could have had a job sooner instead of wasting my time. Make sure you actually have the job before wasting time and money getting the things you need before you start here."
bad,I would not recommend this job to anybody. Co workers tend to be supportive of each other but management is absolutely terrible. Constant emotional abuse from supervisors as well as constantly being screwed over with scheduling and availability. If I could give it less than one star I would. Short staffed because nobody can stand to continue to work there so long hours with minimal breaks and unreliability.
bad,"This company hires management that will not help you, as well as employees who are incapable and refuse to do any sort of actual work. The compensation is sub par and the benefits are a joke. They do not take care of their employees and don't care about the ones who have been there for long periods of time. They are more concerned with hiring new people and making their cafes look as if they are competitive and somewhere special, when in reality they are nothing special. If you want to be respected and actually rewarded for working hard, do NOT work here."
bad,"This is by far the worst company I have ever worked for!  Horrible pay, no benefits at all, must work every holiday with no holiday pay, and if you hit over time they delete it or deduct a whole days work from your work week. Very crooked company. HR is only about covering Panera mistakes. Never received a single raise as promised.  They lie During the interview to get you in the door, but never give what they promised. (Bait and switch)  they will lower the amount of pay once your hired."
bad,"Being an ex-employee at the Altoona store, I will state first that I will never eat or work at another Panera Bread anywhere. The general manager is terrible and incompetent, period!! She would nit pick small things while the store was falling apart!!! She has young women as Managers in the store so she can bully them and have them as her slaves. One of the Managers really runs the store, while she sits back and nags. High turnover rate at store, because of conditions there!! The store is not run right, period!! The General Manager has no people skills, so she can be very abrasive. Some of the workers really care and give 100%, and the GM don't care!! You have to fight tooth and nail to get a raise, and new employees earn more than employees that have been there a year or more!!! Half of the Managers are very good people, the others manipulators!!! Avoid this job, unless you are very desperate!!!!"
bad,"I was hired by regional managers. Although I qualified for all but one minor thing to be an Assistant Manager, I was getting the pay of a manager but as an Associate. The location I worked for was congested and I believe I was let go because I did a better job of keeping the place clean than the GM. I feel he knew that I could easily have my job so he made up a frivolous reason to terminate me. Too many people micromanaging, too many people getting away with not doing their jobs. GM doesn't know anything and doesn't feel as if he has to do anything but hold a title. If you're not a size 0-5, you are considered ""not a good fit"" for the company... Which is the reason I was let go which was odd. I had a 90day review and I hadn't worked for the company 45 days. I feel that too many people have positions in leadership and don't have the proper training and are very easily intimidated by anyone who has more experience, cleans 10 times better than them...etc. This can be a great place to work when it's run by the right people!!"
bad,"Manager treated everyone like it was a popular contest. She had favorites, she took iver 10 hours out of my check. Corporate is pointless they just told her to pay me but she had a issue and wwanted to pick a fight. Told corporate and yet again was pointless. I was almost 5 months pregnant. She tried to get another coworker to trip me. And try to get another to pick a fight with me. I quit after that, a pregnant woman shouldn't be bullied at work smh...  this job is terrible to work for."
bad,"There was a GM that was a woman and she was okay, but then I new GM came along. He was the meanest person I have ever met. He only cared about his self and no one else. He never recognized anyone's hard work and always look at the wrong you do and never the right. Whenever he needs some one to cover a shift or save his but, he will try to be nice but when he doesn't need you, he treats you unfairly. Worse experience I've ever had. They are always understaffed, always yell at the associates every time something goes wrong. This companies values are horrible. They do not treat their workers right at all. And the pay sucks. You have to work at least 50 hours to get a decent paycheck. This definitely a temporary job."
bad,I really did not enjoy my stay here. I even took a pay decrease with Starbucks to get away from it. It is fast paced depending on the area but the company does not treat you as if you're a person more like a robot.
bad,Non-stop moving and muti-tasking. Having and maintaining good customer is #1. I feel as there is no advancement there.
bad,They hired me on as shift  supervisor never trained me for it a new company took over named covilli with lawsuits against the for being racisms they were understaffed cut hours down to nothing.
bad,"People call out without getting reprimanded, not enough people get scheduled, managers do not know how to manage situations."
bad,"I was working as a dining room person and as a barista for a long time and only got trained as a cashier maybe 5 times. I covered dishwasher whenever they needed someone. They hired a friend of mine from elementary school to work in the dining room and two weeks after she got hired, she got to train on the registers and got to do that full time. I busted my butt for so long to not get promoted to another job really sucked. The managers sucked, the kids who worked there were aweful, and it was a bad environment to work for."
bad,If you like working with teenagers this is the place for you and if you don't mind be discriminated against then good for you.I work there from the time the opened til 2003.Will I ever work there again never.Everybody was stuck up and there was no team work what so ever.I never got a raise ro respect.It felt like I was the runt of everybody there.WARNING WARNING WARNING do not work there you will regret it.
bad,"this job would be OK if they actually trained you and let you move up in the company, but they do not !!!! A day at work consists of lots of lazy people who just make messes and leave them day after day The management is horrible and im glad to be out of there. The hardest part of the job is dealing with lazy people. the most enjoyable part was when i quit!!!"
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"There was no unity or diversity. I am very self aware and hands on. If there is something that needs to get done I will take the initiative to make sure it is done, assuring nothing is out of place and the customers leave satisfied. Others felt as if I was stepping on their toes and were not pleased. I don't try to fit into a clique, my goal is to work as hard as I can while others participated in their own personal lives. However I can work well with others as long as we keep it professional based on a common ground."
bad," Provided healthcare to all patient that arrived in the department "
bad,"I will never step foot back into a Panera because the Victor, NY location Is racist A supervisor stated to another staff she keeps all the house n words in the back of the store and also downing employees"
bad,"A typical day at Panera was very stressful. I learned a lot about making food and drinks and the restaurant business. The management were all crazy and liars. The only good manager was KB! The co-workers were okay, they were never there long enough, the turnover rate is extremely high. The hardest part of the job was getting up at 5 am everyday and never leaving at your scheduled off time. Expect to usually get off 45 minutes to an hour after. I really enjoyed quite a few of the regular customers, very friendly and understanding. The pay is pretty terrible, they play favorites, and can be very discriminatory. I didn't get a raise until after 9 months of being there, then I mysteriously got fired the next week. The general manager is as rude as they come."
bad,I regret applying there and even working there. Would not go back to them if it was the last job on earth. was treated poorly and not payed well.
bad,"Overall i rated this very low for the reason the management did not care about you. I was worked 30-50 hours a week even when i requested a reduction in hours. Getting time off is practically impossible as if you request off on holidays to be with family you will not get it unless you schedule it a month plus in advance. Management team was very disrespectful and negative. Only one of the managers were kind and a good person. Co-workers all hated there jobs. I quit because they burned me out and were not willing to bend with my set school schedule. Pay was 8.50$ an hour however after several months you can get a raise of which was never awarded to me because management ""forgot"" after me repeatedly reminding them. "
bad,"The GM and the Assistant manager were always rude and very unhelpful. The hours were great and so was the pay, but extremely hard to move up in other places due to the managers. I had a miscarriage at work and had to argue with the assistant manager to go to the hospital."
bad,Demanding fast-paced work culture with little pay and no employee recognition. Highly demanding and the only draw is working with friendly people. This corporation is a money machine and nothing more. Often no breaks allowed.
bad,The company advocates as a family values company but resents when they are asked to accomodate one's family. Expects standards to be followed but are not realistic in follow through.
bad,"A typical day at Panera consists of upper management with little to know idea how to delegate procedures or organize a flowing deployment of associates for the day. You will be expected to do multiple things at once while doing it at a fast pace, on top of paying attention to details and expected to pick up others slack at all times. You will learn how to twist the truth and passive aggressively pawn all of your flaws and mistakes onto someone less fluent in ""tattling."" Co workers will constantly leave their work for others to finish knowing that upper management only grades you based on social status and amicability behind the scenes. The hardest part of the job is taking pride in your work day in and day out only to have others get the praise for your endeavors. The most enjoyable part of the job is that it's basically impossible to get fired, as the company is so deperate to keep employees in such a hostile and unguided work environment for more than a few weeks at a time."
bad,"Most of the time I worked on the line, this company had very bad management as well as employe's. There was no structure. People would do what ever they wanted."
bad,"Very bad company to work for, rude people, and very unprofessional service. Management was rude, don't go looking there for a job."
bad,The work environment is hostile and agressive. You are on your own for the majority of the shift. Once other staff arives they instantly start badgering you about your product and how well you did on the timeline and bake itself.
bad,They treat their employees like dirt as if they belong in the military. Managers would purposely be mean to ensure that the job was done as well as they didn't help the associates at all. It was a job that is all about the money and they could care less about the associates they have working for them who make the store operate.
bad,"Coming to work to provide people with  satisfactory order that they can enjoy, which will stimulate them to come back and eat again at a later time. It is our job to make sure that the customers are cared for while they wait for there food, we have a motto of 5 minutes door to door service."
bad,I don't like Panera Bread because they are very unreasonable.They are some very rude because they pick the wrong people to manage people.They fire you based on their feelings and not logic.
bad,"dealing with spoiled/ impatient customers "
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,Really Great Company to work for. I was forced to resign due to relocating. I really enjoyed the people and what the company stood for.
bad,its a joke. don't bother unless your in high school and need a first job. Don't do what there suppose to when the times are up. Like brewing fresh coffee like your suppose to. No training just thrown on the floor no idea what to do.
bad,"good food, horrible upper management, harassment.  Would be a great place for first time jobs if things were managed better."
bad,THIS PLACE IS A COMPLETE JOKE. asides from like 2 managers they other ones don't know what they are doing or are catty children who talk  about everyone. the people who work here are completely childish. everyday at work was the worse day ever. they go through so many employees because people just stop showing up because they would rather be poor than work at that hellhole. the customers who come there are also rude and unintelligent.
bad,The upper management was horrible. They don't care about there employee's . Everyone who worked there hatred to come to work and only came to work because they have families to take care of. After they switched management here it went all down hill.
bad,"I worked here for a couple of months, until I honestly couldn't take it anymore. My last day, it was the final straw. My manager took his headset off and THREW IT AT ME. He had severe anger issues and took it out on someone who had no control over the situation."
bad,Panera is a good place for younger people looking to just start and get experience in the workforce. If you plan on this being any type of career you are sorely mistaken. Panera is known for rampant drug use throughout all bakery cafes and an extremely high turnover rate.
bad,i worked over 50-60hr weeks grave yard shift they will use you up it you are a women they make you feel like you dont count do not work for them
bad,Stressful work environment. Skeptical management support. More concerned with ticket times then accuracy for some managers. Co-workers seem to care more about themselves then being a team player. Fast pace production and cashiering helps pass the time.
bad,"Great food, really bad employees. Management is unreliable, co-workers are catty. The benefits are the discounts on food, otherwise the food is extremely pricey, but somewhat worth it."
bad,Working here was my first experience as a working individual and it was also one of the worst experiences that i have ever had. Not only was management terrible but my coworkers were horrible also. there was always some type of drama in the work place and it was never handled maturely. i honestly learned who i was as a person and figured out that drama didn't mix well with my personality. I would never recommend anyone to work at that specific location if any of the people i used to work with are still there.
bad,Great Menu.  Very negative work environment.  Expects way to much for way little pay.  Upper management does not deal with issues.
bad,"Unrealistic expectations. Management was great but when word travels from corporate levels to the individual stores, changes aren't easily implemented."
bad,I was working full time and they were giving me part time hours and the bi-weekly check wasn't anything I would literally get $200 and was a waste of time.
bad,"it was always busy and never had enough people to work and I had to learn to be self sufficient and depend on me, not my work team. Management was horrible always the general manager was always  in the office. my co workers were ok , some were team players others were lazy a specific incident where I was  coming in at two to close and nothing was done, the shift before should have refilled green tea and lemonade and ice teas by the fountain drinks ice in the ice bucket. nothing was  done and I had a line of people there was time where I had to close bakery and back of house because not enough people wanted to come to work. the most enjoyable thing bout the job is when I didn't have to do others jobs and when others came to work."
bad,"I strove to learn every aspect of everyone's job. But when I asked to be afforded that opportunity when it opened up - I was denied, and the job would be given to a much younger new hire."
bad,Management is not that good. I went through six general managers within the almost eight years that I worked there and over fifteen assistant managers.
bad,Management including the GM are mean and unprofessional. The one near the airport has managers that enjoy yelling at other associates. The GM enjoy bullying other associates. Most customers are rich people who are rude. It's was a big mistake accepting the job here now I'm stuck. Watch out management will lie on you to save their own butt. Management talks about GM behind his/her back. All management is two - faced.  GM envies skinny girls.  All management needs to be let go before management brings panera down.
bad,They were always understaffed and they nearly forced people to work when they were sick and throwing up i did not approve
bad,The co workers are great but management will do what they can to hold you back from advancing in the company. I cant express the unfortunate incidences where I was lied to about how much I was making and how I would proceed in advancing in the company. Eventually I left the company because of the slow promotion process.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"A typical day at work would be okay, I wouldn't say I would enjoy it because the work place isn't well put together. Panera isn't very organized, nor is it a nice environment to work with. I learned that panera isn't really a good place to work for. Management... they lack communication A LOT!. Co - workers...they talk a lot of rudeness about the customers, they don't actually care for one another and they are just rude in general. The hardest past of the job would have been, when the co - workers would come in early and complain about everything and are always distractions to the bakers. The most  enjoyable part would be the part where it ended."
bad,"The franchise in Ranson, WV is a horrible place to work for!!  The company preaches to employees about promoting from within and promises positions that are never given.  They keep you on the line, paying minimal wages for maximum effort.  I was fired because I started speaking up about the bad conditions.  I was promised a management position, and was fired when I started inquiring about why I was doing the job of a manager but not being paid like one.  The general and district managers ignored me most of the time, and the district manager actually ran away from me when I confronted him about my promotion.  The turnover rate was horrible- sometimes there would only be 2 employees in the building with more than 3 months experience.  Call-offs were a regular occurrence.  There was never anyone to cover anybody's shifts, so there were always gaps in the staffing.  I usually did not get breaks, and I worked 10-12 hour shifts.  DO NOT WORK FOR THIS FRANCHISE!"
bad,"To start off a typical day, I walk in and hopefully don't get yelled at for another employee's mistake or absence.  Most employees, especially managers, are indifferent and openly hostile toward their coworkers.  Food safety, such as with nut allergens, is completely disregarded.  There are no portion tools for tree nuts on one of the salad lines on a daily basis; this is a severe health hazard, as cross contamination can kill and is regularly overlooked by both staff and management, if not every day, then every other day.  Schedules are printed no earlier than 8pm every Sunday night, before the next work week's schedule starts at 5am every Monday.  Yes, you read that correctly.  You MIGHT have 8 hours in advance to plan the rest of your week around work.  This is obviously a severe impairment for many employees, especially those with young children...we have a lot of those.  Some have left because of this.  Availability sheets are a lot like the rules on Who's Line is it Anyways: they're made up and don't matter.  The only time my availability sheet was abided by was when I got into an argument with my General Manager about it.  Having made her look foolish, she tried to pin the blame on me in front of the other staff.  Managers constantly escalate what should be routine conversations into arguments in front of other staff members and guests.  Managers will frequently put customers on hold in the hope that they will just hang up.  We consistently run out of everything (literally EVERYTHING) due to our Kitchen Manager and General Manager demonstrating an utter inability to communicate"
bad,"Crazy shifts, very long days, no sick time or vaca, pay is not worth it for all you have to do as a manager"
bad,i was the mornning opener had to prepare the bakery open up the line  trained new openers on how to open up the line as well as the store made sure that everything was set up before the doors open made sure that food temperatures were at the correct degrees
bad,dont work here the one in gaithersburg is the worst. the gm was awful and the assist. managers also suck. beware of assist. manager terry hes the worst person alive. DO NOT work at panera bread on frederick ave.
bad,"On a typical day at Panera Bread, I would make customers orders as the cashiers rang them in. I also assisted wherever i was need around the restaurant. Managers were switched around frequently which very much so affected the workplace."
bad,"An absolutely terrible place to work. Low pay, extremely toxic work environment and terrible management. Sometimes I would go home from work crying it was so bad. Save yourself the stress and apply somewhere else."
bad,I really don't have much to say about Panera Bread. Great company horrible place to work I was over worked and under paid
bad,No one got along in this place of work. The management was abusive to their workers and did not communicate with each other. My co-workers were not professional and talked about inappropriate things while in the work place. THe hardest part of this job was having management take advantage of you. The most enjoyable part was the small pay check because I really needed the money to help pay for school.
bad,Manager plays favorites and delegates her work to other managers to avoid doing it them shuffles blame on management staff when something goes wrong instead of taking responsibility for her mistakes.
bad,"•A typical day at work- Cutting the bread putting the food out for display. Cashing out "
bad,"Management was terrible, treated employees like animals. Accused employees of stealing. Never got out on time; always stayed either 30-60 minutes after scheduled shift was over. Did not understand that education came first."
bad,"great place, nice atmosphere. They donate food at the end of the night."
bad,"Low Pay,Hard Work,Terrible Management.Why do You think that this company is always hiring?Because of expansion?No because they are always losing employees due to their low pay, high expectation mentality"
bad,I baked at Panera for 3years. they worked there bakers like slaves often making them do 2-3 peoples work a night. they paid as little as they could and treated everyone that worked for them like dirt.
bad,"GM does illegal things like shave time off of employees time so they don't get OT and so his bonus is better. You tell his boss the DM and NOTHING gets done about it and he still has his job! No life work balance, pay sucks, and never enough employees working to support the amount of sales!"
bad,Seriously work anywhere else but here! The job itself is complete torture and the management is rude and wont hesitate to make you feel like disposable!
bad,"Used to be a fun place to work but has gone significantly downhill since bringing on a new management team in the last few years.  The hiring process makes absolutely no sense. Management terminates those that up while the employees with 0 work ethic were given less work and kept on while the rest of the employees were left to pick up the slack. Raises given sporadically due to management ""misplacing paperwork"" or given at the end of the busy seasons after hours were cut and months later than expected.   No time for breaks were given during shifts.  If you were busy from 3-10 pm, you stood on your feet for 7 hours and tried to get through your shift.  Management constantly complained about cutting costs, leaving the store understaffed and overworked.  You could forget about requesting off.  In the words of our general manager, ""It's a request, not a guarantee.""  Would not recommend!"
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"This place was just absolutely awful honestly. I never even had a set schedule. I would come in, they would tell me what day I worked, then as I was leaving for the day they would say ""I'll call you with your schedule in a day or two."" But a week or two would go by and I would hear NOTHING from them. The managers would just let the co-workers talk badly to each other, even if you brought up concerns to a manager, they would say they would look into it, but never did."
bad,I didn't feel that this was the best job for me and I had a great experience ONLY because of my co-workers. The managers took advantage of their authorities and the power that they held.
bad,dont bother wasting your time working for the franchise rolling dough.  they absolutely do not represent the corporate culture.
bad,Helped me better my customer service skills and taught me how to be more patient with customers
bad,"They are very racist and make fun of disable people who work there. They don't know how to manage their company they go threw employees like crazy and treat them like they are garbage . Horrible I will never recommend anyone to work there. I was supposed to get 2 raises never got them, they messed with my 401k and did this to quite a few others in the store."
bad,"never work here, demanding hours and not enough pay, over wrk their employees"
bad,"Poor management, manager has favoritism issues. After working for nearly two years I received a 5 cent raise after the first two months, then nothing since. I taught myself half the positions in the store because of the managements neglect to teach me anything else but the three positions I started in. I worked full time in the summer with little to no acknowledgement for my work efforts. Management moves only their favored employees up in the store regardless of their poor work experience and short time spent in the cafe. Workers, such as myself who have spent countless hours working hard and productively get no acknowledgement if they are not a favorite of the management team. Frequently ran out of essential products for the food sold in the cafe such as: salad lettuce, eggs, onions, tomatoes, Ect.. And even the soup because of poor productivity and decision making of the management team.  Not a good choice for a job."
bad,Horrible management that could care less that you're understaffed. burning all the food and blaming other workers for it
bad,A typical work day was making sure my area was clean and well kept while also keeping the lines short and attending to customers quickly.
bad,Quit because i got harassed and managers didn't do a thing.  They Did not pay be for the hours i worked.
bad,"DO NOT WORK FOR THIS PANERA. The management team is horrible and they treat their employees like degenerates and the pay is awful. Every employee that has left this location has complained about these things and corporate does nothing about it. Your hard work and efforts go unnoticed or rewarded. They pick ""favorites"" and only acknowledge them in company meetings. Management picks and chooses who get to use their employee discount and when. If you need help on a busy line they will stand there and watch while you struggle then reprimand you for any mistakes. they make young and new employees feel uncomfortable and most end up quitting. The distribution of hours is very unfair with the ""favorites"" getting most of the shifts and time. Some even had 50-60 hr. work weeks while others barely had 4 hrs. This location is nasty behind the scenes and I would never eat there or recommend for dining. Please head this review I a not just a disgruntled ex employee I am telling you the honest truth. You are not allowed to have a good time and enjoy the work environment. I would never work for this Panera again."
bad,Working here was horrible they were really racicts and I did not want to deal with that in a work enviroment
bad,"Just terrible. The WORST job and that's saying a lot since I'm a very patient woman. Terrible management, always breathing down your neck at every turned. Just getting a simple drink of water was difficult to do without getting yelled at. I worked while I was getting over the flu and I was just in the hospital the night before and they wouldn't send me home and said pick up the pace. I nearly got fired for my personal christian beliefs, which I said nothing while I was at work. They INVESTIGATED my facebook. Like what the heck is that? I quit before they fired me. I would never EVER work this company ever again. Not worth the terrible pay!"
bad,"-interacting with customers "
bad,"When I was hired the restaurants I worked at were franchise owned and the owner was an incredible individual. "
bad,"Typical weekend shift at Panera. I come in, go to the back prepare for work. Clock in and get started on my job. I learned how to make specialty drinks, hot and cold. My co-workers where very friendly and helpful to me when I needed help. A lot of the shift managers where stressed after we switched over to corporate. The hardest part of the job slicing the tomato basil bread, I could never sit it in the machine to get sliced correctly. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was when customers would come back to me and tell me how they loved the way their drink taste."
bad,"Where do I start... low pay, no benefits (none), unsafe working conditions, poor upper management, low moral, no room for advancement, no concern for employees outside of work."
bad,Managers had poor judgement in evaluating situations between associates and customers often leading to either party feeling disatisfied with the outcome of the situation
bad,"I was a night baker for Panera Bread.  I loved the job, it was easy, and the people I worked with were fun.  I hated working nights, and the management for the Wooster/Mansfield district was a joke.  He was the type of guy who never hesitated to ""pass the buck"", didn't care for his employees, and blew up on a regular basis when he didn't get things his way.  When I went to part time, he proceeded to try to intimidate me into quitting, screwed me over with my hours on several different occasions, continued to treat me like garbage, and asked me to stretch myself to cover more than one shift a night in more than one location.  He constantly contradicted himself, and wouldn't give me nights off even if he knew about them in advance.  On once occasion, I asked him for an evening off twice because I was having a procedure done at the doctor's office that day, but he refused to give me the night off.  When I called off that particular evening, he told me the next day that everyone was ""scrambling around"" trying to cover for me.  Working as an associate may be a different story, but being a night baker at Panera would probably be similar to some forms of medieval torture if the job had existed in the 16th century."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,Unorganized management. No solid sense of order in the work environment.
bad,The employers at my location does not care about the employees at all!!!!!! They hire their family members and give family members more hours than us US citizens. They punish you for returning to school by cutting your hours and not working with your school schedule. they make a new schedule every week then pencil you in on a day you were not supposed to report to work without your knowledge then punish you for not coming in. they constantly mess up your pay! This is the Washington DC H Street location! I DO NOT RECCOMMEND THIS JOB!!!!!
bad,"I will never work for this place again due to the fact, no matter who you are or how long you have been there, they like to play favorites. If they dont like someone, you can sure feel it."
bad,"Panera Bread is one of the worst places I have ever worked.  They constantly cheat you on everything.  They have you work when you can't (availability issues), work way past you leave time, and their procedures change so often for the worse you can't get your job done."
bad,Hate working here. raise once a year 0.10. Manager is rude disrespectful. If people only knew the condition there food was in we only clean when we knew health department was coming.
bad,"good job overall"
bad,"the managers are rude, customers are rude. the only thing I liked about this place was the other employees."
bad,I learned a lot about healthy and tasteful ways to enjoy food.
bad,"The managers there for the most part don't respect their employees. I have come in to work literally vomiting, because I was told that if I didn't find my own cover, I would be fired. I eventually was fired because I REQUESTED OFF two weeks before I had to do community service for my graduation project. The scheduling manager claimed that I didn't request off, when I got her to look in the book, she said ""ooohh! Well, you must of stuck this in here when I wasn't looking!"" When I then challenged her to check the cameras, she then got flustered, mumbled something unintelligible, and told me that If I didnt have a cover I would either have to show up for work, or be fired and, seeing as Id rather graduate from high school than work at Panera, I chose the latter. All of the employees were treated this way for the entire year that i worked there. It was also a disgusting work environment. The food is not prepared in the store as their advertising would lead you to think but instead, it is thawed out in already formed loaves of dough shipped from a factory and then baked in the store. Their food is much lower quality than it tastes, and they treat their employees like dogs. I will never ever spend a dime of my money there as long as I live. I learned working there that if there is a place that is always hiring, that means people are always quitting."
bad,"I worked there for 7 1/2 years. It took 5yrs to get a raise after having to contact human resources. Management is a joke. They allow employees to stand around play on their phones talk eat yell at eachother ect. I was once a supervisor but after the GM was fired they hired an outside GM that I previously worked with. The day he walked through the door he demoted me. He constantly harassed me and made my life miserable. After years of complaining about the new ""direction"" the store had taken the DM wrote ME up for putting down the management. I was once a valued employee who on many occasions was asked to be a manager. How does a company not only not care about their workers but treat them so badly?? Getting your correct pay is also a major issue. If you take vacation don't expect to get paid for it for MONTHS! The GM is so incompetent that he doesn't even bother putting your vacation hrs in when you need them. I could write a book about that place... If you are smart you would not even bother applying! My stress level was so bad I had panic attacks quite often. I had to walk away after years of hard work just to be happy again. That place sucked the life out of me. All the employees there are miserable but Waco has no jobs so they are stuck there waiting and praying for a new job. I'm so lucky to have found a better job!"
bad,Come in start my shift laugh with coworkers to make the day go easier until shift was over.
bad,Very hard work and little pay the rate of hire is always high because of the incredibly high turn over rate
bad,"A small Franchise of 7 Stores, thought they going to use my experience after i got hired as a Baker!"
bad,"Horrible benefits, you work horrible hours for bad pay. The management is rude and degrading. All they do is talk down to people and call people stupid."
bad,"I worked there for 6 months crew members were fun to work with. Management is a different story, they don't give any straight answer. Store manager follows the commands of her assistant manager, allowing her to fire people with out reason or cause. Lie to employees about what they expect from you. They change your hours you have already worked without informing the employee. Disrespect all employees by telling them that, I am the boss you shut your month and do what I say. The management forces their employees to do tasks that are managers tasks. This is the worst place to work for if you are looking for work."
bad,"Panera bread is somewhat of a disaster. The management is sloppy, management does the blame game to save themselves, and will fillet a worker to save their skin. It's embarrassing to work their and see how each worker starts the job with a open mind and learns to hate the job with a passion. Your coworkers are the only ones who help you through the day to day, as management will only criticize, not coach their employees. Having worked there for years, I remember what it was like when I first started, I remember being excited to go to work. Then like every other job, the balance of work becomes imbalanced. At first you are responsible for a few things, albeit important but a few. Then in years I saw how much worse it got. Eventually I was running shifts while managers were staying in the office. This job is terrible"
bad,"Worst job ever. Management was terrible, you get in trouble for everything. they need to learn how to care for there associates and how to treat them as well as become better managers."
bad,"My time at Panera Bread was where I needed to be at that moment in my life. I can't say I'd ever go back. I have learned that not everyone is going to appreciate you in a job, which was a valuable life lesson for me."
bad,"If you are older than 19 years of age, don't take this job. All management is 25 years and younger. Any problems you have will not be considered, will be laughed off by management. Disabilities and school schedules will not be taken into consideration."
bad,I just hated this company. One of the managers I had would take my personal life to work. Not cool.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,Learned how to make different types of food and sandwiched. Learned alot ab out the food services
bad,But they told me as a delivery driver I would make alot of tips that wasn't true an the pay by hour went down as a driver but in store I was 9.50 a hour because of experience but other employees start minimum wage now this store is a franchise not a corporate store so my checks were not correct always and they never fixed my checks. They told me I couldnt fix it basically sorry about that. iquit had no choice they kept messing up my checks.They got mad
bad,Your job security only lasted as long as the area manager lasted. Constant turnover and backstabbing with little to no support from upper management. Poor culture.
bad,"Panera seems like a great “culture” at first. Once you realize how over worked you are for the little pay you get, you’ll understand the one star review. I was promised a promotion multiple times, the reason I left my previous job was to get into the training department and that fell through. Excuses were always given and the upper management (district managers and up) does not care about you or your home life. They currently have a lawsuit against them for over working management and not paying them for it. Working at Panera was my worst life decision."
bad,"If you want to be overworked, underpaid, unappreciated this is the perfect job. They are always short staffed, under supplied, and people who hard workers end up picking up the slack of all the lazy workers."
bad,"if you ask for time off they will never give you it and when you ask for more hours they don’t care. they will hire new people instead of training you for the position you originally applied for. they do not care what’s going on in your personal life, especially if you’re a student."
bad,"at first the job was a lot of fun! i used to love to come to work. most customers are really nice and the employees are really nice to your face. however, when our best manager was moved to the strip everything went really down hill. the managers will talk behind your back with other associates no matter how good of a worker you are. the whole store is very cliquey and they will lie about you to make themselves look better. i have even been called disgusting names to my face by a manager. it is an awful working environment and i truly won’t miss it. they took me off the schedule and didn’t even call me about it, they expected me to come in myself. the panera bread in massillon has went extremely downhill and I’m highly disappointed with my experience there and how i was treated."
bad,"The manager plays games with scheduling and is constantly scheduling people for times she knows they can’t work, she denies lunch breaks to the adults as then doesn’t pay us for them, she assigns us to tasks we have never been trained for. She over schedules morning shift and under-schedules night shift so often that the closing manager has to close the restaurant on him own sometimes."
bad,"At this location specifically, the management is terrible. They don’t really care about you at all, and sometimes they trash talk behind your back to other associates. This job is not worth anyone’s time. They rarely help cashiers with long lines, they place unqualified workers in certain positions they were never trained for. The turnover is insane. One manager ruins the entire experience, and you’ll know who it is once    You talk to other associates ."
bad,"I can only speak to my time employed at my specific location, but I was ashamed to work there. I was disgusted by how lax management seemed about hygiene and quality control. None of the managers wanted to step up and do their jobs, trying to pawn manager related phone calls and customers off on non manager staff. The whole place was filthy. Almost every order went out wrong.."
bad,"They don't appreciate their workers at all. The managers are terrible, unequipped, and slack off because they are managers. The cleanliness needs work and workers need to be respected more"
bad,There's too many employees and it doesnt leave any room for the ones whom need hrs poor management. No team work or friendliness withinwiwiswithwould have
bad,"The Granada Hills location is in complete ruins. Do not suggest applying there until confirmation of a new general manager. Can’t wait to leave. Employees are overworked, understaffed, under appreciated and treated terribly by customers. PANERA presents itself as a restaurant when it actually runs as a fast food restaurant which causes a lot of customer anger towards workers as their expectations are rarely met."
bad,It was just bad. Manamagent cuts hours and shifts and expects twice the work to be done in half the time. Benefits are a joke. We stopped getting our tips. The company will remove your hours if you go overtime. They do anything to save money which is why shifts are 4 hours and you get sent home early. The partr[picpate in a scammy denotations thing. Overall it is a trash place. Coworkers are great though. Even though everyone is actively looking for a new job.
bad,"Poor scheduling practices with short notice not adhering to their own guide lines.  Not isolated to a single cafe, worked at 4 cafes and other managers (assistant mgrs) all experience the same.  "
bad,This was the most draining and stressful work place I have been apart of. There’s a problem with being understaffed and I understand why. Very unwelcoming environment.
bad,"I feel like I get paid too little for what I am responsible for. I also have to take care of other people's tasks when they can't complete theirs, but no one helps me when I have too much work for only myself to handle. Most employees in the cafe are teenagers who are lazy and just want to chitchat with each other all the time rather than working. Also, a 30 min break (unpaid) is way to short for being on my feet for 8-9 hours! Very physically demanding, and corporate people love to show up whenever they want to pressure and interfere crew members. My district/ regional manager is very rude. She has treated me and other crew members like we are low lives (but she seems to like those teenagers more than adult workers). I would not recommend anyone to work here unless you are young and have no large bills to pay."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"This location has some of the worst management at any job. Half the managers are high and don't care about you. This location is busy and makes the managers stressed out and they then stress out the employees. The gm here is something else, she's rude, pushy, and a little off. Pay is terrible, even with tips."
bad,"The managers at North Rock Road location were very biased. When we had managers from other stores, it was some of the best shifts I had. But the GM didn’t listen to employees and even told us we were replaceable, even though they’re always understaffed. 0/10. Work at another location. Empty promises for moving up, you will never move up there."
bad,"They don't treat people equally (even as all new hires) Management is rude, and short. Favoritism isn't cool but they don't hide it. You're supposed to read minds of people that aren't in the building while you work. When catering orders are off it's your fault. They make the bake station a mess so you get to start by cleaning up for them and end by cleaning up. They don't care if you get hurt, they just want the dough made so you can give them you're space. The job wasn't bad the human interaction was the worst part. ALL OF THE FOOD IS FROZEN ""FRESH"" and baked never actually freash."
bad,The pay rate is not enough for the amount of work people do. Also management put their favorites to easy positions. Benefits are absolutely horrible you get 50% off on just one meal on your shift and yes if you're not working that day you get no discount.
bad,"Panera Bread is a terrible company, they hire you as part time but work you full time like a dog.. the district manager is rude, disrespectful, and talks to people like they are little than her. And the manger don’t have no idea what she is doing started of with 50 people when she became a manager, went down to 20!!! and it’s the panera at THE ROLLING OAKS!!!!!!!! Don’t work there!!"
bad,I work for a franchise company that recently purchased my store. I'm very disappointed with the upper management and feel that they are uninterested and unresponsive. They unbelievably have no Human Resources department! Recently vacation benefit has been cut in half. There is much unrest and high turnover with management staff.
bad,"Management is crumbling. If you have a work ethic, you will be worked twice as hard as those who don’t for the same (or sometimes less) pay. It’s not worth it to sacrifice your mental health."
bad,"Working at Panera has sadly taken a toll on how I view working in the food industry, the Allen location specially. I have encountered several occasions of harassment and the overall unsafe feeling in my place of work. I regret every shift that I go in and am always disappointed in the lack of respect shown toward any of the employees."
bad,"This company is absolutely awful. I highly recommend you look for work elsewhere. I was an Assistant Manager for 4 months before I couldn’t take the abuse and favoritism anymore. The GM and other Assistant Manager did whatever they wanted and made sure their shifts were covered with the best associates, all other shifts were given the newest associates that weren’t the most  experienced and were slower. The area director was the same, she’d only help the GM and favor to all her needs. She never cared about anyone else."
bad,I worked very hard at the store across from Disneyland I liked the job a lot . And it felt like to me when management realized I can do the work they was trying to get  rid of me . For the benefits no one walked me through the paperwork I had to call someone  from the benefit company to help me to the paperwork then I realised it wasn’t worth it so didn’t get the benefits from Panera . Then when I was let go a letter can to my house saying how much money I paid for
bad,"New ownership has taken panera in the wrong direction. The new owners do not communcate with the stores regarding changes to system, procedures, pricing. They are only interested in increasing sales regardless of staffing shortages and training."
bad,"The following review is only for the Camillus,  NY store. My time employed for Panera was only at this location so all restaurants may not experience the same behaviors. Management is a buddy thing, some have no idea of what they are doing and desperately try to justisfy their unnecessary job.  They have spoiled their guest into to this ridiculous idea that they can do no wrong 'ever'. You will be spoken to as is you are of low intelligence."
bad,"I am a current employee at panera in nc its unfortunate to have so much gossip in this environment and to have the gossip begin and continue from your managers. Its unfortunate to be managed by managers you cannot trust when something is happening, thus your personal business os spread within 5 minutes...i will be resigning for 8.25 an hr. The stress cannot be worth it"
bad,"I worked at panera bread for 10 yrs I started at $7.75, I was trained in every position they had including management and catering, it took me all of my 10 yrs of working there and being trained in every position except gm to get paid $13,to only find out that they are hiring kids at $12 now with no experience and are telling me I’m paid to much. This company is poorly ran and they don’t appreciate their hard working associates. I would not recommend this job to anybody unless you want to bust your butt just to be under appreciated."
bad,"There's a general manager who determines who gets more hours, but is never around to see anyone's performance, if she is there it's just to inspect inventory and food. Its soo bad that the week I graduated I called the weekend off (Sat-Sun) --since graduation was on Saturday-- Which resulted in not being put on schedule for the WHOLE week! contacted the scheduling manager (Assistant GM) but she was MIA, not responding. I don't know why I continued to work there little longer after that, that should've been my last straw."
bad,"Management lies and alot of favoritism with employees. "
bad,Threw you into jobs you weren’t trained for. The store wasn’t always cleaned properly. Would ignore your asking of days off. Managers would lock themselves in their offices
bad,"I worked at Panera Bread in Waterloo, IA for around 2-3 months. In total I more than likely worked no more than 40 hours. For the first 2-4 weeks I got hours that I was extremely happy with, I was thoroughly enjoying working there, but after then I worked Saturday every week and that was it. Sometimes I’d work sunday too. My wage was $9.50 an hour so when you work one day a week for 4 1/2 hours your check isn’t going to pay for you basic needs. If you’re looking for a job to provide for yourself, do not work here. The situation I was in was absolutely ridiculous and I can’t express how frustrati and dissatisfying this was. In conclusion, take your shot if you choose, maybe you’ll have better luck than me, but heed my warning if your brough to this same place where you font have time to absorb trainingand learn the tasks of which you’re required to do."
bad,"General manager of Long Island City doesn’t care about workers, she is the reason people make the decision to quit. She has discriminated workers that start working for her and makes it very difficult for them to adapt, she takes advantage and isn’t a trustworthy person!"
bad,The only positive thing I can say about Panera is the flexibility other than management I loved working with my coworkers. But other than that the environment is very high school drama
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"Althought the people who fill Panera Bread are wonderful coworkers, management style is so unruly and uncoordinated that most things fell apart and each time a new manager was on the clock the entire routine had to change just to please them instead of the customers."
bad,"This job was stressful, low paying, and ultimately had a negative effect on my mental health, for the reasons I will describe in detail below."
bad,Managers are over worked under payed so everyone else has to pay for the fact that they are  miserable. A very unpleasant place to work. Never a team effort no one helps anyone and if they have to you get fired.
bad,I think Panera fits for teens as a first job. U can’t live off this. Been in this company for 10 years and I’ve never felt so belittled and unappreciated it’s ridiculous. There’s favoritism and retaliation so you can’t express how u fell without backlash
bad,Horrible place to work dont go there they not clean they mean attitude problems selfish non caring people rude nasty hateful people judgmental nonsense drama
bad,It gets weirdly busy there and can feel very stressful. There is a lot of side work to do throughout the day. It is just another restaurant that is connected to a huge corporation.
bad,"I wish I could speak differently but work live balance has been a major issue.  Doing work for them off the clock on days off , no compensation and having no family time is a major issue for me. raises are very hard to come by and management has complete disregard for their employees overall well being."
bad,Panera is only interested in workers who'll accept slave wages without benefits. Their owners are rich bigots who prey on the women who work for them.
bad,"no room to grow within the job, random hours even with a set availability, bad managers, too many employees (around 50 for a small facility), cut hours due to the excess employees."
bad,The management is simply atrocious. The scheduling was a gigantic pain and the management will bend your words and yell at you in front of your co-workers. Do yourself a favor and never work there.
bad,"I enjoyed my job for the first few months, we had a great manager and everything was fine. A couple months went by and the district manager forced our manager to move to another store who's general manager quit leaving us with managers that had to be hired quickly and whom did not have proper training. Everything was a mess. Our store went down in rank we lost regulars and it became a horrible place to work. everyone complained about the new managers (there were a few that actually did a good job) but overall 0/10 work experience I would never recommend this job to anyone else."
bad,No support from middle management. A very negative environment with little regard for advancement. Human Resources always  sided with employees in order to prevent legal action
bad,"At first Panera was a lovely place to work but, MOST, not all, management has to ruin it for me and lots of other people. They discriminate against most of their employees, and sometimes are even rude to the guests. I loved my job here at Panera, I loved my regulars, and I loved giving smiles on their faces. But why did ""The Man"" have to go and ruin it? I would get screamed at in my face all of the time. I was discouraged and it was hard for me to get out of bed most days to go to work when I knew what would happen. Everyday was torture. I'm disabled and they would throw it in my face by personally picking me out and nit-picking everything that I did. I could say so much about how I hate Panera as a whole, but overall I love it to. Only the people who work there and my job as a whole. But most of the managers need an attitude adjustment."
bad,"It was my first real job, and I quickly learned how poorly managed this location was.  None of the managers had proper communication skills with the worker's and the breaks were very short. There were many occasions were I'll running expo and taking care of the dining room at the same time during rush hours. That alone requires three people's attention but at times it was just me. The pay was very little and lied about my pay on my working papers."
bad,"The general manager at my location did not care about her employees. She made most employees dread coming to work. It was a stressful, hostile environment that I wouldn't recommend anyone to work in."
bad,"after 2 years, this place has never treated me with respect even though i've been told many times i'm one of their most valuable employees. Would not recommend if you're a hardworking individual who knows what they deserve."
bad,I’m really trying to get away from this job. Trying to get something new. Something I’m more interested in. The other associates are very nice. But the management is not good.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,Huge company and successful yet until when??? People see the outside and have no idea what is going on the inside from discrimination and harassment. Very high turn over due to lack of communication and training.
bad,"not that great. management was rude. i got fired for literally no reason. seriously, they gave me no reason as to why i was being fired. not sure what else to say"
bad,"worked here for over a year, have to beg for a review to get a ""raise"". Your work responsibilities are overwhelming because management does absolutely nothing but sit in the office. Customers yell when we sell out of things, managers have the staff handle them when it is no ones fault but management. mentally exhausting to work here and the stress is unbelievable. "
bad,"The managers had nasty attitudes. All the managers we’re rude, except for one.   Got written up for something that wasn’t even my fault. Working at panera just wasn’t good for my first experience for a job."
bad,If you are a sycophant at heart this is the company for you!  Over 10 years I watched the employees that do the worst jobs and the best sucking up tend to be promoted. Upper management's ability to see actual skill at a job is clouded by the sycophants jumping up and down to show them how well they did while their boss was watching. When the bosses aren't around those same butt kisser's run away to be on social media with no care for the business or the employees in the trenches trying to run the business without help.
bad,When I was working there the manager was embezzling from the company and I knew I wasn’t recieving my proper wages and shortlt after bringing it up I was fired with poor explenation
bad,Both horrible. Hourly pay rate is too low for the hard work you do for many hours. Management treats drivers as if the driver himself was a number and piece if machinery. No respect.
bad,"I loved my job there for a long time, but in the end, they drove away all of the associates. I was a manager, and with no associates to manage, I had to do every other person's job all the time. It was very stressful. On top of that, they refused to pay me more for the work I was doing, and they refused to promote me even though I did more work than the people above me (because they didn't want to pay me more) and in the end I realized I deserved much better than that. They do not care about their employees. They only care about numbers on a computer screen."
bad,"They treat their employees like dirt, their food is horrible, “fresh soup “means you pull it out of the freezer and let it thaw In a vat of boiling water. Don’t ever work for this company. Ever."
bad,"My experience with Panera Bread was undoubtedly an up and down experience. What I primarily did was make salads and sandwiches, sometimes make hot and cold drinks and very rarely expedite orders to a dining room person. Very simple things, nothing a high school student couldn't grasp. You have a monitor that tells you what ingredients go with the order and any relevant modifications so you really can't forget how to make a particular"
bad,"Wouldnt recommend working there as a delivery driver at all, trust me or youll learn the hard way. If somebody else messed up youll have to fix it and thats going back and forth for just 5 dollars an hr."
bad,I learned better customer service. I learned how to close a drawer as well as balance a drawer. I valued integrity and learned how to advocate for myself when I felt I was being treated less than.
bad,There is no room for growth as well as terrible management. People are always stressing about when they're going to work because we get our work schedules the day before the week starts.
bad,"The parkside panera in Pinellas Park is run like a day care. The management team is basically a joke. Employees hit their juuls in the back and get high before or during their shifts, you dont get penalized for anything and frankly its just a joke. The big bosses come in now and again and thats when everyone works, as soon as they leave its a daycare again."
bad,"By far, one of the worst jobs I have ever had. Management is awful, except for 1 person. If you are closing, expect to stay way past your shift. DO NOT WORK HERE."
bad,"This job was unpleasant, to say the least. Management didn't care about employees and regularly would complain about coworkers and other managers. Unrealistic expectations of employees given pay. The food itself was gross."
bad,Great employees but not a great management company. At Panera you don’t get the hours you want or the amount it’s picked at random and you can’t really choose. A lot of the times they schedule you out of your availability. Also there is no free food you have to pay with a discount that you can only use once.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,I started working at Panera Bread last April when I was 17. It’s a fast paced job and I always do what I’m asked. I always go the extra mile for them but they are a very disorganized company and they often take advantage of their workers.
bad,"It is basically fancy McDonald's that pays less than McDonald's. The customers can be well mannered, but they can also be incredibly rude to you for things that are out of your control. Management is rampant with favoritism. Do not expect raises or career advancement. This place will chew you up and spit you out."
bad,"this job is very hard for what you are paid. it is very stressful with almost no recognition, long hours, short staffed, and the management team doesn't care and will let almost anything slide."
bad,"a typical work day would be as stressful as can be when 1 or 2 people call off a day and you have to pick up the slack with no compensation."
bad,"Managers are required to work 45 hours and if you work fewer, you get a deduction on your paycheck. The schedule is never the same, so it is very hard to plan anything in advance for your social life. The store I'm at requires managers to work Saturdays and Sundays which leaves me with no time to spend with my husband and family. The store I am at has so many problems with the staff and the way issues are handled. I spoke to the person above my GM about the problems we are having and he basically said, ""That's just how that store is""."
bad,"Just unhappy place to work, little hours, no advancement, strict management, stressful, rude customers, no days paid off or sick days paid. horrible management."
bad,"I only started working here because it was close by, and they paid more than min. wage. At first it was cool but then it just gets really bad and really fast"
bad,"Every morning my boss would start my morning with a list of things that I'm doing wrong. I would ask for help to get better assistant managers on a regular basis. I was only asking for 1 great manager to assist me. Not a team. Just 1!!  I was told that would never happen. This was confusing because I had a ton of great managers come and go because I had trained, developed, and promoted them. Appalling that nobody could do that in return."
bad,"GM was a racist and incompetent (To a black employee scrubbing floors: ""if you dont clean faster imma whip you""). Strange considering the majority of his staff are people of color. Expect to get yelled at and belittled for any imperfection, good work is never noticed. Managers at my location played favorites with people regarding scheduling. They throw out perfectly good food every night instead of feeding the thousands of homeless in my city, or finding an organization that would."
bad,This company has a great concept loved working with their product and with my baking team. Upper management wanted things their way even if it went against company policy. Made it very hard to do the job . Also upper management has little or no experience with food safety laws . And view them as subject to change if it saved their bonuses.
bad,"Too much work for not enough pay. You can’t even wear a jacket when it’s cold and the heat is broken. Ever since delivery took off, the line associates drown in double the orders from before with no raise and no extra help. The cap off pay is 9.25 with no benefits unless you become a manager. Even then, you get a $00.25 raise. If you’re going to work for Panera, work at a corporate store."
bad,"They demand a lot out of you. Management was always a big issue and from what I heard, continues to be an issue. Only managers received benefits but some were flooded with so much responsibility, it just wasn't worth it. They constantly hired more workers when there were already dedicated workers who needed full time hours, so all low ranking workers only received part times hours. It was ridiculous."
bad,Management was awful and pay was even worse. All of the managers there are all rude and don't even treat you like a person. Way too over staffed barely any hours. Staff is always nice to customers but to each others it is a battle. They will put you onto a job that you are not even trained for and send you to the other store without asking you. Every break you have is not payed and unless you're a minor you will probably not get a break. I 100% do not suggest that you work here.
bad,"Panera is a very fast paced place. The duties were not hard, but the management team made working there awful. I would never work at Panera again. Managers had no respect for employees or the work environment."
bad,"Low pay, no ability to advance. Dead-end job. Typical day at work was boring and stressful, hard on the body and hard on the mind. The management is horrible."
bad,"Management was not on the same page on any given day. Promises for advancement and never happened. I would not recommend anyone to work for Panera, especially after they were acquired from Manna."
bad,terrible management. double standards for different employees. management did nothing to help their associates even after having a sit down meeting to discuss how they could be of more assistance.
bad,The entire company has issues all around. Pay is not worth the work they make you do. Make you feel like you aren't a part of the team and treat you with disrespect. Any family or medical issues aren't good enough excuses to miss a day or 2 in a work year.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,Management lacked basic communication skills. Employees lacked maturity and understanding of other's circumstances. Three of the five managers made an attempt to help me through what I was going through. Other than that the majority of the employees were self centered and didn't work well as a team without bickering.
bad,It is a highly stressful job which makes it very difficult to create a great culture for the associates. The upper management are doing this that create a most difficult situation. I have been doing this kind of work for over 30 yrs and I haven't seen anything like this before. We are the catering hub for the Memphis market and Panrea corporate standard is if your catering order is over a certain $ amount then we must have a 24-48 hr advance notice. But we don't adhere to that standard. Because we bake breads Daily and receive that daily along with produce then we can only order for what we have on the books along wit estimated café sales. This puts pressure on our café in turns this causes employees to be fustraited and causes regular everyday customer's which are are soild base not be satisfied which make for a very long hard day everyday
bad,"Managers are terrible. They never hold people accountable for anything. Its pretty much free reign at my location. Associates AND supervisors eat on the production line, I have seen management and employees make food with out gloves on. Place is disgusting. The hardest part of the day would be running out of absolutely everything and having to get yelled at by the customers because the food manager doesnt know how to order correctly. I would never come back. You practically have to beg for a raise here, doesnt matter how long youve been with the company."
bad,"They did get the work done messed on orders and rude to employees , the didn't work with their employees, they were unprofessional at work . Not for newer employees didn't give newer employees a chance"
bad,"Managers treat employees like trash, sometimes in private, sometimes in front of customers. The pay isn't worth the hours they'll try to work you for. "
bad,"When I applied, I was under the impression that I was going to have full-time hours, benefits, etc. after I completed their very lacking training program, but I ended up working a max of 15-20 hours a week. I didn't get to take one break in the whole two months I worked there, and most of the time I was so busy throughout my whole shift that I couldn't even go to the bathroom. I'm a very hard worker and I pride myself in that, but the amount of work I was expected to complete in my shift was completely impossible no matter how hard I tried, and I wasn't allowed to leave until it was finished even if my scheduled shift was over. Eventually I got really discouraged because I always felt like I wasn't doing enough to make management happy, and I broke down and just stopped going."
bad,"I was a reliable worker which is hard to come by in that company which led them to use my generosity and care for my coworkers to ultimately hurt me. The management was never in sync with another and for the job you do the pay is not at all worth it. You're able to make great friends. The place is pretty much run by young adults and the staff is mostly teenagers. With that said, I wouldn't recommend working there to anyone."
bad,More for like highschool students or regular workers to do something in spare time. Was way overqualified for job just took for time being and didn't even last longer than month.
bad,"bad work atmosphere, bad communicate and bad scheduling, managers doesn't know how to respect assoicates and how to talk to them."
bad,My experience was not too bad with panera. However room to advance and scheduling was a huge conflict . Not very friendly management and lazy co-workers.
bad,Very little pay. Very little help. Too much required for pay. Hours got cut almost in half.  High chance of getting sent home early
bad,Managers care for speed of service more than they care for their associates breaks.. They care for associates to be on time to clock in but they don't care to get you out on time..Your schedule is written in rock when it is in there benefit..They also have favoritism..
bad,"I used to work at the Panera on upper peach street and hated it. I was a cashier and the managers treated me horribly. The other cashiers (my age, also teenagers) hated it too and all eventually quit. They were mean to their employees and their customers. When I started working at Panera I thought I was simply a cashier, but I was completely wrong. They had me as a cashier scrubbing the floors, stocking, staying many hours after my shift ended, and calling employees in when we were short staffed (doing their job). As a teen I was suppoused to only work a max of 8 hour shifts by law but ended up working 9 or 10 hour shifts. If I tried to call off the managers would throw a fissy and force you to come in under any condition. I called off once and tried to call off a second time and they said I had to come in or I was suspended, even though I was stuck in a major snow storm 30 minutes away and had only previously called off once. If you are thinking about working at Panera on upper peach, don't it was horrible. However, I am only speaking for this specific Panera (keystone dr) and do not know how the other 3 Paneras in Erie operate."
bad,"I worked 60 hours a week and was generally regarded as not showing up enough. Our district manager was ineffective, offered no support, and immediately blamed us for any shortcomings."
bad,Panera really doesn't care about its workers. They offer little advancement and no raises for skills acquired (but you get a pin to put on your hat/apron). My original manager was fired for having an affair with an employee and was also suspect to stealing from the company. All in all I worked there from when it opened and stayed for about a year. I hated every moment of it.
bad,"The typical work day involves cleaning up after rude customers and badgering from managers. If closing is in your shift, expect to be stuck way after you finish your job to pick up the slack of those who don't do theirs. getting your shift covered is impossible most times. I learned that getting equipment fixed never happens and using broken, jerryrigged tools and machines is common-place. "
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"I worked for the Covelli Panera for 9 months. I was always on time and in uniform, respected authority, did my job, did other people's jobs, etc."
bad,This place was a horrible place to work! They people and manager were extremely mean! This was my first job and they made me feel stupid because I did not catch on to things right away. They don't have very good training.
bad,The job is definitely geared towards High school students. There is a glass ceiling above you pretty much from day one. Was tough work for little pay. If you are offered a raise get it in writing first. They tend to not give you what was promised.
bad,I have nothing nice to say about working for this company. The food is good if you live in a small town where small businesses fail. This job will not give you health insurance if they can help it; and when they do its worse than the most bare minimum plan.
bad,"Prepare for dinner rush"
bad,This is a great place to dine at but working here isn't what it's all cracked up to be. If you notice that have a negative hashtag in the social media world called #paneraproblems which means that the world is knowing about the bad things vs the good
bad,"Not nearly enough money for all of the stuff you have to deal with. I am no stranger to hard work, but the overall morale of the location stunk, and it was exhausting."
bad,"This has to be the worst job I've ever had. My two managers, the trainer and his boss, are roommates, so if there is a problem or complaint about one or the other nothing gets done about it and the same issues continue to occur. My two managers also like to talk about female coworkers and employees and brag about either taking them home, trying to take them home, or just flat out lie about sleeping with them, this also includes the teenage day shift girls as well. There is a no fraternization policy at Panera but my two managers have asked me out for drinks on multiple occasions as well as a couple of my associates. Management is so unprofessional that the bakery manager will call the newer bakers instead of the lead baker because he doesn't want to talk to her. Training is minimal, a few guys have literally had 1 day of training and was sent to a new store with 3 times the usual bake. Also if the bakery manager makes a mistake on the schedule, or anything for that matter, he will blame it on an employee instead of fixing it or admitting to it. A few times bakers have been left alone overnight because no one else was on the schedule and the bakery manager decided to ""stay out and drink"" instead of coming in to help even though he knew the situation. The bakery manager has cursed out two of my associates, constantly says he doesn't need us and neither does Panera causing more than 6 associates to quit within the short amount of time I've been here. From my understanding this has been going on for years now, about three, because everyone decides to quit instead of speak up, I"
bad,A typical day at work is getting screamed at by management and customers. Management is HORRIBLE. Your coworkers are what make your shift pass by.
bad,"There's 3 groups of people working here. The first group  2or 3 workers work like production sites. The second one is the majority and they just do enough to keep their position, and the 3rd one are the managers that eat the whole day and don't do anything. Managers treat people with no respect even if you were old enough to be  their parent. Co workers are nice, just a lot of kids, and the good thing is that they work around your schedule."
bad,"Panera Bread was a fun great environment at the time i started as time went by i came across things that bothered me, i typically opened 5days a week at 530 am. The other associate meembers made the day fun once they arrived, most management was not as supportive as led on to be i enjoyed the schedule it was nice to be offf by 130 everyday"
bad,"Greedy company that offers low pay and no meals despite vast profit margins due to cheap foods sold for high prices, You receive no hours. & management is VERY rude."
bad,"I worked for Panera bread as a baker but did not like the night shifts so I stopped working for them, they said they would pay me the money owed (for 64.5 hours of work), 5 weeks went by of continuous contact and phone calls to head office and the district manager trying to get my money... I had to file a complaint with the Labour Board before finally getting some attention!!!! Even then, the lady in the payroll department was rude and disgusting to deal with!!! I am glad I filed that claim because hopefully they will get fined!!! I still have not received my cheque but at least the labour board has contacted me and guaranteed me that one way or another I will get my money - and if Panera does not pay it willingly they will be compelled by law!!! This is an afull company to work for that does not value its employees and breaks the law by not paying them for months at a time!!!!! TERRIBLE!!!!!"
bad,Panera Bread is a great company for the community. They say one thing and do another thing. They are not consistent with their Culture and Values. Job Security and Advancement are a joke. GM's are locked into a GM role for 5 years. So moving up is not as fast a other companies. I would not recommend working for Panera Bread as an associate or manager.
bad,The only thing good about this place was that people actually thought you worked in a decent place.
bad,The pay for management was above average however you have to work a lot of hours... there is NO quality of life with this company! The supervisors were pointless and not effective!
bad,"In my time, back to back overtime was regular if not demanded. Not in part to keep up with work demand but to machinery almost constantly breaking down with hours long delays or truck drivers arriving late due to difficulties, only to pick up where left off regardless of how much time has passed. Unreasonable understanding as it relates to its management and at times dismissive to the staffs overall health. Unless changes have been implemented since my leaving. I can't say you'll enjoy working as a floor staff."
bad,"Not recommended unless you're super desperate, which I was. Clear favoritism towards certain employees in terms of general treatment, pay, and scheduling. Schedule varied wildly depending on the week, and also wasn't released until the day before the week started, making it hard to plan anything. Corporate policies were also often nonsensical."
bad,"absolutely horrible. they treat you terrible and schedule you on days you tell them you cannot work or they don’t schedule you at all. management was the worst part of this job. i was there for 9 months and they did not ever teach me how to work on line, drive thru, or register. will never work at any panera ever again."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,Don’t work at a Panera that is owned and operated by Covelli Enterprises they pay terribly and give you no support. Ex took over store with like 10 associates got it back to running as a restaurant should and then get told we are going to demote you.  SMH
bad,"Poor management all the way up to the top"
bad,Most mangers don't care... They have no push... The don't respect each other as mangers... So they don't respect the employees.. It's stressful as an employee... I would not want to become a manager
bad,Managers had unfair treatment of employees. Gave only raises to some when promised to more. Broke company policies to get more money for the company. I ended up quitting because I couldn't stand by and watch my managers break the rules anymore.
bad,"No matter what you say to the managers you’re always gonna be wrong and no problems are gonna be solved unless it involves saving their own backs. The managers there are inappropriate, will lie to you, and have favoritism. Something needs to be done"
bad,"There was a rumor that I would get a different job (I wanted 2 jobs to pay the bills) from another employee. So the manager assumed I quit and didnt schedule me for a whole week, even though i hadn't mentioned anything to her."
bad,"Just don't work there. I was treated poorly at this job. Management was rude, minus one shift manager. Upper management was terrible. General Manager was nice at least, though! No benefits whatsoever or you paid overpriced after working a lot of hours, which hours are barely ever offered. Over priced food for low quality products. Low pay and rarely room for promotions."
bad,"Working at Panera was fun especially when you’ve made many friends but the company itself and the way they treat their employees at times is unacceptable. I became a manger here and honestly they don’t care about when you need a day off, they always hand you work, and when your busting your butt they don’t give you the raise you need even though every 6 months you were “supposed to get a raise”. The district manager was also very rude when she presbts herself and as soon as you put your 2 week they come racing to you with a raise."
bad,I had to quit because they wouldn’t let me go to college and there were no advancements or raises. The location I worked at was very sexist.I would not recommend anyone to work there. Its kinda funny how there turn over rate is so high.
bad,"Panera is not a bad first job for teenagers. They allow you to gain work experience and have a bit of fun for a while, but if you’re looking to be paid well for the amount of work you do, this is definitely not the place. The managers make decisions based on petty feelings instead of who deserves it, and they talk badly about you behind your back. This is not a professional work environment and management is a joke.."
bad,"You’ll get paid great if you’re a guy no experience needed but if you’re a girl even with tons of experience you get paid trash. Regardless of your work ethic, don’t waste your time"
bad,"I went from cafe to baker. The company is so understaffed that you WILL be called in on your day off. IF YOU SAY YES, then you're in the cult. You'll be paid well, but will never have time to use it. If you say no, they will penalize you for not ""being a team player"". Please remember that your health is more important than your job because Panera will overwork the good ones and leave the lack-luster workers with immunity"
bad,"After resigning due to the hostile work environment that is allowed and ignored by management, I tried to return my keys in person however I was told I was bot allowed in the building! They had me leave they keys to the store outside the back door! Putting their employees safety at risk! Absolutely unprofessional! They do not follow food safety standards as laid out in corporate guidelines and when brought to upper management you are blown off and told that they are not interested in changing their practices and that I was nit picking. Cheating customers out of the portions they pay for because they refused to weigh out the portions like expected."
bad,I got fired do to a no call no show which was not true because I talked to a manger and he didn’t tell the store manager anything so she called me and said “I don’t need people like you in my team” I took that very offensive and I will be calling corporate! The manager asked what you feel most comfortable working on I said cashier but instead she put me in sandwiches which I did not know how to do.
bad,"Management is absolutely clueless, and will take advantage of you the moment you appear to be a reliable employee. Nearing the end of my time there, I was scheduled for multiple positions a day, and never got proper training for any of the new positions."
bad,"The owners hire people"
bad,"Do not work here!! I can't speak for every location, but this was a terrible place to work. No breaks and you had to work at three different locations"
bad,If you inspired to live as second class citizen or work somewhere for 10 more years just to make $15In my opinion the pay is horrible. You can’t live independently making $13 an hour.They will tell you that they value you as an employee but your paychecks Says they don’t care
bad,The managers are legit •••hats. My sister died of end stage neuroblastoma and they made me work instead of being at her funeral. Exit 5 treat their employees WAY better than Colony Place. The older man who is one of the managers should be looked into for pushing illegal work hours on employees. Don’t do it because it literally caused me to have to go to McLean psychiatric unit.
bad,"You're expected to meet certain timing standards when you're the only one there (or if more than just you, they're still short the right number of people).  Newer managers don't always know what to do or how to handle things, and are more involved with being in the office or talking among themselves than helping the crew. Certain employees are given free reign to run the place and boss others around, or have bad attitudes and drive off new employees but no one will say anything to them. Can't talk to the managers to make them see what's going on because they think certain employees walk on water. A lot of people call off or don't put forth the effort because they know nothing will be done about it."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"I would say they work well with family and life. The discount is great."
bad,"This was a terrible place to work. They barely train you on what you will actually be doing and get an attitude with you when you make mistakes. I spent so much time training on dining room when I was assigned to cashier! I spent one day on dining room, which apparently is required and not a big deal, but I received little to no training on the register. I started in the summer and was reassured that when my high school started back up I could change my availability. On my first day of school I received my schedule (my school never releases students' schedules before the first day) I informed them of my availability and they got an attitude with me and thought I lied about my school's policy (I know this because my coworker/classmate told me). The workplace was just a bunch of cliques that did not welcome me or the other new hires. People who were working there for a long time often complained they expressed interest in other areas of work, but the managers only listened to their favorites. Overall terrible place to work."
bad,"No call No show No Problem--- You still had a job. The management would not enforce any rules. Some people would run all over their ""co- workers"" thinking their job was more important than the others. If someone stood up for themselves they were looked at as the bad guy. If someone was not performing the manager would jump in and do their job and not tell them that they needed to step it up!!  So if you are looking for a place where you are not expected to perform and you only want to be a ""body"" in the kitchen. This is the place for you."
bad,"Panera Bread was one of the worst companies I've ever worked for. The only thing they care about is hitting their numbers, and they do not offer any help for their stores to reach those numbers. They expect their GMs to be able to figure it out, and if not then they get replaced. There is no job security. I was placed in a store that was over an hour drive from my home with no compensation. They did not  honor promises made. The training I received to prepare me for the job was sub-par. I was with a ""trainer"" my first day on learning salads, and that was it- I was on my own after that. I was hired into a management position and received very little coaching. How do they expect their managers to be able to perform to expectations if they do not spend the time to teach what their expectations are? "
bad,why it is a ok job because of the people that work there make it fun but the pay is no good. the manager are easy to get a long with but the it to far out for the Richmond area.
bad,"Worst job I’ve ever had. The manager would yell at me every morning about my shoes when they were non slip shoes, he was grumpy everyday and looked annoyed. Most annoying place to work at. The customers were rude. When I did something wrong which I hardly did I would get yelled it. Management was terrible. Opening and closing were so bad."
bad,"Very poor management, doesn’t work well with student athletes, I myself am one and they said they’d work with my schedule as it would be packed due to sports and they never were cooperative, very rude behind closed doors, talks about other employees with other employees, doesn’t have clean work spaces, lazy mangers, too much drama from outside life involved with work."
bad,Was harassed by managers constantly. They cut my hours out of spite and forced me to work in back because of my Tourettes syndrome acting up during hours working dining room. The owner was rude and constantly made our jobs harder when she arrived to check on things. Overall this chain has a very toxic and insidious culture.
bad,Management decides what your pay will be when you work will be a little you. It’s always about the management.   Distribution boss lies to you does not tell you the truth it’s all about himself . You don’t dare speak out of turn or they will get loud and start yelling at you in front of other drivers
bad,"It is highly possible that it's just the location I've worked at, but in the almost 2 years I've worked at Panera it's been okay. We did just open in early 2018 so those of us hired were training are various locations and then had to collaborate our training and experience by working with each other. Managers will not pull you aside to speak with you if they notice you are doing something incorrectly and will reduce your hours with no notice. They will never fire an employee even if the employees' attitude and actions are toxic and will continue to make excuses why they keep that person employed. They will NOT hire an associate full time. They will only keep you part-time until you get promoted to Shift Supervisor. "
bad,Management discriminates employees. Shows favoritism. When you are not a favorite you get hours cut. Not getting hours promised or days off as requested. DO NOT WORK HERE. I don’t know if the current GM just acts or is ignorant.
bad,"They accomadate to anyone who prefers to be on their phone and talk all day while pretending to be really polite to mask the fact they are actually doing nothing. Maybe they figure letting the younger crowd do anything keeps them youthful in spirit or in some way gets them the title of ""cool manager"". If you are a serious person who wants to remain sane, I'd advise you pass up the offer of working in a playground work environment. This place can bring out the ugly in even the nicest of people."
bad,"The Panera Bread location I worked at was awful. The management, although they are very nice people and will become your friends (which is highly unprofessional), is not good at their job. They get frustrated too easily, cannot control their associates, and act like they have done nothing wrong when you try to reason with them about an issue that’s their fault. If you’re lazy and looking to not do much for money, work nights here; the managers will stay in the office the whole time. Working morning shifts is fast paced but there are good employees that know what they are doing and want to make the customers happy. The managers are just babies who talk bad about other employees and other managers and get upset when you want to leave because they don’t know how to properly train new employees. This place will leave you exhausted (mentally and physically) and no one will ever tell you thank you."
bad,The most racist Managers I've ever met.. Bigotry is their hidden policy to treat workers who are different. I've been treated like an animal because I have a different culture.
bad,"Can’t say this is a bad place to work, just definitely full of fake smiles and people who will talk behind your back. Worked here for about 2 weeks, they trained me for one week, after 2 of those training days I was basically on my own in the busy workplace. Long story short I was terminated for missing a shift I had no idea about...I called the store 2x prior to missing the shift, texted the manager and no response. Next day I come in for work and am terminated on the spot, not written up...not asked why I missed...terminated on sight. Even showing my proof of trying to contact them they weren’t hearing it so yea definitely a place u don’t wanna do anything wrong in because nothing’s secure."
bad,"The pay is absolutely terrible for how much their food and drinks cost. The work environment is awful, employees are always complaining and the corporate management is absolutely clueless about mostly everything."
bad,Not a good place to work at no core values poor management bad equipment they will change the route on you if somebody called me and won't give you heads up unexpected changes too much work for one person
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"My General manager was horrible. She never did her job and constantly harrassed me. When brought up to the area director I was just told it was our ""bold personalities.""  I enjoyed the jobs itself but couldn't work where there was no standards."
bad,I loved working her until I was cheated out of one of my checks and my last check. I talked to the GM and she told me there was nothing she could do about it.
bad,"They would run you to death just to make and change coffee/tea and stock constantly. No one talks to you except the older ladies in the dining room, which gets you yelled at. I would also have to mop and vacuum the entire store by myself and be there until almost 1am. the managers were just awful when I started there so I was out after a month."
bad,"Not enough deliveries to go around, pay and hours are minimal. They will hire you if you have a pulse. 2 and 3 hour shifts are normal.. discount was nice"
bad,"bad job for delivery drivers, says premium wages plus tips and miles, the only people making out is the owners, they get 3.00 per delivery fee and only pay out mileage, so if you go on 3 deliveries to the same place or area you get like 1.00 and panera bread is getting 9.00 plus a percentage of the sales, was let go cause a few customers wouldn't tip said we get part of the delivery fee and when you tell them no you don't we are tipped employees and we don't make minimum wage when delivering you get fired, this happened days after i asked for a transfer then my hours got cut from 35 to 20 how is an adult supposed to live off four 3 hours shifts a week pretty much wasted my time when i had 11 interviews set and took the first job, and panera bread wonders why they can keep drivers"
bad,"Some jobs there are better than others, but if you get stuck in a bad spot, then you are going to have a bad time. Panera seems to have a really fast turn over rate too. It's not a fun place to work. They expect you to do work that is intended for more than one person by yourself."
bad,"Horrible place to work, management is finnicky and unorganized. People are rude and overtime is guaranteed. Management likes to blame others for their own mess ups"
bad,"panera bread was one of the worst jobs i ever worked, nights and weekends were the only shifts i got but managers were willing to work with some and not others for their scheduling. it’s a hassle everytime you ever need to call out, no matter the reason why. constantly being called to come into work which wouldn’t be bad for getting extra hours aside from the fact that they get mad you aren’t able to come in on a day you were expecting to have off. i did love most of my coworkers and some of the management staff, but the GM was terrible. always out of food which makes customers angry and kitchen staff stressed. high tension environment and arguments between staff were common. tip share did significantly increase the pay."
bad,"A revolving door policy forces stores to shovel hours on hard workers when they are light on staff, and then pull the hours back whenever they start over hiring. Some weeks you get 45+ hours, some weeks you get less than 30. Zero potential for advancement, and if you complain about anything, get ready to get rolled over on. This place sucks, and I would recommend working anywhere else over the place that I worked at."
bad,Panera Bread was my first job in general and I didn't know what to expect. I did learn a great amount in the kitchen and as a cafe in a whole. Management was okay but upper management was not so great. I felt that they did not care about the employees that worked there. That is my personal take.
bad,"This was the worst job I have ever had. I worked here not long after turning 16 and would mainly work on the weekends. They worked me to death during every shift. My 8 hour shift would turn into a 9 or 10 hour shift by the time they allowed me to leave. The workplace culture was terrible. I was treated poorly by other employees and the managers had no concern for our well being. It is a very fast-paced job and I never stopped moving, except for a short break. Some days, they would ask me to stand in the back for my break instead of leaving."
bad,"I worked here for a month. I went to college. They knew my school schedule and promised to work around it. They did not. I was scheduled a few times over my school schedule and was told that I would have to get someone to cover my shift or I would be written up. You also get written up if you are sick and can't come to work. I was never late, I came in when i was supposed to. None of that matters. Its just about the money."
bad,"Poor Training and Management, Bad Hours, No Room for Internal Advancement/Promotion Unless You're ""In the know"" with Upper Management. Poor Communication across the board, Made to travel across counties to fill baker positions. Hard work isn't recognized by management, certain bakers are held to different standards than others."
bad,Panera Bread managers sometimes lack off also I feel like they are racist toward black people but they tend to hide their feelings toward black people. I didn't like working in Panera Bread because the manager doesn't help out the employee.
bad,"Management is absolutely horrendous. They use methods of fear and intimidation to manage their cafes and employees.  Awful at providing a work schedule even two days before the start of the week. Panera was my first job, and I regret ever beginning my work career at that cafe."
bad,"Always understaffed, under portioned, and overpriced. The upper management tries to delegate to a staff that isn't trained properly and just expects them to be able to perform to satisfaction but they can not."
bad,"Had this job (delivery driver) as a secondary job so I didn't go in expecting much and was still shocked by how underwhelming my experience was. Let me start with compensation/benefits:"
bad,Each shift was around 9-10 hours. We weren't allowed to have conversations with other employees unless it was strictly related to work. The amount of hours you got was based on favoritism.
bad,"Unrealistic expectations, unobtainable standards, and a complete lack of care for the employee's well being in general. There's an overall breakdown of communication that creates too many obstacles to juggle at once."
bad,"Like a lot of the other reviews on here, management is horrible. You don't get paid hardly enough to have to deal with managers yelling and berating you. Since the second day I worked for Panera, I had realized one of my managers in particular hated me. Come to find out, she hates everyone, plays favorites, and will take her own anger and stress out on you. HR is a joke, they do not care about associates. If you contact HR with an issue, they will fire you for filing a complaint about a manager. It's easy to get hired but I REALLY would not recommend it. Besides management, my fellow associates were amazing and I became very quick friends with them."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"Not good, days were very stressful. I just learned.. nothing just how to open, close and use the machine you take orders with... theres little to no advancement in your position unless you just do it. Coworkers aren't really friendly they won't really say anything to you at all. Hardest part will be rushing because they'll literally threaten to fire you if you're not working fast enough to make them look good as managers. Nothing is enjoyable."
bad,Management is never on the same page. Only one 30 minute break for an 8 hour shift. Get yelled at for trying to get a drink of water. God forbid if you have to use the restroom during your shift.
bad,"Very stressful, and really bad management, the only good thing about the job was meeting new co-workers and making new friends, but besides that it was a toxic workplace"
bad,"Free meals are great, the staff is awesome however, upper management is terrible. Your job is constantly threatened and you rarely have a day off. There is no work life balance at all."
bad,"the management is bad."
bad,"my job was a bit challenging sometimes, but i didnt mind. I enjoy taking on new task. I just didnt like when the managers weren't being understanding to situations that were beyond my control."
bad,Panera is an awful place with rude people who don’t care about their customers early see them wash hands no gloves and not to mention the way the food is prepped and handled gross
bad,After years with panera and it was my first job. It got so bad the closer I got to being promoted to management. If you’re not the gm’s favorite than you’ll get no where with them. All the hw hard working people get looked over for the ones who slack. The more you slack the more chance you have to be a favorite.
bad,"Unreliable co-workers"
bad,"Management at Panera is horrible to employees that aren't part of their group of favorites. Even if you work hard, and even find a way to do a job more effectively, they will punish and belittle you for not going with their way despite being more wasteful and less likely to work in the first place."
bad,Would not suggest working for this company.  There is a lack on support from managers. Employees are allowed to treat other staff terrible. There is never enough staff to work through the rush.
bad,They ask you to stay ridiculous hours for ridiculous pay. No work life balance just work. God forbid if your a dish washer the machine is terrible. They expect you to be there 3pm to close with another 3 hours of using a  archaic way of cleaning but it has to be done by the book!
bad,no comment
bad,Managers don't know how to schedule people properly. I have to open line by myself for 4 hours until someone comes. This new manager is cutting hours but hiring high school students because their pay is less. They watch us through the cameras like we live in an Orwell-ian society. People get written up for anything (and I mean anything). Improper training to new employees who just get thrown into positions they've never worked.
bad,"Very bad management, every manager tells you something different and plays favorites with certain associates. Policies change weekly. I would not recommend to anyone I know."
bad,"They think all employees are 16 and won't believe anything. Even if you tell them you have a disability at your interview, they will still make you stay and work through any awful pain that you have. Ultimately sending you to the ER ONLY after your significant other comes in to talk to them. Don't waste your time. (A couple of the managers are cool. GM, not at all.)"
bad,co worker is selfish they have no respect they dont care about next driver always left the truck emty fuel brake down equipment if you complaint abouth this manager dont care lead driver dont care couple driver make company each others if they dont like you if you brake they owne rules they will try to quit to jobs they do some punishment giving hard time
bad,"no one was able to act like an adult until they had to, at which point it was too late. managers didn't demand respect, employees could do whatever they wanted whenever they wanted"
bad,"A typical day as a Panera Bread Dining Employee includes bussing tables, transporting and cleaning dishes, vacuuming dining area, cleaning bathrooms, changing trash cans, assisting diners, making fresh coffee every hour, making fresh tea, lifting heavy containers and replenishing dining utensils. Panera Bread is a very fast paced, stressful workplace. The staff is very rude and unforgiving for mistakes."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"Employees are taken advantage of, lack proper training, and yet are still expected to cover more than one station at a time whether or not they were trained in that station, while maintaining ideal ticket times all around. Promotions are not work ethic based, but simply on who will kiss up to the managers the most. They simple have no interest in your personal life, I've been made to work doubles while visibly sick, shamed for taking off work to care for my injured mother, and had person days requested off denied. Do not work here."
bad,"Just don't work here I stuck it out for a little bit but they work you to the bone and they really don't care about you. I found out I was under paid by 5,000 annually and they are so unorganized . Customer service is #1 but not for them. Getting whatever into the bag or on the plate comes first - not quality ."
bad,"Company was bought by another company. All emphasis was more more. But you couldn't order needed product. Ovens were breaking, can't bake without them. Solution? We'll start delivery. Management too scared to voice concerns, or just didn't care."
bad,"Worked at the puyallup-wa location for 7 months. Work hours were incredibly inconsistent; went from 30hrs a week to 7, then to 25, then 15, etc. No respect for availability either. Managers there treat you like trash and allow other team members to as well unless you are one of their favorites. Would not recommend this place as a place to work at all."
bad,Upper level management has become disconnected with line level management and employees. They expect the world of you while giving you no time to complete necessary tasks that keep the cafe up and running not only on a company level but on a state mandated level as well.
bad,Had you work 2 day shifts 11 hours long then 3 night shifts the same length every week so you could not have a normal schedule when off the clock.  I was suspended for not making it to a phone call meeting during my 34 hour reset.
bad,"If you are looking for a job I would not recommend working at the Derby Panera. Yeah the pay is decent and the discount is too, but that doesn't make up for how you will be treated by the management and the customers."
bad,"Horrible place to work. Above min wage pay for work, however the job requires a lot of you despite your job title being ""cashier"" or ""line cook"". On top of that, raises do nothing to barely nothing for your paycheck. "
bad,"The management is immature, and gossips about fellow employees.  It's just like high school.  The only reason they get promoted within the company is because they've been working since they were high school students.  They can't keep employees due to poor work environment."
bad,"Being production line opener was demanding, and not rewarding in the slightest."
bad,I was working at Panara in Stuart fl. Most managers where extremely rude and the employees training new people made it so obvious that they don't want to be there. Terrible experience!
bad,"I have recently been feeling uncomfortable working at the Panera bread in Troy commons shopping center due to the fact that I still have to work at the same place as a girl who is seriously racist. She says a joke about my skin color and then makes it even worse by threatening me with words along the lines of deporting me or ""doing things to me that trump would do to anyone who isn't white"". I am on here to look for a new job where hopefully they don't tolerate this type of behavior, whether it is a joke or not!"
bad,"don't get me wrong I loved my co workers only reason I stayed there as long as I did, I worked at 2 locations both were pretty bad managers don't do anything. I also went through 5 general managers. the last one I had was the worst  refused to help her staff that was short handed every night I was a full time employ that worked 14 hours a week. I can go on for days."
bad,"Never work for a Panera company. Filled with lies. Management does everything to better themselves, HR will do nothing. All employees were miserable working there. No breaks or food to eat. Good luck advancing, been waiting 3 years for just an empty promise and lies. Pay is horrible. You can make more money as a cashier at Zaxby's than you would working overtime every week at Panera. Overall, management's the issue."
bad,"There were some very painful comments given by one of the managers to both myself and other coworkers concerning private or otherwise not work-related matters. Almost everyone I worked with left within months of being hired for this reason. "
bad,"From the top down, the organization is a terrible entity.  Ownership demonstrated immense narcissism and treated managers and associates poorly."
bad,The management was unfair and they were not understanding at all. They treated new employees very bad and did not properly train them.
bad,"Panera Bread was pure chaos. I was given no training, little help when requested, bad hours, no help from management with my complaints and a bad coworker environment- not to mention they work you to the bone for 10/hr.The only time I ever enjoyed the job was closing with a nice coworker. The worst part was working on the line during rush hour with no help or training and people jumping down my throat because of it. I won't ever let someone tell me they're applying there without telling them it's a very bad idea."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,This company rotates managers faster than you can blink an eye.  The reason is that management from the top down is highly unprofessional and unreasonable.  The expectations are that your life should revolve around Panera but they do not compensate you for all the stress.  With the constant revolving door of management coming through the door it is difficult to run smooth shifts or be successful in your position.  This franchise is concerned about one thing the bottom line and could care less about workers quality of life.  The work/life balance is a joke and non existent.  There was nothing enjoyable about this job.
bad,"If you are working IN the Cafe's - there is a ridiculous expectation placed on management and associates.  The Corporate culture of - We really care (about the employees) is false.  They care about sales, and the bottom line and making sure the CEO's and Upper management make money and nothing else.  A very demanding environment with extremely high turnover."
bad,They say they want change but wont change - culture is one of talk and no action.I would not recommend to anyone looking for a career with a great company.
bad,"Do not work at this location it's understaffed and the managers have no idea what they're doing. I had a manager who gave me ""a verbal warning"" for something that happened two months ago. They will constantly call you in whenever you have a day off. They will hire anyone off the street who has no restaurant experience to prepare food for people. The restaurant is unsanitary a few of the trainers are on power trips. Some of the cashiers are complete morons and get orders wrong. I decided to quit because I felt like I was being treated unfairly."
bad,"if you are looking for a job that makes you feel like you have zero real world experience let alone a degree because to them that means nothing they treat all their employees like they are 16 and think they can get away with any kind of behavior"
bad,"Greedy company that offers low pay and no meals despite vast profit margins due to cheap foods sold for high prices. Sanitation was always below par and they use harsh industrial cleaners. No breaks were guaranteed. You might get an unpaid lunch break if you ask for one, at least in Texas. I understand labor laws are more accommodating of workers outside of Texas so I am not sure if this is the case elsewhere. The trashy atmosphere and Predominantly rude, condescending, and downright mean upper-middle class white customers. The entire staff was very stressed, angry, and even shift leads were paid low wages. I do not know how much managers were paid. The staff frequently rotates and consists mainly of juvenile high school and, occasionally, college students. Managers treated the staff like garbage, and did not seem capable of empathy. Managers receive lunches, and could not seem to understand when staff got stressed or discouraged. An employee walking out in the middle of a shift happened every few days, one week maximum. I don't even remember the majority of the people who worked there because they quit so fast. Bottom line: don't do it."
bad,"I was fired for being 45 minutes late. I still opened the store on time but the main reason behind it is against the law. I was fired due to lack of sleep because I had taken my husband several times to the ER that week and was living on very little sleep. My manager and my boss knew of this situation."
bad,"Your typical day at work will probably include being sent home before the end of your shift because it's ""slow"".  Unless, of course, you are a favorite of one of the managers.  Then, you will probably have an 8 hour shift!  Almost all of the managers act as though this café is really a Marine boot camp.  The managers are constantly critical of the staff and, consequently, the staff are stressed out.  There a countless errors made in the orders.  And the order sizes (especially the salads) have become smaller in the last week.  It's been fun getting to know the other staff members and learning to work with them as a team.  But the managers pick favorites and it shows.  Panera Bread Santa Fe should be careful that they don't get in trouble for discrimination.  Few of the staff ever take any kind of break; they are intimidated by managers about it."
bad,I did enjoy some time here. the shouldn't hire people because they are cute or hot to them. having two irresponsible very young assistant managers is the reason it happens.
bad,"Very standard minimum wage job. Long hours of grueling labor with little pay. Terrible at training - the store is always too busy to train properly. "
bad,"I worked at panera for almost a year and I knew from the second day I started it was going to be rough. Training was fast-paced and if you didn't learn something what they deemed quick enough, you were to be overlooked when it came to scheduling. In the beginning I got 2-3hour shifts, twice a week, with pay barely at minimum wage, it wasn't even worth the 20min drive over, couldn't even fill my gas tank. Although some of the assistant managers were nice and really cool, the general manager was possibly the worst person ever, she said things that normal people wouldn't say, she was shady & rude & all around a terrible human being. If you can't handle snobby people then I don't recommend this job because the worlds most snobbiest, stuck-up, and vile people come to panera, and they complain simply because they can. The discount can only be used by you, if you worked a minimum of 4hrs that day, and the before price cannot exceed $10, so it's kind of dumb. You rarely get breaks if you are over 18, I once worked from open to close without a break, then when I asked at the end of the night why I'd hadn't gotten a break, the manager shrugged and said ""oops we forgot."" Panera was my first job and anyone one thinking of applying at panera, here's some advice: DON'T."
bad,The product was good as long as the management was able to keep up with the demand. I experienced many embarrassing shortages. Good humor and was rarely encouraged. Organization and consistency lacking.
bad,"I hated it. Good first job to start off with for anyone in highschool, but don’t expect to be paying any bills with this job. Only the bad things were pointed out, no matter if you’re the only one on the line that day... they’ll never recognize you for your hard work. Management doesn’t take harassment complaints seriously as far as firing or taking any action, they will cover up any accusation to prevent making themselves look bad instead of doing something about it, very unappreciative and somewhat stuck up. Each job has its problems but I wouldn’t work here again even if it was the last job on earth."
bad,"Panera's managers at this particular are hard to work with. Mostly because they are disrespectful, inconsiderate, and hypocritical. The GM was extremely rude and talked negative things behind co-workers back to other co-workers and fed into drama. I heard she was fired though."
bad,"I really enjoy working with the other associates at Panera! They're fun to converse with and super supportive. However, the management shows little sympathy when it comes to sick days and having a flexible schedule. The process for a lot of tasks there is inconvenient and makes everything take longer, and the customers are so snobby. "
bad,"A typical day is up in the air. I never know what the day is going to be like. I have managers that act like I'm not there. I try to ask questions or do certain things as far as cleaning and I'm ignored, and sent home hours before my scheduled time."
bad,"Panera as a company has good values and good intentions for its employees. But the managers and trainers at the Panera in Annapolis are just terrible people. The cashiers that have worked the longest time are managements favorites and they can get away with stuff that other people get fired for. Trainers make fun of trainees to other employees. Everyone these is 2 faced and will talk behind your back. Any time you call out even if it’s for a medical emergency they get really upset ( I know because it happen to me). But I recently left because I couldn’t take it anymore. While at Panera, I worked very hard and did everything they asked and yet I was constantly teased and degraded. It was a nightmare."
bad,It can be a better place to work depends on management been there long time 4 years got a raise after so long it could have better opportunities depending on staff managers and employees
bad,It was something. Or was it? No comments. Just enjoy the sunset. Appreciate the friendships along the way. Remember to have fun and express yourself. The world needs more artists in every aspect.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"I worked at this Panera Bread full time 30-40 hours a week for 5 months. At the beginning it seemed like a ok job I had cooking experience then the employees started being rude. The “trainers” are entitled to set schedules and whatever days they want off, they didn’t have to wear visors or hats. The General manager said to me once “ \____ is my favorite employee and most of you know this by now.” She also said to me “ A few of the new people we have hired right now I don’t like and I want to get rid of but eventually they will weed their way out."
bad,I worked here for less than a year and management couldn’t get their life together for anything. My schedule as well as everyone else’s kept getting mixed up while also making you work way past closing time.
bad,"Worked for this location for 3 months. My trainer quit days into my training. Line workers acted like royalty and could never help out even when slow. NEVER got breaks, even when working 8 hours. Never any compliments from staff and the manager is rude to customers and employees."
bad,"Ive worked for two different Panera Breads. One as a manager and one as an associate... it is very draining and the management could care less about you. You barely get any hours (unless you're favorited) and when you ask for specific hours you get attitude. Most of the management is rude and not understanding to any issues you may have. You can tell them a problem and they would say they would work on it but everything stays the same. If you have a family emergency don't even think about calling out without coverage (which no one will take your shift). If you think panera is fun to work at, think again."
bad,"The store that I worked in was horrific. Managers would scream at you while customers were in the store, humiliate you for calling out (whether you were sick or a family emergency), and if the managers didn't like you they would find ways to forcefully make you quit or they would eventually stop scheduling you at all. The job itself isn't too terrible, and most of the coworkers are great, but the managers don't know when to stop with the harassment. I had told them at the beginning that I had anxiety issues with people that I was on medication for, and that I sometimes (but rarely) had panic attacks that I would need to step in the back for. I was placed at the register for the near year that I was there and had a panic attack ONCE. However, with this information, they denied training me in other positions or allowing me more hours. Specifically saying ""well, with your anxiety we don't want you working in [position]."" Yet they would continue to complain about being understaffed and needing more people in other positions that I asked to be placed into. Towards the end of my stay there, I was finally allowed to be placed into the drive-thru. I was immediately pulled out of it due to my ""poor performance"" when they didn't even give me proper training. I then had a family issue that required us to move quite a bit away and I explained to them that I would need more hours so I could afford transportation to get there. My hours were cut in half, and I was forced to put my 2 weeks in. The manager just stopped scheduling me (which I was honestly grateful for because it was awful there)."
bad,"Current GM doesn't know how to handle working with people. She will either over schedule or under schedule her staff, as well as pick favorites among staff disregarding the feelings of others. She promises accommodation for disabled staff but refused to go through with it (mentally and physically)."
bad,"I'm currently a baker in training and it's starting pay is only $10.50. For the amount of work you have to do. It is absolutely not worth it. I can't even take breaks so I'm standing and running around for 8 hours straight because if we did take a break something would either get burned or not be baked. While my trainer is great to work with and learn from,  the job itself sucks."
bad,This is a horrible place to work. The management is the worst that I have ever seen. Very condescending. The GM is a joke and a very fake person. They pick favorites and if they don’t like you they will give you minimal hours.
bad,After being sold on work life balance and a 45 hour work week I soon found out it was a sham.  All managers are on the floor for the majority of the night with little or no scheduled admin time.
bad,"I was new at the job but I did my work of a dishwasher. I work for 3 weeks and haven't received my money on Tuesday. I keep on calling the manager that runs our payment but I keep on going in circles with the manager. I can't work for free because I need to pay my bills and buy food. It is a nice place but if you are going to work there ask for a check."
bad,"They expect you to give up your entire life for them. God forbid you get sick and have to call out, the gm will talk bad about you to other employees. Most of management has no idea what they are doing. Certain employees will get away with everything, like calling out multiple times a month to being late everyday."
bad,"It was only one of the cafes I worked at where the upper management should have listened to their shift supervisors/assistant manager team. Our general manager had no people skills and didn’t know how to speak to associates or managers respectfully. The only time we had a full staff was on shifts he worked, other than that we were always short. Being constantly short didn’t help with tensions throughout the cafe. About 5 people, on separate but similar stressed induced situations, did break down and cry, and a total of 9 people quit including myself and the rest of the manager team excluding our general manager and some associates."
bad,"I currently work at Panera and they aren’t scheduling us as many hours as we request because we’re apparently “overstaffed” yet our night shifts lack people.  I have been there for over a year and the new hires are being scheduled more hours than me,  and quite frankly I can’t wait to quit.  I get paid minimum wage to deal with people who complain about prices I have no control over,  and I have zero hope of getting a raise because I have not heard of one person to receive one.  Overall my experience of working here is poor and I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone."
bad,"A few good managers that care."
bad,"This was my first job, and although I am grateful for the experience, the management is terrible at my location. I was 16 years old and they would put me in at 4:30 am multiple times a week, after I asked them not to. I got so stressed, my doctor had to tell me to quit! Coworkers were great, pay was bad, and you get half-priced meals once a day. All in all, do not work at this particular location, unless you can become the manager's favorite."
bad,"To be honest I worked at the store that was locally known as the worst. They sent another manager in to help the store improve,  but instead 13 people quit in 2 months. Management will belittle and mock you as a way to “motivate” you. It’s ridiculous. The people management does actually like will get worked to death.  The training program.. they took a lot of shortcuts... They just threw me out there with a few days training and expected me to know the whole freaking menu. They also don’t care if you’re sick. Coworkers threw up in the bathroom and went back to work because management knew but refused to let them go home."
bad,Panara was nice place to work for my first job but I would like to work somewhere else now that I have more expierience then I did before I worked at panara.
bad,They werent paying use fairly new people that came in to work is getting paid more than the people that has been working more than a year.The coworkers are good but the pay and managers are trash.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"I have been at this location almost 2 years and no raise!!"
bad,"I do not remember a day that I did not leave Panera Bread angry, or at the most crying. Customers are rude. So rude, I believe that some people forgot they were talking to another human being with feelings. I would work as hard, and diligently as I could, and if someone else would mess a plate order up, I would get yelled at for it, because I was the one who handed it out the window to the customer."
bad,Anyone that works here should get paid more than what they do. It is an extremely stressful job. Management isn't willing to help or accommodate your needs.
bad,this job was very easy but the work enviorment was horrible and the way the restaurant was ran was very unprofessional. the managers acted like they were teenagers and they were not very clean.
bad,Panera has a very high turn over because they will not give raises and they treat you like slaves. The General Manager's can't even make their own declensions for their cafe.I think it is a good job for someone starting out but other than that please keep looking. You have people that has been with this company for years and still make the same amount. It is almost impossible to get a bonus so please don't look for one. The recruiter's will feed you a lot of fairy tales to get you to join the company.
bad,"Too many cons and negatives, a horrible work experience. In a typical day i come in and instantly other co workers are no where to be found and if they are in the front they're joking around loosely while customers wait to be served so i have to take care of it as soon as i step foot behind the counter. Managers are unprofessional, disgusting and inappropriate. Some people who make food are rude, catty and irrational which ruins the entire environment. Only reason to come in is to get paid but eventually the payment isnt even worth coming in."
bad,Great food and environment but they work you like a Hebrew shave. Very underpaid. Need a union to clean up this place. Very high turnover because you can make more money for doing the same job done where else. Managers are ran washed and most stick around to build a resume. They have a lot of pressure to perform and meetnimvers. Pay raises are  on average 10 cents. I would never allow my child to work here either.
bad,"The Panera I worked at is probably the worst place you could ever work. The management was HORRIBLE, as sometimes we don't even get schedules until the night before. They were always rude and were not warm at all. They did not care for their employees at all, and even if it was an emergency, they would make you find someone to cover the shift, although a lot of the time, no one picked up shifts. The environment is horrible, and sometimes the managers would make you do more than what you're supposed to. If you're only supposed to be on let's say cash, sometimes they will make you do cash AND dining. Everyone working there said they were not getting paid enough. It was so bad to the point where in one week, 2 managers quit, the general manager quit, AND almost 15 employees quit. People couldn't work there anymore, which is why I quit as well."
bad,"I'm a prep person , and they want me to help other people but not help me with bunch of stuff to do.  But I use to love that place, but if you going in for a cashier position or on line cook go for it, or even driver but not cook person its stressing nd can't leave till you done, and no one will help you."
bad,"There were very few things to like about this job if you ask me. The pay rate was low, the environment was not professional, the managers had no respect for the workplace and there was very minimal structure. At the location i worked at there was no teamwork and a lot of the seasoned workers there were very rude when they talked about their coworkers and trainees. Their training was very lackluster so i paid very close attention to my eLearning to make sure I was doing everything to standard along with reading every book and binder. The best value i got from this job honestly would be the ability to keep my composure. This job made it very hard for me to want to stay seeing that my previous job of 2 years at applebees was a totally different experience. The work at Panera is easy no doubt, the work environment is terrible. I hope for a better experience for the next person to work there."
bad,BEWARE:  Maple Grove catering hub was the worst place I've ever worked. It's top-heavy with managers and shift leads who sit around and do nothing but talk amongst themselves in the office. The managers and the shift leads are so unprofessional and so rude. There are so many double standards there where one person can never do anything wrong yet the next person does everything wrong. There's major favoritism. There's conflicts-of-interest with manager and team Associates living together. It lacks leadership. it's very unorganized. I've never worked with a group of people who have been so rude as this group of people. There's group cliques and gossip and the place was horrible to go into every day.  Managers are consistently making mistakes and don't want to own up to it. Certain team Associates can get away with not doing anything or spending half of their day out on smoke breaks or digging through garbage for recycling materials. The place is utter chaos consistently making mistakes with deliveries and orders. I hated going into work each day only to be subjected to working with a bunch of Neanderthals.  There are so many inconsistency.  It's very unorganized. Managers lie to you with regards to how deliveries are assigned. All in all I would tell anybody who's interested in working at Panera to beware!!!!
bad,The general manager had his favorites and if you werent one of them he wouldnt treat you that good. most people were lazy and you were expected to pick up the slack. always called on my days off. a lot of people would walk out in the middle of the shift or not show up at all. people that worked there for more than a year would get paid less than those just hired.
bad,Coworkers at my location were nice but the store was unorganized and somewhat dirty. Managers were lazy and didn’t help during the intensive  cleaning. Overall the managers at this location aren’t understanding and will over work you. I didn’t feel the “Panera Warmth” they always talked about. However I liked the location and enjoyed being a cashier. And for all the cleaning that one has to do one is underpaid.
bad,This is not a work environment for a mature person. I would not suggest this job to any of my friend. I do not have very much to say about this job except that it is very stressful.
bad,"The only pros of working here are a paycheck and 401k (assuming you qualify for one). Everything else is here is ridiculous. Most of the staff are whiny teenagers that frequently call off, leaving the rest of the store to deal with being understaffed. Management has no clue on how to incentivize the few employees that do work hard and even volunteer to work outside their typical availabilities. If you express interest in advancing, management will string you along promising a raise and scheduling for the required classes, but none of it ever arrives. "
bad,"Thought I was hired to be a cashier but instead was forced to do numerous other positions that I never applied for. They force you to stay kater than scheduled without warning or asking. They gave me 12 hour work weeks ans 4 hour shifts. The biddeford maine location is a massive clusterf*ck, with unorganized work environments and unorganized managers. Never apply here."
bad,"A typical day as a Line Cook starts with checking the drawers and fridges for stocking purposes. Then preparing and plating any and all orders that are rung in. When working the morning and lunch rush, associates are supposed to stock for the rush and then re-stock for dinner. Most of the stocking does not get done from the end of the morning shift, either we get too busy or someone isn't doing their job. When morning shift does not stock it screws over the dinner rush, and the dinner shift associates are supposed to stock for the morning. Most people do not like to stay and help. Now this is a vicious cycle that has yet to break with this store. There is only one manager that actually knows how to manage employees but the rest of them lack in so much communication. I have worked morning shifts, I have worked day shifts, and sometimes even all-day shifts. I know the Line like the back of my hand and can prep or stock anything for it. Which honestly that is what everyone should be doing if they know the line that well. The management has either ignored or lacks effort in managing certain employees who aren't doing anything really.  Has even ignored my request to learn the Prep station, which I already know how to prep almost anything we need for the line. I know this because there are many mornings I had to prep stuff because either the prep person did not stock or the dinner shift couldn't stock enough. Anyone can become a trainer without actually being properly trained on most things, because I know I was only really trained on the salad station but nothing else. But I know"
bad,"Management is a bunch of rumor mongering little girls that will turn on you for anything. The pay is ok, but not enough for what you are asked to do nightly. The attendance rules are a joke and are a big reason why they lose people. You can't be sick while working here and if you are it has to be on their terms. Way too much expected of you! Most of the coworkers are good people, but management is horrible. A few people there that will definitely stab you in the back if the opportunity presents itself. You will be talked to like you are a child by management."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"they will forget to put you on a schedule and work very little hours,pretty much just clean tables,make coffee every hour, cashier, and clean the juices"
bad,"This job makes you think you are earning decent wages by paying you tips and mileage at the end of every shift, but in reality you can barely break even on gas money and customers rarely tip above an average of $3 an order. When you are out of the restaurant on deliveries, you make a pitiful $5 an hour. If customers don't tip well or at all, you will consistently make below minimum wage. Additionally, the Lansing Mall Panera has large periods of no deliveries every day, meaning you are stuck doing basic kitchen work for 9.50 an hour. To be fair, this job will train you in customer service, and the managers are typically helpful and nice. Overall, this job provides very few benefits for drivers, and a combination of low wages and poor customers result in more headache than this job is worth."
bad,"Too many people work at Panera who don't actually work. Customers are often rude. Managers tend to only care about themselves. It is an exceedingly unhealthy environment mentally and they continuously wonder why they cannot keep good employees. Food may be pretty good, but it is very expensive. Even with a discount it sometimes seems too pricey."
bad,"young managers make for dramatic managers, awful organization, rude and unprofessional behavior. typically you're there for an extended period of time and if you ask to eat something theyll get mad or just throw it away."
bad,The management was lacking a variety of common sense/traits. Employee favoritism was very blatant there and well acknowledged by everyone. Associates aren't trained properly and than expected to exceed standards.
bad,ONLY one pace and its very very fast. Employers aren't understanding if you're new to a task. Only go into this job if you like attitudes and high expectations for low pay.
bad,"Management is not cooperative and does not treat employees with respect, especially the new MANA managers. It is never fully staffed and employees are required to do the work of 2 or even 3 people on the daily. Many things go on that lead to the employees hating their job."
bad,Very BAD management.
bad,"Hard work for little pay. Long grueling hours where I went home limping. The management was always dangling higher advancement in my face with never any payout. No matter how hard I worked it was never enough. They become short staffed and I had to work at two different cafes and do twice the work in the same amount of hours, equally the same amount of pay as if I had only worked at one cafe. Do. Not. Work. Here."
bad,"way too many moving parts these days, not a simple company any more, easy to find more applicants back in the day but now I hear ALL restaurants are having issues hiring people, including Panera"
bad,"Horrible company, does not care at all about their employees. After being there 5 months and NEVER being late or calling out a single time, I called out the night before my shift because of an extremely high fever and cough (after working through said fever and cough all day). I was told I would be written up anyways, even though this is FOOD SERVICE, and you're NOT supposed to come in sick. This policy is absurd, and beyond unprofessional. That, among other things, goes to show how truly little they value their people. Then they act shocked when they can't keep employees longer than a month or two. Additionally, a customer cursed in my coworkers face (completely over the line/inappropriate) and the management took his side, defending him, not even asking my coworker if she was okay after this billigerant man literally swore and screamed at her over something very very minor that wasn't even her fault. ZERO respect or appreciation for it's people. Turnover is insane. If you want to work for a company like this, by all means, that's your choice. 0/10 do not recommend."
bad,"Unprofessional and unbearable management, no one likes to do their job and will skirt responsibility at any opportunity. I do not recommend working here. The place is very clean and high tech because Panera loves to throw its' money around but the people suck."
bad,"Pay is low, environment is fast paced.  Train new employees with no extra pay or room for advancement.  Managers promise the opportunity to train for advancements but will let you down.  Friendly Co-worker environment.  Pay and advancement based on who you know, not work ethic."
bad,"•  Responsible for all aspects of business supervision including revenue management, inventory, organization, ordering, staffing, controlling costs, customer service, training, and employee relations. Always working with a sense of urgency.  Worst company I ever worked for.  Upper management is a joke.  Replace them and it might be better.  They expect WAY to much out of their hourly employee's for the amount of money they pay them."
bad,"The job is easy, fast paced sometimes, but mostly slow and monotonous. The managers are okay. The biggest issue with Panera bread, other than the often slow and dull work, is the way their scheduling website is handled. Often times I would see my shift updated and changed long after I had gone to sleep. I would wake up to find myself removed or added to the morning shift."
bad,"Working at Panera Bread was a nightmare come true, that's why I left so quickly. There was such a lack of communication and there seemed to be no care or consideration put into the work they did. That partially carried through to the product, like orders often getting wrong, tables not being cleaned, dirty and unsanitary dining area, slippery/wet floors in the kitchen at all times. It just wasn't somewhere I could see myself working. I think the only good people at Panera were the bakers and the customers."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"The pay is better than good, but definitely not worth it. Managers constantly take out their frustrations on the employees, but it is kind of understandable because so many of the teenagers who work there don't show up for their shifts and are unwilling to work hard. The turn-over is ridiculous, and there's always an issue with the schedule because the scheduling manager doesn't know how to do their job. "
bad,"Either worst or 2nd worst ever and let's just say I've been working quite a few years.  After a couple shifts I warned people about eating some things at the one particular location.  I have never experienced management so bad.  NEVER!  One manager calling thinking I was late without even looking at the schedule.  That was because another manager did her job wrong AND evidently didn't look at the schedule either.  No training and was told by numerous people that nobody had training.  A manager showing me how to do something only to find out it was wrong and that she in fact didn't know how to do it.  I asked someone about that and they went on and on about how the management does not how to do anything on the line and how they disappear to the ""manager cave"" when things get bad.  They were SERIOUSLY nowhere to be found when in a rush and short staffed many times.  I have never seen that in my life.  I was called a few days in a row to see if I could come in NOW in spite of asking about it days in advance and told no, and not to come in. The night I quit I asked about turnover and how many have quit just this month and was told at least 20 people.  In ONE month.  The list goes on and on but I hope that is enough of a warning.  I only speak of one location and obviously cannot list it."
bad,Working here was extremely un-pleasurable. This job is not based upon performance but rather friendship. If you do not make best friends with everybody its impossible to rack up hours. The job itself was lackluster and could be performed by a gorilla. My gripe lies within management. Rumors are allowed to circulate tenaciously and instead of questioning you its just taken as gospel. There is no management. I genuinely liked the job. The culture was just cut throat towards people who actually wanted to work.
bad,"Awful place, terrible managers. The general staff I worked with were amazing and I loved being with them. JADED managers in every way possible. Scheduling was all over the place, they were cutting people's hours, treated us with zero respect, and yelled at teenagers for everything you can imagine. I highly recommend NEVER working at Panera since you will be unfairly treated by managers and customers. Miserable place with miserable people."
bad,"Managers/Supervisors have a lot of favoritism on who to choose when making schedule and giving hours."
bad,I have been working at for Panera Bread since 2013 and the Coolidge café has been the worst café by far. The management is bad we get numerous complaints all day that unfortunately I cant solve due to just being an associate. The hours are great but the pay is not so great. High Turn over rate
bad,The company itself has much potential but the staff is full of 16-17 year old females that constantly complain about the work they're doing and don't show up half the time. Management did nothing about this and refused to fire anyone.
bad,This company isnt looking for workers they are look for slaves. They work there night bakers withoutht breaks illegally . Fumigate there stores without telling there customers . They fumigate very strong venom and want there bakers to work under unsanitary conditions and still serve food that way . No one ever takes  for there actions there system is build to blame others . Mostly a lot of illegal stuff happens therre
bad,"I've worked at my specific location in Ajax for quite a few months before leaving, the store is extremely unorganized, during peak rush times typically lunch and dinner it is understaffed and customers get upset, because wait times are so high. The main line and front of the store is understaffed and the drive thru is no better because there tends to only be 2 people over there at a time.The brunt of the work is put on certain employees which leads to them being over worked and thus becoming exhausted. The job environment is okay, all the employees are friendly and typically get along however, there seems to be a loss of cohesion between management and the employees. You can submit your availability but it tends to get ignored. A typical day is stressful and you go home feeling overworked and under paid. As an employee you get overworked and extremely stressed out for only $11.50. It isn't a horrible place to work but I would not recommend this location. Management does not seem to care anymore, have lost their drive. The store is not run properly and I am surprised it has not been closed by now. Enter with caution..."
bad,"The food is good and is fresh BUT. The work was a lot and the pay was so little. Closing duties a hassle, always understaffed, not flexible with scheduling. If you're not willing to slave everyday then you get next to no shifts."
bad,"Was good to work at first then as soon as u moved into management well that's where the stuff hit the fan. If you weren't a ""favorite"" employee and basically didn't kiss the right stuff you were  words I can't say on.Especially in the salary department. Your were basically a robot by then because u became more part of the company and where basically treated like bleep. They could then move you too different stores and didn't really care how far the travel was as long as u came to work and that's how they basically got u to leave the company bc between the lack of sleep and stress it became to much and then u either quit or got fired so they can move other people up into your position that were more of the favorites. As long as your not management you are good."
bad,good place good food but the life syle is not what a single mom should of hav to deal with of working 60 hours a week.but the people were fun and friendly
bad,"Like many large, corporate restaurant chains it suffers from a divide between the corporate and the store communities. The organization could vastly improve itself if ideas from store employees were not swept aside. Innovation is key if chains are to continue to flourish in this day and age, and Panera's stores continue to fall behind in properly serving their customers in the way that Specialty's, Potbelly's, and other similar companies do. "
bad,"I was a third shift baker in a very physically disgusting environment. I would never eat at this company or work there ever again. The pay is low, the workload is unbelievable, the cost of benefits is unrealistic compared to what you make. The management was absolutely awful, but you get what you pay for. The few hours I had to be around other employees was the worst, it was always inappropriate personal drama and people got fired all the time for sharing too much personal information. HR was a joke, their main goal was to cover the company's hide. The entire organization was so disorganized and chaotic it fostered an environment of hostility, pointing fingers, and a slew of angry customers every single day. I wouldn't wish this place on my worst enemy."
bad,I went back there not too long again...all the staff and management are different so maybe it is different now but when i worked there the head manager was the worst human being i have ever met and made every employee's lives a living he** to work there.
bad,"Enjoyed the job , worked with some pretty awesome people. The hours just weren't worth it."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,Baker worked all night and learned some shortcuts to bring out a good product.  Management is a one man show only cares about what they can get out of you with very little appreciation or raise.  Co-workers are great cause you work with only one or two people a night ( you solo sometimes).  Some co-workers get territorial and will only bake while you do all the prep but you quickly know who they are.  Hardest part is getting use to working all night and not sleeping most of the day.  The most enjoyable is working while the place was closed.
bad,"I would start by prepping all the food for the day that was needed. "
bad,"If you are desperate for a job be my guest. But have yourself ready to keep looking fir another job. I'm serious. "
bad,I extremely disliked working for Panera Bread. I felt out of place and did not feel like I had enough time to learn what my job was without feeling pressured. Not a good training environment. 
bad,"The gm was late every morning and he would leave the safe and office door open and when I pointed it out to the district manager he did nothing. They also wrote employee's up for their drawer being short but wouldnt let them count it in even though it was company policy. During manager training all I would do is bus tables and wash dishes. By far the worst managed company I have ever seen. Their turnover is horrible and there is zero accountability. The pay was good but not near worth the unprofessional, unhealthy, and hostile enviroment you would have to endure on a daily basis."
bad,"I've worked in food service before, but this was by far and away the worst job experience I've ever had. The management was what made it so unbearable - health code was routinely violated (i.e. a manager wearing flip flops, preparing food in a tank top with her hair down), they would constantly undermine and backstab one another, one would gloat about keeping employees unreasonably late and making them cry (a 40+ woman bragging about making 16 year old girls cry, nice).... I could go on and on. I would never let my child work there. It's not enough to get burned (because hot carts would be left in the walkways - safety protocol was usually not followed) and deal with difficult customers, but then you have managers screaming at you as you are trying to work, employees throwing money down on the food prep area to count it and then not sanitizing it after, having angry customers because once again the GM didn't order nearly enough bagels and the slicer's still not fixed, etc. I'd say there was only one manager that seemed tolerable and sane... the rest were just downright sadistic. My pay was usually screwed up, too, and wasn't always fixed."
bad,"This place has been the worse place I have ever worked at. Management is rude and unprofessional. They never made me feel welcome there. No ""thank you"" no ""good job you did well today"". Nothing. No appreciation, no advancement, no proper training. I haven't worked at other paneras so I cannot speak for all just for this location by far the worse!. I would fire all the people from ""management"" and hire more professional friendly people. Would probably make the place a bit better."
bad,"They've a high turnover because of pay and poor treatment. I worked there a little over a year and i saw several people quit every month. Some after being there for only a month. Some walking off the job. Lots of covert bullying and gossiping. If you're a minority, you will be treated with a lot of disdain. Management is lazy, rude, burnt out, and prioritizes being friends with the employees over actual leadership and professionalism. This company claims to have a No-Jerk Policy but the place is full of them. A lot of the people there are grumpy and they can be quite coarse in training people. The training is a bit shame-based. Ask just about anyone there and they'll give you an ear-full on how toxic that place is. Even some of the people that transferred from other Panera locations said the one in fargo made them want to quit. And with the overnight crew in particular, there's lots of unprofessionalism in how they treat people. I had things violently thrown at me and yelled at on several occasions for very minor things. Very personal things about other employees being told to me that were supposed to be confidential. Bigoted comments and jokes. Duties being pawned off on others so they can stand around gossiping. And if you've ever dealt with a narcissist in the workplace, especially one that was in a leading position over you, and never want to deal with that again, i highly advise you not to work on the night crew at this location. You've been warned. And forget about going to the higher-ups about these things. They do not care. They'll even be annoyed with you for bringing"
bad,"Hurricane of pettiness and everybody stepping on each other's toes, dissfuncional. Manager was constantly using profanity one day and a mother and her daughter walked out and left because of that. If you have the chance of working for this company make sure it's not a franchise location like I worked at make sure it's a corporate location atleast there you will be paid fairly and it won't be as dissfuncional, because it's the gold standard. I decided I needed a real job not a half rate entry level highschool job."
bad,"We had some great line leads and managers when I started. Since then the GM has literally run his staff into the ground. We had 35 people when I started and at times operated with about 25. We lost managers and line leads fairly often as they were called in early or asked to stay late. Coworkers will call out and rather than stay and help the GM will walk out to go home while you're drowning in work. The assistant managers are amazing, patient, and deserve a raise. The Golden location is a shitshow and I wouldn't work there again for triple pay."
bad,"I worked for one year at Panera and it was an experience I will not forget. I took on a lot more responsibility than I had signed up for. And was promised many benefits because of my work ethic. The promises were always broken. I gave them a year of hard work and they gave me nothing. One good thing, I met some good people there. Customers and co-workers"
bad,I hate it there everyday I came they over worked me the manager and general manager was rude never gave me my raise refused to listen to my opinion and managers are always right in there opinion so really u have no say as an employee
bad,Work environment was very hostile and made me not want to work. The pay was minimum wage even though there are a lot of other companies paying a lot more. The management was not good at all.
bad,Most coworkers and managers were awesome usually in the afternoon. They are most likely willing to work with you in situations if needed and very understanding. They just didn’t pay enough for what we went through there and would sometimes cut the new employees short on checks. Nobody really wants to be there unless they have to. The job is okay at but shows it’s true colors after a while.
bad,"long shifts,poor training,management unavailable. i ran positions for 12 hr days 5 days a week alone when more people were needed. they focus on hiring minors cause they dont know better about how poor the conditions are. equipment was always broken or faulty."
bad,They need all new management for bakers and associates the store is filthy they lie about raises they lie about hours there is no room fir advancement the bmm gossils n tellls everyone other bakers business
bad,"Honestly, work somewhere else. I don’t know if it was just the area that was the problem. But the district manager had a huge problem with having a female in charge of a store and deliberately tried to knock them down. Incredibly annoying place and establishment."
bad,"I wouldn’t recommend anyone to work here at this time. Some of the workers are extremely hostile, and sarcastic, some are homophobic ( including one of the managers), and there is a horrible turn over rate."
bad,"Covelli enterprises is awful. No positive reinforcement, terrible pay, no accountability. Columbia market in serious need of help, starting with the district manager. Associates are paid poorly which in turn makes them unmotivated - they’re held to high expectations. Same goes with management in cafe - customers are great, but the over all operation with Covelli and Panera need a whole lot of work."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,The management was very rude and immature. I was overworked and paid less than everyone. If I had a change to go back I wouldn’t take it. I don’t recommend
bad,"You can work here for years, move up through management and still be told a million things you're doing wrong. Had more experience in the company than my GM and they constantly liked to degrade and diminish me every chance they got. Area coaches are great and willing to listen, however, in house management could definitely use some work."
bad,"I guess they give good benefits like 41k, health insurance and dental.  To bad the pay is terrible and can’t afford any money taken out of my check.  All I see there is corporate greed."
bad,"Working at Panera seems nice when you first start, but then it all goes downhill. I have never ever seen an associate be trained properly, we have these videos that you're supposed to watch to make sure you're doing things correctly, yeah no oh, I don't think I watched a single one. Working there oh, did one good thing for me. Help me find a better job faster."
bad,"Worked as an overnight baker for 7 months. No baking experience, but was trained in under 6 weeks, placed on my own at the 2nd highest volume cafe in the district, normal bakes being around $4,000-7,000 worth of product almost daily. Not including the catering orders. Thankfully this location had a day baker, but the day bakers did very little other than pan up. They never cleaned up, they never pulled the right amount of any product, I moved past that part because whatever, but I was alone doing these large bakes by myself while every other store had at least one assisstant for overnight. Even the lower volume stores had somebody come by on a weekly basis. The BTS's were overworked daily, one of them having to pull a 17 night in a row stretch because the BMM approved other's vacations. I requested off for an anniversary, one night off, all I needed. I told him months in advance that I cannot work that day no matter what. He approved it months in advance and proceeded to ask me 2 days before, ""do you really need off for that day? I know it's your anniversary, but I need you in."""
bad,"I dreaded every shift. Management is terrible and plays favorite. The company is more concerned about making money than about helping their employees. The pay is definitely not enough for the amount of work you are required to do. Meals are 50% off, not free. Overall a miserable, miserable place to work at. Do not apply here."
bad,It is easy to get hired here because they are always hiring because they are always short staffed.   The owners don’t care so they lose good managers and keep the bad ones which means they lose good employees and keep the bad ones also.
bad,A lot of flirting in the work place . 2 extremely rude mangers at this Panera bread . Suck at training.  Flies in the ice machine. Coworkers complaining about roaches.
bad,I really hated being an Assistant Manager at Panera Bread.  I was hired in as an Assistant Manager and the company really did not care about my training and hiring any staff.  Which left me working very short handed almost every single one of my shifts.  They keep terrible employees that never come to work or do their assigned duties.  Just a very horrible place to manage.
bad,"The upper management in this area only want employees that don't strive to uphold the policies or procedures. They want people that kiss butt and keep their mouths shut about what is really going on in the work place. If you hold standards high this is not the company for you. If you work hard and advancement should be based about what you bring to the table this is not the company for you. "
bad,"Panera Bread of Eden Prairie had by far the worst management I had ever seen. From the excessive micromanaging to poor scheduling/pay I'd give it a solid 1 out of 10. Not to mention, you're only going to average about 1-2 deliveries a night. Considering this job? Trust me, there are far better options."
bad,This place was fun to work at in the beginning. Yet when it came time to go back to school the managers completely disregard my school schedule so therefore I was late every time they scheduled me during the days I had class. Then at one point they never informed me of the schedule so I winded up missing shifts due to lack of management returning my phone calls.
bad,"A lot of favoritism. Managers will praise their friends even if they are not doing a great job and mistreat good hard working people and make them work even harder. As a result all the good people left and the store became a mess. Eventually the unprofessional manager got fired because she wasn't able to pass audits. All the things were expired or not in good shape because her friends weren't doing what they were supposed to do and the good people that weren't her friends quitted. There are no careers in this company or benefits. You work 35 hours and you are still considered part-time without benefits. If you happen to get stuck as a bus boy cleaning the store, you will have to work harder than any in the store and yet get paid the same. The only good thing that I experienced was that I got along with my shift manager so if I have to ask her a day off she would give it to me and that way I managed to travel a little and get distracted."
bad,There is very little advancement within the company. The managers made a lot of promises that they never followed through with. Overall not worth the headache.
bad,"I left Panera Bread because it’s was to far from my home I got tired of waking up at 3:50am to make it by 5:30 on the bus it’s was very stressful, other than. Panera Bread was good to me"
bad,They don't really care for their staff. If you show up on time and work hard it doesn't matter only the manager friends will get promoted. IF you report safety issue they ignore them and tell you to go by the rules and then don't themselves.
bad,Work horrible hours . Management is very incompetent but tries to act like she knows everything even when proven wrong. Treats bakers like they are nothing. Do not work as a baker ..
bad,"The managers don’t know what they are doing. They are lazy and barely survive running the restuarant each day."
bad,"Working here sucked."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,panera is a very busy high end cafe with lots of customers to interact with. they have good food and offer discounts to employees. open flexible hours
bad,"A learning experience,but learned a lot. Had the ability to meet such amazing customers and associates. Customers are definitely worth the experience and the smile"
bad,"They can’t keep employees around since the pay is extremely low. Terrible work environments. With no staff, standards are too high and unachievable.  People in the corporate/franchise environment, talk down the general managers and do not care about all the efforts they put in on the daily level. We worked in fear. If you work your required hours, you are threatened to work to get the job down even if it means working 70+ hours with no compensation."
bad,I would  say stay away from this company.  The management  will use and and abuse you . If you're  a friend  the with management  you  might have a chance  to make it  with this company  .there are too many  people  there that are always  looking  for ways  to make  your  life miserable  . You  can't  trust anyone  and management  does not care about you . You are just  another  replaceable  person  to them and nothing more . And there no jerk policy  is  just laughable  . Because  this place  is eat up with jerks . For a better  word . If you do decide  to take a driver  position   trust no one  at the Greensboro  distribution  center  .
bad,Get along wit everyone. No good benefits. management is ok but can be fixed alot. Salary is very poor always stressful at work but i can handle it very much
bad,"Hired for a driver position and then they try to stick you with ""table running"" shifts to fill up the majority of your hours because there are so few deliveries. Usually have 3 drivers working when its slow so you end up making a very small amount of tips. When inside you are wishing for something to do as you try and look busy. There were at least 4 different managers, all who hardly knew what they were doing. They have raised the wage much higher since when I worked there months ago so I'm assuming the turnover rate is still very high."
bad,Worst place to ever work! I wouldn't allow anyone I know to work there. I've worked here a year with no raise and have asked management in several occasions about getting one! Too many females work here and there is a lot of cattiness going on as well as workplace drama. Management is terrible and the workplace is unorganized. They never seem to keep anyone but always blame things in the employees.
bad,"Panera will promise advancement and training opportunities but will never make the time to accommodate a training schedule. It will become zero priority as it seems the business is constantly putting out fires. Always understaffed. Unreliable co-workers. Upper management does not care. Store management cliques. Top performers get ridden and slackers get away with Everything. Can pick up tons of extra hours but then they complain about overtime. As a manager they will transfer you Anywhere, even far away from home and they don’t care. Your problem. Be ready to put out fires on a ridiculous level of frequency."
bad,"The management team for the overnight shift could use a make over as well as a class in Ethics for the workplace. Lots of straight nights worked that don't add up to overtime."
bad,The coworkers are like family which is part of the reason I stayed so long. The management is terrible especially since the company has been bought out. They care more about the customers than the well being of their employees. I got 40 hours of PTO for an entire year that I had to fight to take because we were usually understaffed. Shift Supervisors do the same work as Assistant Managers and make a third of the pay and no salary/bonuses. The 2 years I was a manager I didn’t feel like one as we had to cover associates while we were short staffed. I’ve worked 12+ hour days and 7+ days straight during the worst times. It is not the worst place to work but I would not recommend it.
bad,"Terrible, once they went private it all fell apart.  Only care about the bottom line.  Cancelled associate raises without notice, changed manager compensation program for the worse.  Terrible upper management with poor people/leadership skills.  Claimed to respect a great work/life balance, but not so."
bad,"When I was training they literally made us chant ""bread is our passion soul and expertise""...my soul belongs to the lord. Management is basically a joke, they walk around with a dead look in their eyes like fish at a county market and write stuff on their clip boards. Completely absent until the dreaded once monthly visit from the regional manager, on those fateful days they bark orders like drill sergeants. They preach company values but have 0 follow through and then act surprised that they have an 80% turn over rate or that their few good employees are so frustrated they resort to acting like stark raving lunatics at least once a shift. They like to brand themselves as this eco friendly company when in reality the recycling bins in the lobby just get mixed in with all the garbage every day. It's a happiness cult that calls itself a company, don't drink the kool aid."
bad,"You don't get paided what you deserve, your treated poorly/like your easily replaceable, the management is horrible, and the teenagers that are most if not all the basic staff are unmotivated and unproductive."
bad,"I love to bake, and that's why I stayed with the company for so long. It definitely gives you a lot of independent freedom as a night baker, however the management was incredibly poor on both the baking and the store-front side which consistently caused problems for all the employees. On a typical night I would go in at 9pm and not leave until anywhere between 6-8am. Employees were constantly getting burned out by being forced to work long hours and jobs that were meant for more than one person, all by themselves. The pay is better than most entry level jobs however it still isn't remotely worth the amount of responsibility and labor expected of you. Turnover for the job is also incredibly high due to the poor structure of employment. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone."
bad,Underpaid and work with people with no respect. Managers are mostly teenagers with no idea how to properly manage anyone. Coworkers are rude for the most part.
bad,working in the cooperate stores in very difficult. Very often you feel unappreciated and over worked. The major up side is that this kind of restaurant attracts the kind of guest that are great for making connections.
bad,"My experience started out well, then fizzled. There wasn't much room for growth, and when I asked for additional training, I was ignored, or the promised training never occurred. I ended up training myself in two areas of responsibility, which was required, off the clock, because time was not allotted for me to complete these training modules."
bad,i worked for franchise so my experience does not relate to all panera breads. we were very underpaid. we made $3-$5 dollars less then the corporate paneras employees did. the owner is very very selfish and rude also. 50% off meals was the only plus but the food is so expensive that it doesn't help much any way
bad,"I was working as a loader using the palette Jack sometimes the forklift machine, parking bread, labeling, load the truck pushing cabinet start at 8PM to 12AM"
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"Panera was a terrible place to work. The hours were not flexible, you are not allowed to call off a shift even if it is an emergency unless you have someone available to cover your entire shift. The management did not work with you, they do not treat their associates well and they take advantage of them. They sometimes do not give breaks to minors with 8 hour shifts simply because they “don’t care anymore”. Panera is a stressful work environment with no room for mistakes. It is filled with drama, and managers talking behind your back. Do not recommend anyone working here."
bad,i think hardest part of this job is the mangers never helping and making you as an associate do everything even if that means two peoples jobs at once. and never helping when asking for help
bad,This is an awful place.  The store is supposedly cautious and preaches about allergies then I see the same gloves being used to touch all the food and equipment. Everyone is willy nilly and the atmosphere is super slow so we just sit and talk. My favorite part is being able to drive around town.
bad,the typical work day starts with u clocking in then getting told to do many jobs both in and out of ur position and are expected to work them without complaint. Management sucks and are usually all about the company and dont really care about the workplace or employees.
bad,The management was terrible when I worked there. If you just stopped for one minute to drink some water they would get mad at you and tell you to get back to work. They of course did have favorite employees who could do nothing all day and get away with it. For the lack of respect they have for their employees and the amount of work you do the pay is Not worth it. When it's time for your shift to end if you are on a register you can plan on staying at least 30 minutes late. You can plan on working 45 to 55 hours a week.
bad,Not  a place to work if you're trying to relieve monetary stress issues.  Not a place to work if you don't like rich people.  Not a place to work if you enjoy being respected.
bad,"productive and very busy, fast paced, exciting working environment."
bad,Wouldn't bother moving up at a store maybe the office has better advancement opportunities. At the store you are treated as if you are a child. Upper management likes to micromanage way too much which stresses the whole place up and makes mistakes happen.
bad,"I only worked long enough for training, the management team was always high on some sort of drug and forgot to include me in payroll. They also defended a worker who stared at me non-stop and tried flirting with me constantly, he was also about 3 times my age."
bad,"I would not recommend this job to anyone, Not enjoyable, Stressful, Everyone only cares about themselves (especially management) Very Strict, you have to go to HR with any problems because management wont do anything about it. Not worth you time."
bad,Don't work here. They try to pull you in with all these great things but they don't care about your family or personal life. They will work you to death cut your pay and it's nothing but endless amounts of drama it's not worth it. There are better jobs. The company is not ran the way it should be. No one follows policies or procedures. When you try to get things done it's a struggle because your DM and Regional don't care.
bad,"I have worked for Panera for a few months, and only have been paid for the equivalent of 45 hours total. The scheduling is a joke, only staffing people that fall into their ""click""."
bad,Working here in my position is bad. I need to beable to work for full time but I'm not allowed to work full time right now. I got in trouble for working 40 hours a week.
bad,"I worked for Panera bread for a about 3 years,  the experience was dreadful.  The customers at my locations treated me as the scum of the earth.  They were very difficult to please but that never hindered my ability to do my job.  I became desensitized to the grumpy customer base expecting the world from me.  I wouldn't go a week without getting yelled at over a piece of extra bread or a refund when  I was the fellow making the food.  I tried my best to accommodate these customers to no avail but like i said that never hindered my ability to perform the basic task necessary for me to do my job properly."
bad,"Very fast paced store which provides an environment I thrive in. However, managerial figures are not organized/skilled enough to be managing such a high volume store."
bad,Waste of time. You'll be given many excuses why your not hired on so they won't have to provide you with the Beneifits or pay raise. The management sucks & basically you're watched like a day care. You have to ask like a child to use the bathroom. If you're BLACK I recommend you not work here since you'll  be watched like a criminal & asked everyday to see your badge to make sure you work there. The managers watch you more than any other employees & you're provided more work. When I first worked here the job was great than all of sudden it became JAIL.
bad,Starts off good.. 65% discount is a rip off. Hires FAMILY membes and friends. Gives them full time hours. Severe favortisim high drama caused by GM double standards
bad,"My first week or so at Panera was exceptional. I was working with senor Bakers, very nice and interesting people to talk to and work with. Moving to the newest bakery in Plover, WI I was warned that it will be nothing like this and things are going to be new. I understood that a new opening for anything can be hectic and I had been in these situations before. However I could never have imagined how unorganzied, unprofessional, and just disrespectful management and coworkers could be."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"Panera Bread offers a friendly work environment with a modest employee discount. Besides these two things, the job is lackluster and under offers subpar management (Having worked at 3 separate locations over my years)."
bad,"Horrible management, long hours, no benefits, typically no breaks, extremely strict, hard to get a raise, starts at minimum wage and hard to promote"
bad,"Everyone believe they are all managers and bosses because the boss don't know which position they are in. Management have favorites that come in late do what they want go on breaks because they feel like it. They get to pick the days they want. Management is poor sometimes act like a bully as if we're in high school just overall  unprofessional."
bad,"Only reason i stayed there longer than i would have, was because of the people i worked with and the customers. I loved them all! Management and the way they ran that Panera Bread (33174) is completely terrible. Breaks were too short, pay was too little for the amount of duties and responsibilities. Closing was a nightmare. One person had to close half of the Cafe/Bakery. Absolutely terrible. I was always disrespected, harrassed, yelled out, etc. Absolutely the worst place i have ever worked for. General Manager (33174) was a complete *ss. Did not care about his employees whatsoever. That specific Panera Bread has gone rogue."
bad,"Constant 8-10 hour shifts with no break. You do not get paid extra for missing break because you fill out a voluntary missed break form. DO NOT SIGN. "
bad,"This job had long hours, third shift. They demanded so much in just one shift. I had to time everything perfect to make things just right while being out on time. Overtime was frowned upon. The staff wasn't the easiest to be around and I felt I did my job very well, I went above and beyond, but working conditions were not well."
bad,"I did everything from dishes, to working line, to cashier, prepping to drive through. I was a very hard worker and yet my manager treated me like garbage. My manager picked favorites and let those sit around and do nothing."
bad,I worked here for a short time. Learned dining room. Then on my fourth day was supposed to train someone New. I was still lost due to only one day of training. Actually only 4 hours. Overall just wasn't a good fit for me.
bad,"Overworked and underpaid, rude management, rushed, no benefits, not flexible, expectation of career not job, such large crowds and not many employees at hand."
bad,"I've never missed a shift and I always put in the effort to making Panera a better environment. After a year of stifled training, I finally became a manager and one that the employees respect because of my experience and leadership style. However our GM lacks that leadership and is overcritical and never supportive. I have excelled at everything Panera throws at me and there is never any confidence or support given to reciprocate. I also have NO limitations on my availability so my schedule is scattered and never consistent. In return, I can't even get days off when I request them months in advance and the schedule isn't released until 3 days before the week starts. As one of the more proactive employees at our store, I would expect some respect and kindness but get none. I have a greater potential that Panera refuses to accept and I have been wasting my time and effort on Panera Bread."
bad,its a job. ok for students but would not want to work here forever
bad,I liked working at panera at first nice people and easy to work with but I was promoted to baker after 2 hard years of work. Upon becoming a baker i found out how bad mangement treated you on the other side of the fince. If you made a human error there was grief given and seemed unforgotten. Co workers are awesome when i worked there and the hardest part of my job was dealing with mangement once I was a baker.
bad,"Dish washing duties, sandwich maker, bus tables. washing dishes and busing tables. Organizing the shipment when the truck delivered supplies for panera."
bad,"Worked at fdf for  seven years, was the seiner driver."
bad,Everything is fine with the job except that the GM is very rude and they dont give much hours
bad,"Very physical, fast paced job. If you’re lucky you’ll get a 6 minute break once a week. Don’t expect to get a lunch. You’ll be told in the interview you can get $15 worth of free food e/ shift but you’re responsible for baking your free goods yourself. May not seem like too much of a deal breaker but you barely have time to bake for the customers. They’ll also expect you to know everything in 6 weeks. Yeah not possible! There are no specific times for baking you just have to “know” when to take things out of the oven. You have to deep clean after e/ shift just to walk into a complete mess the next shift. I could go on for days. This is the closest I’ve been to scratch baking this position should make more money. Their turnover rate is worst than Walmart’s that should really tell you something."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,Very poor management lack proper training and professionalism. The location was very toxic which made it very stressful. I would not recommend them to anyone.
bad,"Great team aside from management. Unprofessional, disrespectful and rude. The pay is not worth the stress but it is a great opportunity to advance your resume."
bad,"I was treated as if I was trash, the co workers were nice and supportive, on my training week I was expected to know as if I was there for years, all work I've done management would say it wasn't enough, and if I worked extra hard, they would make me leave because I should not work more than 4 hours."
bad,"I’d say out of all the jobs I’ve had so far, Panera bread has been the worst with management. Mangers leaving and coming all the time. It was like there’s no reason to even get to know your mangers."
bad,"I do not recommend working here because in the end, you're stuck in that garbage hole with no way out. The managers are rude and want to get out before eleven and if you're doing dishes, they tell you to hurry up and get out."
bad,It was easy but the new manager was kinda weird and i feel like if the cashier have to do the dining room they should get paid more also the cashier shouldnt have to do coffe
bad,Everyone seemed really nice when I interviewed and first started. After a few weeks it’s miserable everyone is rude constantly the managers don’t care about your schedule (when you can and cannot work). Some of the staff are super nice and helpful but the others are rude and don’t help the new people with anything.
bad,I would not recommend Panera to friends or family. The promise one thing when you are interviewing and when it comes down to it you don’t get what was promised. Working 100 hours in 2 weeks for $950 paychecks as an assistant manager doesn’t seem to be fair
bad,Panera is a difficult place to work. Many of the customers are extremely rude. Also many employees have an attitude problem. The environment is very fast paced which can make the job stressful. The location I work at is very understaffed which makes the job even more stressful. Several employees were promised promotions and none of them received a promotion.
bad,"GM's run their store as their own, company allows this, so even though their is a handbook the only time they adhere to it is when it's convenient for them."
bad,"The pay is terrible and the managers have favorites. No job should have that, but they do. Only certain people receive raises or are advanced in the company."
bad,They allow customers to put in catering orders ANYTIME with no notice. Only job I actually liked until they didn't want to give me a raise but kept slaving me while praising how good my bake was. They don't care about their baker's. Least appreciated position in company but baker's do the most work .
bad,Used to be a great place to work. Now they are stretching their management too thin and raising expectations without increasing hours. No consideration for work life balance. Upper management has no idea what goes in day to day in cafe.
bad,"First of all, I used to work for corporate Panera and I'm a manager currently at franchise Panera in Ohio. It won't let me say the name of the franchise but every panera in Ohio is under this franchise. Panera as a company is fantastic, but this has been the worst experience of my career. Upper management is ridiculously corrupt, I've witnessed horrific things and can't even confide in anyone. If upper management doesn't care then why should associates or other management? As an associate, you won't receive efficient training. It will be miserable and you will feel used because management expects too much from you. You won't be paid anything, no opportunity for raises EVER. Everyone is always miserable all the time and it's a common understanding that this is the worst company ever among associates, it's literally a running joke. Franchise man only cares about money and upper management only cares about bonuses, so they'll slice labor in half and refuse to fix anything in the store because it cuts into their bonuses- while they sit on their behinds in the office and don't even bother to learn half the associate's names. As an associate you will be left dealing with the repercussions of everything being broken/not ordered, running a position entirely by yourself during rush hours, etc. My previous Panera jobs were the best I've ever had, but working under this franchise has been the most miserable experience I've ever had. I have worked in restaurants since I was a freshman in high school, I live for the fast-paced environment. But this is fast-paced in a different way, because"
bad,"this company does not take any real consideration for mental health, and anyone who may struggle with mental health issues. They are not very flexible at all and don't really try to meet your needs. The pay is good, and other employees are good too, but overall not a very supportive company"
bad,"I worked at panera bread for 8 months, starting off as a delivery driver. After about 2 months I got pulled into helping out with catering, and i loved it. The more I showed that I am dependable, the more they took advantage of me. I would get called while at home and asked about catering and stressed out. I've visited other Panera Breads and spoke with several catering coordinators. It seems to me like my home town is the only one that lacks these good qualities that a cafe would need to have in order to keep people. They will take advantage of you, so if you work there set some boundaries! And I don't suggest getting into catering if you plan to go to school or are in college. It consumed my life at home and was too much. They need a whole new management team and I feel like things would get better. What is a cafe without team work? We did have fun at work, and I learned the whole catering thing, so that was a plus. Also, it improved my social skills. I got a lot of good experience there for sure. But as far as the management, it was very poor and unprofessional. My co workers on the other hand, somewhat felt like family."
bad,"People i worked with were super nice and caring, but some of the managers seemed like they couldn't care for what I had going in my life since it was a hard time for my family."
bad,Working at Panera was a bad experience for me. I worked late hours on school nights and on weekends. The staffing was extremely short making the job very stressful for me and others working there.
bad,"Terrible management at both Panera Breads I've worked at, very underpaid for what the work entails, they chose favorites at both Panera Breads I worked at so chances for advancement are very low."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,Ive been with the company for 7 years and ive never seen it at its worse.  At this point everyone just writes there own rules and the management lets the staff walk all over them.
bad,"I worked at the 86th st spot right off of 465. I figured that delivering to mainly corporate places would be beneficial on the tipping end of things. SIKE! I started looking for another job as soon as I got stiffed on a 65 dollar tab last week. Funny thing is that I found out the same day that they were hiring a 4th & 5th driver. We only work lunch- 1030 to 230. You do the math on what will come your way. There were two peeps above me that took the higher double digit & sometimes triple digit scores. Smile in your face then place the knife in your back. Most I made was a little over 60 in tips. Least was 25. Then you get paid a whopping 5 dollars an hour at the same time. Coupled with the 3 dollar delivery fee, technically Panera is only paying you 2 dollars an hour. $2 dollars an hour folks. Gas, maintenance, wear & tear. So weak. In house folk get paid less than 10 an hr when McDonalds & Popeyes will give you at least that much. Company sells 10 dollar sandwiches but can cough up that much to the employees that bust their ***."
bad,Pretty sure any other panera would be nice but not this one or at least not until the manager heather leaves. If you need a job and don’t a have a back bone then this job is for you tbh
bad,You will have a job if you show up but don't expect a raise anytime soon . Too cut throat and  back stabbing at this company. No teamwork. Everyone is for themselves.
bad,"Over worked, undervalued, under appreciated . I have gone over and beyond, went through three general managers, with all different work ethics and have never gotten proper training ."
bad,Panera really doesn’t care about employees growning and expanding within the company. They are unfair when it comes to pay. I worked there for 4 years and when I left I was only making $10.20 when people who just got hired came in the door getting an $11-$11.50 offer.
bad,"the management at this location was terrible, they don't care about any of their employees. would recommend working at any other Panera, but this one."
bad,"This job is an O.K.for a first job. It shows how tough a job might be. With half the mangers show favoritism and professionalism and bias. This is not a career worthy job, but stepping stone to where you really want to work, Great way to earn experience, but that's about all."
bad,"I personally left due to management, and being denied a promotion that I had signed a contract for. They do not care about their employees. They are completely for profit, even if it comes at employee loss."
bad,"If you care at all about giving good customer service this is not the job for you. It's impossible to give good service to your customers when the store runs out of multiple things almost every day. A typical day will include 10-15 deliveries. More than half of those deliveries will be late, and or missing items through no fault of your own. There is absolutely zero accountability from Management positions, and most of the shift leads are very young and not trained properly to handle the tough job of being a manager."
bad,"When I started this job it was all great, but quickly my experience turned out no so good. The management is horrible. The one manager may say one thing and another one may say another thing. It wouldn’t have been so bad if the general manager would sat down and did things differently. I don’t recommend working here. They over work a lot of people and have too many duties besides just doing what you are hired to do."
bad,"The 10 months I worked here they had ten people hurt. The most serious was a guy lost the bone in the tip of his finger. I do have to say I personally never felt unsafe. But they never would take any amount of effort to train their employees. From ""Lock out tag out"" to properly doing their job. Do not question management at all, I seen a few of people fired for that. I resigned for here because they have a very poor corporate mentality."
bad,The managers at Panera are very rude and disrespectful. Don't work here. Unless you want to being treated like dirt. They treat you like robots not humans. I 2ould not recommend working here to anyone.
bad,the gm and most of the assistant managers are amazing but their is major understanding for such a high volume store. favoritism is huge here so male sure you get in good with the managers or you lose hours. over excellent place just burns you out quickly overwhelming you with hours and work to do.
bad,"My experience at Panera Bread included a serious lack of support from management, severe understaffing, a complete disregard for time-off requests, and an overwhelming - at times bordering on hostile - workplace environment."
bad,I do NOT recommend this job. I got hired on my application I put 20-25 hours a week as a part time associate. I got hired. After getting hired I never got put on the schedule for awhile. I called the manager he said they're over staffed and it might be awhile till I'll be on the schedule. About a month later I was finally put on the schedule. I was only put on one day a week for only five or six hours. Then they'd always tell me to go home due to labor. I needed more hours so I talked to my boss about it. He said there wasn't any room for me on the schedule and suggested getting a second job.  I got a second job later and told my bosses and they acted so annoyed after one of them suggested to. Also they let you pick your positions. But they'll have you do busser or dishes for months and when you start say it's only for a few weeks. Definitely would NOT recommend. They don't keep their words and don't care about their employees at all.
bad,a typical would be you come in and they tell you where you will  be for your shift and sometimes you will e switched in the middle of your shift and if you don't do you job right they will give you a warning then after that you will be fired. i learned not to ever go back there again. management was good to the employees. the hardest part of the job is coming to work work everyday because of the constent BS from other employees
bad,"A typical day at Panera bread is extremely buisness, that is why it was important to stay focused and off your phone. The management was very lenient but was also strict. The hardest part of the job was being left of register  by myself and the line was our the door . I handled it well because I'm very quick but it was all irritating because the customers would complain and I would have to explain to them why I'm the only one on register. Rhe most enjoyable part of the job had to be my coworkers . Very helpful and we worked as a team"
bad,"Honestly my time at panera was short for a reason. Don't work here if you are a person of color because they will NOT hesitate to pay you less. They don't let you discuss your pay rate with any other coworkers for this reason. 0/10 recommend, worst job ever. Also, their scheduling system is whack. So much room for improvement and my location was ""one of the best around."" Cashier is the worst position, avoid if possible."
bad,Overnight baking is good for a little while but the hours and stress and life style take a toll on your mind and body slowly but surely.  2 people working together most of the time and just listening to music and getting the job done without being hassled by others for the most part is nice.  I loved this job at first but it has taken a toll on my body and family time.  The pay for overnight shifts should be a lot more than what Panera is willing to pay and then they expect a lot in so little time.  Communication is sometimes good but for the most part it seems like a war between the bakers and associate sides of the restaurant.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"My time at Panera, unfortunately was riddled with poor management and bad scheduling. The management team was poorly organized and inconsiderate. A very unfortunate experience"
bad,"I cleaned the dining room "
bad,"A typical work day is not a typical work day because you are always being asked to do hard tasks that aren't in the requirements of the job description. I learned how to properly FIFO with the products as well as working the barista section The management is very strict and more than less inconsiderate to you as a person, they can really make you feel like you are not doing a good enough job. Generally, the co-workers are nice if they are having a good day, but if they are not in a good mood it effects the work environment. The hardest part of the job is closing the bakery because there are endless amount of tasks that need to get done for the next morning that are very time consuming. The most enjoyable part of the job is wearing a uniform that is the same as others, so we are all equal."
bad,I worked here for 6 months because I neeeded a second job. The mangement was very childish. The workers are young adults fresh out of high school and going to college. There was a lot of childish antics and grudges held at this establishment.
bad,"I couldn't even begin to count how many times I had to ask various managers to move out of my way because they stand around on their cell phones and don't pay attention to anything, then they all get together and group gossip for what seems like hours-on-end. Oh, and if a manager has to do associate-level work, they almost always complain and carry on the entire time."
bad,"Never work at the one in Mission Viejo.The managers will make your job unbearable It's also very cold and even customers complain about that, hate it."
bad,"it was horrible the managers are disrespectful, the boss will drop your hours for 40hrs( 6 days a week) to 5hrs ( 1 day a week)"
bad,"Typical day included dealing with extremely rude and impatient customers. I didn't mind working with the high school kids that worked on the line, the adults who were I was more concerned about getting along with. I got into a public argument with a co worker, and management took sides. Managers were not there to go to with problems and they are pushovers. For those that can deal with rude customers, questionable co workers, and extremely inappropriate managers then this is the job for you."
bad,"Difficult employment while in high school, high-speed and high-stress, inconvenient hours. Typical day included taking orders, preparing/cleaning/stocking bakery area, distribute bakery items/prepare breakfast foods (bagels/parfait/etc.), clean dining room area (stock, clean bathrooms, tables, sweep, mop, vacuum, etc.), making coffee, and occasionally preparing food on back line and handing out orders."
bad,The managers are nasty. They prioritize not losing profit over cleanliness and health. They also discriminated against employees when management changed. Trash company. The managers only care about themselves and didn't offer us overtime during the holidays because it would mess with their holiday bonus. I'd been working there months and suddenly they changed up their policy which caused a lot of us to have to quit. The manager also disrespected me and blamed me for things that weren't in my control. She took her anger out on me and I ended up quitting because she harassed me over something someone else did. This company is not great. The only good thing was the pay. The managers would made you feel bad for not prioritizing the job over your school or kids even though they swore during the interview that they would be understanding of students and parents with other obligations.
bad,Was hired for delivery driver and they only scheduled me during slow hours so 90% of the time I was in the back washing the dishes not doing delivery. $20 an hour is not even close whole working at Panera as a delivery driver. They pay you $5 per hour while driving plus tips and mileage. Was lucky to walk home one day with $30. It's been two weeks and I have yet to even get paid for my first day which was almost one month ago.
bad,"Working here is very much like you are a slave to the industry and it is very hard to enjoy it there. The workers were probably the best thing there, and maybe the food. But don't work there it's not worth it."
bad,It might have been the specific location I worked in but co-workers were unwilling to help in difficult tasks. I had an injury a few weeks into working and management refused to accommodate tasks which furthered the injury. I was also often kept up to 2 hours after closing (it was a very small location that definitely did not need that much closing time) on school nights.
bad,The cafe I worked in was like high school. They made assumptions early and showed favoritism within the employees. The GM was horrible in being inconsistent with ordering things for said employees as well as promoting people when they were unsatisfactory in doing their job. It’s hard to work for a company that treats their employees like that.
bad,"I was bounced around several cafes in the span of a year. All of them faced the same problems of mismanaged labor, high turnover, and unrealistic expectations. The GMs will throw you under the bus to cover for themselves. The last one I worked for would leave early, or just skip his shifts entirely. You don’t get to manage, you just work as an associate attempting to manage a short staffed high volume cafe."
bad,"I worked here for 4 years. Opened 2 stores and trained the new staff. Got promoted twice and even learned the bakers and assistant manager job. They hired a new GM and he fired a shift and an Assistant manager walked out all on the same week I was talking my first vacation in 4 years. He tried to deny my leave that was put in 8 month prior and approved. Because I wouldn't stay he called me worthless and told me that I wouldn't be missed and could care less if I came back. So I didn't "
bad,"I have worked for Panera Bread for just about two years, at the same location. Within that time frame the cafe has gone through 4 different General Managers. New employees last maybe 4 months, rarely do people stay longer than that. The management team needs a lot of work, and is one of the major reasons why the cafe is not successful. The work  place is intense and disorganize. Raises are rarely given out."
bad,"They will sell you a dream, no late nights ..most cafes close at 9pm. The turn around is quick thou. Closing would be 12pm-1030, then you would come back at like 7am. Oh don't forget the lovely 5am- 3pm, no nights right? You will sleep the rest of your day away. Panera expects a lot. They have a high turnover for managers because they will fire a manager for anything. Hints to why they pay so well. they will match any salary. You can make 60k as an assistant. Think about it why do they always need managers?? Red flag"
bad,My GM was fired for favoring all of their employees mental health instead of greed and the bottom line. She would work 16 hours days to male things better at that place and worked there for 14 years and was fired. Corporate no longer cares about people.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"To be honest my time at panera was really ruined by the management at the time. Considering it was my first job, you can imagine the impression its left on me finding out my supervisor was a dictator. She was on a power trip and honestly abusive. The place was horribly understaffed. (People got tired of working under her real quick) and there were people calling out constantly so the rest of us had to pick up the slack. Its was very fast-paced and there was no room for mistakes or you risked getting chewed out by her in front of the customers. It was a nightmare working in the morning when she was there. Night shifts were more relaxed and the other managers weren't as psychotic as her so they made it more bearable and were more considerate. All in all, i give my experience a 1 out of 5 stars but my opinion is heavily biased and i just wanted to rant. Things have changed there, someone new is in charge and hopefully doing a better job than her."
bad,"A typical day at work includes stocking that takes 10 minutes most, and a handful of customers over the course of 8 hours. Most of the time spent working at Panera Bread was standing around, and I prefer fast paced environments. I did not learn much from this job besides how to brew coffee pots. The hardest part was when people were slow moving on their dishes, and I would stay an hour and a half past close doing dishes. The most enjoyable part was my managers, as they were understanding and interactive. I worked 3 different positions and often worked 20 hours a week, as many of my coworkers did, and only 3 of my 20 coworkers were offered raises. The males were making $9+ and the $8.50 at most. I am hoping this was a coincidence, but even the certified trainers (female) were still making minimum wage."
bad,"I worked here for 8 months and did not receive a single raise. I proved myself as a dedicated worker who often trained new employees without being promoted to the proper title. Shift advisors are treated poorly, and although there is room for advancement, it only gets work as you go up. General manager was rude with customers and employees, I was terrified of her. Eventually she quit and we went through 3 new managers in a month due to the poor working environment. Would not recommend."
bad,"No chance to move up. Was told we were supposed to have 7 drivers minimum and only had 3 for 6 months.no full time positions. If it wasn't for the managers who did care, but couldn't help because there was no general manager I would have left after 6 months and not stay for 2 years. All the other employees are good people but once the company went corporate and where no longer cared for by Panera bread.was also told that I was to be paid $0.45/gallon for gas but was paid $0.34.if you are thinking about being a delivery driver,between 2:00pm and 6:00pm be prepared to do dishes because the only one that is there to do them is the delivery drivers."
bad,Panera has great food. They can be flexible with your work schedule. I would not recommend anyone to work for them in Ohio or the surrounding states. Upper management is questionable.
bad,The environment is a good place it's just with certain managers that is. Then you have the ones who would pick on some employees for the fun of it. There is no communication between upper class and the rest of the team. The employees are treated as if they are incompetent and should not be working there.  The managers are more about the drinks they had the night before.
bad,"A lot of what I had gone through was just not up to standard. I loved my job, do not get me wrong, I just could not work with others who did not care. Associates are one thing but a management team? That was really rough.. I really felt like myself and one other person were the only ones running things smoothly and efficiently. We also had managers who were just awful to our associates and I went out of my way everyday to keep every ones morals up and motivated but again... I can't be the only person. I put a LOT of my time and effort into this place only to be  stressed out 100% of the time. I took work home with me often and even when I would vacation it was expected of me to work from out of state (i.e Scheduling)"
bad,"A typical day at work at Panera was if you worked morning you set up the racks with bread and get ready to open. If you work evening you keep your station filled and be ready for the ""evening pop"". If you work night you keep your station clean and make sure the dinning area is cleaned. At Panera I learned that its not right for mangers to treat you with disrespect no matter what. The management was not organized and did not listen to there employees. At Panera there was a lot of different people with different personalities. The hardest part of the job was dealing with management. One of the mangers would roll there eyes and get mad if I told them they had a call from a customer or if I needed help. The most enjoyable part of my job was when I got to make customers happy a lot of elderly people came in a lot and it made me happy when ever they talked about advice in life or how there day is."
bad,"During peak-hours, its very stressful to get around and collaborating with co-workers who's not understanding the order. Management there is terrible."
bad,"Horrible job. Gave very little hours after talking to managers for more hours. The job wasn't hard, i am a fast learner so i picked up on everything pretty fast. Coworkers are great. Pay is good but the hours are horrible."
bad,I had an okay time at the beginning. There was good people and had a good environment. As things continued I started to dislike management and working there.
bad,"If you are a reliable employee, they'll continue putting you on the schedule. However benefits are limited to none, and management will change your hours and positions to suit where they need you. Pay is above minimum wage, and does include team tips, but falls short of cost of living expenses for a single person. Management is nice, but can be cliquey and gossipy."
bad,"Here n lake city I hated the manager very ruled and always cursing. Then hey cut my hours, I was working like 2 dys out the week... They pay is awesome it was 11 dollars a hour bi weekly"
bad,There really isnt much to say differently from the other reviews. Micromanagement is a serious issue. it wouldn't surprise me if every panera cafe was the same aggro environment i worker in. dont work here.
bad,"Associates at panera bread are great people to befriend, they are funny and nice to talk to. On the other hand the job sucks. The management is very bad and no one helps one another so some associates are left with enormous loads to finish while others just stand around. Management also just stands around all the time. They don't help. They don't clean. But they do get upset if things aren't going smooth. None of the Managers are trained in house and can be completly oblivious to panera's style of work when hired because they hire anyone with management experience from anywhere. In concept it sounds great but its not fun at all when a new manager doesn't know what they are doing yet they wont train you. ALL TRAINING IS DONE OFF HOURS. You do not get paid to learn about the company or any of the areas you need to advance in everything is self taught so that can be good or bad for people. I'll let you decide but It left a bad taste for me."
bad,"Don't get me wrong, Panera Bread as a whole is a amazing company. I'm a giver, and I love the fact they give back to the community as far as donating bread to the homeless shelter. That and their food is indeed fresh and clean and I find it's a great choice if you are choosing to eat healthier. Now, to the bad part. I worked at Panera Bread for three years in Salisbury NC. In that time I worked there, I received one 10 cent raise. I also worked multi-positions and was expected to keep up with everything for $7.50 a hour. Including doing drive thru by myself and have to prep food as well, and do barista all at once. The management choose favorites, and flirts with staff. If you were a favorite, you got to stand back in the office with the manager (not mentioning names), and talk to him for an hour while your partner in your area is stuck doing all the work. And if your not a favorite, your workload doubles. My manager had me train people, without the trainer's title. He yanked me around as far as getting the trainers position. Now, it's been years since I worked there, but I do know the same manager works there, and if you want to work for Panera, things might have changed and got better. I hope for the companies sake they have. But I do recommend working at the corporate store in Concord. If you must. Best thing I liked about my job? SOME co-workers were awesome and 50% off food."
bad,I hated working at panera bread. I had anxiety just thinking about having to go to  work. The co workers were rude and too faced. They would talk behide your back. I was new to panera so i wasn't as fast as other people and they would get upset and judge mental.
bad,Our routes started between 1AM and 4AM so if there was a call out from a driver I would be forced to take this route. Order of needed product was almost never done so the responsibility was always placed on the delivery dept. For these reasons I could never be i the office long enough to complete transportation compliances. Managers for my department were hired often and never there to long so I had to except all responsibilty.. This all formed a poor oporating system..
bad,overall I liked working there but the managers were unfair and made it hard to focus. They are constantly yelling at you and putting you down. never motivate you to do better.
bad,I love Panera bread its a fun and busy workplace were I enjoy working but I am looking for better opportunities. I am a runner I basically take out orders to customers and buss tables.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"When I first began at Panera it was amazing and very easy to advance. The turn-over rate at this place was ridiculous, the management was terrible and always come and go."
bad,"Petty managers, awful scheduling, constant negative remarks, lazy managers always complaining about labor, u will never get out less than an hour after u were scheduled if labor allows it. you are not valued here"
bad,"Panera is a much slower pace place from what I like. You are always helped by your team though. Panera does not have any benefits as well. If you are looking for a slow pace and team working place,it's your place!"
bad,horrible management by the strang corporation. they are horrible people that only talk down to other. worst company i have worked for
bad,"most of the actual workers and supervisors are good and decent people. in my experience, anyone above your immediate supervisor will feed you company lines and are far more concerned about the company than their employees. one of many examples: i was told to come in during a snowstorm which had even the turnpike shut down, and was told that even though road conditions were life-threatening and impassible, that i should risk it because ""we have such good health insurance for things like that."" this was an admonishment for calling off because i couldn't drive around two jack-knifed tractor-trailers. on the other hand, my immediate supervisors were all just good dudes trying to make a living. if i had to sum up working there: stick it to the man."
bad,"Responsible for all aspects of the café.  Spent half of my shift as manager in charge.  The second half was in position.  After my shift was done, I then was able to take care of my manager responsibilities.  I was in over my head.  I did enjoy the food."
bad,"What the company advertises as a great company to work for is insane.  There is so much underhanded maneuvers and backstabbing going on it is ridiculous.  Upper management - sitting at the office- has no idea how a café really operates.  Plus, our advertising company actually FIRED US.  Yes, they fired Panera Bread: ""too difficult to work with""  The $100 million dollars a year we paid them wasn't enough for all of the runaround that they had to put up with.  What does that tell you???!!"
bad,"Snakes that are not Men and Women but Cowards. No Jerks and Honesty...I think not! Need to be very careful, a lot of turnover!!! No Respect or Dignity, Integrity does not exist in Upper Management"
bad,uhhh...Think twice before wanting to work for the Panera in Gastonia. Management is HORRIBLE! HORRIBLE!!
bad,"wasn't too excited about this job, the employees were great, the mangers weren't the best managers."
bad,this company has a horribly high turnover rate. management is very rude and inconsiderate
bad,It was a summer job to make money. I was really good at organizing the kitchen so the company would constantly call me in for help which was stressful I was also expected to do much more work because of it. The management was nice but the corporation made it impossible to run the store as they constantly understaffed the place and I was being harassed to come in when I was not scheduled.
bad,"This store is run by women managers that take advantage of the men and work them like animals so that they have an easier day of work. They say everyone washes dishes but truth is only 5-6 out of the 30 employees have ever washed dishes. Many employees have already quit. The management is very poor. The day I quit I remember they had left all the dishes from the night before so that I could do the work from the night before and the day of and I had to get every dish done within an hour because I started at 11am and I was told have them done by 12 lunch time. If I am going to do someone else's work I would appreciate getting there pay as well but I'm not going to do other employees work and my work for $9 an hour. I have already found another job that is paying $9/hr that I enjoy because they respect me as an individual."
bad,"Panera bread on kirkwood highway in wilmington,de has horrible management."
bad,Alot is expected of you working for Panera Bread. The compensation is not worth the workload. Advancement is only given to those favored by management. Not the people like me who put they blood sweat and tears into Panera Bread. All for nothing.
bad,A typical day at work is fairly easy. The job isn’t too hard. Management could be better but it’s decent. Working at Panera taught me that the customer service role can be quite hard sometimes.
bad,"I worked nearly every facet of Panera and knew my job well. I loved my coworkers and found a lot of friends in them. The management is why I no longer work there. The main managers are a close-knit coven who did not listen to their employees' complaints. The general manager, while friendly, is aloof and will brush off any criticism of his management team, downright antagonizing some employees in some cases. The other managers are negligent of their duties and openly hostile to anyone who gives them difficulty. They are currently losing more employees than they can hire due to their own tyrannical style of governing. I do not recommend applying to work at this establishment until the management team has been removed and replaced. Otherwise, I have loved the years I spent here."
bad,Management doesn't seem to be concerned with productivity or their employees. Employees don't care about the quality of product and I won't eat there now having worked there.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"The Worse. Not managed well. Poor communication. Flaky staff. New ownership that doesn’t compensate properly, nor pay in a timely fashion. This business is all over the place."
bad,I work in Panera in Fort Myers in the Forum tje managers are horribly disrespectful and they have favoritism the place is dirty crawling with roaches and they started taking my hours away I don't know why people even come here its expensive for no reason
bad,"- Upper management will constantly move managers around from store to store, and then be confused when you are miserable in the new store. "
bad,Typical stressful because of the work environment. Typical work ethic expected for the fast food industry. You learn basic fast food skills. You learn to multi-task in a chaotic environment.
bad,"Its an easy job, and the management were some of the best I have ever had, but above them drag their feet in helping the store if something needs fixing, or if there are problems in general."
bad,"Managers have high turnover rate."
bad,"I loved every minute of working for panera bread and working around some great people who im still friends with, but they need to better train their mangers to be better leaders and not micromanagers and they need to increase the pay for overnight bakers. they do tons of work every night alone with little pay."
bad,"Fun to be at but there is barely room for promotions, only one raise a year with little  raise. Too many managers giving out orders so it's easy to be yelled at."
bad,Disrespectful management  the hardest part of the job was listening to people disrespect you  the customers were good and the good part was you met great co workers
bad,Panera has changed very much over the course of the last 10 years. What was once a company focused on its people has become only focused on the bottom line.
bad,work hard and deaf problem messed up The ADA requires employers to make sure that communication with deaf and hard of hearing employees or job applicants is effective. ... Employers should consult with deaf and hard of hearing employees about the type of accommodations that are needed in order to make its facilities and work environment accessible.
bad,Everyone comes in bad attitude already knowing the day is going to go bad . No one is supportive. The management is difficult . No one stays for long.
bad,Management was very hit or miss with this job. Some where amazing well other's would take personal vendetta against you. The job was demanding but the pay was worth it!
bad,"The environment at Panera is awful! You're yelled at, disrespected and not listened to! There is a terrible management staff and not a lot of cooperation with scheduling and hours!"
bad,"I would come in, clock in and wash my hands. I would put my mandatory apron on. I worked 5 to close for a month and my trainee wasn't very patient at all."
bad,"The way that the managers manage the place is terrible. There is no uniformity to their system. They move people up based on character and they won't work with those that are not the ""face of Panera""."
bad,"No appreciation for hard work. Keep demanding more out of the employee without any type of compensation.  Guide lines for time on job assignments were assessed six years ago and have never been updated, so they expect more work done in antiquated time study. Therefore, no break time."
bad,"Panera was a learning experience for me, it taught me how to become an independent lady and how to take on more responsibilities. The co-workers are usually a younger group. I did enjoy the customers there, they always had an interesting attitude towards the panera quality. The management was not great at all. It always seemed that the co-workers would get the best of them and there was never any structure on how to run a great business."
bad,Its a good experience.  I personally wouldnt return back to the job. Im greatful for the opportunity and the training that was provided
bad,No work life balance. Managers have set schedules which isn't productive to the work environment or fair to other managers including myself. Standards are not enforced by everyone employed. Unprofessionalism isn't punished merely ignored or laughed about.
bad,"They didn't have the best management at this certain location, made working a typical day pretty tough. This job includes working on the line, and preparing food for customers."
bad,"Nothing you do really matters. Any kind of work ethic goes completely unnoticed. I have worked under insane pressure with no way out and conquered it, but this place, creeps up on you. I feel like it's slowly killing me inside. Maybe it's just because I am overqualified because I feel so disconnected from the food. I miss the passion of creating it with my own two hands and the pride in each dish that reaches a customers hands."
bad,"This company while it has great values, donates extensively, and has great food also has its issues. It's easy to move up in this company but there is never any guarantee which store you will be transferred to once completing training, and even then you can be moved up to 3 times a year. This is designed to keep managers from feeling stagnant but tends to wear out the employees and becomes draining learning the new issues of every new store and helping it to improve. The main issue working for the company is consistency. Within my year working I've had 3 GM's, 2 DM's, and an influx of managers and Shift Supervisors. It's difficult to address issues effectively in your store and improve when management changes so often, and so many different managers have different opinions on the way things should be done, or how much one should be paid in a certain position. Within my district there is an environment created where a person presenting an issue IS the issue and it is treated flippantly and often brushed off or goes unaddressed. Either way, you either love working for this company or don't."
bad,"Biased, un professional, rude and I would never reccomend anyone there."
bad,"Training specialist , food cost specialist , and service specialist ."
bad,"Not gonna say when I started, but I will say that they literally schedule only one driver to handle all the evening orders and expect you to make these orders on time, especially when they come all at the same time or when you're about to be off with an order, you get blamed on the late orders, but when you look at the cooks in the kitchen being all chatty Kathy and taking their lovely time, they don't get blamed, at least not in front of you. The pay is just pitiful and just atrocious. I understand that as a DD you have to check your orders, but that does not mean the cooks are blind, they're also the ones that put the food in the bag for me. "
bad,Panera Bread only cares about money not employees. It does not matter how hard you work or what you are willing to give for them they will let you go with out thinking twice.
bad,"I worked at one of the busiest Panera Breads in California for almost 3 years and did not like a single second of it, to be blunt. Management was fantastic when it came to immediate coworkers and those you work close with, but when it came to upper management it was abysmal at best. Hours were constantly being cut despite the amount of money being brought in far outweighing a need to do so, new appliances or replacement of anything took at least a year to see any real change, and expectation was you could do yours and three of your coworkers jobs all at once.  This company DOES. NOT. CARE. ABOUT. YOU. The only thing they’re concerned with is how much money they can line their pockets with."
bad,I've learned a lot and it was fun while it lasted. Great for part  time or full time. Typical day is on your feet constantly coaching and maintaining employees. Workplace is friendly but pretty high stress/ Hardest part is dealing with people  that cant comprehend well. Also getting younger employees to do the right thing even when you're not there.
bad,"EMPLOYERS STINK. they bad mouth every person in that place, I worked there 2 years and never got any of my raises but still was working positions I wasnt getting paid for  Not to mention the boss bashed me due to medical issues and having surgery. great first job if theres new management"
bad,"A bad company the managers are bad the employees are 4 years younger than you and think theyre tuff but really suck at the job dude told me not to clean the salad line in the middle of a ""rush"" was slow af I was p"
bad,Job was slow at best and very low wages plus no tips. I only worked a handfull of days and they refused to let me go full time so eventually i found something else.
bad,"Panera Bread is always trying to mess up on someone's pay, watch your checks!  Advancing within the company is a joke. Dont expect to be paid alot since any lead position will only get you around $9/hr. Lots of favoritism and only given lead jobs to children. So expect jobs to be done poorly."
bad,Don’t work here this job is horrible they don’t clean there plates and silverware the soup comes out of bags everything in this job is nasty besides the salad
bad,"Management is terrible/rude, pay is poor, they don’t care about what you have going on for say if your a student they do not care. I dreaded going to work everyday it’s unbearable . (The Panera in Duluth Georgia 30097)"
bad,Horrible job atmosphere managers don’t know how to manage. Delivery is confusing set up no customer appreciation your vehicle will need service after you done a few deliveries they cheat you at your miles you should be paid
bad,I went home everyday very stressed and had to deal with work operations while at home. Not good pay at all and they do not give benefits! This is for a teen or someone looking for a LITTLE extra cash.
bad,Stressful. Overworked and underpaid. Managers are not easy to work it. They are not willing to work with your schedule if you have other responsibilities. Understaffed.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"The company itself is not a bad company. I however work in a store filled with miserable, toxic people. I need a better work environment where my hard work and dedication will mean something."
bad,Fast-Paced job. Way too much work with little pay out. Really stressful to keep up with daily customers and the work load the manager wanted from one employee and feel the manager picks favorites.
bad,Managers are catty and petty and rude and they all behave like children. You only get scheduled decent hours if the scheduling manager actually likes you and the work environment is terribly stressful
bad,Pay is terrible and the work is too much for such little pay. The coworkers are all childish and act like work is high school. Managers gossip with associates about other associates and it’s just a mess there.
bad,"This wasn't a great experience. I worked here for over 3.5 years and I still was treated like dirt. Management should be fired and replaced with someone who can actually run a store and be responsible. "
bad,Poor experience with the company and their fairness. No proper training and they more than often kept you past your shift's ending time. Sometimes randomly placed in a different work area with no training but still expected to do a perfect job and then poorly reviewed if you did a poor job regardless of the fact that you were not given proper instruction.
bad,"what, Panera has management? I was not sure of this information until now. Not a pleasant place to work, hostile work environment, absent management whom never seen even when tried."
bad,Mangers weren’t flexible with new availability and wasn’t competent to get associates their bonuses. Associates were never given raises no matter what.
bad,"Store Manager has a Napoleon complex. Like having power over his employees and even the baker's. He was constantly rude to EVERYONE he came into contact with, bakes weren't good enough even on the best days. Was a complete rude about it. Bakery Supervisor was even WORSE!!! Psychological warfare. He would call you once you're off the clock and barrade you with negativity, constantly cutting you off, raising his voice and making you feel low."
bad,Management sucks since they changed the GM. GM IS VERY UNPROFESSIONAL. She doesn’t know how to keep her personal life out of work. Takes out her problems with the employees
bad,They're not reasonable with their scheduling they give you a work overload and expect you to finish everything some managers are nice others not others don't even have time to talk to you about what's going on and how you need your schedule change they play with your hours and don't listen to you when you talk about what type of schedule you need and they're favoritism
bad,Everything about working here was terrible the poeple who you work with and the people you work for and serve i would highly recommend staying clear of panera when looking for a job
bad,"i had an interview on 6/5/19 and after the interview they hired me and said the sooner i start the better. I bough new all black shoes, black shirts and pants. It had been several days and I hadnt heard from anyone about when to start. So 6 days after ""date of hire"" i went in to see what was going on and the hiring coordinator looks at me and says ""we meant to reach out to you but we cant work with your schedule"". First of all dont ever ""hire"" someone if you arent 10000% sure it will work out. Second do not wait so long to tell people. Also during my interview the assistant manager told me that one great thing about the job is how flex they are with scheduling. I literally had hours i could work every day except one. I am also a single mom so i dont have open availability. I am in desperate need of a job spent the last little bit of money i had for this job just to get fired before i start. 7 days i could have spent applying to other jobs but i thought i had one. The location i was going to work has poor reviews because of being under staffed yet they cant ""work with my schedule""?? RIGHTTT"
bad,"It's more ideal to work in the mornings but if you're working night shift then you're basically screwed. Everyone calls out, no call no shows, and barely anyone shows good work ethic. Management in my personal opinion has gotten worse. The new manager really was passive aggressive towards a lot of the employees and some are very intimidated by them. I never once got a raise there after working there for 1.5 years."
bad,"I worked at Panera for a couple of months last summer. This was my first job, and I did learn more about interactions with bosses, co-workers, and customers. However, I did not enjoy my job at all. In fact, I dreaded going in. I felt poorly treated by the managers. There were times when I was forced to work off the clock and past the legal time for a minor. If I finished my work at closing, I had to help others, but if they finished they were sent home and I was left alone."
bad,"It was good working there. It was only like a 5-minute drive and the people were nice. A lot of heavy smokers and older men working there with police and drug records, so be careful."
bad,"They work their employees like slaves. You are replaceable to them. They would work me overtime and extra shifts and still did not show respect for me. They don't even allow you to eat for free on your breaks, even though they are a multi million dollar franchise."
bad,You're expected to learn everything yourself with no direction or hands on training. They just leave you out to the wolves while young high school students try and show you how it's done. But then again it's too busy to even learn. Very uncleanly and messy environment. No breakroom or place for personal items
bad,"VERY stressful. Management is all over the place. I’d be wary for those who want to work there.  I do not recommend working here, I've had breakdowns."
bad,"the place is gross, the management was god awful, the people are almost 90% the most annoying co workers you will have. they make you do ridiculous tasks."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"Limited time to complete the work given. I learned time management, stock room organization, sanitization skills, baking, and how to run the various machines"
bad,"Do not work here, unless you like making no money, kissing butt, fake cut-throat coworkers and incompetent managers. Did I mention no money to be made."
bad,"my typical day at work sucked "
bad,Upper management has no care for lower management. No communication and the communication given is done degradingly and rudely. Terrible company. Terrible owner.
bad,"I do catering full time lol , sometimes I work not even 4 hours.i have to use my own car so there's wear and tear, smaller  companies have cars to deliver,  75% of the time I receive no tips.the best part is panerabread took the 15 dollar  delivery charge away.it use to be panera would take 3 dollars and the caters would get 12 dollars . Instead they give us milage but it's lower then any other company.the job is good for kids for part time that's it, I'm sorry but the company did not even give a raise or a bonus after our president gave all companies a tax break so sad."
bad,"The day I started I was thrown onto the register basically by myself with 0 clue as to what I was doing. People quit left and right, like on my first day someone walked out. I got way too many hours and they didn't care when I would talk to them (managers). Since I was never really trained work was so stressful and I dreaded going every shift. The pay was also not worth it at all! I can see why they have such a high turnover rate."
bad,I had an incident with a door and some dishes. Long story short I hyper extended my left thumb and now it works backwards instead of forward. I went to the hospital and had some days I had to leave and didn’t get paid for thise days and they lied to hr about it saying they did.
bad,"I enjoyed my management team, always on point, helpful, strict when needed, and never treated badly."
bad,"I'll keep this short and simple. Overworked, underpaid, underappreciated, demeaning, uncaring, cutthroat, terribly managed, and most of all greedy. Prepare to work on Thanksgiving."
bad,If you are desperately in need of a job go for it but don't let this be your first job trust me. It isn't what I would consider a teenage friendly job.
bad,Panera Bread was not a good place to work at. The had so many guidelines that were essential in the restaurant business and yet not many of the employees would follow them causing stress on workers such as myself to over work and over stress trying to get things right.
bad,They speak to their employees however they feel in front of customers. Only want to deep clean the store when someone important is coming. They are over priced for their very small sandwiches.
bad,A lot of negativity was in the aroma when you'd walk in for your shift or leave. Either the managers or the other employees were always complaining about something that they're job required them to do.
bad,They genuinely do not care about their employees. They never let you leave even remotely close to your scheduled off time. Management consistently puts you in situations that are horrible.
bad,"The job is really frustrating overall. If you are a hard worker, the job becomes tough. People will rely on you for everything and expect your hard work so they can relax. Management does not get down and dirty and it is very fast-paced."
bad,"I have worked for Panera for 13 years and this is my take."
bad,No job security they let 30 employees go in one day. They promise promotions and don't deliver. They often cut hours in half. You can never get paycheck problems sorted out even if you go to the district manager. It takes forever for raises to get added. Communication from management is terrible. They don't answer your questions or issues or resolve any of your concerns. They save money at the expense of their employees. This company gives no advancement opportunities to those who deserve it and no job security whatsoever.They are only concerned with costs and saving money cutting corners and care nothing about the employees needs or lively hoods. Everyone is expendable.
bad,load truck deliver to customers   very busy  deliverys  to  a lot  of stores   good company to work for  learned  alot  about bakery business    no hard part of  job  liked   to be busy  all the time i enjoyed  the job worked   part time
bad,Depending on how you feel about working in food will determine how you feel about working at panera. I worked there because I needed money and left because I wasn't happy. But you should always be happy at where you're working
bad,"Supervise and participate in kitchen and dining area cleaning activities."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"I worked here during high school and they were not very flexible with my schedule. I would finish school at 3pm and have to be at work by 4pm and be there till 10pm or 11pm everyday. "
bad,Management changed. Then employees started to drop because of the new management. I learned how to prep food. Hardest part of the job was to remain calm during hard situations.
bad,Mangers were not understanding about how long it took to complete tasks and were always complaining about time it took to complete any task
bad,"This position was fun, and I always enjoy working with customers, however there were some organizational issues within management.  Innappropriate behvaior and comments from management. I was uncomfortable and left this position to focus more on school. It's a shame, because I love this company as a customer. Since working at a Panera Bread, I have noticed this treatment from management towards employees at other locations where I go to eat as a customer. Yes, I did contact Panera during and after working there to report my concerns."
bad,"it was just pretty bad over all. no other comment, I would not recommend it to anyone who isn't desperate/ borderline incompetent"
bad,"I would give this O stars if I could.  The location I worked at was awful. First off I was never offered any sort of a raise and worked there for almost 3 years and i started AND ended at minimum wage. The GM played favorites and if you weren't one of those people she treated you like dirt. It became the last straw for me when I was very rudely accused  by 2 other managers (both who are younger than me) for throwing away something that shouldn't have been thrown away. Funny thing is , is that I was off work that night and instead of looking at the schedule to see who was working , I was to blame . quitting was the best day ever ."
bad,I transferred to a Panera Bread in Chicago while I was in College down there. It only lasted a semester. The staff was great but the customers were not. But we all have to choose our battles. I didn't want to leave but I had to due to school ending.
bad,Again I learned that the hard workers don't advance and the slackers do. The upper managements resolution to workplace harassment is moving you to another store.
bad,"the worst job ever just flat out, never again will I work there and I don't recommend you work at this location"
bad,Working on the drive up order line. Management fair and good natured.  Co-workers are happy and easy going. Co-workers diligent doing their jobs. All employees provide excellent customer service.
bad,Terrible experience. Would only work here if I couldn't get a job anywhere else.
bad,Things that needed to be done got done but the management needed  a better way of making sure everything was taken care of. The store was run poorly.
bad,Never had many hrs the time period I was working there and very unprofessional
bad,"The work day went by very fast, because I was always busy. Although I enjoyed my job, the work place was often a stressful one."
bad,I love working with my coworker and eating the food.The hardest part was making sure the line was setup right.
bad,do not ever work here.  This is pretty close to violating labor laws of some sort. 
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,While working at Panera I have experienced the worst management. During my time there I have only given up two shift due to family obligations but since the time off the management has decided to cut my hours. I would never recommend anyone to work there. It is a very busy place but there is no organization and I never get out when I am scheduled.
bad,Managers are mean. Its a very busy workplace. Sometimes i would have 9 hour shifts with no break. If someone was late you would have to stay at work until they arrived even if you had somewhere to be. Nothing was enjoyable and you get paid minimum wage and have to perform hard work. 
bad,"As managers we usually just cashiered for 9 hours straight. Or they made us send all of the staff members home and we cooked, baked and washed dishes. "
bad,"Working for Panera Bread at time I was there, I didn't feel like I was being treated fair. Going into this field knowing that I have absolutely know clue about fast foods and the position that I applied for? I feel like they took that to their advantage. I wouldn't want to work for them ever again."
bad,"I hated this job, they took forever to train me and would blow me off so i had to play the guessng game of what i did wrong when i was called into the office"
bad,"Was good in the beginning, but management really fell off the last few years I was working  I would say though the workers are great outside of a few managers"
bad,Things at one point were pretty good. It was a place I looked forward to going to everyday. Managers and employees started bring personal things into work and things became very stressful. It was no longer something that I saw myself being able to do.
bad,Working at Panera is such a great experience but when you have a manager that doesn't do scheduling on time and you have kids that are not in school or any day care is kind of frustrating.
bad,"Working here was awesome in the beginning but once you get to know management your view on things change. Management is nice to your face but talks about you behind your back. I did learn customer service skills and I learned to work well in a fast-paced environment. But these skills I learned were not taught to me by my trainers or management, I had to teach myself most of the time. Walking into work should not make you feel uncomfortable and that’s how I felt all the time. If you have a good group of coworkers  the day goes by great, if not then good luck. The pay does not match up to the amount of work you’re expected to do. If you don’t ask about your break they will forget."
bad,"When working at Panera I would be working almost every day from the time I got out of school to 11, I did more work then most of the people there and was getting paid less then them. The schedule would come out the day before your next scheduled shift and it was overwhelmingly a negative experience."
bad,"Upon being hired as a Delivery Driver, I worked alone because we couldn’t seem to hire drivers that wanted to work, and our surroundings were a challenge at the time.. Quickly transferred inside to opening cashier (5:30a-3:00pm), Only having about 2 shifts with those hours.. I was content because I drove as needed too. Management was sub par... Didn’t really seem to care to much? But none of my concern... Come the slow tim, My hours were cut substantially... and someone hired after me was given more hours... 2.5 weeks without working a single shift.. I had to leave & find something better... When quitting management told me it was because I never showed up... Umm... no... I have calls from Panera showing that you told me “I wasn’t needed, because we’re super slow, so don’t come in...”  not a bad job... But be true to yourself and know your worth and what you can handle, no job is worth extreme frustration and sadness. "
bad,I was not comfortable and by 2 weeks of begin there my hours dropped without any notice when I wanted to pick up more hours it was a run around for me when I asked to be trained on different things I got told I can and never got trained
bad,"The company is - on paper - amazing. The franchise I work for is kind of embarassing. We are routinely understaffed, opening new locations and demanding more help/work from managers that are already killing themselves for pay that isn't comparable to hourly associates at other companies in the same market. The support staff you have (training department/area coaches etc) are never seen - I don't think I've seen someone from the training department in our store for approximately 6 months - so these people that are being paid to support the management team in ensuring CTs are on staff and helping to produce a pipeline and quality sustainable environment of development of associates to management are absent. Staffing is almost impossible to maintain. I've managed at a few other companies in the market - and I as a manager am making less than hourly associates do at competitors. My hourly associates are making minimum wage - as the franchise won't allow us to hire at comparable wages. For example I am making over 10k less per year than the average for my same position within the company. I am making that same amount less than equal positions in the same market. Honestly if you have managed in any kind of food before, the job itself is not challenging. Yes there's times you are working in position - but as managers you should be shoulder to shoulder with your team during peak periods anyways. The job itself, the company - none of these are the issue. At least in my experience it is a direct correlation between my respective franchise wanting to cut corners as far as how they compensate"
bad,"The company is fairly new and it shows. Everything seems all over the place and they could really use some innovation when it comes to how they do things.  For instance they're always scheduling either really long days or really short days with very low hours and always want to cut labor. They have a bunch of unnecessary stipulations of how they want things which hinders productivity. "
bad,It sucked working there. It just paid really well. The only reason why I stuck around was because of the pay. Other than that it was so stressful. I would close then wake up and open.
bad,Panera bread is the worst place I’ve ever worked. The manager was rude it was a month before I got my first check. Also my coworkers would do things to the food.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,They only move up the people that brown nose their way up. They don't appreciate the work you do to go above and beyond. Would not recommend working here.
bad,This company is ran horribly. You don’t get the hours you were promised when you got the job because they keep hiring more and more staff about one or twice a week. Leaving the people who’ve been there for months or years getting less and less hours. On top of that they reduced pay because of how much over time they were in. Which could be solved by not constantly hiring one or two people a week. Management is a joke as well. They constantly contradict you. I would be ringing people and then at a low be taking out coffees or helping the other ringer bag items for customers to increase the speed. But would be yelled at for doing so. Therefore I stopped doing it. Then five minutes later I’d get yelled at for not doing what I was just yelled at for doing. The other employees were great but you couldn’t get to know them or talk to them cuz you would get yelled at. Which made it a. Er boring and isolating job. The only good management already left due to the issues to.
bad,Worst company I worked at baking they leave u In the store alone if u working overnight it’s hard to change ur schedule and they dnt pay u e enough I had a employee say something racist to me and they did nothing about it I
bad,"The management sucked they couldn’t go and communicate anything to each other. All the workers got treated like dirt at one point or another.you were treated like you were easily replaceable.If they need people for like a holiday or something and a lot of the workers called off,they would go through the list and anyone who declined working that day they would drop there hours.the only good part is the worker are a family of there own we all cared about each other"
bad,"It’s not the worst place I’ve ever worked, but it has a toxic workplace environment. Management is neglectful, doesn’t train well, and frequently projects blame onto the employees for their own irresponsibility. Managers definitely play favorites, and spend a lot of time taking smoke breaks and trash talking employees they don’t like to the ones that ally with them. There is unequal labor distribution and some workers are left with the expectation to pull all the weight for the whole group. People quit constantly, so expect to be pressured into getting more hours than you signed up for. The only thing good I can say is the tips you get that go into your paycheck.  Not really worth the passive aggressive work culture though. For that reason I don’t recommend."
bad,"Don't work there. They just use you and don't care if youre stressed or not. Its a toxic place to be. Everyone there talks so bad about everyone else, even the managers."
bad,This review is strictly for Covelli owed and operated Panera Breads. Panera is ran by people who have selfish intentions. I have worked for Covelli for 3 years and have seen him only twice. I have only gotten the minimum of raises even with working to my full potential. GMs are no better than those higher up. Stores fail because there is no sense of leadership. There are no benefits. Hours are scattered and chaotic. A horrible company to work for. Has completely ruined my sense of self worth due to always working hard but being treated like nothing. No recognition. No “thank you”s. Favoritisms.
bad,"typical work was 12 hours shift with no breaks"
bad,"Panera bread on 86th and cooper rd is one of the worst jobs i ever had. I would NEVER recommend anyone work here. I was promoted to a shift manager but had all the exact same responsibilities as an assistant manager yet no opportunities for bonuses. Nor was i able to move up because i was not needed. The way the management talks to the crew wasn't always professional and the GM at the time was a horrible"
bad,"Being there 6 years, I realized, they don't care about the standards, they treat you like a hot mess, and they will favorite anybody over a hard working individual who works 54 hours a week. You voice your concerns, they tell you to take care. This is not the place to really work for. They move you over and over before even bringing it to your attention."
bad,"When you work for panera, you’re assigned to be trained on one role. I was assigned on production, making food before I learned how to maintain drive thru and front and the lobby. However, I never received a raise. I was told if i was certified on at least three different areas, I would receive a raise. I never did for the two years I worked at this location. Never."
bad,"Very poor experience, very hard manual labor for low pay. Co-workers were nice, job wasn't too hard but the cleaning and scrubbing for 8$ I will never do again."
bad,The managers are are only looking out for themselves and the times on the screen. They don't care if that they don't even have enough employees to cover the shift 😡😒
bad,"Have you work crazy amount of hours put everything on you! Upper management says ""just tough it out"" no training really you folow a book for awhile and then youre just a regular employee except youre in charge."
bad,"I worked there for almost 2 years i was a dedicated employee, i always showed up on time for work, i never called out while i was working there, and i always picked up somebody’s shift if they needed me to, and my manager basically did everything she could to fire me when i informed her i was joining the military."
bad,"I left this employer because I felt I was overworked. It did however expose me to different types of customers, which was great because I wanted to improve my customer services to better service them. It's is a great place for a teenager to work. I had many family members start their work experience here and I am very glad they did. The food is really work and Panera's food standards are really high, which makes the food really good. Panera Donates their left over bread to charity and that is one thing I really felt good about, that they didn't let bread go to waste."
bad,"Very good job at the beginning, management got worse and they started hiring less qualified employees for more money. Very demanding and fast paced. Friendly work environment, terrible management."
bad,"It may have just been the location that I worked in, but I also had issues with scheduling and was overworked a lot of the times. I was a minor at the time trying to finish HS strong before college and they found the need to schedule me almost every day after school to close, or 9:30 the latest I could legally stay. At 9:30 I would clock out but then would be made to stay till actual close without pay on a weeknight (depending on the manager who was on that night).  When my sport came up and I could no longer work other than Sundays due to my prior commitments which I made clear when being hired.  They just stopped scheduling me altogether and REFUSED to tell me if I still I had a job. I walked in and asked one afternoon and was LIED to by my manager who even pretended to write down the days and times I was free."
bad,This is not a job for everybody and it was definitely not for me. I would not suggest working here at the location I was at but it may be very different for others & in different locations.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,The company complains about hours and will not let you get full time but will hire new people to fill in the spots. Management only cares about themselves and will bring a bad attitude to work. Different people make different types of pay. There is definitely favoritism in the company for who gets to move up
bad,"A typical day at Panera Bread is getting right on the clock and making orders for the customers immediately. I learned how to work very fast while multi tasking, how to interact with customers and handle difficult situations on my own. Management was friendly but very inexperienced and lazy. The hardest part of working at Panera Bread is working so hard and getting paid so little as well as not having a set schedule and little hours. The most enjoyable part of working at Panera Bread is interacting with the customers."
bad,the managers at my location had no regard for workers available hours because of this there was a high staff turnover so workers were constantly needing to train new staff.
bad,I loved working with the public; the best part of my job at Panera were my customers. Management changes and a poor work environment became stressful.
bad,Very Stressful Days working there management was lazy and never came out of the office we stressed out with one person on the line for breakfast to make food without any help or any concern for the customers. Customers estimated wait time was at least 5 minutes General manager not familiar with employees or customers could not ever help out in any area if anything made the situation worst. Glad I left that place and feel sorry for others that endure this type of treatment from this establishment.
bad,"poor management, terrible costumers. my hours were never constant, food was too expensive, the kitchen was gross and a lot of homeless people using the bathroom, doesnt surprise me they shut down."
bad,Most of the people in the store I was at don’t care about the employees they just care about making money. Also when you make one mistake they either fire you or never give you hours.
bad,Working at Panera Bread was horrible. It was stressful and the expectations of you were unrealistic. The company has a high turnover rate and the management staff is terrible. The only pro is probably the discount you get on the food; you pay basically nothing.
bad,Not the best place to work. very unfriendly staff. impatient people. Didn't receive the proper training. Everyone was not very understanding or helpful people.
bad,"Exhausting, supervisors do not communicate to each other. To many chiefs, not enough Indians. I really don't recommend working there unless you are under 25 years old. That's all I have to say."
bad,I hated this job because of the pay the coworkers were cocky and arrogant and would talk about every and anyone when their back was turned. the pay was horrible as well as managment
bad,"While working at panera bread it was extremely stressful and highly unprofessional. I was expected to do things that i wasnt trained for, i would have one manager to tell me its fine if i went into over time they needed me while the other screamed at me. Situations werent dealt with professionally and the worl environment was exhausting."
bad,My personal experience at Panera Bread wasn't a pleasant one. The poor management styles of the various assistant managers clashed daily and bumbled overall flow of production.The close-knit kitchen staff were immature and childish in their treatment of other crew members to go as far as to set up others for failure at their positions. The company was unwilling to be flexible in order to set workers up for success. Nor were they understanding of time off needed due to health issues WITH the proper paperwork in place. I will never set foot in a Panera Bread again.
bad,"this job isn't for just everyone. It's great if you're in college and just need some money on the side, however, don't work here if you're looking for a stable job,"
bad,"The location I am at has poor management, asks you to stay late everyday and gets mad if you can't, never out on time. Scheduled until 2 and you are not able to leave until a manager approves it meaning you can be there working until 2:30-2:45 because the manager will keep asking you do do things."
bad,"The gerenal manager was very unprofessional, in the fact that she would talk poorly about employees to other employees and was never incouraging but always was yelling at the employees who were most all 16 and it was their first job."
bad,"typical fastfood starting job for teenagers, pay is low and hours are short. fun fast paced, good for high school  students looking for a first part time job."
bad,"I worked for this company for 3 years and the first 2.5 years were alright, the last 6 months has been pretty rough. New management.. truly showed they take advantage of me and do notncare about me calling me at 4am the morning after i woukd close, which meant i woukd get home aroubd midnight. Every time i had a day off they ALWAYS called wanting me to come in and cover for someone who called out, or when they messed up someones schedule they wanted me to go out of my way to trade shifts to nake someone else happy. Very poor management. Very understaffed. No room for advancement, got a 50 cent raise in 3 years."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"The company is horrible as a whole no good benefits no good pay always have to attend a bread bash meeting which is always on a Sunday at 8. some of the management was cool but the gm was very rude, she claim to be there for you but technically not. Basically panera wants perfect but they can never have that. I work hard for the 3 years to have a position that i know i have  earn to be giving to someone who wasn't even no where near qualified. Also the hours was not that good either especially around the holidays your hours are cut really bad for example from thanksgiving til mid February or march thats when you will see better hours with this company."
bad,"Management is horrible. "
bad,I am a former employee. I would not consider panera bread in matteson to be a well ran establishment. Employees' jobs are not safe. They allow their customers to treat their employees poorly.
bad,"A typical day started at 6am and a nasty look from the GM. if traffic was bad and I was late after I was changed to a different position and wasn't told about it. you are encouraged in the employee handbook to call corporate if anything isn't right or if you are being treated unfairly, I got bitched out by the GM. it is said in the handbook that no backlash will happen. YEAH RIGHT"
bad,The managers are ok the people are fun and understanding at times
bad,"Management is terrible. They have no idea what they are doing, they are over staffed, and even forget to put employees names on the schedule."
bad,"just a typical retail job but the people are great, what can I say"
bad,"Poor management values. Every workers is related in way or the other, friends, ex lovers, friends from the hood, etc. making the work atmosphere filled with irresponsable behavior and poor supervising."
bad,I didn't enjoy working at a grocery store. It was disgusting and people weren't nice. 
bad,"Not a good place to work at-daily harrasment, terrible pay."
bad,"customers are rude, managment is rude and unfair. coworkers try to make the best of it, but there is only so much we could do by means of management. hardest part of the job is trying to keep smiling after being mistreated by customers or management. most enjoyable part of the job is probably when a customer actually thanks you or compliments you on whatever or maybe even closing time ! that is exciting"
bad,Managment is a freaking joke. High school students could be your manager which is not right. Not near the experience to meet that type of responsibility. The GM where I worked was a total donkey. This company is beyond inconsiderate with things in your life. ESPECIALLY a loss of a family member.
bad,"Very negative work environment, no upper management guidance, overworked employees."
bad,Panera is a great place to work at. Employee is like family.  The paid is ok. We are smoke free environment.   It's a place where you can feel at home.
bad,"Term of employment: 10 months (3 months full-time, 7 months part-time because of school)"
bad,I wouldn’t recommend working here  no raises given unless you want to be management or beg  I worked very hard and got no respect  no one wants to do their job properly
bad,Our best manager was moved to The Strip location and ever since it’s been awful. The assistant manager talks bad about the employees she doesn’t like and did not take any of my availability into consideration despite me filling out an availability sheet. You are forced to work almost every part of the store and the pay does not compensate for it since it is minimum wage. And when you’re a driver  you get paid less when you’re on a delivery versus when in store.  Overall the Massillon Panera has gone extremely downhill and has become a pretty bad place to work. The only redeeming factors are the Shift Leaders and other employees.
bad,The company needs some work. The managers are very unprofessional and will talk to you crazy in front customers and coworkers.  the pay is very low. Imagine wha acres
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"all the mangers there are in a little clique. there is little professionalism, they talk badly about other employees to each other, they stress paying for food and not eating on the floor yet they do it themselves. The managers here abuse their power. One manager was having inappropriate relations with another employee on the premises. They make you do way more than you are paid for."
bad,"Working at Panera for almost 3 years was incredibly stressful. Every day was stressful and managers were always micromanaging and making associates even more stressed. Customers are always trying to get things for free and in general treat employees poorly, as well. Pay is bad and good luck getting time off when you need it. Some co-workers were nice, others were gossipy and rude. Glad I'm not there anymore"
bad,"Working at Panera now is definitely not how it use to be when I first started. All Panera is at the DuPont location is Just nothing but unnecessary drama throughout the work place not only with employees but management as well. All due to we all aren’t on the same page, because everyone is so worried about who’s doing what or who can’t do their job right. it’s really unfortunate and it’s getting really out of hand."
bad,The entire time I worked at Panera in Buckhead it was a total disaster. The employee turnover was rediculously high. None of the managers had the same standards or values for the company. A lot of times you would be asked to do more because other people would refuse to do aspects of the job. There was no training. Different standards and expectations for different employees. New employees were hired on at higher rates than current employees. Management could not be bothered with employee concerns. All they did was place blame and ignore the problems.
bad,"Management accused me of lying about being snowed in with 18 inches of snow and then when I showed them proof, they continued to say ""well its sunny here, so get to work."" My safety was not of importance to them, and I will not work for someone who accuses me of lying when I was being 100% truthful."
bad,"Random scheduling, poor management, watered down training (many times new employees are set to train the brand new ones), and a painfully obvious display of favoritism."
bad,Terrible pay. Terrible management. Don’t work here you’ll regret it. Opening Manager is barely ever on time. The environment sucks. Everyone hates each other. You don’t get paid breaks.
bad,"The entire staff is made up of high school kids, and the adults that do work there are childlike. If they don't like you, they will do their best to bully you into quitting."
bad,"They treat you like a number,  management will watch all your training videos but still expect you to be able to do everything prefect from the moment you are told. Most management attempts to be hands off and hide in the back, frequent smoke breaks (only for management), Will not follow your availability. Also not a clean place to work, have a super high turn over rate"
bad,I would not recommend this job to anyone. Managers kept putting me on night shift even though I told them I couldn't. The clientele is very petty and the asst manager fired me after I told him for the fifth time that I can't close. The only good thing that came from this two-week dilemma was the check I received after working 60 hours.
bad,Definitely not my favorite job but it was a job. There store hours were completely messed up and it made it hard for employees to work there schedule and it meant alot of people got layed off. The pay was also very little compared to the amount of work ethic we had to do and it was just a messy job location.
bad,"you need to work all around."
bad,"I first learned how to make the food for the customers, then went into learning how to prep all the food for the day for everyone to use for the day. As time came I started to train new employees also."
bad,"absolutely terrible hours. everyone is absolutely tired of the job.  no one likes working here. way too many people have been hired and its nearly impossible to get even 3 days for around half of us."
bad,"Panera is such a fake place to work. They act like they have all these great work ethics and positive outlook but it’s all a lie. Plus, Panera is doing horrible sales wise so be prepared to have your hours cut constantly."
bad,This place was created at first that's because you don't know the people and what they're about. Typically in a day you get to work and your told that a particular duty is awaiting your instead of doing it during the day. They spread your 20hours over the course of 7 days and you work 4 /5 days Management personally attack you have you there for long nights trying to make them look good for closing shift .And you can't call off because we're understaffed.
bad,No help for bakers you do everything. They will work you to death over 60 hours a week day and night. They schedule you through your vacation and dont even get me started on the shady ppl working here.
bad,"This place was an ok starter job but it is not enjoyable by any means and it isn't something I'd recommend for a more long-term kind of job. One of the shift supervisors where I worked was very controlling and had anger issues, also cursed a lot and was very insensitive, and obviously had allowed all of the relatively non-existent power of being a shift supervisor go to his head. They'd pay the new people more money than the people who had been there for years. They were relatively always understaffed. They would hardly ever be flexible with your schedule, and even if you told them months in advance about time off, AND they even approved it at that time, they'd ""forget"" about it and schedule you that week anyways. The only upside while I was there was that the other employees, and like 1 member of management, were very nice for the most part."
bad,"Scheduling is off the wall inconsistent and plain terrible. Like most corporations or franchises, management only recognizes that they have a life outside of work and not their employees. We're certainly not paid enough for the cost of living in my area either. Regardless, I certainly wouldn't recommend my friends to work for panera."
bad,"In the beginning, I enjoyed the job a lot because I was learning and it felt like there were places to go in the company. As I continued working with panera, I saw more and more shortcuts being taken. Boxes left out in view of customers, bare minimum staffing, constant callouts, ending shifts early and leaving more work for the next shift, etc. Out of the dozens of people working at the cafe, it seemed maybe 4 or 5 cared about providing a quality service."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,It was alot to take in for the 1st job and I wasnt properly trained so I couldnt get used to it as easily as others and they kept giving days off way too much and id only got to work 2 days outta week
bad,New mangers every 2 weeks. With new mangers they like things to go a certain way so for 2 weeks one thing would be right with this manger and the next week it is wrong.
bad,"poor management, you can only use your discount on yourself and yourself only, and only before you clock in, after a shift or during your break. always cold in store"
bad,"I will say I was trained properly before beginning to wait on actual customers which is a plus.  Management was like a swinging door, constantly changing which was confusing.  I think in three years I was given a $.25 raise. I had asked several times to be compensated to match the new hires coming in which were all high school level.  I was never given a raise so I quit."
bad,Even though I learned alot the environment was harsh and extremely unprofessional. There were some very great hard working people who where drove away due to the  unprofessionalism  of the  general manager.
bad,"After working 2 years with the company, I have learned that very little concern or care goes into the needs of associates or managers. Most employees are expected to work long hours without the guarantee of food breaks. There are no reward systems in place for good employees and very few punishments for low quality work."
bad,Management is bias and prefers to promote those who they like rather than who qualified for the position. It was hectic and stressful. The upper management usually ignored the stores issues or problems.
bad,"Always had to pick up the slack from others, because they always had to hire new people that didn't know how to work because they were new. Couldn't keep employees around because they treated employees awfully and didn't pay enough to put up with it. Management sucked, not sure what else to say regarding management. They were young college students that didn't know how to deal with simple problems. The hardest part was doing all of the hard work because I was the only guy and they wouldn't make the women do it."
bad,"Customers were atrocious. Was harassed on almost every shift. This job is a great first job, but don't expect to move up unless you've got a spiteful, condescending personality. Not to mention. the managers I trusted also harrassed me just as much as certain associates. Pretty sure my experince from here has caused me psychological problems as well. There are pros nonetheless, but because of the harassment, the pay and overall work conditions were horrible."
bad,"The pay is miniscule, the hours are long, there were often problems in the back of house such as AC units breaking in the middle of summer, no guaranteed lunch break, terrible management and no consistency in procedures. There is little to no room for growth and they expect a lot from their employees and give them very little in return."
bad,"It was overall an okay place to work. Management was rude and didn’t care to work with your lifestyle, but the staff was normally friendly and good to work with."
bad,"Management did not care about employees, only sales. Corners were cut every chance they got. Strawberries are moldy? Cut the moldy part off you can still serve it! Food not properly stored. No place for advancement and managers liked to get involved in drama with regular employees causing problems between the entire staff."
bad,It’s just a people mill that churns thru employees and managers while the upper management gets rich. Your typical fast food place. It sucks but it’s a steady pay check
bad,Transportation manager at the stockton FDF adds a lot of  Unnecessary stress work culture is very unwelcoming transportation manager makes it possible
bad,Was hired for a full time job. It took over a month before they were able to start me. After starting I only was given a few hours a week to work. Most of the time the hiring boss was not there.
bad,"Working for the Panera Bread is like having all joy and creativity zapped from your life. If you are over the age of 18 do not work here, they will exploit your physical and emotional labor. Managers are not understanding of both mental and chronic illnesses, they will bully you into doing what they want, and they will make you feel like dirt. "
bad,"It was a very fast paced environment. i was never fully trained, i basically learned on my own other than the computer training but the training i did on the computer wasnt even the right one. the only good thing there was the food."
bad,"Be prepared to work doing many different chores, no raises, low wages, bosses do not care one little bit about you, it really is a shame. Good product, great customers, but lacking human empathy."
bad,Company lost its training motivation and is not so well and diligent focused on training new staff form all company levels. The goals and strive for success are no longer there. There is too much drama involved and way too many tasks are performed based on emotions rather than results. Employees and managers are not giving %100 of themselves anymore.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,Both management and employees are super rude and tend to gossip as well as form clicks against new employees. The managers as well have attitude problems and are very fake to both customers and employees. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone because of how inconsiderate scheduling is no matter what you request at the interview or ask for later in the career. Despite any plans outside of work life they will schedule you as they please completely disregarding any other commitments. The only thing I enjoyed from this job was getting free food at the end of the night and a very small pay check.
bad,"I enjoyed working with the people there. However Panera's management system was terrible. One time I had a customers asking for a manager. When I asked one of them to assist the customer, the reply was that that she could not leave her area because she is not in charge. It make no sense when a customer is in need of help."
bad,It gets crazy working at Panera Bread but it gets fun when you work with associates who honetly feel like family. Just management sucks there and especially upper level. They don't seem to care or even bother what is going on within youself. They seem to defend others than help you out or even bother to hear what you say. As well when you put your hard time and dedications into it.
bad,"Always short-staffed, people came and went so quickly. Very difficult job for anyone in management. I liked many of the people that worked there, but I got burnt out after almost 2 years."
bad,No family time leaving in the middle of the night to go to work no weekend's off poor management no communication no structure go for what you know I would not recommend working here.
bad,"There is no organization or professionalism. The company is failing and the only perk of working there is that the associates are great. I was doing the job of an assistant manager but getting paid less then the associates. The pay raise was continually promised but never delivered. None of the higher ups have accountability or respect for their employees. However, the associates are treated pretty well. I would strongly recommend NOT taking a management position at this company."
bad,"I always closed and it was almost always busy when I come in, it was always a very negative atmosphere, Little to no help comes from anybody especially corporate, some managers are decent but overall very bad management over the last year and a half that I worked there, Panera bread as a company is very negligent and unthoughtful, I don't have much good to say because no matter how hard you can work, it's never good enough for them and it has taken a big emotinal toll on me and several other coworkers that have ended up also quitting."
bad,But the job alone I hated they would cut hours and want more work done in less time making everyone hate the job. There’s not one person there that likes working with panera.
bad,Turn over is very high for associates and managers.  Pay grade is based on amount of time in business not performances.  Not valued in the company.  Can be replaced without warning.
bad,"Overall the work environment is unwelcoming. The General manager was rude and abrasive. Management would overbook your hours even as a minor. For example, one 16 yr old coworker of mine worked over 40 hrs for about 3 weeks straight."
bad,The management was terrible and even when we lose half of our staff; they didn’t hire anyone and expected the staff we had to work three jobs at once.
bad,"Panera was unorganized, stressful, and something was always going wrong. Mangers were never helpful, and associates were very lazy. It's a job for high schoolers."
bad,"Their philosophy is -a manager does no work-. Scream at all employees, until the job gets done.  When a customer complains-give the customer a free muffin."
bad,"The job duties were fulfilling, but the management had a hard time controlling and monitoring the employee's actions and negligence. I had to leave this job because management did little to nothing to resolve conflict within the workplace and this made me feel too uncomfortable to continue working there."
bad,"Horrible place to work. I would not want my worst enemy to work here, incompetent managment rude coworkers nobody cares. Hostile managment are gm is extremely incompetent. Its easy to see why they have a high turnover rate not worth 12.00 an hour."
bad,"Panera was a decent place to work, but you weren't paid enough for the jobs you had to do. Also there was a manager who only added you to the schedule if she liked you."
bad,"At Panera Bread it was a very unbalanced work place where managers would pick favorites. They would purposly ignore their associates just to sit in the office. Everyday multiple people would be allowed to call off causing the rest of the team to work multiple positions while balancing customers orders. Employees would show up hours late and not be punished for it, basically a slap on the wrist. The hardest part of the job was trying not to lose it during a normal work day because everyday was so stressful. Most people quit becuase of the lack of management. Managers at Panera Bread are the laziest workers I've ever seen in the work force. The most enjoyable part of the day was getting to take that apron off and clocking out. They pose as a ""family"" type of atmosphere but in reality that company is just horrid."
bad,"I worked at Panera for about 2.5 years. I have worked multiple different locations. The job itself depends mostly on the state of the store you happened to work at. Unfortunately for me I spent majority of my Panera career at an understaffed, mismanaged, busy, and stressful location. After sticking it out for awhile dealing with multiple problems; nothing stocked, employees not well-trained, nothing prepped, not enough people, I thought I would get promoted or at least a raise. But no after all the hardships I faced with a smile I get rewarded with nothing. After working there for so long I never got promoted only empty promises until finally I left."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,everything is based on the professionalism of upper management.  They can either be good to you or force you out with in a seconds notice.  There is no culture of professionalism.  There is no Human resources department that is easily accesable.
bad,Creepy boss and made me feel uncomfortable at work! Cant breathe without feeling like you have to walk on egg shells. Very understaffed and not enough safety equipment.
bad,"Very short on good help makes it Had on the employees that take work serious."
bad,"The management was bad also they did not listen to availability.. I worked there with people who were miserable , but some how I enjoyed myself while I worked in a fast paced environment."
bad,The company rather hire managers from outside that promote people. I witness about 5 good managers leave because of work environment. I saw employees complain to the point they have to call H.R.
bad,This would be a good job for high school students during the summer but after you've been there for awhile it's like the management cares about you less and less
bad,I worked with panera throughout high school. It was a job. They never listened when I had to change my availability. When I gave them a full schedule when I was going to be out of the country on a school trip they still tried to call me to come in.
bad,When I first started working at panera I really enjoyed my job and then as time went on I just dreaded going to work everyday. Once the mangers realize that your good at your job they do everything they can to try to work you to death. On weekends I was almost never home on time and the managers don't really try to handle employee to employee disputes very well
bad,The management team guaranteed full time work then everyone's hours dropped dramatically. (I went from 40-28). There were favorites who got special treatment and always got plenty of hours while everyone else suffered.
bad,"Im not sure if this is goes for all paneras but the one i worked for was awful. management was basically non existent, they lie to you constantly about when you will get a raise just so you won't leave. it took me two years of working there just to get one quarter raise."
bad,"I clock in and go to work everyday I have to. The atmosphere is unimaginably horrific for employees. Especially if you're on the line. Hardest 6 hour shifts I've ever worked. Animals...the managers are beasts chasing you in the wild jungle. Working at an everyday oasis more like walking though the hot desert with no water, food,clothes, or energy. The day I walked through that door was day part of me died inside, buried underneath the soup station. Enjoyment doesn't exist at Panera, only fake smiles, and fake promises. Although, I didn't mind the 60% discount for my food, even though deep down I knew I deserved it."
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of employees not showing up to work which meant you having to do the work of 2."
bad,Just was not a job for me. All of my coworkers and I would work our butts off and most of the times we never were allowed to take any breaks. The scheduling was one of their week spots. But definitely taught me some patience and great people skill while under pressure.
bad,This is a high school job that pays very poorly. I do not think this job is good for anyone. The management sucks and the pay is terrible. Even shift supervisors get paid terrible.
bad,I spent three years of my life in a company that did nothing but take. Overall the company sucks. The people were the only reason I stayed as long as I did!
bad,Managers dont care to listen. The pay is terrible for the work you have to put in. They have the biggest issues eith calling out even if your sick or in a accident they say only deaths are excused. Thats just wrong.
bad,The location i worked at was a franchise and expected me to work like a mule. I would often cry after work because of the stress from the 4 hour lunch rush with no break. Definitely wouldn't work there again
bad,My manager is very biased and she has favorites. She would degrade many people and talk down to almost anybody. She would not let you speak unless she was completely right and it felt like it was petty high school drama.
bad,"Panera Bread was a good place to work for a high school student. I was able to do my job quickly, and also it was nice to get to know customers. Also they give you a percentage of discount when you buy food which was nice when you had a break you got to eat and it wasn't so expensive."
bad,They over work you for the amount they pay you. I was stuck there every night till 11pm-1am depending on who else was closing. They are very unorganized.
bad,Panera bread was ran like a sweat shop and my manager was an sociopath my co workers were cool for the most part customers were good but the management wasn't great
bad,The pay was not that good. I was qualified in all areas and still did not get a raise. I even did some of the managers duties like inventory and they still would not give me a raise. They would not schedule enough people and the store would be so busy some days.
bad,"Management is very rude, you never get out on time. If your even there for an hour over the time your supposed to be off and you ask to leave that's a huge no."
bad,No raises when you deserve it. It is all about favoritism. No recognition for doing good deeds. I hate that. I learned that I will not kiss butt because management do not care about you.  Most enjoyable part is the customers!!!!
bad,"most enjoyable part of the job good employee's  food  ok sometimes"
bad,no communication and respect. customers were great some employees were great
bad,"job for college students, good if your looking for a temp job"
bad,Not the best place to work due to management being so bad. The time I was there i learned a lot how to work and give great customer service. The team there was well but always problems that didnt interfere with work that we had to deal with.
bad,In the past 7 months I have been working at panera bread none of the promises have been met. I was promised a 90 day evaluation and raise which i never recieved. I was promised a 6 month evaluation and raise which i never recieved. I also was told i was going to advance within the company to a certified trainer which also is supposed to include a raise. Today i train employees like a certified trainer and have still yet to recieve any of the benefits promised to me. I am displeased with my job and currently looking for a new one. I would not recommend working for this compant
bad,"I worked at Panera bread for many years and became an Associate trainer within a year. When you become an trainer it means nothing you don't get a raise, it is meant to make you feel special so you keep putting up with the stress. Over the years I had many issues with scheduling. I was treated as a fill in, I got the left over hours. If you are not a favorite of the GM then you do not get regular hours. I have had many jobs and I can tell you that at this Panera Bread, you have no friends everyone talks about each other behind their back. It was all I could do some days not to walk out the door during lunch because it was so busy and managers would be sitting in the office. The times that the GM did come on the line and help we couldn't wait for her to go away since she would yell at us in front of customers and they would look back at us in shock. I have never been treated that way at any job I have had. I didn't make enough to stay, I am relieved and I will never ever step in that Panera again. You can feel the tension when you walk in the door and you can tell that the people that are working there are unhappy and miserable. The management treats the employees awful and they don't care because there is always someone else to take your place."
bad,"A typical day at work for me isn't easy. I am a single mom I work go to school and I ride the city bus every where. Working at Panera Bread I learned that caring about others is wonderful but its got its perks. Diversity is very absent and I felt out of place for a long time. My co-workers where ok but alot of them are young high schooler and they got alot more hours than the adults that needed it. As far as management they played favortism and enjoyed ignoring you when its important. Needless to say although I enjoyed working there I did not feel appreciated and for a gal like me, two hours on the city bus to and from work and picking up my only son in between , well you get it. Its stressful. The one thing i can truley say I enjoyed was the food and the days we truely did got along and had a productive day,"
bad,"This job taught me many skills that I am grateful for but it always showed me that I will never work in food again. The managers were terrible and I was treated like no on cared about me just another employe. They did not work with my schedule and were not considerate of my days off. I remember one time I had to go to a funeral and my manager was saying I could not call out and that there was nothing he could do for me. It was a sudden death of my cousin that WAS REAL, and I felt as though they did not believe me. Overall working here was terrible.m"
bad,I was supposed to be full time but they never gave me full time instead they kept cutting my hours. They would not give me a reason why. On my days off they would call me and ask me to come in. No one check the dates on the food except for me. They had very poor management. The new General Manager laughed in my face when I was in pain.
bad,"Panera could be good to work for, as they have unique opportunities and interesting employee programs, but I would suggest looking somewhere else in Albany for a job. Poor management creates a toxic workplace and the general manager is easily one of the worst people I've worked with as a general rule. Managers have no respect for students or those who need specified availability. Won't hesitate to schedule you when you specify you're unavailable, or if you request time off - even if done so correctly. On top of that, schedule was always released last minute - there were occasions where people would work Sunday and not know it because the schedule came out when they didn't work the day before, then get in trouble over it when they had no control as we were ""expected"" to check in everyday."
bad,The managers there would put you to work. It would be the same basic routine you are trained. Just repeated processes over and over. Make sure to always give the customer their satisfaction as well.
bad,"Management doesn't care how sick, or  overwhelmed and over worked employees are. There is little room for advancement. The issues bring the employees closer"
bad,Just a few people there that care about you and helping succeed.  Upper management only care that you show up and work for bird seed for ever and don’t follow through with what’s promised about a career there.
bad,"All they want is a body, they don't care if you know what you are doing or anything.  Management thinks they are above all the employees, and they don't treat their employees with respect."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"The usual quick service resto. High turnover, inexperienced workers. Nothing surprising. Tow the company line. Poorly managed, workers don't show up for shifts. "
bad,Employee happiness is almost never considered in an environment that is solely geared towards making customers happy. I was frequently reminded of how expendable I was as an employee by our managers and was never given an opportunity to advance myself in the workplace past the role of a Trainer. The pay does not come close to compensating for the amount of stress incurred within the general responsibilities of the job and everyone that worked there treated their jobs as temporary.
bad,The workload was too much for one person to properly complete. I was being harrassed by a fellow worker and nothing was done. My other coworkers in different departments were always helpful and encouraging but management was unprofessional and not helpful. If I am told I should be making one thing and you pay me another it should be fixed.
bad,"Working at certain stores is a hassle. Dealing with different personalities in managers. Some of them are awesome and great at their jobs but they have more managers that don't care about their jobs or anyone else. They schedule outside of your availability, change your schedule without communication. Also not very organized on the inside and they don't take care of their store, it seems as though it is falling apart. The general manager is not good. seems to not want to be there. Tends to disappear for more than 30 minutes at a time. No one really feels appreciated there."
bad,"Terrible management. The ask a lot of you for pretty low hourly wage. But if you hustle, you can make decent money. I usually left with at least $40 in my pocket daily for a lunch delivery shift."
bad,Job asks for way too much for what you are being paid for. Management does not care for its associates and often humiliates them on public forms such as printing out notes calling out associates and taping it on the office door. There is no opportunity to growth since management has it's favorites and disregards everyone else.
bad,The boss is awful; he never listens and rejects all the pro you use. They won't let you get out only work. Even make you do overtime. We are understaffed..
bad,A typical day is very busy and short staffed. Some management don’t care. There is a lot of Unfair treatment. Raises are a bunch of ridiculousness because you really don’t get one.
bad,Overall not the best place to work  had a lot of problems with other workers and management often towards my sexuality and identity. Not very clean and most of the employees where teenagers who didn’t know how to do their jobs
bad,If you enjoy not having a life outside and management constantly using you then this is the place to work. They prefer to hire from outside than within.
bad,"Was a shift manager for a year, worked for the company for almost 4 years, the team was great but the GM and AOP were horrible and deceitful... I worked very hard and was titled the best shift manager, because I did my job well and actually cared for and looked out for the associates, my GM and AOP felt threatened by that fact... when I tried to transfer out of state to have a better chance of progressing and furthering my career within the company, my GM and AOP sabotaged my transfer and drove me to quit!!! Pitty because I really loved what I was doing.... not only was I a shift manager but I was also responsible for; safety, maintenance, repairs, inventory, and stocking.... my GM even went as far as having me sand down and repaint every booth in the cafe just to save money!!!"
bad,"Panera needs to work on hiring managers who actually care about employees. Constantly scheduled for shifts I repeatedly asked not to be. Sometimes it would be painfully slow, at other times it was so busy that they couldn’t keep up."
bad,This job was okay because of my co workers. Management was absolutely horrible. They didn’t care about the employees or the fact some may have children. Wanted you to eat sleep and breathe Panera. No advancement unless they felt guilty or they felt to many ppl were quitting.
bad,they dont care about you only money  worked  9 hours  one  day  no  break  no  lunch    double  the work  for  special  orders  next day they  yell at you  why you  stayed late  they  act  like you did no work
bad,"Managements at all locations seem very unorganized or delayed. There is lack of communication or miscommunication consistently. Recently they have been cutting hours or transferring employees to other locations due to lack of sales. Don’t expect any advancement or raise (unless it’s 25 cents) for a year. They only see the bad in employees (ex: tardiness), not the good things (staying late and working hard)."
bad,"I have been with this company for two years,  They did not inform me of any other responsibilities, aside of dishwashing.  I was also responsible for food prep and putting away stock, which was not in the original job description.  During this time, I only received ONE evaluation with ONE raise.  The general manager is incompetent and likes to retaliate through the schedule.  The pricing of food is too high for what it is.  They allow people to work off the clock when they're close to overtime and to be expected to finish their job.  They serve expired food.  Most of the staff is lazy.  There are no benefits for the staff."
bad,"Management was very uncoordinated and none knew what was going on. Constantly running out of prepped or baked goods. Personal time was often used in place of paid vacation time due to the lack of ""proof"""
bad,A typical day at work was very stressful and the hardest part of working there was taking in complaints even when doing the right thing. The workplace was disrespectful.
bad,"I feel as if managers picked favorites, They get irritated if you asked for a day off, and the request off system is awful. They will do anything to schedule you. Coworks are lazy, and management does NOTHING. we are so understaffed that there are very short breaks. If  I even get a break it will be at most 5 minutes. Some managers are cool, but only to your face. If you DESPERATELY need a job, this job is for you. good luck"
bad,I have been employed at Panera Bread for 3 years seen many come and go. I try to apply as a manager but was told they don't do outside hiring. I stayed despite this is one of the worst company I've ever work for due to lack of organization. the store is alway either short staffed in the kitchen or always missing produce. If it was not for my customers I would have left their the best part of my day.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"If you want to work here, dont plan on 40 hours even if they hire you full time. You will be lucky to get 25. Oh and dontnpiss off management, cause if you do, your hours will be cut to like 10 or less a week. Management isn't professional what so ever. They treat their employees like garbage. So dont plan on being sick, ever. Or have a family. Cause they could care less."
bad,"they cut hours and had 4 managers on duty at the same time, so being yelled at 4 different people about the same thing. Management always had time to complain about speed but wanted accurate items like the items pictured on the store menus."
bad,They never trained me and threw me into the simplest job. They also placed me in the prep position when I was under 18 so it threw the manager working that night under the bus since I could not use their sharp tools.
bad,I had a horrible general manager. there was a low level of team work. Managers often showed favoritism. Low chances of earning a raise. Overall there is unfair pay among the employees.
bad,"The manager at my Panera treated everyone very badly. She would yell at people, and make you work over 12 hours with no breaks or lunch. She would also make humiliate you in front of customers."
bad,"I loved working at the Panera Bread in Coral Springs FL but when I transferred up to PA, it was horrible. The management was very conceited and played favorites with all the employees. If you were scheduled out at a certain time, sometimes they would purposely make you ""wait"" to leave, even if you told them multiple times that you had a second job to go to. I would never recommend working for this company."
bad,"Very busy and fast paced."
bad,"Management is horrible. Worst job ever. The manager cut my hours because of personal feelings towards me even though I was the ""go-to"" employee. Made me change my hair because of the color/length."
bad,"A normal day at work usually start slow I don't know about morning I worked graveyard hours. The management really wasn't all that good, let alone that we never had anything stock truly. The culture was decent the hardest part is closing, the enjoyable part is getting paid"
bad,"From all Panera's I have either worked at or helped out in, there has been a common trend of poor management and immature leaders. Other than the occasional ""normal"" associate, everyone seemed to forget that there was life outside of this fast food job. Also, I was in charge of training new hires, and given a leadership role but not paid for it. I have worked with Panera for a year and I didn't get any raise. I worked endless hours and not once was there any money to compensate for it. There is clear favoritism and that is not how the company should be run."
bad,"working here was fun but also a lot of work. managers get lazy and leave more work to their employees, even to deal with problems only they are supposed to confront. depending on who you work with the day can be very successful or the total opposite. it wasn’t all too bad, but this is my opinion and certian managers took their jobs seriously and acted accordingly, while most managers didn’t care, especially for certain employees."
bad,"The management where I worked was absolutely horrible. They did not care about the employees health or availability. I told them I was available 25 hours a week but they constantly gave me 30-40. I am a full time college student and it was hard to balance everything. They also would get upset if you called off on a day that clashed with your availability and made you find someone to cover, even when it was their fault for scheduling you. Horrible rules too, rarely got a break on time."
bad,Lunch rushes are Fast and fun if you like being quick on your feet and multitasking. The food is worth getting for the discounted price and the employees are friendly.
bad,"Poor management, unfair treatment. "
bad,"After working at Panera, I realized that a typical day is very fast paced. It consisted of cooking, taking orders, handling cash, and stocking items. I learned that quick does not mean correct. It is better to take your time and be correct than mess up, but experience is the most important. The management can vary, but mine was very tough. The culture was stressful due to all the fast pacing work. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with all of the specifics, like dating and recording all the items, and remembering which products go with which.The best part of the job was being satisfactory to the guests."
bad,"Don't do it."
bad,"The work is physical, pays less than average. There is a tremendous amount of turf protection and lack of accountability to change the culture that exists inside the High Point Facility. The management team is very poor and exist only to further their careers by stepping on others as they climb their career ladders. "
bad,"Management is incredibly scattered, no communication between managers, and schedules always put up at the last minute. The environment was unclean, and training was poor."
bad,The best part of Panera was the quality of their products as evidenced in the volume of customers that dine/takeout from this particular location.  The company also provides regular training modules when new products are added to the menu.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"I worked there for a while, never got a raise, never really felt appreciated for the work I did. Some of the managers were kind of rude too. Wouldn't recommend working here."
bad,"During the time working at Panera, I had good and bad managers.  If you have a good one the job is easy and efficient but I had plenty of bad ones. So give it a try but if the manager doesn't work on your behalf it's not worth it."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend this location for anyone to work at due to the management. I was there for 17 months and had expressed interest in becoming a manager to 3 of my 4 general managers. I still was only an associate when I left there. Most of the management team are write up happy, which means if you look at them the wrong way they will probably write you up. 3 write ups and you're out. Trust me when I say the new people that got hired didn't work there but maybe 2-3 weeks at best. It was ridiculous. I was always there, always stayed over to help out if needed, and I didn't get the recognition I deserved. I also didn't get the compensation I should have for the amount of work I did for them."
bad,"Very Very Stressful Job, Hard to Enjoy Coming To Work. A normal day was very busy always with short staff and poor lazy management. Poor communication."
bad,"Fire people without cause and without question "
bad,"Management is terrible because they do not let you off on time, always asks to stay an extra hour or two, never give you proper breaks, does not appreciate the work that their employees do. Workers do so much compared to what they are paid. It is hard to get a raise. Everyday is the same."
bad,"Panera Bread is a decent job to have in highschool or college, you get good hours and above minimium wage. I learned how to communicate with the customers in a respectful manner and in a clean and friendly enviroment."
bad,There is a little bit of room for advancement which is the only bonus in this job. Maybe location is the key to enjoying your experience working at Panera.
bad,show up and do the work. it was not hard. nothing to really complain about. great for a part-time or timp job. unless you are a manager your not getting payed much.
bad,"Very bad with working people with disabilities and very bad about doing schedule and giving hours.  Also,give special treatment to certain employees and not a very friendly place to work at."
bad,"The pay is too low.   I've been there 4 year's and I'm a trainer... New hires make more than me. "
bad,"Horrible. No respect for their employees. Managers are unprofessional and place blame on employees for their short comings along with playing intense favorites. Schedule is irregular and unfair, limited hours or over-worked. I would not recommend anyone work here."
bad,In the beginning I loved my job. It's not so much the company as it was my GM. It was because of that I left the company. On top of them being extremely stingy with raises. They do not value their employees or reward them for doing good.
bad,"I've only worked for a month, and they have the same people every time with 30 + hours, but I haven't been on the schedule for an entire 2 weeks."
bad,Take care of all dining room requirements. Take orders from customers. Hand orders out to customers when food was ready. Hardest part of the job was making sure the dining room was in good shape when it was busy.
bad,I worked long days and several days in a row. I worked there for a year and was one of thier best employees and I saw people that came in after me get promoted and got a raise before I did. The managers where not fair and had favorites. And when I thrented to leave they offered a $0.25 raise bringing my $8.50 up to $8.75.
bad,Panera Bread in elk river is a mess. dirty and does not care about employees. They had an employee working there for over a year knowing that he is a registered s3x offender.
bad,Get free food after training is done. There is no advancement and not much benefits. It's really a job for High Schoolers and raises were not even worth.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"Panera (or at least this franchise of it) does not care about the staff at all. We are just numbers to them, keeping the doors open. The management tend to micromanage, nitpick, overreact, and keep staff on a short leash. If you even look at them wrong, you will be sent home for the day. No benefits, low pay, and don't even thing about getting a raise (even if they mention that from day one!). It's a place to work and keep very busy, but you take little home from it. It's a place to work, not sure what else to say. I guess work there at your own discretion!"
bad,I think this would be a nice place to work if a change of management occurred and the people applying for jobs and are promised certain positions that this employer would stick with their word.
bad,I would not recommend it to anyone unless you like to be around drama and incompetent management.  that always like to put you down for their enjoyment
bad,"A typical day at my Panera was coming in and being bombarded with work the minute you walk in. Sometimes, I wouldn't even be able to clock in. 2/4 managers working there actually cared. The other two only cared if you weren't going to show up. They always ask for you to find someone to cover you if you call in. Even when you're sick and shouldn't be at work. Their ""no jerk"" policy is pointless, they let their favorite employees do whatever they want and treat co-workers badly. The only good part was the food and even then, it gets old quick. The hardest part is probably dealing with jerks all day."
bad,"Great starting job for high schoolers, as far as advancements, hard to move up in the company unless you are favored. Hard workers do the grunt work, while lazy workers have the leisure of going home on time and calling out without consequences. Management is a joke."
bad,You must put in a lot of time to this job. If you plan to get promoted you must work long hours and grind day in and day out. Baking is a 3rd shift position so you will not have much time for anything in your life. Management will tell you one thing then turn around the next day and change their approach on the situation. Rules are broken often.
bad,"workload is extreme, management wants you to work around the clock never taking any time to stand or sit just constantly working. Assistant management is overbearing."
bad,"I enjoyed my job but only for 2 weeks. The main manger was nice at first but than was rude and would yell at me if I made any mistake. My manger is rude his co-workers and all of his co-mangers. Just be ready to be yelled at a lot, your manger sometimes won't remember the days that you requested off, if you have an appointment or want to hang out better make it a month in advance, and be ready to have no breaks sometimes."
bad,this company will tell you one thing and never do it. the are soooooo disorganized.  its no work life balance at all if your a driver and there care nothing about your life. because working here you dont deserve one.
bad,"My manager and I didn't get along.  I was constantly told my work was bad but never told what about it was bad or what i could do to improve it, just constant criticism.  It was an unhealthy place for me to work"
bad,"i have nothing but good things to say regarding the franchises that i have worked for, the franchise owners are always fantastic people and they are exceptional at running their stores. however the company itself has some less than decent policies. the biggest that comes to mind is the ""clean food"" that panera advertises. the most notable of which being that they purchase food items from Haliburton, a crude oil company that is notorious for being ridiculously opaque with their business practices and about every decade or so issues a public apology for their mistakes. insinuating that the food they sell panera is mis-labeled as to be almost certainly not clean within the standards that panera advertises. all speculation of course."
bad,"Constantly stressful, poorly managed, poor planning, often unprofessional, no follow through action after multiple conversations, Slow upward mobility."
bad,I feel as if the place is run by children. No rel management there to now 100% of what they're talking about. the place is definitely for kids still in school.
bad,"Too stressful. A lot of turnovers. District manager and VP operations work you to the bones, under appreciated, no benefit no bonus no raise for over a year. Too much work no match pay."
bad,"The workers at Panera are amazing makes the experience worthwhile. However management is very disorganized in every aspect of this establishment. Managers have been changed many times, each time get more disorganized. Scheduling is based on favourites rather than who gets the job done efficiently and precise. Overall not a great place to work, would recommend working at any other location."
bad,"At first, this job was great, it was fun. I enjoyed coming to work. But fast forward a few months, and it's become a depressing chore you have to attend in the cover of darkness. After you become a certified baker (overnight), you don't get compensated for it. They use excuses to not pay you. But expect you to do the same work as someone else they pay a few more dollars than they pay you. Yes, favoritism exists. The overnight baker's manager, picks favorites and literally follows your schedule to almost sabotage you, and get rid of you for any slip up; all the while, other people who do a bad job, get cleared and get a pass. It's not worth the stress or the energy, since it ruins your social life. Especially if you have a family. Also, the employees are immature, and finger point blame every night."
bad,"Hostile co-workers, management does nothing about it. The company overall was good,  but the location i worked at was too harsh and led to a flare up of mental health concerns for me."
bad,"Despite the free drinks, it is not a place for those working under a temp contract because you are treated exactly like that. A temporary person that is there to provide help when there is not enough coverage nor are there enough computers to do your job. It's not a friendly environment and it's not a place I would want to work at again."
bad,Managers were quite immature. It seems like they were only promoted because they've been with the company since they were high school students. Our store manager would flirt with every attractive guy that walked in. We got only one break and most of the time we worked 8 to 12 hour shifts.
bad,"This job is always busy and you are constantly working hard, unless you don't care about your job. None of the managers know what they are supposed to be doing and the stress falls on the people who want to succeed. The only reason to work here is because of the good discount on the great food and the high starting pay."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,I worked there for almost three years and hardly saw a pay increase. I left with like $250 a week. I just couldn't survive. I loved my coworkers but I couldn't make a career out of it.
bad,"Hours are inconsistent,  the pay is not equal to the amount of labor performed. The Store Manager often disregarded the well being of staff, requiring old women to lift far more than what is safe"
bad,"Upper management tends to treat employees badly, trickle down effect from there bosses. I would not recommend a career at Panera Bread. Although work tasks are easy and include making salads and sandwiches i am constantly being held hours after my scheduled time off. This is because they are always so short staffed."
bad,I do not recommend working for Panera Bread. The management is completely inadequate on every level. There is no support or respect for the night baker even though the entire company is dependent on them. They only care about labor costs and profits not about the customer or the well being of their employees.
bad,"At first, things seem great. You're taught about the company culture and the great things Panera is doing in the fast food industry. But soon, the mask comes off. From a lack of properly maintained equipment to potentially illegal management practices, Panera reveals that it really only cares about profits."
bad,"After working here I have noticed the business does not care about their employees at all. Managers are nasty and spiteful, love to cause unnecessary drama. Hire terrible employees, talk down on their work ethic but do not fire them to hire better people to bring up the quality of the restraunt. Gives decent raises to those who have worked there for a shorter amount of time than those who have worked years. AWFUL place to work do not recommend whatsoever, glad I quit when I did!"
bad,Panera bread has a terrible GM and went through like 5 different sets of assistant managers to find which was the best because the GM was so difficult to work with.
bad,The benefits and pay are not worth the frustration you deal with daily.  Benefits are bare minimum. The only good thing is they will match your contribution to your retirement benefits
bad,Panerai Bread is a very good place menu wise and health wise. But are very rude. Rehydrate will stand there and not even acknowledge that you a real in line or wanted to order. I should not have to get your attention to place my order.
bad,I use to hate waking up and going to this job. the management was poor and they didn't care about your personal life at all. the general manager there was sarcastic and rude and stuck up. The other managers were not any better.
bad,"As other companies have learned that continued growth cannot be sustained without attention to ensuring stable, efficient support services, Panera struggles in this area. "
bad,"Panera Bread is one of the worst companies to work for. You get terrible hours (if any) unless the manager likes you, then they will schedule you overtime regardless of your skills. They don't train new hires and just throw them on positions and tell them to figure it out."
bad,"You'll like working here if you don't mind working every holiday without holiday pay, never getting your required paid 10 minute break, like working solo while the managers stand around only to yell at you about 3+ minute ticket times....""why are my ticket times at 7 minutes?!""...because I'm alone and had to make 4 breakfast sandwiches, 6 oatmeals and 2 -all sliced- bagel packs for one rapid pick up."
bad,Management was a pain and it was rather messy and disorganized. There would be specific times of day that were extremely busy but it was always busy. My staff was constantly changing and there were new rules and ways of doing things that was always changing.
bad,Expected to be in 10 places at one time. Rarely allowed breaks. Managers disappear as soon as you need them. would not work there again.
bad,"terrible job, no pros all cons, short unpaid breaks, no benefits, no chance for advancement. My managers were pretty cool, but other than that this is save work and the pay isn't great."
bad,Panera Bread was an awful place to work. Management was terrible and so was the pay. Corporate was so rude and looked down on all of their employees.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"Worked at Panera for two years. Initially, I loved it. Over time, managers became toxic and mean and the entire management team is now mean/toxic/unfair to employees. "
bad,"well; I have no intention on being discreet in relevance to critics rating a company... where there's lacked of ''Moral/ethic""... socially responsible is not effective; compensation/growth is ridiculous terrible."
bad,"Unhealthy work environment for every one. "
bad,"Panera Bread is an amazing company to work for.  They are involved in the community and take great care of their employees.  However, the franchise owner in Ohio and his directors create a hostile work environment with impossible expectations.  While these expectations did drive me to want to succeed and better myself and my store, it was impossible to meet said expectations and the ridicule following a lack of success was enough for me to choose to leave the company."
bad,"Fast paced, high call volume business, pay rate wasnt meeting my budget. The hardest part was waking up at 4:40 am to have store set up by 5:30am"
bad,"The work Environment depends on which store you work at. Every single store is different. At the first store, I loved my job, the workplace and everything. They provided awesome opportunities for advancement. But when I transferred I saw an ugly side. My new General manager did everything he could to belittle people. The managers have a god complex and almost all the employees are petty and rude. They treat the customers rudely and their fellow employees even worse. Many of my coworkers are two faced and love to spread drama throughout the store. There in no opportunity for advancement. I'm at a ""training store"" that has no trainers. nobody knows the correct measurements. they give away lemonade and green tea. They only promote people after years of servitude. The pay is terrible unless you're a transfer. The Hardest part of this job is dealing with co-workers. The best part is the customers who, for the most part are kind and enjoy simple conversation. I even had a customer look at me when I was sick and offer to help me home if I was too sick to drive myself while my GM called me a liar. "
bad,My manager wanted me to quit school to focus on Panera Bread.
bad,"I did not like working here...."
bad,"When I began working there it was apparent immediately that management had favorites. They would give them 2x the amount of hours, were much easier on them and allowed them to slack off significantly more than the others. Management would constantly tell me differnet things, and then get upset if I did something a different manager told me to do. i.e. take out the trash, the one who told me to do this did not have a problem, another one would tell me not to take it out so they got upset w me."
bad,A typical day at work is working the cash register and putting a smile on my face for all of the customers! I learned how to provide better customer service and connect with people better. 
bad,"There are too many managers to know what is going on, as well as the fact that they are under trained. The work is busy, the hours are long, and it takes quite a bit of physical effort."
bad,"Panera bread a first glance seems fun and easy to work for. However, the employees were put on ""part time"" and made to work 40 + hours a week. Advancement was horrible and breaks were scheduled poorly. I once had a break not ten minutes after I got to work for a 5 hour shift! I also was scheduled to close one night (11.00 pm) and then open the next (6.00 am) repeatedly. I do not recommend this place for work unless you are truly desperate."
bad,"I worked at two stores. The managers had completely different rules at each store. The Warner Robins store had a manager that was unappreciative, and exploitive. He taunted the female employees. I worked like a dog from 7 - 5 many days without a break, and he was still unsatisfied. I have 25 years of work experience from teaching to technical support, and this was one of the WORST experiences of my adult life. The regional manager either did not care, or was clueless. Before you take the job, talk to the current employees...when they can be completely honest with you."
bad,offers great discounts and good food. They let you take vacations but other than that this location needs help with management and needs to work on their attitude especially higher up.
bad,Thought I was doing a great job until I was let go without any warning. The employees was really kind and helpful. The task was easy but difficult to remember.
bad,"The management team stretches every employee too thin because they have no organization. They expect them to be able to do so many tasks at once that none of them can be completed effectively and in the correct manner. Instead of giving constructive feedback, they humiliate employees in front of the rest of the team and are not great at communicating issues or fixing problems. You’re not compensated properly for how hard they make you work."
bad,Lower management are awesome.Upper management horrible.This was  not a company owned store so might be different.Covellai is a horrible and cheap owner.Explains the massive turnover at his stores.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,Working under Manna LLC is the worst... if you can work for an actual Panera bread owned company would 100% recommended. They are pretty rare to find mostly manna owns them
bad,Panera bread is constantly expecting more work for no increase of pay. They have caps for job positions. They expect you to do all these tasks to ensure the general manager gets a bonus. I have expressed my want to stop working third shift and go back to days. They could care less about my wants or dreams. They just want me to complete the bakes with no complaints
bad,6 supervisors in 4 years? Not a stable work environment to be able to thrive. Another market in another area would have been a better choice. Very disappointing.
bad,"If you care about yourself, mentally, do not set yourself up with this job. It was the most unorganized establishment ever.. Very embarrassed with the managements skills, and even the work environment was disgusting.. very unpleasant"
bad,"No longer the company it was. Once, a company who cared about staff, culture and was a leader in the industry in so many ways. All about profits and numbers, which feeds a cut throat environment."
bad,When I first started I was trained by 5 different people who all had been hired only weeks prior. I was never properly trained. When I didn’t know how to do something or had a question my coworkers and managers would get annoyed. Some of the coworkers were very rude and unprofessional but the managers did nothing. This location has gone through about 3 different general managers and multiple assistant managers in two years. I was never trained on line my entire four months working there. The discount is nice....as long as you only get 15 dollars worth of food and are on the clock. If you are thinking about working here don’t bother until management gets it together.
bad,Dont bother working there...too many drivers for the amount of deliveries they had and the pay is poor. They have no clue what they were doing it was a complete kerfuffle.
bad,"My GM was one of the most kind & fair boss ever. She truly cares about staff &guests,however the asst managers treated me in a truly disrespectful way"
bad,"Was very excited about working here but after 4 years I will no longer stay. Before Panera went corporate it was great, now it's toxic and unpleasant and too stressful."
bad,no matter how hard working you are or how much you put into the job you will still be treated like garbage. they do not value their workers. employees were nice though.
bad,"I absolutely adored my coworkers, but management (the GM) need some serious help. Not worth the pay or stress. The customers were rude and I was even insulted by some. Sundays were the worst and brought the worst customers. On top of it, sometimes the Associates (not Trainers) had to train the new hires or they were just simply put to work with 1 day or less of training."
bad,The company doesn't focus on your performance.It's favortism that runs pretty much here.It doesn't matter how hard you work or how long you have been there..they don't promote from within.
bad,"As a driver, you will be expected to be a busser and a dish washer as well."
bad,$5/hour while driving...less than minimum wage.  Customers like to not tip.  Mistreated by half the managers.  No free food.  Forced to work weekend or evenings--the worst time for delivering Panera.  Most insurance companies won't insure your car while delivering.  Make sure the managers don't steal your tip money--count it before you leave.  Several times managers gave me less than what I was due.
bad,"This business has alot of great people that work there. My biggest complaint is that it is the most poorly managed place I've ever worked. The general manager tries to avoid conflict at all costs, so instead of hearing from her what the issues are, you hear it from everyone else. Plus, schedule comes out day before the week of."
bad,"Panera seems great at first because of their planet bread class and training. However, they will have you there cleaning till about 2 in the morning by yourself because they only want one or two people working  because of a strict budget they’re under. I understand it’s the restaurant business’s and you have to set hours based on sales but having one cashier close the entire front area is way to much pressure and stress on one person. Furthermore, I never been to a job where the manger takes the place of an associate just because they did not want to pay to have another associate there. Working with mangers instead of associates makes the job very boring because you are forced to talk to the manger all night because you and the manger are the only people working. You may get hours at first but they will cut you down to about 12 hours a week. They say they only have money to schedule more people but somehow they continue to hire new people. I guess it’s to replace people who leave because they have no hours and the cycle continues. Don’t work at the hospital location. It’s  boring and they expect you to do everything by yourself. Plus you only get one 30 minute break and sometimes you can work up to 12 hours."
bad,You will love the people you work with! But the bad apples seem to take over in this competitive work environment. Line Worker is exciting but stressful. There was a staff of 45 to 75 workers and someone is always trying to knock you off your square. Too many gossiping lazy managers on one shift.
bad,"I quit my FULL time job to come to Panera because they promised me full time hours. I got maybe 16 at best on any given week. Not enough. Barely ANY training. I basically trained myself. Also, the management is poor. I got sick and had to be in the hospital for 5 days and they never believed me when I ever got sick. I literally was throwing up blood on my shift and overheard them talking about I was lying. OKAY"
bad,"First off my manager at panera bread was always crying , did everything on the cheap side to "" save"" money for the company examples only her and maybe the manager on duty could have overtime hours , everyone else was cut short  40 hours or less . Other female staff would also be crying at random times , the pay rate could be a major factor for the poor performance at the restaurant,  nobody seemed serious about their role and pretty much focused on getting their hours and just head home . Overall that company needs some changes starting with their minimum wage pay which is $5.50 /h ."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"This company mainly hires and promotes teenagers with no common sense or hard work ethics. Upper management are all rude and disrespectful jerks. Low pay no benefits. No respect or appreciation. Too"
bad,management sits n office eating all day when lines to the door schedules are off working 6 days a week high stress and no staff when busy only some manager helps when busy
bad,Such an unhealthy job environment. Very hard to move up because of management. Pay is very low even as a deli every driver I couldn’t make the pay or enough tips to keep up after my own bills or live on my own.
bad,Just depends on ur manager. They are selective and favor easily. Umder paid and over worked at place that charges a little too much for their food. There was no growth even if you had experience
bad,"Managers are overextended and take it out on employees, they rarely follow through on anything an employee asks them to do but are quick to help a customer. "
bad,"You end up working with really great people, but not for great people. Management is poor on communication with employees and often leads to confusion or conflicting directions. It is difficult to speak to a manager about important issues as they never seem to have the time to listen."
bad,"I decided not to accept the job, when I was addressed by a very rude employee. That has also ensured Panera will lose business because of that one specific employee. The customers practically heard how rude he was towards me. I saw some customers leave because of that."
bad,Was hired as a full time employee at the rate of 12hours I neverd received full time hours. The work schedule was very difficult to read and unstable. They had poor management I was lie to multiple times on why I wasn't giving more hours. I was lied on good thing I had proof to back me up. Poor communication on management side and alot feelings are involved.
bad,"Iv'e wasted enough time working there, i don't want to even spend the time writing a review on how bad employee's are treated, or how much of a corporate wage slave ""employment opportunity"" this was. This one woman worked there for 7 plus years and couldn't get the dental coverage through the company (because she was deemed ""part-time at 34 hours a week) or afford dental through private insurance. She works there to this day with a lot less teeth."
bad,The management were a mess. Made us stay hours passed our scheduled departure. Over worked minors more than  the legal work load. Under staffed at the time.
bad,I wouldn’t recommend anyone working in this place if you have your own home and children to feed. You get no benefits and they over work you for a poor salary. The stress ain’t worth it at all.
bad,"Not an engaging experience. Wouldn't even let us take extra food home at the end of the day so they instead threw it in the trash. Wasteful, uninterested management."
bad,"I’ve hated it here. It could just be my location but I would not recommend this place to anyone. Poor management, poor treatment, poor everything. Managers don’t help when asked a question. The managers will even talk about you behind your back. It’s like high school all over again. You’re supposed to be a team leader, not stab your associates in the back. Manager said I don’t know anything, yet whenever I asked a question, they had an attitude....They act like their nice people but they’re really not. Please don’t apply at this location. I always closed so I guess you could say it was pretty chill around that time since all I was doing was cleaning up. But the management was very messy. Anything was better than this location. The managers will belittle you and they don’t care at all. You’re just a number to them. Oh and not to mention, when I sent in my resignation letter, not a manager said a word and when I asked for the two weeks they took me off the schedule after the first week..."
bad,When wanting to advance in your current position you can't. You can't cross train unless you push for it. And even then it's hard to train for other positions to know the whole store. I feel ignored by my GM most days when I ask for cross training. They have me train other employees but will not give me my title as a trainer. It is very invalidating over all. Other employees want to quit as well.
bad,"I the managers are nice, co workers are very easy to get along with. Food was delicious for lunch since everything is healthy. The most enjoyable part of my day was making a customer smile."
bad,"There are crazy restrictions on what you can look like, piercings tattoos. Dress code is strict. Management is in shambles and there are terrible double standards for every employee. Pay is no where near what it needs to be for the amount of work you are required to do. Honestly there’s not a lot that is good about working there. From direct managers to higher ups there really is no structure and they lack good leadership skills."
bad,"As a full-time college student, I was overwhelmed with being a full-time worker as well. When I asked for less hours, they lessened my workload by 1-4 hours/week, which wasn't nearly enough."
bad,"Panera is a good stepping stone for better jobs, however, due to favoritism in the management staff, and inflexible hours, it isn’t a good long term job."
bad,Panera Bread is a great first job. It takes all the nerves out and is very casual. Not so well as a career. There isn't work life balance. You are expected to work out of your pay rate and attempt to reach goals as a team.  Yet there isn't a sense of team.
bad,"Very demanding of its managers and associates."
bad,"Working at Panera has its ups and downs. They are incredibly flexible for high school and college students. I would highly recommend working there if you are a student. When it comes to making a living, I would not recommend it. They almost never give raises unless you become a trainer (.50 raise). It is not guaranteed that you will move up in this company despite working incredibly hard or how long you have been there. The company has the tendency to move people up based on favoritism or they choose to hire from outside of the company. They have incredibly high expectations for their employees which is a great learning experience for future jobs. The one thing that is nice about working here is the people. After a while, your coworkers become family to you. For the most part, everyone works together as a team which makes a huge difference in a high volume store. Management is extremely helpful when it gets busy and they sometimes reward hard work."
bad,"Had to pick up a lot of other people's slack while still getting paid the same as them. started at 8.30, been working for 2 years. only raise I got was 25 cents after a years worth of work. My managers have told me you're supposed to get 25 cents for every 6 months working there. I'm trying to get some type of back pay now."
bad,Overall Panera Bread has horrible management and not a friendly environment i was extremely undervalued and going to work felt like a chore more than a job.
bad,"It has taken a toll on my heath understaffed , a couple of people working there is a bully and rude which makes for a very negative day. Nothing you do to go above and beyond is appreciate only nagging because a certain person doesn’t like it.  Just negative people.  GM does not stand up for employees unless you are super close. He Listens to you tells you one thing does another."
bad,Poor management for the most part.  Highly unprofessional.  Pay is way below minimum wage. New employees are being hired in making 3x more than people that have been there for over a year. No raises.
bad,"Working at Panera Bread was alright at first, but turned into a nightmare about 6 months in. Management is poor; my manager picked favorite associates and gave them constant praise, but, for everyone else, nothing was ever good enough. Working on the line was a nightmare. I didn't get paid enough to get screamed at over sandwiches (by my managers AND by customers). Working with the food is so stressful, and you're expected to get meals to customers in less than 3 minutes, when everything is made-to-order. The expectations are unrealistic. Everything is the line's fault. You're blamed for everything that goes wrong. Every food service job has its pros and cons, but I wouldn't recommend working here for an extended period of time."
bad,"Panera is a trying it’s best to be a good company and place to work, but through no fault of its own, it often falls short due to the amount of business it deals with. Employees have very little time focus on anything other than the immediate job at hand. In addition, they are generally understaffed because few new employees decide to continue working under such conditions for just over minimum wage. Those that have been working for some time are often making less than new employees, because of a lack of significant raises, this drives them to quit leading to problems with training the few new hires that do stay. The one good thing about Panera is the staff the majority of which are very pleasant friendly people, and good to work with."
bad,"Paid $6/hr for driving and $9/hr in store.  Tips weren't great.  They also paid mileage.  However, they had no auto insurance coverage, vacation after a year was based on some sort of average hours worked in the previous year.  No sick days.  No benefits. Didn't receive a raise until about 1 yr and it was $0.25."
bad,"I bend over backwards every day for panera and nothing in return other than ""you can do better."" The powers that be are constantly changing panera to be a worse place to work and worse place to get food for our customers"
bad,"Working with others left like more of a competition than teamwork. Each time I communicated to my managers about a problem i experienced, they did nothing to try and help me"
bad,"there is no support, training or growth in the company, if anything brakes they don't take care of it, and is our responsibility to take care of everything"
bad,"As my first job , Panera sucked. The employees were rude and there was no encouragement there just judgment and criticism constantly while i did my best going at such a fast pace and it was so busy I could keep up but it the night when we’d close they were pressuring me and cussing as me trlling me to hurry up when i was trying to make sure everything was nice and tidy but they were too busy trying to go home they’d still have little bits and pieces of food stuck in cracks and would mop up dirt and food before sweeping. Just disgusting and they would pack up an Close an hour before they’re supposed to. I wouldn’t recommend."
bad,I started before the company was bought out and it seemed like a great place to work. After 6 months I realized that being a GM for this company would not be something I was interested in. They expect a lot from GMs but give them no support to achieve the goals that have been set.
bad,"I was promoted from within but did not receive any of the training I was promised, and upper-management never had my back. The lack of respect at this place is appalling."
bad,"-A typical day at Panera is u put on your apron and just when an order comes up you follow the listed food in that salad or sandwich and you usually have to clean your station at times when it's not busy. "
bad,"Productive and hard working. I learned more about people and processing the company guidelines. building relationships."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"Cold people, rude environment. Food is OK. Management is fake, don't truly care for employees. It was the managers and employees who need to figure out how to work as a team and conversate with other employees working at Panera Bread."
bad,"No support from upper management. Company had been a  good family friendly environment, but has become all about the bottom line. Need to remember the money is made at the cafe level not in the corporate offices"
bad,"My experience from when I did work at Panera Bread wasnt much of a great one.  Even though I really enjoyed my position there, It was working with the manager, at the time, that was the problem.  For some reason he would have a problem with what seemed to be just me.  Regardless of the good feedback and compliments that I would receive, it seemed that he was the only one who had an issue with me and he handled it very unprofessionally."
bad,"and so is management.  very tough job, takes thick skin.  Also I had to clean fecal matter off of walls in the men's restroom on more than one occasion."
bad,"Everyone just came in, put their nose to grind, and never smiled or talked unless they HAD to. What i hear is that my store is just the black sheep (rated lowest in the city)."
bad,"primary job duties for Panera team members include food preparation, sanitation, and customer service. Panera Bread crew members operate cash registers, as well. Applicants with strong communication skills and experience in the coffee shop industry may gain preferential treatment during the Panera Bread hiring process."
bad,"At the Panera Bread I have been working at, I have had to deal with the most terrible management that do not know how to interact or respect their associates. I am in need of a new job as soon as possible because it has become too toxic of a workplace and I will not continue to put up with managers that care more about their statistics than their own employees."
bad,"Ever since Covelli Enterprises bought out Panera Bread it has seen a increase in lack of training, and lack of concern for their associates and managers."
bad,its was fast and the mangers cant not keep things you tell them to there selves. the work place is fast and if you cant handle rude people then don't work here casue people get mad very quick here
bad,"Although I thoroughly enjoyed the food that was served to me, my experience with panera bread in Lafayette, LA was unpleasant to say the least. First off,  the delivery system is a total joke: small delivery area, little to no driver management since the driver manager was fired for a driver's mistake,  delivery marketing did not boost sales at all, and when not making deliveries, which is mostly 80% of the time on shift, we are allocated to back of house duties (although it started off with drivers just sitting on their butts until deliveries popped up) Plus, drivers can only wear an orange polo shirt which is given to u. No other colored shirt is acceptable so hopefully love orange. There's so much unnecessary drama that happens and people on the line talk bad about everyone excluding themselves. Secondly, most of the managers actually work for most of their shift. When business is slow, they tend to run to the office to do 'paperwork'. Which, in turn, slows down efficiency, since everyone has to hunt down the manager if there is a problem. Lastly, quarterly meetings and an employee of the season is chosen; which is either a popularity contest or a pity party. I received a super large polo shirt I never wear and a $25 gift card, not exactly that great of a reward but a reward nonetheless. In conclusion, I feel bad for writing this, because I really wanted to like this job but all it really gave me back was a sense of failure for things out of my control. I'm sure this is an isolated incident though; it can't be this bad everywhere else..."
bad,"A typical day at work would consist of two rushes either breakfast and lunch or lunch and dinner. Customers were often easy to deal with but on certain days some people were harder to deal with than others. Management was not the best, schedules were often messy and confusing. Managers were often stressed and unpleasant to be around. Pay was awful and barely were given discounts on the food either."
bad,The manager there just dont care causing everything to fall apart when they are asked to help. Several shift supervisors have said several times that they doesnt really care.
bad,I had been working at Panera Bread for over a year and never have I been so displeased to see its decline in management. The associates have more of an idea of how to run the house than do the management which is the biggest reason I left. The management is extremely poor recently and there's a revolving door of them who are outright rude to customers. Not a company I would recommend to anyone anymore even though I once spoke so highly of where I worked. There were many people who had been there over a year and still never received their yearly raise either.
bad,"Panera Bread was just like working at any other chain of its kind. The pay is not bad, but the employees at the location I was working at were not entirely positive and the managers were not very flexible with hours."
bad,"Seems like a good job at first management will cut you to save hours, refuse to give you over 20 hours even if they promise you 35+ workers are nice but corporate doesn’t care for you all they want is a “good clean store”"
bad,"They promise the world! Training stinks! Managers and DMs are crooked! If you are sneaky, and good liar and theif then this is the job for you!  The more youocrooked the more you’re promoted!"
bad,"It’s a joke!!! When I first started with Panera I was warned that it wasn’t at all as what it seemed and I didn’t believe that person, but I should have. It was great at first my direct managers were awesome and attentive, but then suddenly you stop hearing/seeing them, their attitudes change and if you have an issue they want you to solve it yourself. Because I came from a high production bakery before, it was easy for me to adapt to Panera and complete everything on a timely manner. But they definitely were biased towards certain people and let others slack off without getting in trouble, but if it was anyone else they’d get a write up."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"Lack of honesty and poor objectivity in terms of descisions. Not enough experience. Promoting people in positions of importance, whom are not clearly qualified for such positions."
bad,Over real it’s a great place to start having a job but not a great place to work if you’re looking for great pay or to further your skills in management.
bad,The managers were chosen by whether they were friends with the GM or not. Our store manager had no experience managing and was younger than most of the employees there.
bad,"I do not enjoy panera bread they lack leardship and can not follow proper instructions , they do not provide the the work life experience and lack Professionalism within the work place"
bad,"great work and crew, Franchise owner and upper management is not pleasant to work for.  Not enough pay for what you have to do for them. Working over 12 hour days or more!! (I was a GM for Covelli in Tampa FL )"
bad,"Due to the fact that the majority of the employees are either high school students or young college students, the work environment was not professional at all. Management did not like to listen to employees. Management did not take the employees seriously, probably because of the average young age of them. In addition, scheduling was very inconsistent, making it nearly impossible to try to budget."
bad,"Too many new managers that didn't know what they were doing, things kept changing and their solutions to customer service issued varried from effective to offensive."
bad,"Do not apply for the delivery driver job. Every job has it posted as being $12-$15 an hour. This is incorrect. When you are driving you get paid 6.50/hr plus tips, and when your in store you get paid minimu"
bad,"This is a very fast paced job, some days are fun depending who you are working with that day. Panera at the loop in Kissimmee, FL is NOT A GREAT work environment at all! 2 out of the 5 managers barely provide assistance but stay in the office and eat. There is also a lot of favoritism within this store they are unfair with hours and pay, they will only put the same workers on clock every day. 90% of the coworkers do not have good attitudes at all they will harass and scold at you if you are just starting out or have been there for a couple months, instead of trying to help, then they will distance off into the cliques they have and talk terribly about you to everyone."
bad,The Panera I work at is bad the manger is rude to his employees and expects the staff to bust their butts while he does very little. The only good thing are the employees that have been their the longest they help each other out and really care about each other. You get very little praise from management and raises are non exsistent. The customers are high matience and act as if it is a 5 star restuarant when in fact it is fast food. You never get out on time and is expected to be there on time should work both ways. In the summer there are always a ton of flies totally disgusting.
bad,I gained more gray hairs working here than anywhere else. I hate almost all of my managers. Not a good environment to work in. Everyone is so lazy. I will never come back here to work ever again.
bad,"To be honest, if your looking for a temporary job to hold you over Panera Bread isn't bad, but they have a lot of problems."
bad,Worked there for 2 years. Was the last employee from the opening of the new store and was never given a raise. other employees who went to school with me were making more than i was despite them only being there a few months.
bad,"Management isnt the greatest, the promise so much and never follow through with anything. Over worked and under paid. "
bad,"Poor management. Low pay. Unless you are desperate, look for something else. The food is way overpriced for the quality that it is. The environment is depressing and draining to work in day after day."
bad,"This was not a good fit for me and my family at the time.  The hours made it difficult to spend time with my family.  I learned a lot about the  processing of baked good, however, it was not good for my lifestyle, in the long term"
bad,Why do I have to fill this out it's really silly because I already reviewed this. Panera is a terrible place because you get treated poorly with little to no benefits. No free meal unless you're a manger and you get an unpaid 30 minute break.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,The managing here is out of this world horrible. There is absolutely no structure and no respect from most of the managers working here. Unless you have a 2nd job you are currently working I do not recommend this place to be your only one because employees usually leave within 2 months of working here. No respect whatsoever.
bad,The management here is horrid! They are rude and mistreat the employees. They expect you to know what they want you to do without them actually telling you what that is. I've witnessed shouting matches between an associate and a GM where they were cursing at each other and calling each other names. Very unprofessional! They allow some employees who are their friends to get away with mirder while the ones who actually work their butts off get treated like dogs. The person doing the schedule is so unorganized and has no idea what they are doing. They schedule people for the next day or change their schedule and don't tell the associate and then that person gets in trouble for not knowing it was changed.
bad,Panera as a franchise is great! When it comes to their employees. they couldn't care less. Employees have been forced to work for a full month before.
bad,Very fast paced job with no mats around hard tile floor to stand on as you are standing for a long period of time.  Overall it was a good place to work for but then I got sick and did not go back
bad,I worked for company nearly a year. Only one raise with Black Hat $.25/hr. Hard to move up. Not compensated enough for amount of workload required despite time worked
bad,"Everyone smokes, our manager was constantly high, we had a ton of rude costumers, and the pay was not worth it. The one highlight was the free pastries at the end of the night which I donated to a local shelter."
bad,"Opening line- Customer service- Food preparations. Learned how to cater and deliver- preparing food, manage money and running the line. Workplace culture is fine but not for the long time employee."
bad,"I started as a prep person and worked my way up to Shift supervisor, i loved coming to work for my cafe. right now Panera is becoming to much micro managing to the affect of me not liking my job ,, cutting hours and making it more difficult working conditons."
bad,The hardest part of the job is lack of training employees. What I liked about the job was that all the employees were like a family. I always enjoyed the bread bashes because we were able to express our issues but things never changed.
bad,"Hard to deal with,  low training which was very confusing. Rude workers,  many different tasked wantsed with very explanation. Overall,  a bad first job."
bad,"I used to do the Opening sometimes closings "
bad,"I learned to be more of a people person at this job. They were incredibly flexible with my schedule, however, I worked harder for less than I deserved and was mostly taken advantage of while working here."
bad,Panera is a good place to work but involves a lot of tasks and many tough customers and personally am not a major fan of the work environment. And last but not least they are nice but difficult because of the amount of work you have to do while on shift.
bad,"Its insane and its like a mad house.  Managers don't even know what they're doing, New working hour schedule is not conducive to family life.You never get recognized by managers for going out of your way. There is no communication, you jump on your register and do your work."
bad,"Depending on franchise depends on how they treat employees. Austin, TX focuses more on earning money rather than employee care. Management is not consistent or responsive. As a day baker you see your managers face to face maybe once a year outside of meetings. Most communication is through text, phone, or email. General lack of caring."
bad,"It's the same as any fast-food restaurant. Dirty, annoying, except panera tries to pretend like they're different from McDonald's or Burger King, but they have the same stuff going on."
bad,"Panera is not a fun working environment. The management cant wait to tell you how much better they are than you while kicking their feet up.They have a burn and turn work flow. They hire you, burn you out, then kick you to the curb. They see employees as a means to an end and that's it. If you respect yourself don't work here."
bad,"I was the cashier/bakery associate. I took customers orders as well as got them pastries. I learned patience, understanding, and communication skills. The workplace culture was very chaotic and perpetually changing. The hardest part was the unknown of the shift ahead, not knowing how many customers would come in and their attitudes. The most enjoyable part of working there were my coworkers. We all got along for the most part and were able to grow our communication skills."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"Decent job for people in high school, customers very friendly. Management was okay, could be better.If you're good working as a teamn this would be a good fit for you."
bad,great place to learn how to bake. no room for advancement. low pay. bad management. sub-par benefits. they don't stay true to what they say there core principals are.
bad,This place offers no benefits. Takes forever to get a raise. A place strictly for those in high school. Management sucks. The only positive thing is that there are no fryers to have to deal with and they offer clean food...that's it! The pay sucks!
bad,"Panera Bread is a great, friendly environment to work in. I've meet a lot of good friends and i even met my longtime girlfriend but the management is terrible. There has been work weeks where i have worked 50+ hours which at the time was more than the managers of the store. I work 8+ hours shift with no break at all and my managers get mad when i sit down or rest because I'm tired. i work hard no matter what job it is and it is a fairly easy job but the managers make it a terrible work environment. The most enjoyable part is my co-workers.The hardest part about the job is the much rush."
bad,A good job for people who are starting their first job out of high school. While some may work their butts off others don't. Many of the paneras lack real management.
bad,"Good job itself, customers are good. The management needs a lot of work. Particularly in communication with each other and and employees. At least at this location. Also there is poor training at this particular store as of late with new employees not fully having time to grasp procedures and rules. This does not however apply to all locations of this company I highly recommend the Canton and Southington locations for employment training is thorough and the management is good. Over all I loved my job and what I did for work. It was sad to see poor management ruin a good store."
bad,"Delivered for a month, in a 8 hour shift the most deliveries I saw was 7. "
bad,"When I first started working at Panera I really enjoyed it, but in the passed year it went downhill. Management is a joke. They simply ignore any problems that come up. They will turn a blind eye to workers slacking off, tasks not being completed, and lines of customers that need to be helped. They would rather sit on their phones or go outside to smoke than. This leads to more work falling on employees that actually take their job seriously. This is what, unfortunately, led me to find another job. However, there were some good parts about Panera. Most of the regulars are kind and welcoming, and I gained some close friends out of my co-workers. Although, I would not recommend this job to anyone. If you're looking for a stable work environment with good hours and great leadership, look somewhere else!"
bad,"I have never worked for a company that cared so little for their employees and so much for themselves."
bad,I did enjoy my years working at panera but it was always a competition for hours and I never felt like they wanted to promote good employees. I want a company that I can move up in and succeed.
bad,"Works are unappreciated, work environment is unprofessional, inappropriate coworkers. Would not recommend. Management is poor, cleanliness and safety aren't the best, breaks not guaranteed during rush hours."
bad,"The staff is not very friendly. They ask for way to much of you, and do not even take the time to appreciate their staff. Concentrate on more of the negative than the positive."
bad,"I only lasted here a month. I thought I would have liked the job but I didn't. Yeah their food is great and all but for me the negatives out weigh the positives. I only had a lunch once and they would schedule me long hours. After I mentioned about the lunch issue they cut my hours so I had 3 hours my last week. Ironically, I'm a full time college student, they scheduled those last three hours during my class. The scheduler is really rude and I asked her politely for my hours to be switched or covered but she told me there was no other way for me to get out of it but get a write up. I decided to quit after. The GM was not much help either. It's sad how I thought Panera was going to be a good job for me in college but it was horrible for me. The coworkers who were there had too much pride and degraded you for your errors and trained you poorly. They expect you to be profficient within a week which is highly unlikely for most people. I took me 3 weeks to catch on and I got scolded so much for taking ""too long."" I would not really recommend a Panera job, they're strict, immature and rude. A lot of profanity and disgusting conversations happen frequently. It was hard for me to make friends here sadly, I was only associating with one person but half the time I'd wouldn't be working with him, but the negative experience won't stop me from eating there, just not this specific location."
bad,"Coming into short staffed shifts with nothing stocked because morning/midshift manager is lazy.Scheduling managers that fail to take into account availability, hours requested, and skill set of employees scheduled to work. I've learned that some managers like to play favorites, giving more hours to certain people as well letting people get away with things that others would be written up for. Management in general needs. They are never in agreement about anything and we keep having managers coming and going so there is no stability. Co-workers overall work well together, or at least they used to before we had a big manager overhaul. Dealing with managers and the division between morning crew and night crew would be the hardest part of the job to deal with. The most enjoyable part would be working with the friends we made there."
bad,not an enjoyable place to work. management is sexist and treats employees like mules. advancement is little and and not much when you get it.
bad,it was a good job for a while it just was not for me in the end. I did learn a lot from my peers and was able to get certified in different areas in the job.
bad,everything is completely unorganized the only good things about my location is the nice coworkers. everything else is unnecessary fast food drama that everyone else tries to avoid. but i love the food...
bad,"I think Panera Bread would have been a better experience if it weren't for such horrivle management that soured me on my position and job when I wasn't allowed to leave for over an hour when my father in law of 93 yrs was in the ER room after an emergency surgery.  He passed away just hrs after I was able to get there and there was NO reason why that had to happen except for the management who had NO personal life and was envious of mine."
bad,"i had 9 hours per week, always asking for more..my hours were totally scattered and you start on the most difficult job in the entire place."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"Panera is a great name, however what happens behind the scenes is always what everyone wants to know. One manager smoked weed in the parking lot (after hours). Sanitation is not an important idea for the managers. They treat it like a fast food place than a great name cafe or bistro. They were not willing to compensate anyone. They were unwilling to work around family matters or important doctor appointments. Overall my work experience was below par. Would still eat there BUT only select items...."
bad,"Working at Penara Bread is going to e exhausting and unrewarding. Management is not good at best, hardest part of the job is doing four things at once and having multiple managers breath down your neck if you don't get a sticker on a product right away while doing three other objectives that they have given you. Costumers can be very rude, and management fights with each other. Nothing about this job was enjoyable, but teaches you have to work fast. Also if there is a blizzard you are still expected to be there when the roads are impassable."
bad,"Work days the upper Management doesn't want to work. They have a great training program and if everyone knows what it is all about, then everything works well."
bad,First starting out this was a great employer but after being with the company for a while there is lots of favoritism and management does not follow through with employee payroll issues and benefits.
bad,"I admit, I'm not always the timeliest, or the most polite, and I can't always help but show when I get overwhelmed. I'm a human. My problem with this company is you're trained to be a robot of ""the system"". My issue is, no, the customer is NOT always right. If you're confronted and being screamed at by a customer because their soup wasn't piping hot, you had to sit there and take it. I learned a lot about dealing with a fast paced work environment, and how to handle your emotions, and handle mostly unpleasant customers, which is great..."
bad,"Difficult advancement. Hard management, inappropriate. Co-Workers were great. Job was easy and fun, Loved working with people and serving people."
bad,"you see the manager maybe once a week while you work, but the reviews are always negative. that's the type of motivation they use. even good workers feel like they aren't good because all you hear about is things you do wrong."
bad,Panera Bread was by far the worst job I have ever had. There were some perks about working there but there were a lot more problems with the management than anything. The general manager was on maternity leave and the assistant manager took over. After that everything continued to go down hill. The management is horrible there and I would not recommend working there.
bad,"The management was highly disorganized and would continually forget to schedule every position. More often than not you would be running around the store trying to make sure everything was keeping up with the costumers. When one would ask to have their schedule work around their schooling, the results would show no one was listening."
bad,management is hard to work for but the employees are one of a kind and you make great friends. the customers who come in daily are the best part of the day.
bad,"Customer service"
bad,"Each store management differs from the next.  It is difficult to lump them all together.  I enjoyed working with my Store Manager, but experienced difficulties with Corporate Management, all of whom no longer work with the company"
bad,"when i started at panera it seemed like a really great job, well that was all a pipe dream. management is non existent the schedules were a mess, and they never had enough staff deployed to cover the business that they were producing. the quality of people hired reflected the desperation of the hiring manager. their ""policies"" only seem to apply for some people. and their senior staff all get treated like dog feces on the bottom of a shoe. i would never and will never work for this company again."
bad,"The store I worked for was understaffed and very poorly managed. The job itself is simple. You make sandwiches and salads in a quick fashion and help out customers as necessary. The co-workers were, for the most part, great people. There were a few bad apples but that's the case at any store. What drove me to leave was the lackluster management. Too many times I would be getting ready to leave for the night, long after my shift was over, when management would arbitrarily decide to nitpick for insignificant details they felt I had left out of my closing responsibilities. Shift supervisors were lazy and were very obviously playing favorites with certain workers. Not to mention the managers and supervisors blatantly talk trash to associates about other associates when they're not around, often making harsh and unfair personal judgements about people's lives. This wouldn't be an issue if it took place outside of work, but that's highly unprofessional behavior when you're on the clock, especially for management. At the end of the day, I'd recommend avoiding this store like the plague until something is done about their outright dysfunctional management team. You'd actually be better off at McDonalds or even doing volunteer work at the rescue mission (take it from me, I've done both). At least they appreciate your work."
bad,"not enough professionalism , the General Manager would plan her wedding in store"
bad,This place was good simply because of the customers. the work place and ethic was lacking.
bad,"All business was night, mostly lunch service. Company was slightly inconsistent due to thier management structure."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"This may have only been the specific location that I worked at, but the managers were awful and treated their employees very poorly. Due to that, there was very high turnover, and even the managers themselves transferred constantly. Most were also rude and hypocritical (i.e. sitting out back smoking while on the phone, yet expecting me to both stock and watch the register at the same time) and even though several managers were there at once, it was impossible to find them when I needed them. The customers were also very rude, and took things like price hikes (which cashiers obviously had nothing to do with) out on us. They were also terrible with the schedule. They had a book of days we couldn't work (due to school, etc) and I always seemed to get scheduled during my classes, despite numerous corrections. I would also be the only cashier scheduled when I was set to leave, so I never got to leave on time. Much of the time, I didn't even get to take a break on an 8-hour shift for the same reason. The pay was also very low."
bad,"At Panera, everything was stressful. People complaining in one ear, managers telling you to do things faster than humanly possible in the other. In addition to that, rules f company were rarely followed. I did learn some skills, such as operating a cash register, and being able to deal with impatient customers. The management was very poor- the managers were always coming and going, this is normal at panera. The scheduling was always off. I often felt like i couldn't talk about problems with the managers for fear of them getting upset. Most of the managers were constantly stressed out and in need of a smoke-break. However, the scheduling was flexible- that was an upside. But people, co-workers, and managers were completely unpredictable at Panera Bread. Would not recommend this job f you have a hard time dealing with stress."
bad,A typical work day is going in and doing dishes and cleaning and doing what the manager asks. Made allot of good friends there. The hardest part of the job is the management. The most enjoyable part is the friendships.
bad,"When I decided to work at Panera I knew I would enjoy the atmosphere because I am a very social person. I quickly embraced the atmosphere and the friendliness of the other employees. It was when I became a Shift Supervisor that things started to change. I did not realize my own social life would diminish and a strain be put on my marriage. The schedule was tough to deal with, constantly changing and my hours fluctuated and I really needed 40 hours. I couldn't enjoy a wknd and had to ask for days off hoping that I would get approved. My excitement went away when I had to deal with unrulely customers and get blamed for things that I had nothing to do with or any control over. It was unfortunate the way that my particular upper management handled situations and treated the employees and myself. Not a situation I wanted to be involved in anymore."
bad,"Panera Bread is a food service establishment that rides the edge between fast food and a conventional full service restaurant. A typical day at work for me was pretty simple. I clocked in, washed dishes or prepared food, and clocked out. The management staff was mostly made of people who had a strong dislike for their job, or people who were just working through college. My co-workers were mostly high school and college students. The hardest part of the job was the stress of just how utterly replaceable everyone there was. The most enjoyable part of the job was the discount employees received on food."
bad,"I was hired to work full time with 35 to 40 hours a week. I ended up only working part time with 20 to 25 hours a week. Management is RUDE and they have there favorites associates in which they give all the hours to. Thought the food is really good, I would not recommend this as a place to work unless you are in college looking for only a few hours a week. This is a Biweekly pay period and the payday is tuesday. The only good thing about employment with Panera Bread is the 65% discount and the food. OTHER WISE I DEFINITLEY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS AS A CAREER CHOICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
bad,No advancement.  No raises.  Cheap manager with bad equipment.  High turnover.  Lazy employees.  Good food discounts.  No recognition.  Schedule Flexible with what I need.
bad,"Work environment was ok but the management at the time I was working there was awful, there was no leadership and a lot of the work load would fall on a very small number of people, things might be better now."
bad,not paid enough and slwsys understaffed. cant keep good people. they change your hours without asking and compensation is horrible.high stess with very little help.
bad,I am a college student and do my best at my part time job but sometimes my job becomes to stressful and effects my school work. The managers will only give employees tasks to do and won't help out the employees that are swamped with work. They only care about those that will be there full time and they treat the part time workers poorly.
bad,Upper management is not supportive of their team. Upper Management expects management team to be respectable of the associates while they are not respectful of their own selves.
bad,Hours were good due to the fact that the workplace is extremely understaffed. Overall job duties are very high and it can be very overwhelming when you are stuck doing two jobs at once because no one shows up for work. Management is horrid.
bad,"Everyone there is way too cliquey. New staff are treated like outsiders. Line workers are on drugs and the managers know but don't care because in the end they do their job. They throw you into the fire after their ""training"" and it's a constantly stressful environment. One manager especially had bad anger issues and hit a girl with a hot pan from the oven. Don't recommend at all!"
bad,"The general manager is cold with a light sense of humor. The hiring manager is not much help when working in evening rushes, he just lounges around and complains when there’s an issue rather than helping resolve it. There are a handful of good employees that will actually help one another, the rest call off all the time and manage to get away with it or don’t care about contributing to the tasks at hand. This job is stressful, but the good managers and associates make it worth while."
bad,This job is good for kids who don’t have anything to pay for. Good first job. After a while the pay will bother you. Seriously no raises and you work hard to get no where. The management (certain ones) acts as if they see nothing wrong with it & will continue to prolong any conversation bought to the attention.
bad,"Building and re-constructing staffing for the better."
bad,"This is not a fun place to work. While most of the other associates are very friendly, the managers are rude and unqualified. The biggest problem is the scheduling is not flexible at all."
bad,"I worked here for about a month before I quit. They expect you to do everything with no help. The managers do not want to assist you with anything, and it’s impossible to get one when you need them. They hire any warm body but those of us with a work ethic end up suffering. Scheduling is a joke, I would be scheduled to close on a Friday night and then open the next morning at 5am."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"I worked at Panera for 3 years, I was an assistant for two of them. I worked for the covelli franchise, and if I may, probably the worst franchise I have ever experienced. The director of operations would just pummel the area directors, to them you were only a number. Your contracted 45 hours and you end up working 50-55. Then they blame that on you saying you should get out faster. A typical director visit usually ends with a unhealthy work environment. They basically have you push around minor associates and make them feel bad if they choose there high school life over them. Don’t work for such a bogus company. You would find a million times better.list that is 3 hours long to complete right before your shift is up. I"
bad,Panera in FDL specifically has barely any professional managers in charge they are biased about favoritism and are emotional with the job so one day you did something right but doing it again the next day you are wrong .
bad,"When I first hired in, I had no intentions of moving up. I worked in 2 locations. The first one, I didn’t plan to stick around too long. Then I changed my mind when I transferred. They didn’t allow me to transfer. In fact they made me start over even though I was more than qualified compared to those they did move up. When I was trying to move up, doing everything by the book, not taking short cuts, quality service, it seemed like you had to buddy up with management to get anywhere within the company. It’s more of a job for college/high school kids. Not a single parent  trying to make a living."
bad,"It's not worth the time and energy they work you like a slave"
bad,I worked at two separate stores they were both terribly managed. I had seen a cycle of new managers come and go. Very fast-paced and not worth the pay. I was supposed to get a raise for training individuals and one for each year you worked there but didn't receive either of those. I could not ever get time off because of the bad management and low turn up rate of other employees.
bad,"The management is horrible, when I started October 2018 we had 7 managers that would close at night and now we are down to 2 and our general manager refuses to hire more. We had to bring another manager to the lower peach location where I work from another location in order to help cover shifts."
bad,"I worked for at the Aurora location for almost 3 years since it opened back in April 2016. I will say right now that the only reason i stayed so long was for the fact that my co-workers made every second bearable and i cared about them. The decisions the management team made over the course of my time there were not only unprofessional but unbelievably comic at times. They would make one or two workers (often new hires too) to work line during peak rushes because of under staffing for hours on end and often not help at all if it was really busy. Having 2 people do the job of at least 6 during the busiest time is disgusting, so no wonder they don't have the respect or support of their staff.  If someone called in ""sick"" the managers at the time would HOUND everyone and pester each person if they could stay and cover, even if that person has been there for 9 hrs already, and if you were actually sick they would tell you to ""pop and Advil and call back in 30 mins"". They do NOT care about the people they hire and work with. There is no respect among worker and boss and the support system there for training new hires is a joke. If you had a complaint or request and told the managers it would take WEEKS to hear back and they would not give straight answers at all. I waited nearly a month for my T4 and the reason was he ""forgot"" even though i asked every time i saw him. If you work at this location, expect to be treated like a time slot because that is how they see you, a cog in the machine that they only care about if it affects them directly."
bad,1sr rule of this co is no jerks allowed. Not my experience. Most managers are over worked and under paid. They have some good employees but it is stressful and company expects too much. Really has gone downhill since co was bought out 2 years ago
bad,"panera is a decent temporary type of job. honestly, i don’t recommend working there unless you would like to get food experience to move onto another job or become a higher up. free fountain drinks and decent discount on food (only if you get below $10 worth of food though) but management needs serious improvement. there’s lot of drama and favoritism, both in management and coworkers, and almost everyone is a disrespectful crybaby. management is very unprofessional. they allow their emotions to take control and they’ll dump it on whoever they feel deserves it or if they’ve made a simple mistake or even no mistake at all. there are some good eggs, but sadly a few of them are leaving soon as of august 2019. with no good management, i plan on taking my leave too ASAP."
bad,I worked here seasonally and every time I came back on a break from school there was a new general manager and each one was worse and cared less than the one before. I did not really enjoy my experience at this company and is the reason I no longer wish to work in the food industry.
bad,"Worked there for a  very short amount of time. At the location I was at some of the employees were really disrespectful to upper management, they basically ran themselves regardless of what they were told. Management lacked understanding and communication between themselves."
bad,"-Lack of proper management "
bad,Management is really bad from district to GM. You have to work two years at 37hrs a week get a paid vacation. There is more shift leaders and managers than employees practically. Questions you ask are answered differently by each manager. The store is filthy all the time. Mgrs have favorites employees who don’t help.
bad,Management isn’t very helpful. They’re more than likely just sitting around. There’s a lot of favoritism and discrimination in the workplace. Good for high school/college kids.
bad,"As my first job I wanted to really gain some knowledge about businesses and how some of them run. All I really got was disappointment. The training was minimal and then they expected me to take care of half of the store. I got the general vibe of servicing customers but as for management it was very improvisational, a lot of us didn't like the way the place was operated."
bad,"Great as an associate, once you move up you get very little support from upper management. Terrible scheduling had several weeks when I didn't know if I worked the next day or not."
bad,"I'm from Jersey, born and raised. To survive the everyday you have to work. At least two jobs. My experience at Panera was in the state of Geargia. Needless to say, "" never in my work history have I ever had a job where the managers take pride in bringing down there employees instead of appreciating the hard good hard work they put in. "" And will tell you to your face. The only time proper procedure is taken in and enforced, is when their bosses is in the store. Its funny, everything taught at "" planet bread "" ( orientation before work ) about the rights and wrong of the company and store policy for all employees. Just about all managers disregard or act exempt for the rules. Only the in store managers !! The Panera Bread company is actually a really good brand. They really have to step it up on oversight on managers."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"For how little you get paid, you are doing a lot a work! For how much work you do, you deserve to be getting paid at least $10 an hour! But, you only make $7.25!"
bad,"Management was poorly ran, taking away hours from employees at random to see if they would ""work harder to earn them back"" causing an extremely stressful environment with a complete lack of trust."
bad,"Got into arguments with coworkers about stupid stuff they decided they wanted to fight about,managers never did anything to punish anyone.Not a good place to work"
bad,Manager was very rude and yelling to others. Everybody was stressed because of her. When she wasn’t there everything was ok. Even if your shift overs 4pm management would say “good to go” at 2 pm. You never guess how much you make money that week.
bad,DM and GM were big buddies and partial to certain employees that was part of 'after work' get togethers.  If you were not part of that group you were not listened to when it came to reporting issues with other employees including doing their jobs correctly.
bad,"For the first few weeks working at panera, everything was running fairly smoothly.  After about 2 months, though, at least 7 people quit or were fired, most of those being managers.  Our store was struggling to find management and employee replacement.  We did get new managers but they would not help me, as a cashier, when we were low staffed.  There would be a line out the door for over 3 hours and several managers would just clock out and leave without bothering to help the guests, much less me."
bad,This company is a Franchise of Panera Bread. Do not go higher than a shift supervisor in this company as it really isn't worth it. The main leadership team from Encinitas can kindly be described as less than pleasant.
bad,"i just learned to always stay positive and dont live in the past , panera was kinda like a family but whemn new people came people started falling apart"
bad,The management was so bad that people were quitting left and right. Our one manager actually get fired because he was sexually harassing employees and our GENERAL manager got fired/quit because his work ethic wasn't compensating the store.
bad,"Terrible place to work because the management was terrible, we were overworked and underpaid every day there was not fun because of how understaffed we were."
bad,Working at Panera Bread wasn't very pleasant at all. They would not give me the time I needed to request off and there were times when they would only give me 10 hours a week on the schedule. I would not like to work with food anymore.
bad,"Panera seems like it’s a great company from a customer’s prospective but it isn’t. The management can show favoritism to certain employees, let them disrespect them, and steal food but they don’t write them up. The management can go from giving you more than enough hours per week to only two days for a 6 hour shift and a 5 hour shift. Bad scheduling can result to angry employees and they won’t care about panera anymore. I assumed that it would be a nice job because I loved panera. When I worked there it was a toxic environment and everyone whined about hating panera. They despised the job and were promoted, they complained about working there on the clock, and they were disrespectful to the male managers constantly and nothing was done. I wouldn’t recommend panera to anyone don’t work here you will not like it."
bad,I didn’t like working there they all sucked and I felt like the managers did no work. We had only a few hours and I wanted more and they wouldn’t I worked there for almost a year
bad,"A Typical Day at Work: extremely stressful around peak meal times with rude customers"
bad,"Hours are hard to come by, co workers complain to much, overall negative environment. The biggest problem is when you work in the afternoon and they force to clean after-hours which can go about 2 to 3 hours above closing time. At least you get paid for it."
bad,i was promise a 50 hour work week and a great work life balance. i got neither. i never worked less than 65 hours a week and never saw my children. i would often close one night leaving close to midnight and have to be back at work at 4am the next morning to open. i was physically threatened by staff when they refused to do their job and was not supported by upper management when i wanted to press charges despite having witnesses and video recording of the event. i ultimately left because of this.
bad,"This place is poorly ran. If you give them a set schedule they will do it for about two weeks then completely give you a different one. If you call in sick, be prepared to get a write up if no one covers your shift or be prepared to have a doctors note. I do not recommend this place to NO ONE. On the other hand, most of the employees are amazing. They are all friendly and welcoming. During the day we have our older crowd working then at night we have all of our teenagers. Everyone gets along great."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"Working at Panera bread is stressful and not, some days things move slow and others they are fast and some of the people on the team are not team helpers. I started out getting a lot of hours and for the past few months they have completely dropped to 2 days a week."
bad,"do way to much work for the amount you get paid. even when you request days off, its not for sure you'll get them off even when you place your non-availabilities. lunch rush is probably the most stressful time of the day because you try to keep a positive attitude even when customers are hangry. you learn a lot of life skills that you can use in the future."
bad,"Working for Panera is okay, it's really about the same as other food service jobs.  It can be very stressful and high demand during the busy times.  Like most similar jobs, there is little to no room for advancement despite a lot of nice empty words from management.  Management seems disinterested in the input and experiences of low level employees.  They usually only care about addressing the demands corporate puts on them.  Very little if any recognition for good job performance.  Everyone tries to act nice and have a positive attitude but that's all you get - no actual reward for performance and minimal pay.  My coworkers made the work tolerable."
bad,Panera Bread is a high school job. Working here beyond that is not fun and everyone who is older and works there takes themselves way too seriously. People who work hard and do all of the work for the team are paid the exact amount as the slackers and the managers would rather disappear and use their phones in the office than help their teammembers when everything gets busy.
bad,I was a delivery driver and when I first started working there I would bust my butt. Well they like to recognize bad workers and people who are lazy. I didnt learn anything except panera is super dirty and has cockroaches everywhere lmao
bad,"Starting pay is 8.25, only $1 above minimum. Good for high schoolers, but beyond that, a terrible job. They do not work with your school schedule if you are not a minor, and management was very sloppy and unprofessional."
bad,"Management is inconsistent. Nobody is adequately trained when they first start, so there's very little time to ask questions before being tossed into the job with minimum knowledge. "
bad,I was inform on the date i was hired I would work 20 hour per week as of this day I only work 8 hours per week. I was inform I would get training in all field of work which is another lie from Penera Bread. I have seen many people come and go base on the fact of lack of work hours and Panera Bread ability to speak the truth. I'm seeking another job now that gives a employee the ability to move up the ladder. Sincerely I would not inform the public it a good work place.
bad,"The work was enjoyable until associates and team members stopped showing up for work and those who did show up had to pick up the slack. "
bad,Once you sign your name you have sold your soul. It was very fast paced. not a lot of thank yous. I stayed for 9 years and not sure how ive made it this far. Good job for teenagers
bad,"Management is lacking. A better training program would help the entire company."
bad,"There were 2 managers in place at the location that I worked at for a very short time, that, in my opinion, should not have had the position. Very little use of logic and/or common sense to a level worthy of recognition was understood or applied in much of their daily work procedure. This is what corporations want in the form of management. Nothing more than ""Yes People!"" No brain required. Just be able to stand the smell of BS and take orders from people with the I.Q. levels of slugs."
bad,"Many, many times over the last few years I have known many employees who are often working 60-80 hours a week. They have often asked for assistance to staff, train and help stabilize the market, and they are ignored until their performance drops, and then and only then do they realize there is a need for support."
bad,"The managers are supposed to give 2 evaluations to workers per year with pay raise. This happened once in the 2.5 years I worked there and it was due to the state minimum wage being raised. The CEO and higher officials are making an absurd amount of money while the people that do the actual customer service work make barely enough to survive. I met many great and happy people at Panera, but the low wages and lack of position flexibility and schedule flexibility tore away at their hearts and made them less desirable to be around. The CEO and other higher officials need to stop being selfish and give their workers a fair wage."
bad,I enjoyed this job as my first job but after a while you begin to notice all of the flaws and how things can be greatly improved. I did enjoy the free drinks.
bad,"At Panera Bread, the managers were not friendly, and did not coach you through what you did not know, they just expected you to learn on you own. The other employees were also not friendly and it was a very ""that's not my job"" type of work environment"
bad,"The managers at this Panera are disgustingly horrible. all they do is make you work 500X harder so they can just relax and do whatever they can to AVOID helping at all, Then when one thing isn't done its ""unbelievable"" even though you just did everything else by yourself while your other coworkers got to stand around and laugh. managers don't care about your other obligations and don't you dare ever not feel 100% because you will be working. you have to let them know over 4 hours ahead if you cant go in.  The company is known for having ""Panera warmth"" but hires the coldest managers. "
bad,"If you want to be a delivery driver, don't.  Pay sucks,  only get 2-3 hours a day and the tips are lousy. They schedule too many drivers for a 3 hour shift. That means less tips for you. Only good for someone in school. If you need a real income go elsewhere."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"As catering coordinator I recieved little to no help with orders, management would continue to take orders until I had too many. I then had to deliver them all over the county. I felt over worked and underpaid."
bad,Great company to work for. Depends on the store and market whether or not the cultural values will be carried out by management in the right way. Very fast paced and you must have a hustle and care about your job if you want to succeed. Company expects a lot for little money.
bad,"They try to make your schedule as consistent as possible which is nice. They're also willing to adapt to your schedule if you give advanced notice. However, if you work at a register at all DO NOT expect to leave on time, they will wait until the last second to pull your drawer and you'll be there an extra 30-45 minutes. They will also only allow you the minimum, required by law, amount of breaks. They will send you on your 30-minute unpaid break as close to the 5-hour mark as they can and they will keep you at work until they would have to offer you another unpaid break, there are no 15-minute breaks here. They are also often understaffed because of call-outs which makes your job that much more difficult."
bad,"I worked at Panera for about a year, & I was good at my job; however, the work & money did not equal out. I was making $9/hr, yet giving $20/hr worth of effort. This is a great place to gain work experience to prepare for a real job, but I do not suggest going into this place with hopes of making $10/hr or more."
bad,I worked for Panera for four years and it is very demanding for poor compensation.  Management would like the bakes to be made under 9 hours which is extremely hard to achieve solo considering all the steps they would like performed.  If all the steps are preformed correctly the employee will have no breaks and will barely have time to clean after his or her shift.  To conclude on a very long and possible stressful shift Panera does not even compensate a free meal only a small discount.
bad,"It's a fairly simple job - just very stressful and fast-paced. If you like working with food but don't know where to start this is a decent option. The work environment is alright - there's times of stress during rushes, and times where you can just relaxed for a bit. Management is pretty poor, granted it really goes down to the individual and their work ethic. While working here I didn't get any benefits, though."
bad,"Have a passion for food and training. I first learned how to cater at this establishment on a large scale. Management was quite cut-throat at my first stationed location. Though my efforts in training were recognized as valuable but I was not promoted or paid for my efforts. I was sent to various locations to train staff and management on a large scale. My classes and sessions were as low as 50 people or as high as 100. I made all my own materials and tests as well as ensured that my staff's were cross trained in no less than 3 areas in the cafe's. "
bad,Panera Bread made me cry everyday.
bad,The jobs locations weren’t too bad management tried to be good but there as a lot of drama on the job between monagemt and employes. Hardest part was the hours not too many were giving but wanted a lot done in shift that were short.
bad,"Worked a few places, this one by far most stressful especially after GM change about 1.5 years ago.  Managers don't communicate well, regional manager is numbers guy not worried about the team or the managers working together well.  Overall rather toxic and not worth working but due to the relationships created among good workers and those pulling extra weight in the cafe, its a bearable place for now."
bad,I liked working at Panera temporarily but the managers would tend to belittle you or talk down to you at the location i worked at. I had to leave because the main manager of our location cut my hours to the point i had no choice but to find other employment.
bad,When I began working for Panera I saw that it was a very demanding fast paced environment to work. When you first start working for Panera you can enjoy yourself with learning the ropes to retail and customer service . However Panera is a temporary job certainly something I wouldn't want to make a career because the balance between life and work is off it can be very stressful.  The management can put a lot of stress on the employees when the company demands certain changes for example there has been a lot of instances where hard working employees hours have been cut down by corporates demand. The managers tend to have favorites and don't value their hard workers Panera can be very stressful and something corrupt
bad,"Management discourage a team dynamic and instead preferred assigned tasks regardless of overloading employees in more demanding roles. In addition, managers were not receptive to employees suggestions."
bad,I did not enjoy my time at Panera Bread mainly because of the management. I worked there for 2 years and never received a pay raise while others would apply and on the spot they would get a higher raise than me. It was very stressful and the hardest part of the job was when they scheduled me to open at 5:00 am in the morning.
bad,Training was inconsistent. New hires were trained by people who aren't getting compensated for training them. I worked for the company part time for over a year and never received the required online training needed for advancement. I trained well over 20 people and was not once paid the salary of a trainer.
bad,I worked there for six years because it was easy and I needed college money. You do get some free stuff but the discounts are virtually nonexistent in written company policy.
bad,Their Orientations was lovely but they hit you with very low pay for the stress of preparation and timely work. not enough employees to keep a functional atmosphere. doing multiple jobs for lower then minimum wage. no benefits or health.
bad,"No opportunity for advancement, no matter how hard you work. Once they felt like you were  trained in the area where they wanted you at....they wouldn't arrange for more training so that you could advance to management"
bad,"Typical high school job, it was very cliquey. Management chose favorites. No room for growth. Lack of communication. Some employees got paid  more than others regardless if they worked there longer"
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,Panera is a company thatsconstantly busy because of the demand evry employee needs to work as a team in order to be efficient and management needs to b orderly in order to have positive results
bad,I was told that even I did certain job duties i would get a raise and never got one. Mangers seemed jeolous if me and my work ethic when they should be happy at what I bring to the team!
bad,"It's a job. Nothing special. They give employees different pay rates for the exact same work based on the individuals. That's a little strange. I loved one of my managers, the others were incredibly lazy, considering they must have a bachelor's to be a manager for Panera (like, really?) and they were quick to criticise. My GMs were pretty great, more willing to help than the lower managers, but still incredibly stingy with hours. I use to work food prep, which included way more work than food preppers at other Paneras, and I was expected to finish before 1100 to work the dining room, by myself, during the lunch rush. Which is ultimately why I quit."
bad,My managers we're not the best and half of the time the order systems were down. We have some not nice employees. I also didn't get a lot of hours when I asked for hours. I also don't get paid enough money for how much work I do.
bad,"Was promised $12-$15 an hour, but only made $8 an hour on my paycheck when I worked in the restaurant.And that rate dropped to $5 an hour when I was on deliveries. The tips did not make up the difference."
bad,"I was promised to be scheduled a full 30 hours a week. This has not happened. Management is often disorganized and inconsistent, yet maintain high standards for associates."
bad,"The concept has made the cafe into a “fast food “time and Work structure, but expects to be able to staff and charge at a premium cafe price. Not realistic. On call 24/7. Average 60 weeks and you schedule can vary from starting your day at 2AM to closing to store at midnight. Quality of life is horrible."
bad,"I started working when I was 16 and finally quit after being worked practically as a slave around 30+ hours a week. Try not to work here until your an adult, it's not the best environment for teens. The managers as people and supervisors were great. Just at Panera Pines the MTI's go annoying, the aspects us associates were held at were almost unreachable. Great people just horrible work environment."
bad,Okay place to work not amazing but may be a different experience at other stores based on management and coworkers. They are good with scheduling around you.
bad,its a fast pace store especially with a drive thru. The hardest part of the job would be learning all the steps to each sandwich. other than that its an okay job.
bad,"12% sales growth expected yearly, production with little to no store support and on-time delivery expectations create an unnecessarily stressful work environment with little salary to justify it."
bad,"It was fast paced which I didn't mind, super stressful especially with the manager that I had who wasn't very helpful. I learned how to multitask at this job, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, it was a temporary job."
bad,"It's a good place to get started, but not a place to settle down in, there's 6 managers always down your throat whether you're doing good or not, there were a few managers that are actually humble and good hearted human beings, never gave me health benefits when i started like they were suppose to, no 401k, no PTO"
bad,"This was my first job in the restaurant industry. I learned a lot about how to use the electronic systems used in many restaurants. However, I felt being a cashier was not a job I enjoyed."
bad,the Management is very stressful at times. sometimes it could be fun depending on what day you work. it can be real busy and the people there are really mean to you.
bad,I loved the job but there is a big problem with upper management nothing runs smooth and you are treated poorly. Not very good hours and no cares about there job
bad,"As a baker for Panera, I had job security, but for the wrong reasons.  It is a position that was overnight, alone, locked in the store, for 8-10 hours.  There was little to no time to take a break, ever, and the opening management was downright rude and disrespectful to the bakers."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"Management was poor. The general manager was unprofessional and biased. However, I enjoyed working with my co-workers. They were friendly and supportive."
bad,"Good food...too many politics and nepotism in this area.  "
bad,"At my location (which was new) there was so much stress, work, disrespect from managers, that half the staff quit within 2 months of operation. good bagels though."
bad,"panera needs to learn how to pay their employees a decent pay rate.i loved my customers but the managment team was not great, I worked there for 3 years and didn't even make $ 9.00 an hour"
bad,"9 consecutive days of working and I can still barely afford to pay my electric bill. The company itself is not a bad place, and the values i have learned in three months is greater than i have ever learned before, but being paid 8.50$ an hour and working until i have sweat dripping down my face for 10 hours daily is a while new ball game."
bad,"My time at Panera Bread was not an enjoyable one. The hours are long and inflexible, and the staff does not seem to be appreciated for the work they do there."
bad,"Panera is a great first job, but not as a career. Very clean and organized, and food is impeccable. Great place to eat, not so much to work however. Managers are typically rude, but get their job done."
bad,"I worked there for almost 2 years and helped open the new store. The job was great and I liked the hours, overnight, but the managers were absolutely terrible. I would go back if it weren't for the management."
bad,The Panera I worked at was a very busy. The management overturned every couple of weeks. Nothing was consistent or fair. They did not like to give raises. I worked there for 2 years and received one raise when I was promised three.
bad,"If your a baker here, esp. overnight, they will ask you to work some crazy hours like over night one day and day shift the next. They don't care about you or your life. I really hated this place."
bad,Panera Bread can be a great company to work depending on the management. The hours are extremely flexible and you have the opportunity to be promoted.
bad,"Working here was okay. I enjoyed working with my friends, but the job itself was not very fun. Just your basic food service job with little financial compensation to show for it."
bad,"A typical work day at Panera Bread consisted of rushing orders, and endless tasks. Working at Panera Bread on the turnpike was stressful, and unfair. I learned cash register while there, and learned how to prep. Management, however, wasn't always the greatest. Even when working there for a significant amount of time, I was never offered to be a trainer, even though I was treated like one. I would help show the new workers the ropes, but I never got trained or paid to do it. I was also treated unfairly for things that weren't even me, or things I was never told about. For example, I was written up, suspended, and not told that someone else would be covering my shift. I had no knowledge of the three write ups, that I did not get to see or sign, causing me to want to put in my two weeks. Even when putting in my two weeks, the managers were very cold and not understanding, nor caring. The hardest part about working at Panera Bread was not me doing my job, but not being respected or appreciated for it. The only thing enjoyable about working here is the half off on the highly expensive food."
bad,"This was the worst job I've ever had when it comes to  being a manager or a GM. The district manager is degrading and expects you to run your crew with an iron fist. You cannot keep crew members around with that mentality. You expect respect, then give it to others."
bad,Management does not accommodate to employees that need time. Does not work well with scheduling does not follow what was told to me when hired. Does not give things that we're told/promised when hired...
bad,"If you want to work where you feel appreciated, Panera bread is not the place for you. the lack of care for their employees is shocking. the management team is only looking out for what will work for them in the now. They are not looking at the big picture, and in doing so they are pushing their good workers that have been with them for over a year away."
bad,The managers are not that great. I feel like they did not know how to treat there associates. They never have enough coverage and you never get to leave on time.
bad,"Taking customers orders, processing payments."
bad,"The crew members are as close as family members are"
bad,"Given tasks to do that I wasn't trained for or taught"
bad,"Panera Bread in Greenville, SC is definitely not the best place to work. The staff were generally all good people, and nice to be around, but management was heinous. I was penalized for needing to go to the hospital and told it was ""unacceptable,"" before having my full-time hours cut down to less than 10 a week. There was not adequate hands-on training, and then there were penalties for not being able to perform to their satisfaction in the same job you were barely trained on. The benefits and pay are not worth all the terrible things you have to deal with on a daily basis."
bad,Loving family environment... You regularly work with the same people therefore it becomes a second home )everyday oasis) the bad thing about it that the pay sucks your NEVER allowed overtime and advancement opportunities are very limited and randomly selected .. the management team is NEVER on the same page and are NEVER consistent on the day to day rules
bad,"overnight shift, learned new things, management was ok we didnt have managers on the overnight shift, co workers was great very helpful, hardest part was working overnight shift with a kid, but i enjoyed the experience and co workers"
bad,"I really don't have many nice things to say about working for this company. In my experience working there, management was cruel, people would be over loaded with hours due to lack of staff and guilt tripped into coming in on their days off to cover for another individual who called out 5 minutes before their shift. So if you have no other life or responsibilities, this is the job for you. They played favorites, talked about people behind their backs, and started petty drama to make their days more interesting. I would not work here again even if I was offered double my hourly salary."
bad,"The Panera that I worked at was incredibly unorganized and sloppy. This was most likely due to the lazines of my co-workers and some of the Management staff. The GM of this location did not have an open door relationship with employees and was very dismissive of any problems that you were experiencing. The pay is very low considering the ""upscale"" nature of this ""fast-food"" restaurant.  I also noticed that certain Managers played favorites while criticizing others. It eemed to me that the younger you were the better treatment you would receive.  Also I know that the District Manager actually let an Assistant Mgr.keep their job after they had punched one of the employees. WTF?? This is outrageous . Others had been let go for things much less severe. Yes you do get a very good discount on food but that is about the only up side for working at this Panera."
bad,"The turnover rate here is high. I was able to get a good amount of hours. When I worked there, there was not really any room to improve. The management is 50/50, some of the managers are the best I ever had, the others not so much. This job gives you an opportunity to meet a wide range of people."
bad,"Its great if you want just an entry level, humdrum job to get you by while you are in school. However if you have any idea or dream to maybe make it a career or at least get some management under your belt, then this isn't the place for you. The two different locations I have worked are terrible. The upper management doesn't promote from within, likes to cut budget where they shouldn't (EXAMPLE: we no longer buy dish soap. too expensive. the dishwasher is enough sanitation), and doesnt carry though with any disciplinary actions (examples: getting high or drunk at work is ok, you dont get a written or verbal warning, action, nothing)"
bad,"Managers never seemed to know what they were doing , they were very unorganized."
bad,"Worst place I've ever worked for. Inconsistent hours. Manager played favorites & if you weren't one of them they treated you like dirt. Constantly get yelled at by management for something. Super strict for a min wage job. Low pay. Great job if this is your first job because management ""baby's"" the kids & they could never do any wrong. No room for advancement. Management never would train you for different positions in the store."
bad,"Very underpaid job aka min wage for normal employees, shifts make 9 an hour,  they have benefits at 25 hours a week but you'll never see 25 hours a week if your part time."
bad,"open the bakery case then take peoples orders. It us always busy during lunch rush. I learned that I need to speak up more and not grt walked all over. The management was not very good, they treated me like nothing and disregarded my job availability, but i loved my co-workers! The hardest part was probably waking up at 3:30 AM some days and working outside of my availability. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting food at break time."
bad,"Would walk in and feel a somewhat inviting environment,but had unreal expectations.Other than that okay place.Co workers work overall great people."
bad,i loved this job one of my favorites however somethings were not right with the expectations of employees. we all liked working together but the management did not do as much as the employees and mainly talked about eachother more than worked
bad,Working here is a huge eye opener! Schedules are never consistent. Hours always get cut and allot of the time the managers will either talk about you infront of you or to other coworkers. The upside is the huge discount you get 60% off up to 10.00 and the coworkers are amazing.
bad,"After working for this company for 2 years, being promoted from retail associate to associate trainer and on to shift supervisor I only received one pay raise that was about .75. Also, I was given higher manager tasks and still was under appreciated."
bad,"Busy place."
bad,There is a lot to be done at a panera bread restaurant but a lot of hours to be made. Usually they start off around minimum wage but there are multiple ways to achieve raises
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"Manager team has low emotional intelligence. Some managers run the workplace like a schoolyard.  Favoritism is often used and it leads to lost productivity, as employees who aren't getting the plum assignments spend more and more time gossiping."
bad,I worked here for almost two years. I enjoyed this company. My co- workers were like family. My only issue with Panera Bread is the amount of rude costumers came in daily. Overall i did enjoy working here and learned a lot.
bad,"typical day started anywhere from 4-6 in the morning, by reviewing orders to be made that day for delivery and pickup. by 6 am the store would open and also bring more opportunity to receive more orders. management would constantly take you away from making your orders to help the cafe (this you would always have to expect or your orders would be late). In between making your orders you would have to take out delivery's your self and be back in time to finish all of your other delivery's before they are due to be delivered. "
bad,There is no future nor career in working for this chain it is strictly a last resort for income no benefits no climbing the industrial latter or anything of that sort. just a dead end job
bad,"It was fun to work there however, nearly every night work ran past the legal time for minors and it was very understaffed, which meant coming in on nearly all of my days off and working all day. I don't mind the work, i actually like working, however they always seemed to depend on me coming in on my days off."
bad,"I have worked there roughly 9 months and the people aren't very nice. I have no names to mention of the sort, but I did not like working there."
bad,"A typical day at Panera varied on many factors, examples include what workers closed the night before if you're morning shift, what manager was working, and what time of day/what day you were going in. Sunday mornings are crazy, and it seemed like we were never prepared for the rushes. Coming in for the afternoon shift could be horrible, especially when the previous shift didn't stock anything and just tried to clock out as soon as their time was up. My coworkers mood seemed to revolve around if they wanted to go home/had plans for the day. I met some life long friends working their, but I also met people who I have no desire to ever see again. I learned management skills, and how to run the line, but again, it really came down to who was on the shift with me. A few of the managers seemed to not understand minor flaws. For example, if their was a line out the door, and all the customers were ordering multiple trays of food, two associates on the line just couldn't keep up with the demand. I understand we were supposed to work steady and not mess up orders, but their were a few times the manager on duty would sit in the office and just allow it to happen. It's a shame really, there was a point in time when I enjoyed going into work, that enjoyment left quickly as time went on. Advancement in the company is a joke as well. It seemed like no matter how hard I worked, I was stuck doing the same thing, day in and day out, with almost no hope to reach manager."
bad,"In the area I was located, it seemed very prejudice. Customers tend to be very rude occasionally, but that is anywhere you work when it comes to customer service. Managers are disrespectful. They don't know how to speak to employees the way they would like to be spoken too. You don't get paid anymore than what you started with unless you get promoted...and there is only so far you can go as far as moving up."
bad,the management there is fine. my co-workers are alright. the hardest part of my job would be dealing with the management and rude customers at times.
bad,"Management was horrible. Always playing favorites, no communication between them unless it was high-school gossip. "
bad,"The Columbus franchise used to be a fun, respectful company. the culture was people first, let's make some money and grow a franchise while valuing its people.  then it was bought out.  now it's money and power and people are all disposable. its hard to find a smile in the place and even harder sometimes to find a bagel!  Such a shame."
bad,"Starts off at 5am  Attend to the opening of cafe. I've learned to work in a team "
bad,Not a good place to work if your looking for job advancement.
bad,"I really did not like working there. Coworkers were good people, management was spotty, customers were the worst. Pay not commensurate with job requirements."
bad,It has good structure but needs stronger management support.
bad,"Trained new employees, computer training, opened the bakery at 6 a.m., helped take orders for customers, maintained OSHA requirements, ordered product for the restraunt, catering, and delivering the catering."
bad,"You are always moving"
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,I was an older worker and experienced discrimination from other staff and management. I was not offered any opportunity for advancement even though I had the qualifications.
bad,I wasted three years of my life at this job. This place has done nothing but degrade me.
bad,"Many of the managers are disrespectful to employees, mostly talking down and just being rude overall. It is incredibly disorganized with people being called in on their off days due to the managers' neglect to schedule people. The one where I work has so many people getting upset at the treatment and leaving that they're bringing in new, very unprofessional people, but they can't afford to fire them when they are rude to customers, don't show up, etc. Overall, it's really not the best place to work."
bad,When the managers are under pressure the frustration comes out towards everyone
bad,"Some are nice, but some r very mean!! If u do not put panera #1 before ur kids, school, whatever..then they will play faviorates. General manager is nice."
bad,I worked at the cash register and made drinks at the barista. I also assisted other workers and the managers with making food.
bad,In general the people you work with are good people. Managers are lazy and have a hurry up and wait attitude when you have a problem with payroll. I would never work for Panera as I have been shorted on almost every pay period. When I was shorted for 8 hrs I told management and they would say they fixed it only to be paid 6 of those hours so I quit and still havent recieved my 2 hours.
bad,Typical day I would make sandwiches and provide customer service my co workers were great people to work with. Management wasnt really the best of managements. They put work first before school. hardest part was getting along with management.
bad,Panera Bread is a amazing industry of quality food and service. Regrettably Panera La Habra is managed by very unfair and unprofessional standards. The management shows obvious favoritism and grudges that is apparent and conformable by the entire staff. I wish some form of review or investigation would be brought to that store because of all the unfair and hostility of that work environment.
bad,"Only way to grow is thru backstabbing! No life-work balance. If time off is taken, they make you regret it. Large disconnect from regional managers and assistan managers. People are treated like peons not ""PEOPLE"". Love my staff. The only thing I've learn is to develope a great Situational Awareness(always watching my back from backstabbers)"
bad,"Panera was a very fast pace environment! My co-workers were enjoyable, however management was not. I got discriminated at this job ( for example i didn't get my paycheck one week because i had blonde hair, my mom had to pick it up the next day.) i did enjoy the fast pace environment but didn't leave much room for error when i was just getting to know how to make everything!"
bad,"A typical day would start off quite randomly, with whatever task that needed to be handled."
bad,"Working at Panera Bread is similar to working at any fast-food place (in my experience, Chick-fil-a). It is very fast-paced, especially during peak hours. There are different sectors in which people work, the lunch/dinner line where orders are taken, the food packaging and sandwich making station, the food prep area, the bakery, the eating area, and the dish washing station. It is imperative that each station stay productive, as each station effects every other station. The person working in the lobby needs to collect dishes from the bus stations and bring them to the dishwasher, who cleans said dishes for those on the food line and bakery, who need to keep up with the orders and make sure they are accurate, otherwise the food being created isn't correct. Everyone works in conjunction with one another. Management would help when it was busy, but many of them would sit in the back, eat food, and goof around while they ordered everyone else around. My coworkers were pretty awesome, everyone got along great, which provided a positive attitude even when the shift got rough. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers during our busy hours. Sometimes our lines would go out the door and there would still be some mean old man telling my coworkers and I how to do our job, despite the fact that their orders were often confusing and took very long. Despite this, I had to keep a smile on my face because ""the customer is always right"" kind of thing. There were enjoyable parts of the job: when really friendly people came in and were very polite not to get in line to order"
bad,Panera was a very humbling working experience for me. I worked with a lot of people that were slacking off and didn't really care about the job. I had to take on a lot more responsibility most of the time.
bad,"A typical day began setting up sandwich, soup and salad lines, to assist in arrangements for the catering orders for each day, to determine which associates I was assigned to train and to open for business. Duties after opening included taking orders, processing payments and customers services in general."
bad,"its just a regular job. buss tables, meet new people, serve food."
bad,You will do anything for money and they notice that. Long hours and the store cleaning was intense.
bad,"Panera Bread is a great place to meet, eat, and hang-out. But, management is unprofessional, rude, and talks about employees behind their backs. The upper management included. There have been many times the ""upper crust"" of St. Louis visits and never takes the time to speak to associates or other management about the sinister things going on. It would be to their advantage to do so when they come to town."
bad,"I’ve been working here for 2, almost 3 years. It’s a great place to start, great place to meet wonderful people. However, as an employee I feel under appreciated most days. The littlest of things from a “please” to a “thank you” or a “how can I help?” from the people above me would make my days so much smoother."
bad,"If you want a full time job that you can build on, then this is not a good fit.  My store was chronically understaffed which led to over extending the full time employees.  We were always trying to fill a hole, but still expected to maintain a high level of service.  We were set up for failure with these unachievable standards.  Management is hit or miss.  Pay scale is not in line with competitors.  I had to say goodbye to a job in which I excelled and actually loved."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,It was okay but not for me & I just need a job that I can take care of my family and get my future together and financially be able to do everything at once
bad,"The job was okay and I did learn some thing from working there. I have learned more of communication skills, I learned to deal with money, and customer service."
bad,my review of pannera is it's very clicky and it's one manager doesn't like you you're pretty much doomed from that point on. I would not work there again if I had the chance the people I worked with were great it's the Staffing in the way they run that place is just sucked. all the managers need to get on one page because working different days with different managers it's different than it should be the same all the time.
bad,"I hated working here. Always short staff, lots of catty, lazy coworkers. Always having to pick up the slack for them. It's  a survival of the fittest environment. People only look out for themselves and refuse to help others or don't perform their daily working duties, leaving the slack to be picked up by the next shift."
bad,"Majority of the time- busy"
bad,"Some of the rudest people I have ever encountered was when I was working here. People truly don't care about you and will go there just to take their bad attitude on you because that's just what gets them off. It's okay to stand up for yourself. No, the customer is not always right. No place should ever be like that."
bad,"They did not care about my schedule as a student and most of their other employees were students as well and had the same complaints. Isn't worth it because you don't even get a free work meal, it's still pretty expensive with the discount. The management was a mess."
bad,Good flexible schedule but everyone is overworked and overwhelmed. Consistently short staffed and many call offs make it chaotic. Pay is ok but not enough for all of the work required.
bad,Long hours. upper management does not care for your work life balance wants you to work on your day off you will get endless phone calls and text on your day off will
bad,"Work and responsibilities are not difficult. Being fast paced often with no breaks can be rough. Most workers are nice but are often looking for a better job with higher pay. Management is poor, schedules are often released at the last possible moment, and they won't hesitate to schedule you on days you can't work. Easy but frustrating job."
bad,"Not a good work place company .Very poor work environment and very long hours required."
bad,"I would typically arrive and be the only driver for the day, it was rare for there to be another delivery driver to help. I also had to run catering every once in a while, and I am quite small so it wasn't an easy job with little to no payout. Even if I requested a day off weeks or even a month in advance, there was no guarantee I would get it off, considering I was one of the only delivery drivers. Even if it was a day that I could not negotiate around, like my orientation day for the college I am now attending, was something they expected me to skip out on. It is a pretty casual environment, which was nice. Since it was always short-staffed though, I had to do deliveries by myself, and if I was cashier I had to run back and forth between getting pastries, making bagels, making drinks, and more."
bad,When I got this job I was really excited because I had heard alot of good things about them and working there for a while was good but I can only work in certain areas of the cafe due a lack of certain skills so when everyone got the hours cut I was only working two hours a day and not even full weeks of work I just couldn't live on that and the general manager has no clue what she is doing
bad,"Poorly run. Low food quality. Over priced items. Not environmentally conscious, ie. Plastics everywhere, no recycling, etc..."
bad,My time at Panera was stressful. It was constantly busy and the management was not the nicest and they were not helpful. I was paid $7.35 for a year and a half of working there and was always working hard. I was never given the raise i was promised though.
bad,"The hiring manager hires any and everybody that walks in. The management team is rude, irresponsible, and unprofessional. The staff is pretty cool for the most part. Reminds me of high school a little though."
bad,I worked there as a high school student and this was my first actual job. Panera is a good place to start out as a student looking for part-time work while still in school.
bad,"management is bad, i don't feel like any of the managers truly care about the job, especially the district manager. the job needs a lot of work it wasn't as bad as it is now but the job is pretty bad now i am trying to find something better."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"Terrible management, mean and don't care about staff. I was paid minimum wage after working there for two years. No room for advancement in the company. I only stayed there because the environment was fun to work in with my friends."
bad,"I would only suggest working here if are a high school student and need a few hours. This place is crazily fast paced with such high turn over there were never enough employees working there and not enough help from managers. The managers chose to belittle employees and focus on things such as not having the right pair of shoes and writing them up (happened to one of the full timers). There was only one manager that did not 'bully' the employees, the others chose to gossip and be rude to even the guests."
bad,"Most people were nice. the managers did not talk to each other, asking for time off always got messed up, they would call you about why you're not working when you're not on the schedule."
bad,"Too many people in charge and no one knew what they was doing. The disrespectful language and ones who were in with management,would sit in the office,trashing other employees. Felt like High School all over."
bad,Poor management. Working over 50+ Hrs as management. There is no proper training.  Backed up on Bonuses by 8 months. Employees were good people. That’s all.
bad,panera was an interesting job. the managers barely scheduled me and i did everything they asked. i only called out due to a serious snow storm. otherwise i would not work here
bad,"High stress, low pay, no benefits,  lack of structure,  demanding higher ups. Good for high school students but can't make a living here, a going nowhere job."
bad,They pay is competitive and they love to promote from with the company. However the company itself has gotten too big for itself and no longer runs well. The companu lacks communication from top to bottom and no one gives clear direction on how to address potential opportunities. The training is also terrible and covered in red tape that does not actually allow people to learn what they are doing.
bad,The turn over rate is so high It seemed like every other week someone was quitting and I was getting left to do their work. The menu is way to big and the kitchens space is to small. And let me not even get started on the customers. There’s always one customer who think they run the world and can talk to you any kind of way. And since your behind the counter you have to take it. But in all  I barely made it through those two years I just needed  the money
bad,"Delivery Drivers were expected to be Jack Of All Trades. Wash dishes, prep food, be a cashier, clean dining room, take out trash, and general maintenance repair person. All this with minimal to no training on that stuff."
bad,"loved working with my customers, but panera started changing people frequintly ,changing the way they wanted things done,and to much attention to time rather than professionalism."
bad,"Great for early morning breakfast or just to grab an on the way work coffee. Great for studying, not loud and very spacious and comforting, nice, employees."
bad,Horrible work conditions terrible management people were treated more like objects than people I wouldn't recommend it. Days were long hectic dangerous work conditions if your not able to work quickly in a cyanotic environment this isn't the place for you
bad,The way they try to cut corners around what they have been trained to do. The methods to training and teaching someone comes with too many steps that are consistently changing. The other problem is that if you follow those said steps in our particular hub you are looked down on as slow and incompetent. It begins to create an environment of underachieving and disappointment. That's the system as a whole when it comes to what they was us to do and within the time frame of what they want. It's unrealistic and wishy washy to say the least. It doesn't come as though they care about the team as much as they care about the client who inevitably treats us unkindly in certain circumstances.
bad,Panera Bread was my least favorite company to be employed by. They were disrespectful and had little sympathy or understanding for their employees needs.
bad,Very hectic and a handful to deal with. Not much help when getting behind with orders. The work environment wasn't steady and the hardest part of the job was all of the meticulous things no one did but expected the new girl to do.
bad,"would never work here again, poor management, not enough staff always had to find people to cover shifts after they would have no call no shows associates can be rude to customers"
bad,A good first time job for a teenager wanting experience. Company is mediocre overall. For the worth ethic should definitely pay their associates more.
bad,"This was a great place to work for my first 7 months, but they decided to change all of the managers for no particular reason, while at the same time telling us there would be $1 to split between 35 people for yearly raises... Managers constantly broke rules, asking employees to perform tasks outside of job description and sending you home/writing you up if you did not comply. Would not recommend until the current GM resigns."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"Did not have a great time working here. Management didn’t care about school life or anything outside of work. Paid poorly, treated poorly by other employees."
bad,Just a very stressful and unorganized establishment. The managers don’t seem to care that they’re working you like a slave and only schedule 2 people to do work when there’s an abundance of customers.
bad,I was promised a promotion and after 6 months of waiting for it to go through i inquired about it and they told me to just keep waiting. The upper management decided to make me do the job and have the responsibility of a position higher than my own and refused to pay me for it but i still had the consequences of not performing in the position im not getting paid for and was never trained for.
bad,"Managements hires people out of desperation instead of work ethics or skill. They rarely listen to their trainers or other decent workers when they come to managers with problems, but the people that don't do their job get their concerns taken seriously. Anyone with decent work ethic ends up doing their job on top of babysitting the less reliable workers and there is little to no punishment for said workers for blatantly doing their jobs wrong in front of the managers. It's much more stress than it should be for the type of place that is."
bad,"This company is micro managed to a level I have not experienced ever in my almost 30 years in this industry."
bad,"Since there's a high turnover rate at this particular store, none of the managers or coworkers trust you to stay or do your job right. In order to actually be accepted there, you have to go through at least 2-3 months of being berated and made fun of, then they realize you are there to stay. Our equipment constantly broke, and it took months for upper management to actually fix anything, or even order us new equipment. We went through managers like disposable gloves because of how horrible our store is. When we'd actually get a replacement, they'd be from a less busy store and easily get overwhelmed by our rushes. Despite all of these negative aspects, the company is still not allowed to give us free meals, so we're essentially spending more than half of our paycheck on food prepared by employees who feel like they are not respected, you do the math, lunch is not great. Management also constantly forgot if you expressed interest in becoming a Trainer or Zone Leader, and would often leave employees in the dark for months on how to actually get these titles/positions. Do not work here."
bad,"Highschool job, not recommended for people out of highschool, if you want to start in the food business go ahead, personally was not an enjoyable time for me, and the management was not the best."
bad,"Panera bread was a good environment I just personally didnt like the experience to much. Management was great, but rest of staff was just decent. I was only there for a bit so I really dont want to say anymore negative traits."
bad,"Unfortunate amount of stress and hostile work environment. Everyone was constantly stressed and angry which rubbed off on everyone else. Catering policies were unfair and HIGHLY stressful which led to long 14 hour days and sometimes with NO break. Mileage paid LOW as well. The food is good but employees became sloppy in taking care of the line and due to being rushed all of the time with unrealistic ticket times of 4 minutes from order to customer, food wasn't always pleasant to look at."
bad,"I worked at Panera for 6 months and when I first started out it was decent. The co-workers were mostly friendly.  I used to open the bakery at 5 am for my shifts and go until 2 pm. "
bad,"Unless the managers like you, you'll have a hard time. Good and hard work is not appreciated here. Managers like to impose rules and not follow them. "
bad,"Panera Bread is an OK company to work for. They compensate well for entry level and do a lot of promoting from within. The down side is there is a lot of nepotism with in the company. If you go for a job inside the company and your are going against someone whose room mate, brother, father, etc. already works in that department, it doesn't matter your knowledge, you probably will not get the position. The hours are also OK at best. They have a shift that will be a good fit for just about anyone but they do require working at least one weekend day a week for 3 month stints. If you have a family or social life that can cause a huge pain. The Hardest part of the job is not receiving the technical help when needed. They are constantly improving the programs for the company and cafes but when it breaks, you are expected to fix the problem with little to no training and sometime when reaching out for help they don't even have an answer to fix the problem, leaving the cafe in limbo until someone with an answer finally comes into the building."
bad,Management picks favorites and no one is on the same page. The other employees like to complain about every little thing that happens. The customers were fine though. Very understanding if you're new to working there.
bad,"Very little time off."
bad,The management is just flat out awful... They stay in the office 24/7 and never help their associates when screens are full or even care about whats going on within the company. So much shady stuff has happened throughout my time there and the managers do nothing.... There is no development from within unless you kiss butt... super unprofessional.
bad,"To start off, the management at this establishment is horrible. You have managers that walk around care free of the things they do, little things as well, for example, fingernail length, dyed hair, etc... these people are managers, and are supposed to be examples to associates, so when we see things that they are careless about, but turn around and tell the associates not to do exactly what they just did, its unfavorable. Also, with even higher management such as the general and district mangers, making personal calls to employees, or confronting associates on the job about certain situations seems to be very unprofessional, not so much about confrontation on the job, but mostly the fact that both conversations (personal call and confrontational) seem to focus on scrutinizing the employee and and/or demeaning them. Employers should not try and twist your words, nor should they try to mentally manipulate an employee for speaking out for their concerns."
bad,This job was very stressful because of the rush of customers at lunch time and dinner time. Managers will expect low ticket times but that is sometimes impossible.
bad,"Over worked and under paid. They give great discount on food. Management is okay, could be better. Work environment is fast paced...busy most of the time."
bad,While I work at Panera it wade my enough to cost a living and lack of opportunities. Very demanding for the pay and very inconsiderate. You have to work for someone who you’re not sure wants you to succeed.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"All of the managers and associates are great people, many of whom I'd consider friends. However, As far as running and operating a business that take scare of their people, there is much left to be desired. Management on the ground floor puts friendliness before actual leadership, and some managers attempt to avoid grunt work al together. That sounds like it  isn't too much of a big deal until you realize that the store is extremely understaffed and needs every person to be woking at their best output possible. In my opinion, the problem goes all the way up the ladder, which is what's really scary about the business. I truly believe that its only a matter of time before the other shoe drops and something terrible becomes of the great people occupying that staff."
bad,"At first the job will be great and you love how everyone is treating you. But as you work more and more you'll slowly see things that wouldn't fly at other jobs. Normally a lot of people are good spirits when working, while others are little less desirable. You can tell from the good workers from the workers that should not be there. The training is something that greatly needs to be worked on. While managers need to do more of managing their employees as well as making sure the employees feel safe and can feel reassured that management is there for them if any problems arise."
bad,"Management,  at least at my location, doesn’t manage anything.  Employees do what they want.  Food builds aren’t followed, hands don’t get washed, customer service is a joke.  All managers are more worried about being friends with employees than anything else."
bad,"Panera bread, being a “fast food” franchise, should seem like a pretty easy and simple job but it is far from that. Managers and supervisors take their jobs too seriously and make work load harder for associates. You start at minimum wage basically and have no chance of moving up or increasing your wage, as the cafe “does not have the money to give raises.” Overtime is refused. If the cafe is low in sales for the day, they are quick to cut you and send you home with low hours for the week. Managers expect a lot and do little to help. General manager & assistant managers belittle associates and act superior. Also, forget about free food because that’s not allowed. Instead you’re given a “discount” off your meal. So if you plan on eating even a cookie on the job, hide."
bad,From my personal experience there was lack of structure in the environment. My work environment was always short staffed sometimes had to work two positions at the same time.Very draining.
bad,I dont feel like the pay is worth it for the 45 plus hours they want you to work minimum.  They dont pay overtime. As a manager you are expected to work 45 hrs plus with no additional pay.
bad,"I worked multiple Orlando locations for three years. Mostly terrible management and leadership, terrible pay, and they treat you bad. If you are good at your job you are taken advantage of. If they decide to promote you, it will take months longer than they say and the money isn’t even worth it. Most of the managers I know have left the company within the last year or so. I left because I got paid more at a theme park than being a supervisor for 3 years."
bad,"Would not recommend for older adults, pay is very low and its very hard to get a raise or advance. Always constantly short handed and everyone is held to a different standard. There are a lot of people stand around and do nothing and leave the workload on certain people."
bad,It's a typical fast food cashier job. You take the order and have the customer complain. The worst part was the management and the drama that you couldn't get away from with the other employees.
bad,"In short, I was bored with lack of deliveries and the repetitiveness of the dining tasks. "
bad,I was referred to working at Panera through a friends which was a guaranteed hire. I never really had a set schedule. I always had to stay longer than what my shift was.
bad,The management there was terrible. The mangers didn’t do their jobs as much as they stood around and started drama with one another. You got a 60% discount.
bad,They hired a lot of people and is giving everyone a small amount of hours knowing we have bills and things to take care of. They try to add on to your work schedule for the list of things for you to do and don't add it on to your pay.
bad,This was a great job before I transferred to the Novi store. Management at Novi have no idea what they are doing nor do they care about their team or customers. Money is what drives this company. Some managers had their favorites and they weren't embarrassed to show it. Rules were very loosely followed.
bad,"Aside from the fact that people come to work smelling of alcohol and constantly late, it is a good first job to start out at. The hard-working co-workers are the reason to work hard and for myself. Management is inconsistent and the hard workers feel worthless. It is very difficult to bring up concerns with management because they talk 95% of the time and rarely listen. The fast work-pace is stressful. I learned how to keep up with the pace after time."
bad,"Okay work place, not the best management. Lots of physical work in some areas and lack of pay for those who work hard. Advancement took a while to receive."
bad,Management makes this work environment very toxic. I loved my co workers but I left due to the way the management was treating staff and the consistent drama in the workplace.
bad,A typical work night would be to take out all the dough poof it on the floor then on to the proof box. bake all sweets such as cookies and muffins as dough rises in the proof box. Take out dough for the following nights bake. Bake all the dough that is ready to bake.  Decorate sweets. Clean and Maintain area sanitized. Review nights bake with the manager.
bad,"Everyday include a surprise on what position I would be tossed on due to being understaffed. While also, almost daily OSHA and food safety violations."
bad,"Panera is a good place to start any career; from a teenager's first job to starting off in management. Lots of room for growth, but work/life balance is very poor. They expect a lot from the managers with little pay. Any sane adult would not work here for long; only to advance their career."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,I worked there for almost 2 years with no pay raise at all and i was making just over the bare minimum wage but i liked my coworkers and the work wasnt too hard it was fine for someone in high school
bad,"Initially I felt that my salary was fair until I started working within my role. After 10-14 hours day, including nights and weekends, my salary equates to minimum wage. Coupled with very expensive benefits, no maternity/paternity leave and only 10 vacation days per year, Panera seems to be loosing more and more people on my team each month. If you use your 10 vacation days (most do not), you will receive calls asking you to complete tasks or assist others, even while in foreign countries (not the safest WiFi). I’ve had my family stare at my for an hour as they ate breakfast beachside as I took back to back work calls and could not eat. There is no true break from work and you will receive a “talking to” if you do not answer the phone at night or while on vacation. To top it off, my manager is a micromanager. My former manager along with the department leader respected that I knew how to do my job effectively and would ask for help if needed. With my new manager, I feel incompetent because all items are questioned in detail, even vacation days, schedules and break times! Promotional opportunities are limited as internal associates are overlooked for external hires. You are expected to not only perform your managers role until they are backfilled, but then you must train them upon hire. The one great thing about Panera overall is the people. I love my coworkers."
bad,"Overall, it was a good job to work but there were way more downs than ups. Nothing was consistent at all, not enough care for delivery drivers, not enough money made as delivery drivers, bad attitudes from managers, lack of communication, much more. "
bad,"Working here was not an amazing experience. The managers had me working positions I was not trained for. Also they would not pay me for two months, I had to fight them and even after I received my earned money it was not all of what I should have been paid."
bad,"I DON'T recommend this job for any adult with bills.short breaks , overly worked, lack of communication, bad pay rate. you are on their time. they don't care about your availability."
bad,"Most managers don't care about you, nor the store. Production line and lobby are disgusting, things don't get cleaned for weeks. bugs and mold present in store. Bubblers containing drinks are disgusting, tea bubbler RARELY cleaned. Raises are few and far between, lucky if you even get a quarter, even after a year. Coworkers hate their job and constantly bickering and gossiping, rarely doing their jobs. Always understaffed. Terrible workplace. Learned that you don't have to care about your job."
bad,"I worked at a Panera located in an outdoor shopping center, so it was always busy. Sometimes we wouldn't get a break for our whole shift if it got too busy. The manager always scheduled me to close (which would be until 11pm) and I had to go to school early the next day. The cashier position has multiple jobs (ex. making coffee/bagels/pastries) for customers which would become really stressful when there was a long line. My manager would also schedule me on days that I had requested off weeks prior."
bad,A typical day at work was almost always stressful as you have so much to do on busy days and then when it is slow you are stressed about what you should be doing. I think something that I learned was working harder and time management and being responsible. The management was pretty untrustworthy. They are not really quiet about what is going on with associates and I think that is very irresponsible. The workplace culture isn't very nice the associates can be very rude and full of drama which can be stressful if you are not interested in that certain aspect of life.
bad,Only because we don’t have enough employees in these areas that’s needed. And I am dealing with a lot and working her is not helping when you have to Cole line and drive try by your self
bad,"Throughout the time Ive worked at Panera, resect was an big issue for me. I felt disrespected by a manager and a few employees as they spoke to me in a manor where I was always be given an unnecessary attitude."
bad,"As an employee of Panera Bread, my duties include maintaining the cleanliness and sanitation standards of the health department. Specifically, I would attend to the needs of the customers, take out the trash, bus tables, wipe down the tables in the dining room and on the patio, clean the bathrooms, wash dishes, and stock merchandise."
bad,"There were the typical rushes for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The atmosphere was pretty stressful because you have to replace coffee every hour which could get hectic when there were long lines, and only 2 people for registers. The hardest part was how much an associate was made to do. There weren't enough people up front to meet the demands for the rushes. I did learn how to prioritize things however and that made the next job easier. I also learned how to make some darn good smoothies. The most enjoyable part of the job was the times in between rushes after all the chores were done. The coworkers were also pretty nice."
bad,Constantly being threatened to be fired for not achieving desired results. Overreaction to behaviors that are being monitored through video without knowing what is really happening.
bad,Panera is a very stressful job. You never really know what hours you'll be working. The management was pretty bad. The managers were rude and unfair. I don't recommend.
bad,"This job consists in coming in at night between 10pm to 1:00am and star your route (diferent route every day) 10 to 14 hours a day, between 7 to 12 stop per route. You have to unload the truck, recount the product and put it inside the coolers and pick some stuff back. MAY SURE NOT TO SPEEDING WHILE DRIVING 1 MILE OVER THE SPEED LIMIT OR YOU ARE IN TROUBLE. (Very stressful) You will be in a diferent truck every day, that mean some trucks are nasty and some drivers leave the truck with mechanical issues. "
bad,Panera Bread is a very calm and quiet place to work. It is a slow paced environment. The hours I received were not the best nor was the pay. I would prefer another job.
bad,"Low ratings aside, the main flaw with this location was how new it was, being less than a year old there were major managerial flaws. A majority of the team were part time high school students, myself included at the time. This lead to a very unreliable and low effort work environment."
bad,Its a poor place to work at. They won't let you move to other positions.  Try to move up from current position at the time.i was denied. And laughed at
bad,Its was a decent Place to work got along well with others. They trained me well and gave me a chance. i wouldnt mind working there again pay is not too good though.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"I liked being able to socialize with customers, but overall, I did not enjoy my time working in the food industry. I am a picky eater and it becomes difficult to say if I really liked the foods customers asked about."
bad,This is a place that hires young employees so there is a huge turn over rate with the employees. They offer a raise with each level you learn but it take a long time before you actually see the raise on your check. Not a lot of opportunity to move up in the company.
bad,A typical day at work started with me doing dishes and then usually going ton prep some food and then working my register all day. I had a lot of customer interaction and a lot of cashier expierence.
bad,working at panera bread is a first time job. They dont pay well but it is good if your looking to just get on your feet and start somehwere convient..
bad,"took orders, preped food, ran drive thru unloaded truck customer service, make sandwiches special orders  management was amazing they always helped and yelled at their staff when things did not go his way. the staff was a great team and always pulled together ................................................................................................"
bad,"Corporate Trainer"
bad,"they were all rude. but what can you expect out of a bunch of high schoolers, right? high schoolers run that place and they're all rude. I wouldn't ever return to any Panera locations"
bad,HORRIBLE management. Managers stand around and do nothing while employees work their butts off. A lot of high school workers who don't really care and don't work hard so other employees have to work extra hard to make up for it. Extremely busy and demanding. Often run out of bread/pastries resulting in angry customers.
bad,"Nice place to work, especially if you are trying to work on getting better in customer service. It is all about being in good with management, as bad as that may sound. That is what it was like working there."
bad,The managers played favorites with hours and even though I was hands down one of the best at what I did I still was skimmed over for the favorites. The managers would even give away free meals to the favorites.
bad,"The coworkers were decent, alot of work drama, and very poor management. Managers lack communication, very manipulative and DO NO CARE for ANY workers unless they kiss a**"
bad,"I LOVED the GM at my location, but she left a few weeks into me being there. The shift leader was awful, she was incredibly rude and condescending. There was more than 4 staff member come and go in the 3 weeks I was there (yes, I only lasted 3 weeks) and they were all management. I enjoyed my job duties of prep, but its hard to do your job when the equipment is broken or taken up by the managers pancake party. Honestly, I would love to stay in the same position, just a different location where management is honest and doesnt treat you like trash."
bad,Great company over all but not the best environment for workers in some stores. Some management are rude and make the work place undesirable to work in. They make promises and do not fulfill them causing you to feel stagnate without room for growth in your career there.
bad,"At the location where I worked, it was just not busy enough at the front of house. Thus resulting in me just being bored all the time. It is agonizing especially as a cashier. I talked to my manager many times about moving my position but months went by with no action while they were over here hiring people to do the positions that i specifically said that i would be interested in learning to do. it feels like no one really listens to you. Plus they were really strict on the uniform for the most trivial things. I had to buy three different pairs of pants because the first pair didn't have the ""right pockets"" in the back, the second pair came a little bit above my ankles and thus were considered high-waters instead of dockers, and the last pair just dont fit me but they love them. whatever."
bad,Very hard to be equal with others alot of favoritism and no benefit really. The biggest benefits was discounts on food.managment was never really around for help
bad,The management at Panera is mediocre. There is a hierarchy where they're above everything the associates are looked down upon.  Long days where pay is not enough for the amount of effort put in. There is a lot that needs to be done at corporate where the higher up's are not living up to a professional standard.  If this is a temporary job for anyone than it is okay to have it but in the long run it is not worth the time spent and the money being earned. At Panera you learn to have a sense of urgency since the clientele base is very demanding having to operate different departments throughout the store
bad,Being in the environment could get very stressful which led to many attitudes throughout the day. Short staffed most of the time or overstaffed in small areas. Management could have been more friendly and understanding.
bad,This was my first job and I was sixteen years old and in high school.  I really didn't care for this job.   It was a thankless position and the location was dirty.
bad,"A typical day at work began with me clocking in and then pretty much immediately going into the kitchen to find someone who was completely losing their temper or complaining about what a horrible day it had been so far. Very frequently I would have managers talk down to me and tell me that I wasn't good enough (even when I was still training) (this was my first job btw). I had one tell me I was useless. The same one tried to write me up for being on my phone AFTER I had clocked out. We often ran put of important supplies (ex: bread). Almost none of my coworkers got breaks (even during 8 hours shifts). I was usually unable to clock out for 30 minutes to an hour after my shift ended because the managers would make me stay and complete tasks that weren't even a part of my job. I was frequently yelled at for requesting even a 30 minute break during a 7-10 hour shift. I had a coworker seriously threaten to beat me after I asked her to take a customer's order while I was busy (which was her job anyways). My schedule was almost always messed up. To give an idea, one week I worked 9 hours, the next I worked 34 and the week after I worked only 12 even though I explicitly stated I could work 25-30 hours/week. Every single day there, there was really low morale and people would very frequently have to leave the line to calm down due to either other coworkers, managers, or sometimes (but not as frequently) customers. It was rare that someone would get fired because pretty much 60% of the employees quit after their first two weeks. We were understaffed at least 6 out of 7 days in the week."
bad,Working side by side the gm was tough due to favortism towards certain employees and treating others like they didnt matter. Need to work on communication
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"For the amount of work the bakers are required to do every night, the pay is not worth it. Most nights bakers only have a few hours of help. The only shift for bakers to work is at night"
bad,"I have already written a review for Panera, but if I had to reiterate something about working there it would be that it is not always the most positive of environments to work at and managers are not good at looking out for their employees."
bad,"The culture and standards are wonderful. The pay is fair. The management is lazy, cannot communicate, and do not follow company standards. The store is very dirty and no one seems to step up to clean it. Management makes it very difficult to work in an otherwise exceptional work environment."
bad,The professional management at this location needs to change ASAP. They are very hostile and rude it is hard to work in those conditions and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I hope
bad,"i was a baker at night for two years, when i advanced to head baker i was given a very small raise for doing three times the work and when i asked for a raise i was laughed at, the company does not care about its employees at all."
bad,"Very fast-paced, stressful environment. No matter how many people are working, the rushes are strenuous and we are constantly running around trying to get everyone taken care of. We are often not given our full breaks (even though they’re required by law) due to how busy we are. Panera is not the best job for teenagers like myself - we are often scheduled outside of our availability and not given our days off, even when we request off weeks in advance. The managers fail to communicate with each other, and many times we are told to do different things by different managers. The managers do not do a good job of training new people, forcing the regular associates to assist the new employees when they don’t know what they’re doing. By my second shift, I was closing dining room by myself, even though I wasn’t sure what all needed to be done. A few weeks later, I was thrown on the register during the dinner rush with zero experience. I had to teach myself to make all barista drinks with the flip-book recipes. Nearly all of the people at my Panera have had the same experience as me. You will get yelled at for making minor mistakes (depending on the manager). Managers also are not at all understanding of school, sports, or any activities; they claim to be flexible, they are not.  Most of the people that work there are unhappy and planning to quit and find another job. I’ve been working here for about 3 months and the only reason I have stayed this long is because I want the money and I have a few friends that work there. If you are looking for a first job or easy part-time job, I would"
bad,60 hours plus a week is expected. On call 24/7. Good luck taking a vacation. Low pay. Corporate franchise did allow for quick upward mobility. Very high stress.
bad,"You dont get your raises like promised. If you work hard you do most of the work while others talk, play and smoke. But some managers are amazing and help"
bad,"I worked at the one in Oneonta, NY and they barely trained me, talked to me like I was garbage and gave me 8 hours for a full time schedule when I was commuting."
bad,"Dealing with rude customers, and even most co workers were rude and not very welcoming someone always had an attitude my manager did not do anything to change certain things"
bad,"All of my fellow employees were really cool laid back people. However, I had multiple problems with management because they were too laid back on some people and then extremely strict towards others. Politics played a huge role at this job."
bad,"I was never trained and was expected to know everything the second week I work."
bad,treat employees with no caring when I worked there. jumped down your throat for everything. So nice when I applied but stab you in  back after a week.
bad,"It really depends on the location but most bread co. Don't pay you what you are worth (including management positions) most the stress comes from being over worked, extremely rude customers, and poor management."
bad,I had days it was short and I also had days tht were longer than usual but overall it was a good job they just start dropping my hours. Also I was taking out garbage as well.
bad,"Working at Panera has taught me great customer service and always putting customers first. It was a very quick paced job and it helped me to work on my toes. The hardest part of the job was learning and understanding the menu since everything is seasonal. The most enjoyable part of the job, was being able to make customers happy."
bad,The management within the panera establishment i worked in was extremely unprofessional. Never fixing problems or listening to employees concerns. Always messing with the schedule but never letting you hit overtime.
bad,"There was like 2 amazing managers that both got transferred to different stores and from then on it went down hill. We were constantly under staffed, scheduling was a joke, managers played favorites and would fix our times if we break violated. All around just a nightmare of a job but i stayed for the friendships i made and the pretty much easy money if you can get over the stress and the mistreatment from managment."
bad,"Not a very pleasant place to work. The location was busy so there was always work to do (which was not the problem). General Manager was the only one that had skills capable of running a restaurant, all others made working extremely pleasant."
bad,I worked there for almost a year and when i switched my availability to just the weekends my general manager would write in shifts after i got off Sunday and then not call me to let me know just so i would get in trouble and he would have a reason to fire me
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,The job is just way too stressful and for what I was making it wasn't worth it. it mainly due to the poor management and all the requirements needed for the job.
bad,"•	Training New Crew members and Reducing Customer Escalations"
bad,Management needs improvement.  The pay in low and it does not give you any added incentives to work harder.  Advancement is hard and low.  Hours and schedules are hard to work around your family.
bad,The mistreatment of employees and constantly changing around of the environment makes it hard to build relationships that aren't toxic. It isn't a very neutral company all customer based.
bad,"I really loved this job at first but my opinion quickly changed. I had the 5am opening shift which got very tiring. A lot of times I would have to work overtime so it made it hard to maintain a work/life balance. I also had the worst managers at my location. One of them always picked on me and actually made me cry once. "
bad,"Although I did not have the best experience at Panera Bread (because of management), I worked very well with all my coworkers. Yes there were stressful moments (as with any job), but we worked as a team, and we always helped each other get through service."
bad,"3rd shift baker, work all night and to have store ready for day to day business and to have everything done I would need to work through my lunch just to catch up.  Personally I just had a hard time with the 3rd shift."
bad,I hated my job here. The managers were all very young and did nothing but yell at everyone and belittle them. The people who were lazy at work got high praises and the ones that worked hard were disregarded.
bad,"Promotes VERY slowly, not the best morals. managers just care for a body being there regardless of knowledge of work. hard workers are over worked and pushed to their limits of leaving. managers constantly switched around and the next one that comes is always worst than the first. I enjoyed the regular customers that came in they were always a delight, and the employees are pretty friendly."
bad,"Typical hours per day can range from 4 to 9 hours.  "
bad,"Most of the managers are disrespectful. They will not allow other people to help if you need help. Although they were able to work around my availability time, they gave terrible hours and does not help with anything."
bad,"A nice place to work and start out for a younger individual. Great lunch discounts, great pay, clean environment, also professional. Encouraging coworkers as well."
bad,"I have not had a good experience with this restaurant. I worked here for three years, with a low hourly pay. I was a certified trainer working full time, only to realize that new employees started at a higher pay rate than myself."
bad,They pay minimum wage with little advancement and subpar management . They are highly unclean and have a problem with rodents. If it weren't for the coworkers the job would be absolutely horrendous.
bad,"The job isn't really a hard job, but it's very repetitive. For example I worked the cash register and there would be times when I couldn't even leave for a second to get a drink of water after standing there for 6 plus hours. Not to mention all the customers you have to deal with. There was plenty of times when I didn't get a break when I should have."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,Working here was fun in the aspect of te people there but the requirements for the pay was not all too well. We did pretty much as much as the lead shift and got paid really low . Should really consider pay raise
bad,"A typical day at work was fast pace with random problems."
bad,"The company really was not that terrible. I moved in August to the other side of town, though, and when I asked for a transfer they told me know. It was too expensive of a commute so I quit."
bad,"It was fine to work at panera bread the only thing was the could no work with my schooling.It was fun, great environment, and good people. not so up-to-date equipment."
bad,"Very relaxing working place, Management was not the best over night Superiors not the best. I really enjoyed getting together with the other bakers from other area."
bad,"Because an assistant manager didn't like that I quit, she made it so I didn't get another job somewhere else by SLANDER."
bad,"Terrible environment, unrealistic expectations, bad hours. "
bad,"A typical day at work, you can expect calls ins, expect to work short handed, and also late. It can be so busy that you aren't able to leave until it eventually slows down. I have been there up to 2 hours past scheduled time. It tends to be rather stressful. However, you form a  wonderful family of co-workers."
bad,"This was my first job and it was great that they gave me the opportunity to work but at the same time they expect you to be able to do the job of 2 people at the same time, became physically exhausting very quickly"
bad,cooking for customers was the challenge but it got done on a daily. from cooking breakfast and lunch it was quite the job as tough as it seems it was not impossible.
bad,"continuously asked for advancement and training and was continuously promised training then never received it, management is really bad"
bad,Managers would argue with each other and other employees and would allow some employees that they liked to break rules such as dress codes while writing up others.  Managers would regularly kick out customers for loitering while the place is supposed to be a lounge.  I don't think I ever worked a shift there where I didn't get a call before I came in to come in at a different day or time because schedules were so disorganized.
bad,A typical day is pretty dreadful. Managers always complaining about the smallest thing. Customers are really rude and management isn't understanding to situations that happen to employees. Co-workers however are very nice and work well together.
bad,"I've worked many under the table jobs, Panera being my first real job. The people were great. The pay, hours, and management were god awful. I learned a lot about sanitary work spaces, as well as dealing with unfriendly customers. A typical day at work was a line out the door, nonstop cooking and cleaning. Rude managers who think of you as a tool to get a job done and not a person. maybe for $2 more per hour I would have stayed but certainly not for $9 bucks an hour. They don't even give their workers free food on lunch break.."
bad,I learned that you can only look out for yourself. Remain focused on your own career goals.The most enjoyable part was learning new things and gaining a family that i did not have before.
bad,This job is more suited for teenagers/college students and not someone who needs a steady/reliable income. Nice job to learn about customer service.
bad,"Typical day i would be working on line and register whiling managing other task that the manager did not do."
bad,When they were shorthanded with managers I told them that I would help them out to run the store. Right before I get laid off they had me run as a manager and a catering coordinator. Being overwhelmed and frustrated nobody would listen.
bad,Just your average work place. Gets a little crowed at times. Location is near a metro. Plenty of other restaurants around.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"managers were sloppy and rude, always tried to blame their mistakes on other staff members. managers were doing 50, 60-hour weeks and then would pull even more hours for themselves and not leave enough on the schedule for the rest of the staff to make hours also. "
bad,not really worth it to work at panera but very good job if you under 18 and need a part time while you are in school vacations and need your own cash
bad,"Unless you suck up to the manager and become best friends, there is no moving up.  Raises only come once a year and are never over $0.25.  Higher ups only care about more profit but don't motivate or even supply proper space/tools to increase business.  Drains your will to live."
bad,"I would never go back to work for a corporate chain restaurant again."
bad,"If you're thinking you'll make bread. Wrong, you'll only bake nothing else. Since I am not a night shif person I felt terrible working from 9PM to 6PM."
bad,"Panera was a very fast-pace job. It was always busy and you always had a job to do. I learned a lot about foods being there. depending on the time of the day, it could be slow. rush hour was during lunch most of the time. my co-workers were nice and always helpful when I had trouble at times. my managers were always on their job."
bad,"Management doesn't do much.  Most of the responsibility is left to the associates.  Very stressful work environment.  Great co-workers, chance to interact with loyal customers that are concerned about associates"
bad,not my favorite place to work. over work for little pay. the managers were rude and did not car about your preferred schedule.
bad,Great place to meet wonderful people through the guests and other teammates. They promote from within and create a fun atmosphere while working your shift.
bad,"Long hours on your feet, dealing with very rude people, and poor management were what made this job suck. little pay with almost no brake and a constant stream of rude customers was not worth the experience."
bad,Many days were filled with hectic and unorganized boss who constantly attempted to cut labor costs and save money by under scheduling leaving the crew member working swamped.
bad,"0 tolerance for any mistakes of any kind, regardless of your tenure there.  Most unforgiving and hostile work environment for a manager I have ever experienced or even heard of.  Horrible culture and no team work among management.  Getting fired is their openly used incentive for all goals and expectations.  Unbelievable.  Hourly turnover in most locations was deplorable and the manager turnover was ridiculous as well. I have never seen so many managers leave with no notice in such a short period of time."
bad,It was a typical franchise establishment. Overworked employees and never get any compliments only negative reinforcement.
bad,"Some stores are great with happy people and upbeat atmosphere.  Others are brutal.  Short staffed, long hours, extremely grumpy customers and Managers who back stab other Managers.  Very toxic."
bad,"I worked for Panera for a little more than a year. I worked for both franchise and corporate. Neither was to my liking. The franchise side was pretty crazy. A lot of turnover with both associates and management. I'm not so sure the district manager or the director of operations knew what they were doing, they just weren't involved enough. On the corporate side it was a bit more organized. You definitely work less hours and they payed me 20% more for the same job. Panera is just not for me. It's fast food without fries. All soups and meat come pre cooked and frozen. All the pastries are frozen also. The dough for the bread come delivered from a huge warehouse. Nothing is actually fresh. They do put up a good front though. You can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig."
bad,Management is horrible with no employee incentives. The new owners don't care about the associates just that they look good.
bad,"The employees there are lazy, not to mention the managers don't seem to care up until it comes time for the health inspector. Benefits and raises don't come easy to those who work very hard to get just that. Managers will chose favorites and let those be the lazy ones and give them all the credit. Hardest part is dealing with just how dirty and lazy the place is as a whole. Only good think i can say is at least it was a job that paid(not very much though)."
bad,"I have not worked at this location long, but none of it has been pleasant. All staff constantly warned me about the irritable management and I have been harassed by said management. They are constantly short staffed and constantly overwhelmed, despite a general ease of work. All staff, including upper management, are confrontational and undermine workers in front of customers. Terrible experience for bare minimum pay."
bad,"When I started, I was promised the pay I was getting at my old job, and was promised to move up in the three months time, because of my job experience as a food manager already. They never gave me a raise, never trained me to move up and they started cutting my hours and making the schedule with ""open shifts"" for people to claim instead of giving me the 40 hours they had me working at the start. The management just got worse as time went on."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,My experience there wasn't great due to the fact we kept loosing people and constantly under staffed. Also we had change general mangers six times in within five months.
bad,"Take Home The Bread franchise has taught me how to work under chaotic and little to no supervision while trying to lead multiple people in multiple locations. I Have learned the importance of having people wanting to work for you vs. having to work for you."
bad,My day consisted of washing dishes and cleaning the dining area. I would also greet customers and make sure they have a satisfying dining experience.
bad,"I start my day at 7:30 am . I come in and make croutons then i head over to my two salad station and start my set up for the day.This is where the fun begins! First i change all the pans there are around 50 or so pans then i refill all pans on both sides then i proceed to stock to get ready for the day. This includes paper bags three different sizes apples pickles, pastas,soba bowles,yogurts,chips spoons,knives,forks,plastic and metal and soups all done before 10:30 And morning chk list and temp log as well."
bad,"Good company to work for but pay is not good seems like there's no room for advancement,you get a pretty good discount healthy food but your hard work does not reflect with your check"
bad,It was an easy summer job but management and coworkers were very unorganized and immature. It is not something I would ever go back to.
bad,Early days starting at five thirty in the morning. Busy most days with regular customers. Close to my home so had the choice to walk to work. issues with the management for not being liked/not being the favorite. the free food was the best thing about panera. learned how to bake product and attend to customers needs.
bad,Good place to work if you have a good management staff in place.
bad,"PANERA BREAD			● Cashier"
bad,Management wasn't willing to work with me when I wanted to go back to school.
bad,it was an ok work place. store and management could of been a little more organized and professional. But overall it was a good work place
bad,"Management had issues that were conflicting with new born son."
bad,"Cleaned dishes, organized work area, got along with everyone"
bad,"Only worked here for two months, it was a summer job and it is now closed down."
bad,"Very busy, management was very rude, most of the co-workers were nice, nothing was hard to do, dealing with the customers was the best part of the day."
bad,"I worked at this company for 3 years at 2 different franchises and can honestly say that I loved the work (all the food that was assembled, shaped, mixed and composed to be baked and served) and the job itself and everything about being a solo baker (even the graveyard shift hours where difficult, I still loved it). BUT the people, politics and atmosphere of every Panera I have every baked for is always the same in the sense that management and co workers where not friendly, considerate, understanding or generous at all. Absolutely no sense of what it means to be a team or a family. That was always the hardest thing. In working for this company I did truly learn what it means to bake for very large amounts of people either alone or with only one or two other accomplices, and that was very refreshing. I appreciated the challenge and the constant yet steady work load. Unfortunately, they do not give benefits for the Marina Del Rey, Torrance, Carson, Westchester and Santa Monica locations and you never get time to take a break because of the big workload. As I said before, I did not mind the workload and got everything done in a timely fashion but I did find it to be more then unsettling that myself and others were severely punished when we did not have time to take our 30min breaks; they didn't allow us more then a couple hours overtime, even for large catering orders requiring more high volume baking for each pay period (which consisted of 2 weeks). The hardest thing in the job was definitely the equipment breaking often remaining in that state for extended amounts of time injuring"
bad,"I Deborah think that Panera could have done things a lot better then they did. When hiring to many employees. the environment was loud some of the management did not no what they was doing.It was a reck when we first open the door's . I no that I did my Bess when they place me on the register then to make sandwiches, to cooking sulfa's and baking cookies,"
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"Good Growing Company, and benefits to its employees."
bad,"A typical work day consists of a quick, organized pace, making and serving sandwiches, salads and bakery items."
bad,"scheduling flexibility, wages aren't compensated well"
bad,I enjoy the fast paced environment and giving customers the best experience i can>
bad,"the most enjoyable part of some job that i like greeting customer,meeting new friends at work."
bad,My job at panera bread is temporary and primarily to help pay for my final months of graduate school and rent. Overall the job has led to friends and an eye opening experience into customer service.
bad,I worked at Panera for 4 months and it was the hardest job for the least amount of pay ever (I have over 30yrs work exp). The managers all have differernt rules. The hours were the worst. I was hired for 18-20wk and got under 10. The full time people were getting under 20wk. Schedules were never ready on time and you couldn't make plans and they will send you home early if slow. One holiday I was there for only 2 hours and they sent me home.
bad,"Working for Panera Bread was very challenging,"
bad,It's a decent company to work for but locally it is a terrible place to work.......the management staff is unreliable and not fit for the task. They have a high turn over rate because the management blames their staff for everything instead of looking in the mirror.......It all starts at the top....
bad,"Can be very chill, but can be super crazy. I feel I like learning about new people. I don't love the management, my coworkers are fun, but I dont always love working for them. The hardest part of my job is working later nights. The most enjoyable part of my job, is meeting new people."
bad,I worked for panera for couple years and i was making no progress on moving up. They didnt want to move anyone because they had a steady team that wasnt leaving at that time.
bad,"the environment was great, good co-workers, flexible shifts between everyone"
bad,"I worked at Panera Bread for 8 months. Everything sounded wonderful during the interview. Then, I was trained on a computer. This was followed by working in the dining room doing everything from cleaning to interacting with customers. There is no room to be creative and bring your own ideas to the job. They even have a specific way they want you to wipe off the tables. Once I proved I could clean a dining room, I was moved to cashier. Without asking me, they told me I would be their new bakery opener. I had to be at work from 5:30am - 1:30pm occasionally, 6 am - 2 or 2:30pm frequently...etc. Because I was the first one there, I would have to take my break first... exactly 2 hrs after I began my morning shift. So I arrived at 6am for example, then took a 30 min break from 8-8:30, then came back to work a busy breakfast rush followed by a long lunch rush until between 2-3pm without a break. I also had to pay for my food on my unpaid breaks. Also, when you come to eat outside of your shifts you do not get any discounts. There are two kinds of people that work there, the ones that hate it and the ones that are psycho ""we must do things the Panera way"". The managers treat you like children. They check behind you, stand over you to make sure you do something right, and when you do something wrong they stand there until you do it right. They also think that Panera is everyone's life, so don't expect to get much time off or any at all for holidays, etc... unless maybe you put your requests in 6months in advance before anyone else does. It was an overall horrible experience. You also"
bad,I have encountered very RUDE and COLD management not only to their co-workers but to the customers. Especially to their new employees and that behavior is out in the open for others to hear. They have their favorites regarding: bending the rules of this company while other employees are watched like hawks. The management I have encountered speak to you like you are 10 years old with no respect. There also seems a lack of consistency regarding who and when you'll be trained considering how 'intense' they claim this training will be. I have also encountered a lot of gossiping in the baking area of the place. The morale of employees are downgraded which has an affect on the entire atmosphere.
bad,All they really care about is money  The customers are all rich white people and are therefore extremely entitled and rude. Food is overpriced and not that good. Management sucks.
bad,Managers are getting too lazy. I have been in and out of Panera throughout my life and I realized that the integrity and work ethic of most Management has declined in many ways.
bad,I have many problems and they were not understanding at all. There was one manger who got fired that was. They had there favorites and they didn't listen when you made a request on what you wanted.
bad,"I liked working at Panera when I first started, but now that I've worked there for a year, I do not like it. They don't pay much, and they don't treat their employees very well. They care more about the customers feelings rather then their actual employees. I understand the customer comes first, but Panera doesn't care about their employees."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"After I left the company I tried reporting a cafe for a wrong doing and used my middle name to do so. I was not informed to months later that because I did that I would no longer be eligible to be hired back into the company. Also mother manager has lied about me saying I did things that I did not do, HR did not investigate these claims and again marked me as a non rehire. Panera does "
bad,"Most of my time is spent dealing with hundreds of customers per day one after the other. As soon as I'm done with a huge rush of people that I worked my butt off for, my manager is breathing down my neck to clean something or do someone else's job. It is way to much work and stress for the pay, benefits, and treatment."
bad,"After 1 year of working I've been with three different general managers and experienced very different atmospheres each time. Currently all of us don't enjoy being there, not even all of our managers want to be there and it isn't hard to miss that fact."
bad,"This job is okay, it's not great when it comes to pay but if you need some extra pay on the side it is a good position for you, the pay out in miles and tips help."
bad,"As a student who recently graduated, I found when I was in school and working here at Panera, they would never consider that I was a senior and had a lot of stressful things on my plate.  They would schedule me too many hours and were not very understanding about when I needed time off.  The management is also extremely unorganized, and they really need a better communication between the employees and their managers.  They also need a much better training staff and designated trainers because they a lot of the new employees coming in do not know how to properly do their job."
bad,"Mostly everyone is not happy there. It's difficult to have a smile on and be positive for our customers. I'm sure the customers can see this when they pick up their food orders at the window. It's very hard to get people to stay there. If your older and nearing the retirement years, this is not the job for you. We all hate the way management speaks to us during our busy rush times. There's never any meetings to discuss these problems."
bad,"I often found myself questioning how I allow myself to be treated the way I was by employees, managers, and customers. Easily the most toxic work environment I have ever experienced."
bad,"When I started with Panera, it was a great Christian based company, that cared about it's people. Now it is as far away from that as you could possibly imagine. Choose Panera, and I wish you the best."
bad,"I started as an associate and worked my way up to a shift supervisor position within two years of working there. After some time, I realized that I wasn't getting paid as much as I should for the amount of work I was doing while other associates were getting paid more than me. I enjoyed the opportunity for management but upper management was lacking the effort to ensure employee satisfaction."
bad,To much work for overnight bakers and not enough time to finish have to rush to get it done most of the time with no break for lunch your always on the go and then you have to clean up before cafe opens and sometimes your by yourself and still have to get the same amount of work done
bad,Its fun if you have cool cowokers but working there can be a lot sometimes not worth the pay. I listed one year and a half. It was a good experience and I know to always respect my servers
bad,this is the kind of job you take when you really want to become familiar with a first job ! it gives you regulars and humbles you to listen to people and multitask at every moment with money and people’s food !
bad,"For me, this job wasn’t the worst experience of my life (despite the ratings I’m giving it)."
bad,"Staff never stays, not even the managers- everybody comes and goes. Stressful environment. Managers can’t talk to people with positions below them, meaning managers aren’t allowed to have any friends at work besides the other managers and the few people above them who rarely are there. The managers are constantly stressed and when I was working, they were always hiding in the bathroom, the managers office, or just left the building so they didn’t have to deal with customers and all the stuff that constantly went wrong. Kiosks NEVER work. Nobody ever tries to fix them either. Customers always complained asking why we even have kiosks and I agree. If a cookie or any pastry item breaks, you can no longer sell it. If a cookie breaks, I would put it on a napkin and take it to the back for somebody to eat and was going to get fired for it because I didn’t throw them away instead. I was never told to throw them away in the first place. There are too many bad things to say about this place, I’m glad I quit when I did."
bad,"Working here for 5 years. Catering you make the most money, but long days and overworked. Earlier hours 3am-1pm. Hours may vary. Flexible hours though"
bad,Was a learning time but wasn’t the best they didn’t ever give us the time we wanted of and were in trusting in there employees but the other workers were great there
bad,"Panera is a great place to work but the Plainfield location is not. Employees walk out on a daily basis, as does management. Hired mostly 16 year olds and don’t pay attention when staff is on their phones or smoking inside the cafe."
bad,"Poor management, constant low morale and work that should be easy but it’s not because of lack of communication within the store. You should work there if you want a job for a month to make extra money."
bad,"You get 50 percent off food when you work, they don’t get too busy and everyone is really polite for the most part. A lot of high school kids though.."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"Benefits aren't worth what you pay. Upper Management talks about you behind your back without discussing how to improve. Have to work 50 hours to make your ""salary pay""."
bad,"The managers were pretty good, there's not much to complain about there. But the customers were older and rude. I did everything but fix the food and was miserable the whole time. For the most part, we all got along."
bad,"The worst managers you could work with that dont wanna hear any excuses. They wont leave the office to help with stuff and always blame others for their problems. While working at Panera, I witnessed managers harassing employees and talking trash behind our backs. Don't work here, you're gonna hate your life."
bad,"Tried to find coverage but no one was available. Called in sick and got harassed on phone by manager because manager was upset that I was sick and had to ring himself extra hour without a second cashier. Unprofessional. Made derogatory comments and told me I’d receive a write up. Can’t fathom how if associate is sick and it’s their fault and they receive write up if they cannot find coverage. Policy doesn’t even verify this to be true."
bad,"I was originally hired to be a cashier, They gave me about 1 hour of that training max and that was it. Then they had a person that wasn't fully trained themselves train me to be a busser or floor associate. Needless to say it didn't end well.   They once threw me onto the barista stand with no training and I don't drink coffee so I am a bit clueless when it comes to anything in that area. The discount received is nice though. It is a 75% off any food purchased. But over all not worth it in the long run. Make sure they give proper training if applying to this job."
bad,"I worked for Panera for almost 10 years the BMM was awesome helped in everyway possible, the general manager was the same would give you the shirt off your back. Now the district manager had no remorse, for almost 10 years all together I worked for Panera I got incarcerated and even called multiple times, case is still on going and they relieved me of my duty never in my time there did I call in show up late for work or anything unless i had a doctor note. They love you aslong as you jump through threw hoops, stayed multiple time to bake breads and couldn't get help trying to get out of my situation."
bad,"Management is absolutely horrible. There's only 3 decent managers. Too much drama at the location I worked at. Some of my coworkers were sweethearts. The managers try to intervene with your personal life. The job is super easy, I was on register, line and I was on prep too. The only benefit you have is a 50% discount off on a meal less than $10 and only when your on break. Your off days you have nothing. Pay was horrible for all the work I was doing I was doing the job of a shift leader getting paid minimum wage. You go from associate to associate trainer to shift leader and then manager. I was training MITs (Managers in training) and I wasn't even promoted to a trainer. I wouldn't recommend this job to anybody, it's too emotionally draining."
bad,"Very high school clique-ish; even though most of the employees were adults. Over worked, and employees got yelled at for uncontrollable things. Management wants you to work in every area possible if you have ANY down time, and some managers are NOT very nice to new hires who are LEARNING."
bad,"well at Panera Bread they are dirty and they have roaches. not those little roaches that you see running around. They're big, they're in the kitchen, bathrooms and dining room."
bad,Many of the other workers (Managerial and Associates) did not take their jobs very seriously. This led to many customers getting upset and being rude. Managers ran the place poorly
bad,"Panera was a fun place to work at first but as time went on I noticed how unorganized management was. Products were not being ordered correctly which led to stress. From the beginning, I wanted to work part-time but as I kept working, they continued to repeatedly move my hours up to full-time despite that not being my desire. When it came to breaks, they would be at odd hours (very early or late), often I wouldn't get a break at all, I would have to repeatedly have to remind managers about my breaks. Managers would have an attitude at time and they would talk about inappropriate things on the job such as sex, drugs, etc. Overall, the job itself was fine but with a mix of the bad management, low pay, and continually messy hours, it was not worth it."
bad,"The location of the Panera Bread that I worked at has VERY UNPROFESSIONAL managers, especially the GM. The hours were inconsistent, and the turnover rate was high."
bad,"A typical day at panera would begin being short-staffed, with management not helping the employees and having to do most of the work by ourselves. "
bad,"A typical day at work would often entail being stuck in one position for hours at a time, not moving, just making sandwiches or salads and cleaning your area the entire shift. Any divergence from your assigned position, even as a manager, would cause the manager in charge to command you right back, regardless if you were trying to help a coworker or customer. Unreasonable expectations from higher management. A goof way to meet young people in college, but other than that, there's not a shift I work that I don't think about how much I don't want to be there.Overall, an experience I would not recommend you apply for."
bad,"Although I only speak on behalf one particular location, I can attest to the fact that it is not the best work place. While working there, I always deemed it chaotic and cluttered."
bad,Wasn't trying live off their $8.50 hr.. But was told with tips delivery drivers should be making $14+. Not.. I felt like out sider there. I'm over 35# most the employees was kids. Hand full of adults working there. If your looking extra change around Christmas time work there.
bad,"terrible management"
bad,at work we had a lot of fun a lot of team building but the management was very bad I would say ! Attitude was the main priority to me  I feel like your attitude means everything and the way of tone of voice also
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"Easy going job. Managers can be annoying, but the way to deal with them is to never take them personal. Once you separate your feelings from this job, it will be okay."
bad,"Ok first job, I guess. I got to learn how to interact with coworkers and customers both in calm and stressful situations. "
bad,"I had a lot of good experiences at this store, but that was only because of the friendly younger people that worked part-time. The sign that always says they're hiring says ""premium wages,"" but don't be fooled. They tried to start me at minimum wage until I said something about it. Then, my raise was inconsequential. Management will hire you if you apply, I guarantee it. They are desperate for reliable workers, as almost every single day I work 2 or more people don't show up. A lot of it is just lazy workers, but managers are the ones who won't respect when people tell them months in advance that they can't work a certain day or time in a day. Almost any other place will pay you more to work, and will probably be more enjoyable as well."
bad,"Management sucks, however they have flexible hours. People call in all the time, and the managers don't care they will leave yall short and struggling. Pay sucks. Employees and even MANAGERS talk constantly about each other."
bad,At first I really loved this job. I enjoyed baking and working in a steady/ fast pace job environment however the boss and I didn't see eye to eye and over made it bad work environment in addition to one of my coworkers that I worked with almost every night would not do what was expected and it ended up being s very bad work experience in the end.
bad,"This job by far is one of the worst ones I've had. When I worked there before (I was there for a year and 3 months in 2017-2018) it started off not so bad. But it quickly went down hill from there. Most managers were just awful, they didn't act like managers. More like children in woman's bodies. So much favoritism was at this place, one associate would be allowed to do something and another associate wouldn't. Example, I was leaning over the counter one day talking to a coworker for a few minutes, my manager comes over and tells me not to do that, to not be ""sticking my butt out like that"". 5 minutes later I look over and she's doing the same, talking to another coworker and leaning over the counter. So I left. Came back early 2019 because I desperately needed a job and I knew I could get one back there cause they're always hiring. New store manager, all the rest of the managers are the same. I figured it would be fine, but no not really. The new store manager acts more like a child then the previous managers do and comes up with rules that arn't even on the board for us to follow. I will not even recommend this place to anyone, management just drives this company into the ground. I've been back there less than 3 months and we already lost 6 people and 2 more are planning on leaving (and they wonder why they can't keep people)."
bad,I started working at Panera Bread in December. It was a good environment but the pay was trash and they cut my hours to 7 hours a week. My manager begged me to stay but had me scheduled 1 day a week. You do too much work for a low pay & unfair job. I truly wouldn’t suggest this job to anyone.
bad,"I love most of the people I work with, however, I feel Panera Bread cares more about the customers than the employees. I have worked at this location for three years and I feel the work I do isn't appreciated."
bad,"Every morning I was scheduled to work, I would come in at five a.m. and I would set up the soup, salad and sandwich bar, turn on all equipment that is used throughout the day during my shift, and prepare the drink stations that are located in the lobby. I prepared  salads for the dine in customers or some days I helped prepare the salads for the Drive-Thru. As I completed an order, I had to clear the order off of the screen and that would notify the customer their salad was ready by ringing their buzzer. "
bad,"Went to this job expecting a change from the last bad food service job i worked at with a bad manager, but they exceeded my expectations here. Two of them in particular are kind of condescending and act like they know it all but they are clueless. The other managers are nice though, and the employees are cool. Work here if your trying to have a job for a couple months."
bad,Management will be nice for a few weeks and then start to schedule outside my availability while I was still in high school. The co workers I had were amazing though
bad,fun always busy never boring not the best pay not the best managment not respectful of time off work not aware of time when employees need to leave work
bad,i can only say that this company is a bit confused on how to run a business properly and that their view on how to treat employees as humans is completely skewed. if u are a hard worker and would enjoy being appreciated for your extensive amount of loyalty and devotion.. please do yourself a favor and do not bother applying.
bad,After working here for months I been treated poorly. Management is constantly rude to everyone. They have no respect for employees. I was a regular cafe associate but would blame me for being short staffed. Im not a manager it is not my problem we are constantly short staffed. I dont get paid enough to deal with it. I work 9-10 hours 4-5 days a week and been told I cant take a break because we are short staffed. Again not my problem.
bad,The staff I worked for was awful and full of gossip. The work was easy but it was tedious. The pay was fine for what you did. You could climb up the ladder if you truly wanted to.
bad,"On a typical day, I worked a 5-6 hour closing night shift. During peak hours there was a lot of confusion and some employees did not communicate very well with one another. Most managers were easy going, but some were very strict. I enjoyed this job for the first part of my time there."
bad,"A great opportunity if you are under the age of 50, otherwise look elsewhere. Managers are rarely hands on, delegate after analysis. The work culture is a political culture, if you are not a liberal stay away."
bad,"After doing the work of many I was told that I wasn’t being considered for the assistant position because I wouldn’t change my Sunday availability. Then the knicker was that “since you do such a wonderful job, could you please train the new assistant when he starts? He’s in training now and is new to the Panera company so you’ll have to start with the basics” ....."
bad,"Panera Bread can be a very nice place to work, although it is fast paced if you have good co-workers and or managers you will pick up on the speed of the job very quickly."
bad,"Aprendizaje, disciplina , trabajo en equipo, compañerismo, actitud buena ante el trabajo"
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"They do not pay workers enough for the amount of work to do in the shifts.  The management is unprofessional, they would call out and cut hours just to add up theirs."
bad,"There are some good days at work and there are bad days. Just like any job. But the bad days are really bad and the managers do not make it any better, like they should be doing"
bad,"I personally felt that this was not the right job for me because it was too much to do all at once and you basically couldn't be human there. they would make you grab, everything while having to  count change grab soups, drinks, bread, and all sorts of things  and everything. and they didn't care you weren't human you were a slave and you had to rush too much and they just didn't care. if you can rush and do it all and multi task than this is the job for you. if not NEVER go to this job it was an awful experience."
bad,"It can be difficult working in customer service. Plus we would get very busy at times. Right now we are in our slow season so I'm not getting as many hours as I would like, but other than that love the place I work"
bad,"So I had a horrible experience last Saturday with one of my managers. So this was the first time I had worked the dishes shift, and apparently I couldn't do anything right. It apparently didn't matter that I didn't get very much training for it, if any, and that I could barely understand the person who showed me around the back of the restauraunt. When you can't understand the person who is training you to do things, that's a problem. I asked some of the other workers for help, they seemed annoyed with me. I can't help that I'm short and I can't reach things that are higher than me. Most of the time working at Panera is okay. I enjoy washing tables and brewing coffee. But working the dishes shift with my manager yelling at me about every little thing was an experience I do not want to repeat."
bad,"As of right now, poor management and lack of employee training. Very low pay and unfair distribution of hours amongst the employees. Only 8$ an hour after taxes. Very fun coworkers and family-feeling setting, though. When management is good, working at panera is very enjoyable."
bad,For any student trying to get by it is a great place to get started. If you're not a student and trying to move up in the company it is difficult when they say it is not.
bad,"At first, this seemed like a fair job. However, after being there awhile, I now feel that this may have been the worst job I have had. The training process was unprofessional. The managers all told me different ways to complete tasks and then grew frustrated at me when I did not do it “the right way”. I had also told them my hours needed many times, and no request for more hours was given, despite reassurance that they would resolve this issue. Above all else, the atmosphere just was not for me, as no one seemed happy. They did have very flexible hours for school and life and were kind, despite the issues."
bad,"Everything at this job is easy, but extremely dull. I drove around all day and then did everyone's job when I got back to the store. Management was rough, in particular the GM. She wouldn't buy simple utensils and replace anything because it came out of her yearly bonus."
bad,I thoroughly enjoyed my employees and the public aspect of the job although I did not enjoy being belittled and reprimanded in front of my staff or guests.
bad,"Due to Panera Bread being so busy, managers had a lot of stress that led to poor communication with staff and poor management. Schedules were always a mess and most of times, staff was confused with what area they were suppose to work."
bad,Poor Culture and Management. Little growth opportunity. It felt like no body in the company actually cared about the employees working in the stores day to day.
bad,started five years ago and have just watched the place go down hill sadly. new management is always in and out and changes happen to frequently. hard to stay on top of everything when no one else is trying as well
bad,"My typical day at work is keeping up with the cashiering department making sure we are stocked before the person before me leaves then working with customers and giving them service. Sometimes I would work cashier and food runner balancing that was sometimes a struggle. My managers were unprofessional, unhelpful, and unreliable, but I still maintained great customer service."
bad,"The employees are always friendly with each other there. The management needs work, this causes unnecessary stress in the work place at panera and makes it hard for everyone to work as a team."
bad,Never get anything accomplished from the higher ups. More concerned with bottom line sales than associate relations. No matter how hard you work or things you sacrifice you are always expendable and they make sure you know it. Working with the teams at store level is only saving grace.
bad,"The managers were lazy and hardly ever did any work when the floor associates needed any sort of help. Sometimes, they only scheduled one person through lunch rush/dinner rush just to save on labor costs. They were nice though. Also, v.ry negative atmosphere. No one liked their jobs and many people always smack talked other employees,"
bad,"The location of this restaurant makes it a fast paced job. My coworkers are great to work with. "
bad,Management could have been better. There was obvious favoritism. I went above-and-beyond for the company and was never treated with respect. Panera Bread has been my least favorite job in the six years i’ve been working.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"Fast paced, productive work environment with easy clean up. Job duties include making coffee/tea, keep facilities clean, checking bakery for freshness, ringing up customers, providing fresh food and a clean experience."
bad,"The job can be overwhelming, management take advantage of your work ethic and over work you. Management i disorganized.  I learned cashier, barista, drive thru and the line."
bad,It is a job that promises work life balance that does not live up to the promise.  They are cutting back on managers and causing people to try to produce more in less time.  It is no longer the environment it use to be.
bad,"Panera doesn't care about its employees and has a very high turnover because of it. Used to have an off-shift discount, but lost it over time because of the company's greed. They're overpriced and breed an atmosphere of entitlement for the customers which in turn act like some of the worst around. Not recommended for those with thin skin."
bad,panera bread is a fast pace job that can quickly go hostile the moment people are over whelmed. theirs way to many call off and never enough workers to compensate for the call offs.
bad,"Your experience will depend on the store's location and your fellow employees. If it's a really busy store it will be a really stressful workday- if you're lucky and don't have a very busy store then you'll be working in a pretty relaxed environment. Working in a busier store was better because we learned how to do things very very quickly, so that we were never bogged down if we were only moderately busy."
bad,"Discrimination among the work force from management, poor hygiene and overall low health standards in the cafe. Management rarely listens to associate's problems or requests."
bad,"A typical day at panera would begin being short-staffed, with management not helping the employees and having to do most of the work by ourselves. "
bad,"I've worked at two Panera Breads and they are all horrible. The food is decent and they put on this facade of it being healthy. It isn't. I worked long hours, got yelled at many times and overall hated working here. The managers pick their favorites and closing is a pain. If you are young, like under 25 this may be somewhere to pass your time. However, the pay is so low it is not worth the stress. You are better off working anywhere else, even Chipotle."
bad,Working at Panera Bread is a food service and retail job.  One must be very comfortable with dealing with customers on a continual basis.  Management is not always behind you.
bad,"Management won’t follow labour laws, always out of something. Constantly changing management staff so procedures constantly change, need to know how each manager likes things done to get by. Management staff doesn’t know how to say thank you and all their “power” has gone to their head and you get treated like garbage."
bad,"Wasn't all terrible, but there were many times I felt overworked and underpaid/under appreciated for the work I was putting in. Can be very fast paced, and the standards the employees are held to can sometimes be unrealistic."
bad,Too many friends no advancement and a lot of kids working under kids.Managers more concern with who with who that the good of the company.Would like to see more professionalism in the work place.
bad,Food Service is not an industry I will commit to. Overall the lack of real benefits are a reason to leave the food service industry. Management is a case by case issue. Not worth what you will put into it.
bad,"It's good if you are looking for a job that pays over the normal amount, but other than that, it's just a job. They do well with working with your schedule on things like doctors appointments that are in advance or days that you request off. They also follow your availability well. Try not to call in on the fly. The hardest part of this job is blocking out the people that cause drama. Beware of those people. Just keep to yourself and don't get yourself involved in that. Some of the people there are great though. Very loving and caring. The management it so so though. Only half of them really care, the other half are a little one sided to certain employees. Just depends on who you are. Just be cautious when applying or getting offered a job here. You pretty much have to have open availability to work here."
bad,The company as a whole is okay but the cafe differs in management and training is poor. The cut hours unexpectedly and favoritism is shown a lot throughout.
bad,"Life revolved around upper management and what they wanted, as opposed to how it should be. Every market ran operations differently and communication was never passed on to all team members. Management was cut throat and would take any opportunity to throw someone under the bus."
bad,It was a good experience in the food industry but organization and management was lacking. I felt that new restaurant associates should be given more attention and proper instructions while working.
bad,"Panera's company does provide opportunities to advance, although the work environment at the Richmond Rd location in Lexington, Kentucky is awful. Managers are negative and are not willing to take time to understand the needs of their employees."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"need better utilize employee's assets."
bad,"While I worked here, the majority of the team I worked with showed such apathy towards their jobs and the effort they put into getting anything done when they weren't being directly watched by the GM, I was surprised. I was lucky to have been trained by an associate who actually cared about productivity, not wasting time, and ticket times for our customers."
bad,"I would rather not leave a review, It would take way too long to go over every detail of why this was a terrible job experience. Just know that you have to fight for hours, and the customers are normally rude."
bad,"The almost too relaxed work environment allowed for lots of extra time for employees to bicker and squabble with one another, breeding an ineffective workforce."
bad,quick paced and management does not communicate very well leaving staff scrambled and not ready for rush. coworkers are very nice and fun. working the line is fairly simple if everyone works together.
bad,"There are an ever changing number of sandwich combinations, salads, drinks, soups and deserts that honestly are priced way too high. "
bad,"The work itself at Panera wasn't very stressful. Most of the shift was fast-paced and on your feet, but you had the chance to sit down for a few minutes if you needed to, plus a 30-minute break. There was a heavy emphasis on customer satisfaction, and a very ""corporate attitude."" All employees were required to attend a seminar praising Panera and its corporate employees, emphasizing how ""lucky"" we were to work there. My location in particular was deemed as performing ""poorly,"" and employees were explicitly forbidden from asking for raises based on personal merit. I saw coworkers who had been there for years receive laughable raises, even when they were promoted. Even after asking for months to be trained on different positions--being promised so upon hiring--I didn't receive any further training for almost 8 months, which was inadequate and eventually caused me to quit."
bad,Not a bad first job! Corporate was the worst part about working here. They made new rules that changed the way we did things seemingly monthly. Other than that it was a typical fast wood experience.
bad,I hired in as a day baker and that lasted about a month then they went to all night baking. Didn't receive raises I was promised when hired. Way behind on calibrations and certification. Run out of things we need on a daily basis. Ordering in terrible. Management is not good at all.
bad,Panera Bread had poor management and I was not taught properly how to handle the equipment to prepare the food. The hardest part of the job was keeping a steady pace. I would not apply for any position at Panera.
bad,"Thirty minute break is laughable. No time off until 12 months worked. Don't even think about being compensated fairly for your work, that's a joke. Will constantly talk about bonuses being bigger the higher you go up the ladder. But a bonus is a BONUS, shouldn't have to break my back for bonus to make ends meet. Corporate Panera is much better. Think twice."
bad,"Fast paced environment, franchise company. too much politics in upper management. Simple business plan, difficult to execute, does not take care of staff as they should."
bad,"Panera is ideal for a college student, don't waste your time trying to build a career. I spent many years on trying to become in the management world and didn't get anywhere good luck"
bad,"I worked at Panera Bread for almost 2.5 years. It was my first job and I can honestly say I stayed there way too long. My managers were alright, I've more bad managers than good. I can't keep track of the amount of times I had to negotiate how much I was being paid because I found out someone who had just gotten hired made more than me, it's constant favoritism and it is difficult to move up unless you are buddy-buddy with management. I finally decided to stop working there when they forgot to recognize me as a Zone Leader when I had trained almost everyone who worked there. The blatant disregard for the hard work I had put in is what set me off."
bad,"Be careful if you accept a driver position. First off, when you are out driving the pay drops to 6.00 per hour. Second You may get 20 hours a week if you are lucky. Tips in my area were not all the good, and when you are waiting you do work around the store. The pay goes up to 8.50, but chances are you will be washing dishes."
bad,"Management is absolutely awful. They play favoritism and don't honor those who truly work hard. They tend to pay new people on at higher wages and expect you to train them. Managers there will literally disrespect you in anyway depending on their mood. Managers are horrible examples for the workers as they are lazy and don't enforce rules to everyone. Managers can be very unsanitary as I once saw a manager drop a tray of bacon into the trashcan, pick it up, and use it the entire day. If the management wasn't so god awful it wouldn't be such a terrible job but the managers make this job somewhat unbearable."
bad,"Usually 12 hour days--always on your feet."
bad,"It can be a great place to work at if you are a college student. This job is not hard at all. What makes it difficult is the management. They expect so much from their employees and they dont have high expectations themselves. They are not thankful and dont appreciate much of their employees. Of course there is always one or two managers that do care."
bad,Definitely got the feeling that I was more of a number than human being in their eyes. The dress code was super strict too. I learned a lot there but I wouldn't recommend it long term
bad,The managment needs A LOT of work. The GM will throw you under the bus. He lies pretty bad. All the  other managers are wonderful and so are the rest of the team.
bad,The job wasn't difficult but the people can be. I had to push to get the money I earned and hours were short as is. I wish they would deal with their staff better but some of the managers are cool.
bad,"fun place bad mangement"
bad,I hav worked at panera in LP for over a year now. We are not allowed to have face piercings or tattoos anymore. The GM will make rules that are not actually through head quarters or the district. GM never follows up with her word. Panera bread would be a very ideal place of work if it wasn't for the unprofessional management.
bad,A group of kind associates could not hide the fact that strict cleaning procedures and managers that asked too much made this job an unpleasant experience
bad,"It's a temporary job that helps pay the bills, but it is not my idle job to work for. I feel like i have so may better skills that I can put towards a different job that can benefit me more, and my skills."
bad,"Brief timeline of how I was let go"
bad,"Panera bread as a company is a great place to work, I loved talking to the elderly and indulging in their words of wisdom, and seeing families of every ethnicity come about, but the location I was at had something against me, they didn't like the person I was, it wasn't my work ethic nor the common mistakes any new associate would have, they out right did not accept me nor gave me equal rights, I felt abused mentally, and verbally. I would work at another location where they have a better work system, management worked by favoritism, not in they have more experience or work better, they kept it within family and used the workers not just myself for their own benefit, time cards change, clocking me out when I wasn't the one who did it, I respected everyone in my work place and did my part as needed, work is work, and not to be replaced with anything else."
bad,"Panera Bread is swamped with people nearly all day. When working on the production line, all food is expected to be completed in 5 minutes or less and with so many orders including carry out and phone in, the expectation is impossible because theres always special orders on specific breads with specific ingredients which at any time we may be out of. You don't get to appreciate any food you make because theres another order in no time at all. If your a dish washer you wash dishes for 6 hours straight and clean up all the gross messes made. I personally would much rather work at a clothing store very low stress with a happier athmosphere. Pay raises arent by much and the expectations are high. Really you get paid as much as any fast food, but everything has to be on a level above them. Just if you want to be happy apply elsewhere."
bad,"I hate working at Panera, they don't properly train you for being cashier or the other jobs decked out to them; barista, line work, packaging baked goods, serving food, waiting on tables, and cleaning up. I constantly get yelled at because I don't do my job right by all 5 managers, but it's not my fault if I can't do something they never trained me  for. They also put customers first in such a way that customers can verbally abuse the staff and we have to apologize, then get yelled at by a managers in front of customers for it. They also play favorites: if you're a favorite you don't get yelled at, if you aren't, be prepared to be picked on and yelled at constantly. They don't even let you out when you're scheduled to leave if you're a cashier, and while their ""counting the money"", they make you take a register and continue working until they're done like 20-40 minutes later."
bad,"Your mornings are hectic and all the coworkers and especially managers are cranky because customers are cranky because we run out of coffee or bagels they want etc. Management puts on a fake face to customers and then treat their coworkers badly behind closed doors. Management plays a lot of favoritism games. You make one little mistake, they will use it against you your entire time your hired there. Coworkers and managers tend to be a bit gossip like. Great food, nice customers overall, some good coworkers, just make sure you kiss up to the managers, very good job security and a flexible schedule, the only way you can get fired is if you steal, however managers expect everything to always be perfect,"
bad,"A typical day usually involved me cleaning up after guests, doing dishes, and restocking condiments. Co-workers were nice, management was overly strict."
bad,I have worked at Panera for nine years five years are for management in 4 years of catering. At the beginning of catering they had managers who helped and succeeded with my sales moving up.  Towards the end they have chosen managers who were all about power and Greed. They have hired new managers who are not involved with catering and left me alone. Right before I got laid off I helped them as a catering Coordinator and a manager. I put my heart and sweat to help them succeed when they were short-handed.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"Managers are rude, they pick favorites. Customers are okay The online request off system is horrible"
bad,"Never gave me hours during the week, the managers were rude and unprofessional. my co workers were very fun and dependable. the job wasnt hard everything was pretty much self expanatory."
bad,"Management does not communicate well with each other. This was a common occurrence with all cafes in the market. However, Panera is a good employer for those going to school full time."
bad,"I have ten years of customer service experience, as well as management experience. I came to Panera looking for a new opportunity and found that they could not uphold their own promises. You are not allowed to work certain areas without being certified through computer work. For each three areas you would receive a raise. This totaled nine areas and three raises. You also received a raise for training employees. In my ten months of employment I was doing all areas and training, all while being understaffed and working closing shifts. I told management multiple times and even talked to the general manager about my four raises that I was owed and the poor staffing issues. I learned and excelled at all areas and was training closers within the first month. They even approached me about management opportunities saying that they thought I was a good fit. They kept telling me I need to find time to sit down and do the computer work. How can one do this when the shifts are understaffed and they rely on you to train all the time? They do not want to give out raises, thus not allowing time in my scheduled hours for the computer work. The job was just fine it was the lack of respect for the employees that made me quit. The GM at the Eagan store is known for screaming at her employees in front of customers and being all around unprofessional. I've seen her belittle her managers in front of people to embarrass them. When I approached her she was extremely rude and told me I'm in charge of my destiny when I told her that  her company was not following their standards on raises. The most"
bad,"poor management, very clean and high standards for cleaning which is a plus, crowded line area, okay pay, free meals sometimes, coworkers were enjoyable"
bad,"You will become one big happy family with your coworkers. It's impossible not to. You will all have to go through war on a daily basis through rushes so you just form bonds. But your GM will NEVER be happy. I worked at 3 different Panera's and its the same thing at everyone you go to. Sure some are less stressful but all of the GM's are unsatisfied with the efforts that you do because the regional managers are always forcing them to try and meet impossible standards. If your in highschool and have no intention of trying to be promoted to management, this is a GREAT job for you. But if you transition to college with this job, you'll want to advance in the company and the company wont treat you as good as they did in the past."
bad,"Panera Bread is a good place to work at. It is very fast paced, which I enjoyed, and I also enjoyed learning and the experience I received from there."
bad,The environment of the establishment wasn't very inviting and the managers didn't seem to help. Very unfriendly and didn't make you feel like you wanted to be there. Still kept a positive attitude about job.
bad,Great Volunteer Experience at the time I volunteered as a seasonal café associate- although now the café has closed & is no longer doing business in Chicago's Lincoln Park Neighborhood as a 501 C Non-profit entity of the Panera Bread Company-  . .. How Sad!
bad,"Scheduled for 50 hour weeks, working more like 60+. On your feet all day, in a very tiring environment. Constantly short-staffed, with added pressure on management to act more as an associate - filling in holes - and less as a manager. Never enough managers scheduled together, leading to lack of quality management during busy times as things become rushed. Associates are the saving grace, as many have great attitudes, and really keep a positive atmosphere to work in."
bad,I just didn't like the work environment and management were veryyyy rudeee. I was graduating High School when i worked here and I fought with them on letting me have my graduation day off and my senior trip day.
bad,"Managers were out of control, calling us idiots, other than two specific managers who made sure that we knew we were valued."
bad,"Panera is a fun place to work! All the people are really nice they just don't want to pay you for how hard they want you to work. No pay scale for positions just the lowest amount they can get away with and no negotiation, No consistency in labor relations it seems that if you work hard and are there every day they squeeze more out of you and if you are not a consistent employee and call in all the time you get promoted. "
bad,I wouldn't reccomend this job unless you enjoy working in food service. It's a very corporate controlled business with customers with elitist attitudes.
bad,i loved panera but did not like managment i dont have much to say about panera bread  that i love the  idea of the company and the atomsphere
bad,"The Management team does not work."
bad,"While staying at Panera my experience with the team/employees there was the best part of the job. Unfortunately for this employer I found the cons outweighed the pros. To start off I found the managers inconsistent and unorganized. There was no overall respect for guidelines of Panera, simply because there are so many guidelines without provided answers of why they are set. One manager would be okay with something while another manager would not be okay with it. There was such an inconsistency, you rarely ever knew if you were doing anything right. This job also has one employee taking on the stress of about 3. They are constantly understaffed and when they are properly staffed they complain about how bad their Labor is. For a Job paying minimum wage there was way too much stress included in a simple workday. "
bad,"Cleaned and cleared area of workers from day and afternoons. Slow start due to others from previous shift still on duty. Set up breads for baker to baked. Rolled and baked flat breads and wrapped for next day sale. Set up bagels on racks for baking. Decorated cooking and cupcakes. Prepared soufles to be baked for early morning sales. Pulled frozen products for next days bake and set up on racks. Cleaned  work areas, washed pans and baking utensils."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"Working here was generally a nightmare. Management especially was disorganized and disrespectful. I opened with this store, and by the time I resigned less than 20% of the original staff was still employed, and all were by resignation, not termination. The morale was very low, and people felt very mistreated. It was difficult to attempt enjoying tasks day to day when the rest of the team was so negatively impacted by the environment provided by the management team. Little to no opportunities to advance. Not worth minimum wage."
bad,"Easy to start out. I was only a cashier, but then I grew with the company and became a trainer. I would train all the new people on cashier, making drinks, maintaining the dining room, cleaning back of the house, preparing and making the food, even opening and closing the bakery, or the make line, and phone orders. I was making my way into catering, once I found out there were no openings my next goal was shift manager. I ran into issues with a certain co-worker and was not happy. The management was very poor, they showed favoritism and it showed on the schedule. Some co-workers were nice but mostly consisted of attitudinal teenagers still in high school. Gossip and rumors spread throughout the work environment, which is not suitable. Hardest part was just making it there, there is no difficulty in the job description itself. Only real required work was to make it there on time, and was even harder on those who didn't have a car. Most enjoyable part was only the regular customers who put a smile on your face."
bad,"As an associate, I would say that the worst part of Panera is the false sense of goodness. We are fast food, just like everyone else. Soups are frozen. Doughs are pre-made. Yet the customers are verbally abusive when it comes to the employees who are doing excellent jobs (my soup is too hot, why can't I have free things), more so than any other fast food job I've worked, because they expect us to be an upscale bistro. "
bad,"I still enjoy this job. Every associate in the store gets alone with each other we all have fun working with each other, everyone goes out of their way to make sure the other person doesn't need help with anything and everyone is willing to take time out and teach you any job function your interested in. But then you have management. The GM has made me a victim of  profiling and oppression with this company.( no/limited advancement ) We have another manager that peeps at you out the corner of his eyes and sneaks around watching us (it is so creepy). We have another one that will nit-pic until she actually has 2-3 associates upset for the day. And then we have one that notices everyone's actions and he doesn't say anything but he makes you feel better when he says ""I'm sorry about the other day, but can I buy you lunch to make it up to you"". And no need to complain to COPORATE they simply DO NOT TAKE THE TIME TO DEAL WITH DIVERSITY issues with management."
bad,"this job used to be good from what I've been told. when you first start out, you have to learn how to do about 30 things in order and how to do them within a time frame to help out the other baker and the pay is crud. you start out at 10 an hour and will not move up until a year and a half  and the raise will be 15 cents or less. plus this company only hires good looking and healthy looking people for the day shift and will hire ugly people like me for the night shift so the customers will not see us."
bad,"They was not much advancement opportunities, the management were not helpful and did not care about there employees. There was also a lot of work for not much compensation."
bad,I'd work there forever but no advancement for me as a guy.work environment was amazing will love it forever.
bad,I was working at panera for awhile I had got sick still attended work regualry and on time got sent home for being too sick. I over medicated one day took to much medicine and over slept past work and was IMMEDIATELY fired. But they knew i was sick Someone who else worked there No called No showed and was able to keep their job and wasn't even sick
bad,"Not bad for a first job. Gotta be a strong individual because you get a lot of attitude from many people. Very fast paced store, especially during lunch time and before any storm."
bad,"I worked at Panera for a year, and had 7 new assistant managers and 2 different general managers. They seemed unprepared and untrained for their positions."
bad,With the exception of co-workers and regular customers I was dissatisfied with my job. I understand I shouldn't say anything negative but I tried for 2 1/2 years to be successful and advance and I finally gave up. I'm stubborn and don't like to quit but I'd had enough.
bad,"My day was spent in whichever position needed to be filled.  I was the Swiss army knife of the store, trained in all positions.  Being my first customer service job, it was here I learned how to approach customers politely and friendly.  Our direct management team had issues but all-in-all, they were effective.  The same could not be said about my co-workers, some were lazy or rude, some didn't care about the product.  The hardest part was the attitude of most workers."
bad,i don't know exactly what I'm going to do till i get there. I've learned most of the jobs and go where I'm needed. Poor communication between management and employees or each other. All my co-workers well trained and helpful. Hardest part of my job is not knowing what my scheduled shift is from week to week. most enjoyable part of my job is driving.
bad,"I did enjoy this job, at first. But, then it was made very clear to me that it was a place where you had to fit in to get anywhere. If you did not fit into the manager's group of cronies then they would make it very difficult for you. Thankfully I did fit in. But I did see some employees treated very unfairly."
bad,This good part time job if you are going to school and living with parents.
bad,"Everyday is different. Learned how to deal with minors and young adults better. Upper management is ok. Co-workers pretty decent. Hardest part of the job is the long work hours, no sick days, no personal days, and not much vacation."
bad,tech manager had be previously terminated from a major pizza chain for embezzling money from the company. not much more that can be said than that.
bad,The managers are lazy and don't like to do know work. All they do is sit around and eat. The employees was cool.They dont want to pay no money and want you to do all the work and also they dont promote within the company. They promote from on the outside first.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"Good place, can be bad at times. When it is busy, the pressure rises and it can get to you if you can not adapt. Some employees do not pull their end of the load, causing others to pick up for their slack."
bad,"I worked here for 2 years and was promoted to an Associate trainer. Through my 2 years, I started making $10.50 and ending making $10.88. I was a veteran at Panera and I was trusted to do any task. However, my pay did not reflect that. Towards the end of my time at Panera, they were hiring people at a starting rate of $11.25. A whole 37 cents more than someone who worked there for 2 years and knew everything about the company."
bad,The pay and hours available are the main Pro's of this job. It is a fast paced Work environment and there are many employees. Management was scattered and often had issues with staff.
bad,"I learned a lot about food service, and this job helped me to gain a much greater respect for all of those who work in any type of food service career. Customers were impatient a lot of the time, but my coworkers were incredibly supportive and friendly. I had a hard time managing my hours, and I felt management may not have been as understanding as they could have been. The best part of the job was getting discounted meals for my lunch break! So good."
bad,"My experieince at panera bread was not ideal. When I first started I worked as a cashier and would close the dining room, and sometimes the bakery. After working there for several months, I was moved down to washing dishes full time."
bad,There isn't a lot of professionalism at this location. Managers are not as active as they should be with the associates. There is a small number of associates that do their job to standards. They are for the most part very understanding forgiving with scheduling emergencies and inappropriate behavior. Very sweet people though. They care about each other and the customers.
bad,"The job itself isn’t too bad, it’s just the management. Schedule’s are not out until a week to a day before the day the schedule begins. Managers don’t always come and help out. Closing has taken up to 4 hours. Short staffed a ton. Stressful working environment. Fun coworkers too. I think with better management this would be an amazing place to work!"
bad,"In my current position as food prepper, the training was very poor. Many times along the way, farther down the line, I was informed of things that were supposedly part of my job but had never been told to me before. The manager turnover has been very high because of a lack of desire for managers to stay or a lack of ability for managers to be kept. The company allows a discount on up to $10 worth of food on any given shift, but this amount has been the same since I started there in 2004. In the same amount of time the cost of food on the company;s menu has continually gone up, so that same amount of discount allows for a far lesser amount of food to be purchased. The company has also, in the time I have been working there, stopped paying time and a half holiday pay for federal holidays, so the only  holidays there is any benefit for is for Thanksgiving and Christmas, also the only two days of the year they are closed. The paid time off accrues throughout the year and carries over partially into the next year, so it is not immediately forfeited at year's end. The insurance and health benefits are reasonable and affordable, and an employee can insure his or her family members with health, dental, vision, and life insurance. Opportunities for advancement exist based on quarterly review for people with ambition and a strong work ethic. I was most disappointed in this company when they removed the daytime baker position I had been hired for in the company and I was given the choice to either go to my current cafe and prep or to quit."
bad,"Worked there for 7 years, saw incredible turnover over that period. Problem with bad general managers, forcing the good managers to leave for better positions elsewhere, leaving really bad upper-management at La Plata. But the day to day staff, the people you are in the trenches with, are great. If not for them, would be bloody awful."
bad,"I've been around a lot of places and to be honest, there's not a lot to say about Panera Bread. It is a pretty simple and average place to work for young students."
bad,The employees were productive as well as the managers. Food was made efficiently and correctly. Orders were correctly taken and checked for accuracy.  The management however plays favorites when employees and talks about an employee to other employees in a nonprofessional manner and sometime insulting.
bad,"I enjoyed working for the Baker manger that i worked for, she was very understanding. i didn't like how the send you to different locations. Overall it was a layed back job, I worked overnight ."
bad,"There are never enough closers, constantly understaffed and stressed, one person often does up to 4 positions and there's no chance for raises. Management also messes up scheduling constantly."
bad,"Lack of composure in the management. "
bad,"Maybe the franchise is a lot worse then the corporate stores but it really isn’t worth it.. I work as a Baker which is their 3rd shift position and they honestly couldn’t care less about us, even though we’re the reason their stores open every morning."
bad,Its great besides the fact that Management is to busy worrying about crunching numbers and not enough about retaining the employees. Not only that but i was late 1 time and they cut my hours in half.
bad,"When I first had my interview I was really excited to start. I applied for the cashier position. After your interview if you’re hired you have to do an orientation which is just basically a walk through of your Panera so you can see what it’s like to work there. After the orientation you have a “proof” which is kind of like a meeting with all the other hires where you watch videos about Panera and do interactive questions with a manger.after that I did online training at my Panera which took three hours. I’m still not sure if I’ll get paid for those three things but I intend to ask when I go back in a couple days. My first day there was horrible. They had me scheduled from 5am-2pm which I wasn’t mad about since that was the shift I wanted. When I got there the manager told me I was going to be working the line, which was weird since I applied for the cashier position. But I just went with it for now. While training I found out that the girl who was training me had only been there for FIVE DAYS.  A girl who barely knew what she was doing herself, who was still supposed to be training, was training me! My first day wasn’t terrible I just was confused the whole time because nobody was really training me. My second day I had a different person train me, she knew what she was doing so it went a lot smoother only she was scheduled for two hours because it was supposed to be her day off, so when she left I was kind of on my own to figure out what I was doing. My third day I had another DIFFERENT PERSON train me. She had been there the longest out of all of the line cooks so she was"
bad,Panera Bread was an okay job for my first job the only thing I hated was the pay and also sometimes the managers were a pain. But other than that it was okay.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"When I started working here, this was a great place to work. The team worked well together, everything ran smoothly, management was great. After a year of working there, management became manipulative. Teamwork was more strained. There were problems on every shift. Rules changed frequently. Would not recommend in current conditions."
bad,"If ur looking for part time job just a few hours a week for basic wage or a first job then Panera would work. The shifts at this location are short(3-4hours), even though I was hired to work 5days/hours each day but I found out quickly they don't have shifts like that.Pay is not good at barely above minimum wage and due to over staffing the super short shifts feel endless with nothing to do."
bad,"I really enjoyed this job at first! I was qualified to work every job in the store. The new GM came in and gave me a really hard time. I don't think it is fair that a new manager can come in, treat you like a number and don't even speak. They hire every week on here but are really choice-y with apps. Get it together."
bad,"They only paid me $8.25 to do everything in the dinning room, helping out in line, and running food orders. At 16 ,I had many responsibilities, and Panera did not pay me enough to do as much as I was doing for them and also continue paying for my car and phone"
bad,"atypical day at work was me coming in greeting everyone  first then i would go to the cooler collect the meats i need,  prepare them then i would gether my veggies an prepare them ,then  i would  prepare the pasteries, then i would  load the dishwasher, then i would go clean the dining room. These are the things i do for eight hours five days a week. On the weekends all i did was prep the meats an veggies."
bad,"Great perk is the free food, other than that can’t really say many positive things. They don’t promote very often and when they do, you will probably be relocated  to somewhere far from your desired area of town. No late hours but very early mornings (as early as 3am). Very high turnover rate for managers and hourly employees, so you get what you signed up for."
bad,"It was probably the bad management at my specific store but they hired me for 30-38hrs for a week wouldn't do full time, they knew my schedule and knew i needed daytime hours and then slowly started cutting hours down because i wouldn't take the night hours eventually i started closing for the store but tjat wasnt good enough either since they didnt have me come in until like 5 or 7 during dinner rushes and then the store was closed at 11 and we were expected to basically be out the dooor and done with all duties by 11:30"
bad,"The hours given to me were not enough, I moved to Manchester and Panera Bread was in New Britain, it was difficult for me to get back and forth. I asked to have a transfer to a Panera Bread in Manchester but it was not given to me."
bad,"making food"
bad,"Relaxed, good food. Required to fill in more positions than hired or being paid for. Forced to be a trainer without getting paid as a trainer. Worked a year without a raise. Management is hit or miss, they are either reasonable or explosive. Coworkers are very efficient and nice. Just being over worked and expected to run up to three positions (Cashier, Dish, Cooking, Dining room, barista) at one time."
bad,"Time management is huge. Since everone has their own way of baking, nothing is consistant. Making it hard for everyone to have the same understanding. I can tell its not easy being a manager for overnight bakers, but that just means they should have more in charge, making moves."
bad,"Panera Bread can be a good first job if you work at the right location. At the seal beach one, there are hardly any benefits for the job and scheduling is all over the place. It is a franchise and the upper management treats store associates as if they are expendable and worthless. They are there everyday yet never take the time to learn associate's names. They work in the office upstairs and come down to the floor just to criticize and enforce old, rigid rules."
bad,The management takes out their frustration on staff. A lot of drama throughout staff. I called out to go to a funeral and I was written up for it. Management does not care about the wellbeing of the workers. I don’t not recommend working here.
bad,"Working there was fun at first but the pay grade isn’t enough to make a living. Paying rent in Ocala is expensive and when asked to get more hours, they still scheduled me for less than 30hrs a week. Management is good, scheduler is bad, environment has its positive and negative outcomes. A lot of regulars are good, but also a lot of spoiled elderly people that don’t know how to say thanks or you’re welcome."
bad,"The workload wasn't overwhelming and was manageable. If you've never worked in food service there's a bit of a learning curve. Some customers could be antagonistic but most of them were pleasant. Management was so-so, some managers cared more about the employees than others. Opening shifts were brutal and draining."
bad,I went to Panera Bread thinking I would be able to advance within the company with benefits. I was in the training to become a manager and soon realized the only benefit was free food. I began searching for other career options.
bad,"some days were busy, some were not. I learned how to work a register, assemble sandwiches. I really do enjoy the co-workers there. the managers wouldn't solve any of the problems I addressed them, and they promise a raise and promotion for a long time, and I never got it. So I left"
bad,i use to love working at panera bc old management and my coworkers but once management changed the higher up ppl showed their true colors and they are just as trash
bad,"I would not recommend working at Panera it could have been the location I worked at. But the management was very poor, always had a lack of people on shifts. And the place would be out of order on a daily basis."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"Perhaps it was the individual store I was working with, but I had a less than admirable experience working with Panera Bread. The customers and staff were never the issue for me, it was the management. Though, of course there were a few managers I still hold in high esteem, there were more than a few who were not. The most undesirable experience I found while working at Panera, was how little I felt appreciated, with two years experience, trained in almost every area except for bakery, preperation, and management, I was given the title ""Trainer"", but received little benefits. I was barely given a raise, and when I offered to help stocking the shipments, I realized just how low they were paying me in relation to my co-workers. When addressing this problem to the then general manager, I was brushed off and the issue was never revisted when management was changed and I left for college."
bad,While I enjoyed doing the work I felt that I was always being taken advantage of. They ignored my availability and were very inconsistent. Whenever I addressed an issue with my manager I felt that it was ignored.
bad,The general manager at Panera is very critical and yells a lot. The assistant mgr is very lazy and won't help...he just comes out of his office at night to yell at us. Most shift managers are awesome. The GM talks about promoting me but never follows through.
bad,"I wish to not comment on my time at Covelli Enterprises. It was a good learning experience. Company culture always begins at the top, so treatment of people started there and made it's way to the cafe level."
bad,"Really Fantastic people working  there and encourage each other through some difficult situations. Management needs to be more diverse and understanding with employees . Seen a lot of unhealthy things in personality and authority , which to a lot of customers is a turn off . Sad to see a great business be so ugly and disrespectful,when they say they are so real and comforting. Does the CEO really know what’s been going on?"
bad,"Panera was fun, employees were nice and the customers are gracious. Enjoyed baking the pastries, and delivering the food to the tables where the customers sit."
bad,"While working there I experienced a lot of chaos and  miscommunication between managers and associates. We’re given limited produce and when said produce runs out, the associates are the ones dealing with angry customers when it has nothing to do with them, it’s all on the manager who does truck orders and doesn’t buy everything we need."
bad,"I fell in love with the Panera business model.  After coming through the depression of '09 and the no-job-recovery.  I decided to try to get into management at Panera as everyone I knew said I was very good at what I did.  However, the Franchise that owned the Panera I worked in never saw it that way, and any promotion proved to be elusive.  After ten and a half years of trying, and ultimately accused of having a bad attitude.  I decided to retire. Now seeking PT work."
bad,A typical day at work would include me getting snared looks and having to deal with the wishy washy attitudes from managers. 2/10 managers there are somewhat nice the employees are disrespectful and management lets anything go on as long as they like you. Unhealthy first job. After 6 months i still didnt get a raise being that i always do overtime..
bad,The company is clearly pushing employees to the limit of what they can or will do for as little money as possible simply to find out what they can get away with.
bad,"Not very fun place to work , some days it only depends on who’s working . A lot of favoritism especially when break comes around people don’t come back"
bad,"This just isn't the company I agreed to work for from the beginning."
bad,Working here is not that bad but theres chaos that happens and management isn't well they'll use you. You tell them to put you on the schedule and they wont or they will put you in a bad time.
bad,The management does not do their jobs properly in my personal opinion. It is often lacking in food due to a lack of food being ordered. Schedueling is terrible. One day you'll have 3 closers when you only need 2 and the next day you'll be closing alone. Work permits for those under 18 are not followed. Half the employees lack valid food handler cards. Complaints about harrasment are not taken seriously. Overall I personally think they need a complete change of management.
bad,Panera is not panera anymore. It was bought out and now that it is privately owned it is not the same culture or design that once was. This is okay for those fresh but sad to see for those build within the company.
bad,"Primary job duties for Panera team members include food preparation, sanitation, and customer service. Panera Bread crew members operate cash registers, as well. Applicants with strong communication skills and experience in the coffee shop industry may gain preferential treatment during the Panera Bread hiring process"
bad,"When I started, the job was exciting and fun.  Due to management changes, the last 5 months have been a disaster. There is no team work, nobody to properly do their job without getting the run-around, and no gratitude expressed for going above and beyond during this transformation.  It's physically hard on back, arms, and feet. No cooperation helping with last minute added bakes or cleaning (baker does all prepping, baking, decorating, dishes, and cleaning by themselves) I'll come back after management is established and re-review."
bad,One manger is unprofessional yelling and screaming at customers had to call corporate because she was yelling and screaming at me also.I already have lot of responsibility's plus she added work on top of my work.Also I have disability as well.Also it is very stressful. I need job that is less stressful.
bad,"I was mainly a delivery driver but was also “trained” on cash register and drive thru. Tips could be okay but it was really only steady during lunch and even then most of the time there were too many drivers to share deliveries with. Management was hit or miss, my GM wasn’t there often and the managers let employees get away with a lot more than they should have. High turnover and overall poor attitudes from a lot of employees. Stealing was rampant as well which to me is not acceptable."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"Management at Panera was always on your back, constant drama between employees, and the environment was just a little uncomfortable. If a manager didn't have enough of something there was always someone to blame. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was making a customer walk out happy."
bad,"typical low wage job. It worked for what i needed. flexible hours. always up for picking up extra shifts to cover others.  General cleaning and stocking duties. greeting customers, handling food. good breaks."
bad,"Begged  for hours,  refuse to give  me hours. Make next to no money, can't pay bills,  afford to  live.  They say Im a  great worker  but never   work me. very very short staffed and stressful."
bad,Working at panera was okay.You get a lot of customer complaints in a day. Management at my panera was chill but some managers were a little extreme. Loved my coworkers
bad,"I liked working at Panera Bread for years and did well there with multiple recognition certificates received at our quarterly Bread Bash meetings, and even a promotion to associate trainer, however, due to our facility being a training store, management was continually on rotation.  Most of the mangers were alright to work with, however, the last one I worked with for about 6 months was difficulty to communicate with about some things that needed to be improved in our store, that past managers had addressed appropriately."
bad,"No room for advancement- trainer, supervisor, and management positions very rarely open up and waiting for them to do so takes forever. Management shows little appreciation for employees and this is reflected in the pay. When you DO finally get a raise, the highest raise you can get is about 22 cents. I would absolutely not recommend this company to anyone I cared about."
bad,I learned a great deal about management and customer service. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the team members and customers. The hardest part of the job was the lack of communication throughout the management in general and no one being on the same page or even having a set way of doing things. `
bad,"Working as a delivery driver at Panera Bread was not the best experience. Delivering was fine, everything else was unclear. I was never properly trained, and it was very difficult to get a manager's attention at the end of my shift to collect gratuity. Coworkers were not fair with splitting up delivery orders amongst each other and get annoyed with you when you reciprocate their competiveness."
bad,"From the day you're hired, the company preaches to you about ""being human"" and ""doing the right thing"", yet when they (as in their HR department) screwed up, I was the one who got the punishment (Terminated). Instead of treating me like a ""valued employee"" I was treated as a statistic. "
bad,The management had no respect of my time and did not treat all associates equally. On a few occasions I would get to work and after being there for no longer than 10-20 minutes they would send me home. This was bothersome because at the time I was still dependent on my parents for transportation and we did not live as close to the location I was hired at. Management would also give us aimless duties when we were not busy.
bad,"Worked there for two years. Very unorganized and hectic. New workers made dollars more than me and I had been there for two years. When I asked for a raise, they told me I couldn't get one because I was in college."
bad,I like it but it was the people that didn't make me like it like one day it was busy and I was new and the manger was making me do everything there is suppose to be 3 people on line there was three but she wasn't doing anything
bad,It was amazing and the environment was ok. Nothing that couldn't be repeated. I enjoyed the opportunity to grow with as well as learn about the company. Its easy to be promoted. Management  were nice. Pay was ok. Customers were friendly.
bad,I really liked the job. It just didn't pay enough and I was never offered health care. Customers were nice and the food was good. Only 50% of 1 meal a day was free but we got free bread if we closed.
bad,"Very little to no formal training received, but expectations of proficiency are grossly disproportionate."
bad,"Angry, stuck up customers frequent Panera and make life hard, plus in order to actually train you, they make you watch 3-4 days worth of boring videos."
bad,I like the people the job was ok pay could of been better management wasn't the best crew member worked together to achieve your team goal it was a quick learn experience
bad,I do not wish to write a review about Panera. I did my best under stressful work environment and was not compensated enough as general Manager........
bad,I loved my job but the company itself made it hard to love it overall. They don't pay enough for what they expect you to do. Its hard and you learn a lot but they don't appreciate you enough for fair wages for what they expect
bad,"Had high hopes for this job, but was very disappointed. Being trained on the register was useless because you pretty much had to learn it yourself. You get paid nothing for the amount of work you do and it isn't worth it. Managers were ok but weren't around a lot when you needed help. Opening is ridiculous, the amount of work you do to get paid nothing is pointless. Extremely crowded constantly and understaffed which made everything stressful. Never got the hours I asked for but instead got double the amount. Customers always had orders received wrong, even if rang up right and they'd take out their anger on you. Arrogant regulars would come in daily too, who expected you to remember their orders and treat them like royalty. I don't recommend"
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"Constant standing, walking, lifting, carrying heavy items. Management would cut staff (tho not myself because I was a hard worker) in order to save labor. Saving labor meant larger bonuses for management."
bad,I didn’t like 2 of the manager there they both was mad   Racist  And disrespectful.and I had to leave because I can’t work with people that see colors .
bad,"As a Line Associate,"
bad,The work was pretty doable. the staff often got lazy and handed tasks over to other employees. some workers work a lot harder than others. Management poorly manages.
bad,"If you are desperate for a job, Panera is for you. Its fast paced but can be stressful.  Management isn't always the best. They care more about labor than the employees needing their hours. They don't even give you free meals or food at the end of the night that may be thrown away anyway"
bad,Stressful hours of work throughout peak times. Short staffed and poor managed. Never providing full time to be considered for vacation PTO time. Poor raises.
bad,The management at this location was awful. The work environment was very unprofessional and unproductive. The typical day was stressful and exhausting. The typical shift was made up of poorly trained employees who had no or little training in their position or we were simply understaffed. Personally I like the values and transparency of Panera. We offer a clean menu with many options for different dietary needs. My favorite part of working in the food industry is the ever changing options and combinations as well as going over and beyond for the customer. My least favorite part was the poor management and the immature and incompetent employees they hired.
bad,"The pay is low, the hours are long, and they ask for too much for 7.50 an hour. I would not suggest working for Panera Bread to anyone. The food is overpriced and management does not like to work with their employees."
bad,"The job at Panera Bread has been a stressful one to say the least. Management is poor, thus resulting in low pride for the workers. It was very difficult to enjoy my time spent here during the day when the managers did not enjoy it themselves. Quite often, customers were unhappy with the service and time it took to receive their food. I am a detail oriented person, and I could not take pride in my job at this location. The discounts were a perk, as a 65% discount is given on all food items. All drip coffee and fountain beverages are free when working, so that was a huge benefit. The training plans are very confusing and are never used. No one really seems to take their job seriously, which results in poor employee relationships and unhappy customers."
bad,"A typical work day at Panera when I worked there consisted of doing the work load of two employees. I learned the fundamentals of a job. The management was okay. The culture was average, nothing that stood out to me. The hardest part of the job was not quitting sooner. The most enjoyable part of the job were those 5 minutes in which you knew you were going to clock out and go home."
bad,"When i worked there the management had just as high a turn over rate, because they were fired, as the employees. The regional managers and owners would place on the burden on the managers, treat them  poorly and fire them often or move them to another store. I didn't get much of a sense of stability and that people were valued."
bad,i would go into work and then listen to gossip from all the 17 year olds that worked in the back. then i would go put on an apron and get to work. the worst part was doing dish at the end of the night because nonone ever did them.
bad,"No organization, scattered training, let the kids working there do basically nothing throughout their shift and let the older employees pick up the slack, management was a mess"
bad,"Managers don't actually train you. Even when you have no experience you go through a training worksheet once and then you're on your own and expected to keep up perfectly. Trainers attitudes are either from understanding or rude. Often managers and some employees treat you as if you are dumb if you make an honest mistake and don't understand something, or ask questions they feel are stupid or just processing things differently."
bad,Panera Bread was my first real experience with people working as a cashier and had the chance to be one on one with the customer. learned that it is very important to keep your composure right at all times because you are representing a business. i enjoyed meeting new people and working with a great and supportive crew.
bad,They require the bakers to do way too much work in 8 hours. Management complains if you work over 8 hours. Got hurt at work because of faulty equipment. Don't maintain their equipment. Never get any praise from bakery managers. Panera does not give regular raises. They don't pay their employee's a decent wage.
bad,The specific Panera Bread that I worked at in Peoria was very unpleasant. The people I worked with were very unprofessional and racist. Everyday I walked in there I wanted to leave because I knew that I would hear something totally uncalled for and disrespectful.
bad,"Easily able to make friends. Training is simple. Hours are easily adjustable, but I was not able t move up because I could not work nights due to school."
bad,"Panera was a great experience both personal and professional. Panera allowed me to open my eyes about the work place and how people should be treated within it. I loved my panera store in Fresno but wasn't quite as fond of the one in San Jose. Overall, Panera helped me grow."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,The management is not good here. They were very bad about schedule flexibility and would hold you long after you were supposed to leave. The job was very fast paced and it was easy to fall behind because most of the time the food prep was understaffed.
bad,"The job itself was fairly easily in that it was performing typical minimum wage tasks, but some of the managers/trainers were unpleasant people to say the least. I was refused breaks, treated condescendingly, and told to do tasks outside of what I would be initially assigned for my position. Also, I was told I would be compensated with leftover pastries/bread and even meals during my training, but none of this was actually provided."
bad,"Long Hours, do not get out at assigned time. Lots of people call in. Only trained in one area so it gets to be the same everyday. Good thin is you get paid well for full time and get to meet a lot of regulars. The regulars are sweet and kind."
bad,I've been here for a while and its made me become a better person. I am patient and hardworking and dedicated. This job has made me realize how much I am able to handle and what I am capable of.
bad,"I usually served food and closed the line everyday. The restaurant was poorly managed and I did not enjoy working with some of the people. Many of my coworkers were lazy or would not show up, leaving the rest of us to do everything for them. We had four managers for only about 15 employees, and most of them were very harsh and overcritical. I was always scheduled too many hours, sometimes twice the hours i asked for. The hardest part of the job was not knowing when I would get off at nights, because depending on who else I worked with, it could be anywhere from 9:30-11:30. The most enjoyable part of the job was probably the bread and the pastries."
bad,This particular store has horrible management (GM). This is a store where they do not appreciate their workers and is shown. This store is out of control and has a lack of correct guidance.
bad,Panera is a good first job for high school and college aged individuals but over time the time becomes increasing frustrating due to constantly having new staff members and managers. Turnover rate is extremely high and general management and district management are often times not on the same page. Difficult to get raises and many of the managers treat staff very poorly.
bad,"To much drama between coworkers, management was biased to the regular workers. majority of the customers were old, a lot of regulars."
bad,I was poorly trained and the hours were very little. The Main Manager is a very rude and power hungry person. Not a very supportive environment.
bad,"It was okay. First time job got laid off after being opened for 2 months. Mangers where okay, co-workers where great."
bad,"Doesn't treat their works very well, management isn't that great. Though in a restaurant feel it is great place to eat. Food is delicious, some of the people are cool."
bad,"I hated this job. The coworkers were pretty nice and the job seemed exciting at first but it was ruined by the management. The General Manger was very rude and condescending. He would give vague directions such as ""could you get that"" and yell at you for doing the wrong thing very often. He would talk down to employees and make them feel lesser for undeserving reasons. Almost as if he got a kick out of it. This attitude rubbed off on all the assistant managers and made it a terrible environment. The job was fairly easy with decent pay."
bad,"The job itself was easy. Management never knew what they were doing. A lot of times they tried to tell you how to do your job without even knowing how that job was supposed to be done. There was a lot of turnover. In the 3 years that I worked there, they went through 6 General Managers and several shift managers. A lot of times, the prep team was asked to serve molded fruit and vegetables. They were told to simply wash it off or cut around it and feed it to the public. At least 2 General Managers did this with staff. If anything ever runs out (like produce), they would send employees to Kroger or Giant Eagle to buy their brand of coffee, dressing or just cheap, non-organic produce. Overall, a very deceptive place to work. They just don't serve what they advertise."
bad,"It started out as an incredible place to work, but I quickly realized that my hard work was taking me no where but making my general manager dislike me. I begged to be trained around the store so that I could get ahead in the store and follow through with the incentive I was promised could be offered to me. My general manager blocked me from being able to train around the store and thus made my work day unbearable in almost every way. She was transferred from the store and I was suddenly able to be trained in other areas. Even though she's gone, my work life is difficult and I almost always feel unwanted. In addition, I was hired at one salary and three days later, they upped it and completely refused to raise mine. I work harder than most and do not get paid close to what I think is right simply because I make even that $0.50 less per hour. With how much I work, that adds up fast."
bad,"I have been working at Panera Bread since 2009. I got the job as a part time dining room worker while I was in high school. I really enjoyed the job, at first. After I graduated high school I received a promotion to shift supervisor. I have stuck with the company ever since hoping that there would be room for advancement. I was wrong. After six years, I have not received a promotion, nor have I received a pay raise in over two years. Even when you get into management there are no benefits for working for this company. I do not get any vacation time or sick days, if I request a day off 9 out of 10 times they expect me to work it. Also, I work 8 hour shifts and very rarely do I get a break, and if I do have time for one, I get told that there is always something to do. There are some good things about this company, they are flexible with school schedules, and management does get free food which does save some money. But all in all, there is no benefit for working for this company which is exactly why there is such a high turn over rate."
bad,"Employees are expected to do the work of multiple job positions. As a customer service associate  I had to be a barista, sweep and mop the entire place, stock, take out trash, clean restrooms (I once had to clean up someone's feces), maintain the drink stations and coffee and tea urns, clean the glass doors, clean the bakery, box up donations, and do food prep, all while having a register open. The drive-thru is also poorly ran and inefficient. (i.e. every time someone orders a bakery item, we have to run through the restaurant to get to the bakery to see if it's in stock, and then run back to the drive-thru area to put the order in. Silly.) "
bad,"inconsistent reviews and feedback.  Corporate and franchise were not on the same level, although they acted as if they were. Users and abusers, they do not care. Gain as much experience about how the world works in a corporate life and see if its for you."
bad,"Management was a joke, there was a lot of sneakiness going on management telling you they were going to promote you bring in a new employee from a previous location and promotes that person (white of course). This is an okay job for a high school student needing extra income."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"You are more of Glorified Cashier, because you're stuck at a position for most of the day. As a food cost manager, you have to put extra hours just to get your non shift duties completed"
bad,"I worked at panera for 1 month. I was punctual and a hard worker. i worked the register i was beginning to feel overwhelm. i asked to be put in the dining room as it may be less stressful for me. I got fired for walking to the back room so that I could calm down after I had a difficult customer as the register.  this was my first time i got upset with a customer and i get no warning and i get fired on the spot.  its funny they fire me but have sign up that they are hiring. "
bad,this was my first restaurant job. I applied as a  part time worker because I was in school but I always punched out with full time hours because they extremely under staffed. In my three years of working for Panera bread I went through about 10 different managers.
bad,"Management didn't seem like they wanted to be there, inconsistent training, some employees didn't have uniforms.  It seems very disorganized"
bad,"Employees are led by example, if the manager horse plays and has inappropriate behavior on the job, then the employee doesn't learn to respect the manager or their authority."
bad,"Overall good first job, longterm seek other opportunities. Typical slower mornings, busy lunches, and sometimes crazy dinner."
bad,"I didn't really get to much managing, but more running around. I am very good with Time management but it seemed I would never have the chance to get what I needed done, because my staff always needed assistance (which is great because I love teaching) Hardest part of the job was the fact they offer growth in the company, I was on my way up the ladder, and theyn stopped caring about panera, and more about Noodles and stopped eveyones transitions."
bad,"In my entire time at Panera there were only 7 African American employees ( between two locations). I only felt valued as an employee by my immediate managements team- I came in to a shift even though I needed surgery on a broken bone simply because I didn't want to just walk out on my team before they found a replacement, I would come in early and stay late if needed and try to do any and everything to help my store ( even coming in when people walked out) . Ultimately, I felt like it meant nothing. My care and desire to be a team player didn't really make a difference."
bad,"Working at this branch of Panera Bread was exhausting. As a student, they expected me to work 30 hours or more a week! The managers talked down to me like I was a child and nothing good I did was ever recognized."
bad,"This was my first job and when I first was hired I loved my manager, Holly. She made me want to come to work, but after she left it wasn't as enjoyable as before. I only got one shift a week (4 hour shift) and my pay checks were kind of a joke. I asked for more hours the whole time I worked there and the night I was planning to put my three weeks notice in I was asked if I wanted more hours. After a year of working there. Our store was in charge of training managers and they would work there for a period of time and then sent off to manage another store, the only downside is consistent poor management."
bad,"Good people, but management needs improvement. I learned a lot about customer service in my field. Those skills continue to help me in my daily life. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the rush, the line would sometimes form out the building. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to the customers and working with good hard working people."
bad,"This company will lure you in with promises, that they never fulfill. It you want meager pay along with no benefits and the far off dream of being more look elsewhere. "
bad,The job was okay. i felt like i wasn't treated as fair as other workers
bad,"I worked the register at the City of Industry branch and found that not only did they hire so many workers that no one had sufficient hours, management also had no way to deal with the scheduling issue because everyone wanted to work more hours. My co-workers were friendly and I learned a lot about the cashier system and being a barista. The hardest part of the job was dealing with limited hours to work. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers and getting their food and drinks ready for them as fast as possible."
bad,There was an attitude that accepted age discrimination.  I was underemployed and not considered for any kind of advancement.  I do like that some of their stores have a pay as you can program for the low income people in the area.  
bad,"They work you past your lunch hour, don't give you breaks or lunches and they don't care. Burns are common from all the hot items the cafe prepares."
bad,I love my job and love 3rd shift. Management was very slow to respond to problems and did not care about seniority. My co workers were great for the most part. The hardest part of my job was always trying to perfect my craft. The most enjoyable thing was hearing people tell me how much they loved the product.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,If you’re looking to start out in management sure. But Panera doesn’t pay very well at all!! People are super nice love employees but they need to get the stick outta their butts and start paying people what they deserve.
bad,I would not recommend working for Panera bread the discount are great. But I was hired as a dish washer and u have to do everything whether a it’s busy or not. Clean tables clean floors listen to your manager cry like a baby. They only reason I really stayed at the time was because I made some friends there. But it’s not worth the pay check. Some manager there treat you like dirt. There were only two good managers and they were planning on leaving. I would only work there if your desperate cash.
bad,The management didn’t really care about their staff at all and the employees were rude and that made it very difficult to like my job. I did like the fast paced environment because it kept me busy.
bad,"Any shift worked, I was always put out of my way to stay over an hour after the store would be closed because team members couldn't fulfill the job they were paid to do,"
bad,"There’s a good chance to advance and earn higher pay working here, and the managers are very please with good work. Terrible management which is the biggest problem."
bad,"Working at Panera in all honesty, was kind of horrible. While I enjoyed my coworkers there was no organization and call outs were insane. Mangement seemed to blame people who didn't want to come in on their day off as opposed to people who were supposed to be working."
bad,Panera is a fast cash restaurant meaning not full service but also isn't necessarily fast food. They usually pay minimum wage regardless of previous experience. Good place to build up skills for different careers. Management varied as all places do. Expect to work around an eclectic group of people. Most full time employees were those who worked there a while or were shift leads.
bad,"I disliked working in the food industry, but it was a great first job for a 16 year old. The money was decent. The hours were good, but I wanted to coach gymnastics & enjoy a job."
bad,"Management is lacking which makes work very stressful.  They have very high expectations which is great, but no follow through due to running out of products, or improper staffing and run out of coffee. Positives would be a consistent schedule and the ability to easily move up if that is your desire. You get raises for cross training into a different area and also for training in your home area. From having also worked for a different Panera in a different state, pay being only $8.25 an hour compared to starting at $11 here in Ma., the franchises,  have very high expectations,  the management in Florida was almost always on point, but there expectations were 75% higher for less money."
bad,"Most of my time their was as their night dishwasher. First thing I did was organize loose objects which can take no time at all to half an hour. Cleaning dishes would take up most of my time thereafter to occasionally to be interrupted by calls for soup to the line (which was my responsibility) or to cover the floor person's break. Closing time quality of life varied on who my co-workers were for the night. Good co-workers would make it a breeze, bad ones can make it a miserable experience forcing longer hours. The worst managers during closing would have to do worthless or inefficient task despite my objections or simply not help. Good managers were rare, but greatly appreciated. Plenty of average managers."
bad,"Cashier, counting pastry’s, baking pastry’s, bread, open the store. Making toast baigols, be nice with the people, close the store, always doing some thing."
bad,"The hardest part of the job is trying to make everyone happy.  As the baker you support the café staff who are a different branch of the business and keep their management team happy while still being accountable to your own bosses for overtime and problems that arise because of said café management.  The majority of the café staff I have found to be wonderful and fun people. The few exceptions, unfortunately, are the ones my manager chooses to listen to so I no longer trust her to have my back.  I have learned a lot about baking but the training is certainly not sufficient for the task.  The baker is responsible for cooking all of the breads, cookies, and pastries that the café sells in a day, often by themselves, and cleaning the bakery area within eight hours. I dealt with it for a year now but in the end no job is worth bad management."
bad,"I worked with PR instead of corporate Panera, generally terrible managers who did not care about their employees often working minors over their legal limit and not listening to their associates. Very fast-paced and there definitely are major issues with the company that they are ignoring."
bad,"I worked as a baker. My work day was always the same, I would prepare and bake the bread and desserts for the day and prep for the following day. I learned that timing is everything when it came to baking bread. Some breads need longer in the proof box than others and it was up to timing efficiency to have the oven always baking. I was managed by an outside group and they were ok. The management of the individual cafes were more impactful to me. Their last manager was too busy hitting on the staff to do his job. He had no initiative to do anything but complain. The culture was very young minded. They would rather goof around than be serious about their job. A small percentage of the employees were over 40. They cared about their work and how it reflected the café. The hardest part of the job was finding a place in the cooler for prepped items for the night bakers. Coolers were too small for the amount of product that needed to be in them. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing my finished product in the display case and seeing the faces of customers approving of my hard work."
bad,"I got the opportunity to work all shifts and I rather work from lunch to dinner so around 10am-6pm. Unfortunately, they have this horrible schedule that you always need to go by. If you don't give them your days you need off or don't clear them on your availability then you're screwed and you need to find someone to cover you right away. Scheduling is important but it is a real shame when you give the managers a clear 4 day availability and they only schedule you two hours a week. So for a high schooler, its a good work experience to have and the discounts are good. But you only get them when you work there! NOT when you're off. Super fast paced and the food is good. But don't be me, a mom with kids because the paychecks wont even cover your gas for a week."
bad,"There are lots of great people in Panera with great vision and great intentions.  There are some very very serious echo chamber issues in the leadership of the bakery operations, which is the department I work for."
bad,Neglected to promote correct type of people into positions of power resulting in poor teamwork and a crew that had little respect for the people in power. This created a toxic working environment.
bad,When I first started everything was fine had little to no issues well other than the hi weekly pay. However after a few months passed the store went under new management which forced alot of us together those of us who have not seen eye to eye  that was great the issue was though there was new management who did not want to hear a word of what we were saying all we were was pawns in there chess board and we could not move just pickup and go living paycheck to paycheck and getting paid by weekly
bad,"I typically work a minimum of 10 hours a day and have worked in excess of 15 hours semi-regularly. In all the time I have worked, almost everything was self developed. I was shown how to do most things that I know once or maybe twice and then had to develop my own skills and talents without any sort of guidance or feedback."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"I was given a lot of hours, I also covered for a lot of people who called off. Co-workers can be unreliable, which leads to a more stressful day. The management is good, but they aren't good with their wages."
bad,This was a great job when I was a high school student but that is about how far that goes. Definitely not enough to live off of and work way to hard to be stressed about paying my bills.
bad,it a great place to work if you can get early morning shift and have a set scheduled but the management is like working with kids that don't help out.
bad,The food industry is not for me. I get paid well but dont like the job. Alway's worked weekends and the people who work there are not very nice. Wouldnt recommend it unless you were desperate .
bad,"Looking back at my time spent at Panera, I did enjoy my time because I loved my coworkers. However, the management lacks and fails constantly to keep up with inventory and promote raises. I was one of their best workers at the time and worked for almost two years and did not receive one raise. Not even 15 cents. This was extremely discouraging as other workers would be there for six months and already get a raise. Some were even hired at a higher wage than me. They would be cashiers also, which is easier than people working on line, prep, and dish. They never trained me on cash and did not respect me; i had fun times, but I would never go back."
bad,"Panera is just a company that is just doing too much and cant keep up with itself. Some of the locations are great, but the higher volume stores are drowning and it seems as if Corporate just keeps adding more things into the mix. It makes a very stressful and impossible environment."
bad,"There are three aspects of delivery at Panera that make the position unprofitable for anyone that pays for their own vehicle. One, you only take one order at a time. Two, the delivery fee is high and all of it goes to Panera. Three, the base wage is low. That said even in the best circumstances, like a very busy weekday lunch rush, you cannot make what is needed. Occasional automotive maintenance and repairs cost money, sometimes a lot. It only makes sense as a small side hustle and even then you could make much more doing the same thing somewhere else."
bad,Management at panera bread was so unorganized.There wasn't any communication so everything would be a mess not organized because no one communicated. Didn't feel as though we were working as a team.
bad,"While Panera can't be beat when it comes to pay and compensation, the hours are long, the environment is hot, the demands on time are strenuous, and management can be dense at the most inopportune moments. It is, however, one of the most satisfying jobs I've worked, people aside."
bad,No manager is on the same page and nothing is ever good enough. You are underpaid and overworked. We are understaffed always because people constantly call off and managers don't bother to find people to cover their shifts. Managers rarely help. Don't recommend.
bad,This was a great experience for someone that's in high school or first years of college. Flexible and they were great about asking me how school was going
bad,"Management was poorly handled."
bad,Panera Bread is a decent place to work for a teenager. As you get older its harder to maintain decent hours since you do not get a set schedule. The management for this store is not very professional.
bad,Panera is a well oriented place to work. It helps you gain a lot of skills with working with different types of people .. I love working at panera bread .
bad,"A typical day at work is just going and setting up the line, getting the store ready, working through lunch, restocking, and cleaning. Working at Panera Bread  is very enjoyable! The most enjoyable part to me would be during lunch rush, being busy and going fast to me is great."
bad,Management is really bad with communication with fellow management and their associates. Most days associates do not receive a break because the store is constantly understaffed and if you work in the drive thru you will most likely never receive help from other members of the staff. Managers will give associates new titles but no pay raise with titles or benefits besides being forced to do extra work for the same amount of pay. Some senior staff is paid less than coming on associates. You only get a 70% discount and are not allowed to take food at the end of a shift even if they force you to work through your break.
bad,Not much to say but they didn't care about all the hard work you do. I was sick and coughing and sneezing they wanted to make me work the bakery counter. Hated it
bad,"While working as a Panera Bread Accociate, your job will be high stress and lots of moving around on your feet. If you don't do well under pressure, I would say this job might not be one for you."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"The employees are all wonderful hard workers. And there are a few managers/supervisors who are considerate and responsible. I would have stayed if it wasn't for a few poisonous managers/supervisors. Hypocrisy, favoritism and gossip is NOT appropriate in the work place, ESPECIALLY from a manager or supervisor. I will not return there for work until said manager/supervisor is no longer working there."
bad,"A typical day was busy, hectic, and and often unpredictable. Management was typically in the back office or out of sight when they were most needed. Employees frequently called out and were rarely reprimanded for it. No sense of teamwork."
bad,i liked working at panera even with drama it was better because managers were able to listen and deal with issues although a month of being unpaid forced me to look into other work due to a transfer i made resulted in me quiting i had to go to corporate until they fixed anything
bad,"Same general tasks every day, customer service is unpredictable. "
bad,"Starts out slow and picks up for lunch, management team is great, learned food safety, most enjoyable is the customers, the job was great, great place."
bad,"Opening bakery, ring up people, package items, I learned how to be patient with people, co workers are the ones that make my day go by faster, hardest part is dealing with rude customers, I enjoy my co workers."
bad,As long as you do your job and you do it well yor can expect to have a long term job. The Mgmt. team I work with is great and plenty of opportunity for advancement. Mostly do to the high rate of turn over caused by the other three factors.
bad,"- fun workplace"
bad,"I love Panera. I love what they stand for and all of their values. They are supposed to be very organized and regulated. I am sure if you work in a district that follows the protocols and procedures, everything works very well. I worked in a location/district where there was not support, they did not follow all of the protocols, and things were chaotic on a daily basis as a result. When you come on board, you are told all of these wonderful things about how supported you will be and how much help you will have. NOT TRUE in my instance. I was not given the proper training or tools to do the jobs i was expected to do then consistently reprimanded for incorrectly doing things i was never properly trained to do. There were LOTS of inconsistencies like this involving what company policy was vs what i was being told to do. Because we were so grossly understaffed in management, i was working 60 hours a week on a 40 hour a week salary. I was willing to work with them to make the situation better for me and everyone else. the decision to leave was easy when i brought everything up to my area director and was treated like a crazy person. Like i was supposed to be able to do the job of 3 (yes three people!) in a 40 hour work week even though we both know other cafes have several people to do all that work. i had had enough at that point and not once did i ever feel like i had the tools/training like they promised."
bad,"First I should say, I work for a Panera franchise, not corporate.  So I'm really reviewing Blue Ridge Bread, located in Virginia.  I was hired as an Assistant Manager and after 5 1/2 years, was never able to move up.  This is not a competency issue on my part, as I know I'm capable beyond many of the others who were promoted before me.  This leads me to believe that there were a lot of company politics involved, which can be the case in any company. However, it has become acceptable for the General Manager to adjust employees hours (taking away hours from them), so that he won't catch as much grief for overtime.  Also, as managers, we are scheduled to work 50 hours/week and my boss says that this is a minimum.  He expects us to stay and work extra hours each day and come in on our days off just like he does.  His bosses lack anything related to people skills and push for unrealistic results, month after month.  We are expected to push the hourly employees to their breaking point until they leave and we just replace them.  They are barely paid over minimum wage, and are expected to perform at a much higher level, with little to no appreciation.  The benefits are good enough to keep me there until I can find something comparable, but I have become well beyond burned out working for this company, under this management, and the turnover (associate and management) reflects that I'm not the only one who feels that way."
bad,"Panera Bread is a company that, while efficiently managed, lacks any connection to it's employees. Often one can get worked over by shady practices such as ""2 hour breaks."" One can also have schedule change without warning and can be sent home and lose hours simply because the restaurant isn't busy enough."
bad,I learned a lot about time management at this company. Being on pointe and having fun while doing your job is a difficult thing to accomplish. This job also helped me expand my bread baking abilities.
bad,"For a typical day at Panera, it was moderately to heavily busy. Many times we were very under-staffed, which isn't fair to anyone. There was always something to do. I learned loyalty and respect from my fellow employees and from a large amount of amazing customers. I improved on my customer communication skills and service."
bad,"Your are expected to memorize the enitre menu including allergens and the history behind each ingredient for very little money. My entire first week of work, I spent on the computer taking an online class about coffee and then was expected to just know the register and how to run all of the equipment, there was no one to shadow and no leadership. I was attending college courses and made my availability clear when I applied for the position and yet was only scheduled during my class times after repeatedly talking to each manager. There is no cohesiveness or communication among managers."
bad,The job wasn't hard except for when they expect you to fill many positions at once. The management was sometimes disorganized and kept employees switching positions. The customers are OK for the most part but you get a lot of attitude from them too. The other employees were okay. You can get fired for anything really so be careful if you decide to work here.
bad,"A typical day at Saint Louis Bread Company is never the same. Some days are really slow and some are really busy. I've learned to become a better person and expand my skills to better help others. The management could better better and the communication is very poor, same for co-workers. I just feel like there is no room for advancement."
bad,Management was terrible. There were some great people who worked there sure. But the manager at the waterworks location was awful. He would make you keep working after throwing up and expected too much. He was very rude and would swear a lot too. Overall you were treated like an imbecile there and I would never go back.
bad,"I consistently displayed strong multitask skills, ability to receive and apply directions in a fast timely manner, Ability to work under pressure constantly"
bad,Corporate offices don't offer stores enough labor hours and/or staff to accomplish expected goals.
bad,"The pay was $18/hr and I was averaging 50/ week. They pay over time.  Delivering dough to stores,  wasn't to bad,  because the trailers are cold and it's a great way to stay cool in the summer. I loved everyone I worked with and there was a positive atmosphere. Only problem is the plant manager loves to throw people under the bus.  I've seen allot of people get fired for small things and eventually i was fired. I talked to someone who just quit recently and they said all new people at plant and there's no one there I would know,  now except the plant manager."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,This job has its up and downs. the management at the store i was wasn't the best but it had its moments it was fair. This place doesnt have the best pay roll ever. i started of at $8 per hour and i was certified in every position in the restaurant and was an associate trainer and still stayed at the same payroll untill a year later i only got a .25 cent raise while i was in my senor year of high school i was still putting in over time by 5-10 hours.
bad,"Overall fun place to work but if you need benefits this is not the place to be. Hours are flexible, good training but the compensation is not very good unless you know someone or have been there a very very long time. Typical day is like any restaurant you either cashier or work the food line. A llittle tedious but that's how it goes."
bad,"Typical day was taking customers orders. I learned more about the ""food"" industry. Management was uptight. Co-workers were typical, unfriendly people. Hardest part was non-stop working, even when no customers were there. Most enjoyable was giving the leftover food at the end of the night to donations."
bad,"I clock in and start to stock up my work areas. I check what's out and replace. I flip containers and put new labels on. Say hi to co-workers. Management is ok, one gets on my nerves in particular. Hardest point is trying to close and clean everything and restock, and put away food, when people come in late and order more food. So frustrating, but part of the job. Most enjoyable part is clocking out and leaving everything behind."
bad,"Panera can be fun at times, but it can also be rough at times to. the pay and benefits are decent, and the hours are sometimes tough."
bad,"This job won't pay you for how much they ask you to do. It's a customers always right policy and you will deal with a lot of entitled people. Almost every position sucks, but if your panera has a drive thru that's probably the more fun one."
bad,The management was not great which greatly impacted my working experience. Have there been better managers I would have worked there for much longer than I did.
bad,"Panera just is a temporary job for me. One of the rules in the rule book is .. we don't hire jerks. Yet, everytime someone comes in some or all of the managers gang up and have a lot to say. It's very unprofessional. All of the managers have really bad attitudes and expect 100% from you while they give 50%. They will always tell you about what you did wrong but will never ever say anything when you do great or have a survey come in. You have to wear a hat which sucks and the benefits suck."
bad,Panera has a hard time promoting black women. You can work for them for years and not be promoted. The management team is always so sloppy. The bakers are rude the only time things are enforced is after bread bash.
bad,Panera gets really busy its a hot spot for lunch and dinner. It was always busy in the restaurant. which made for a stressful workday with upper management becoming overwhelmed.
bad,"Honestly, I didn't like my job but The people were great to work with "
bad,"My entire experience working at Panera was completely blotched by the one area that lacked greatness. This area was management. The people I worked with were wonderful people, the entire working environment was fast-paced but pretty enjoyable. I enjoyed every aspect of working at Panera. The only reason why I eventually chose to leave was due to poor leadership and communication skills by management. The culture they created in the work space was not professional as well. There was a sort of “tattle-tell” technique used by most of the Assistant Managers, in order for them to gain the likes of our General Manager. I found this culture very unprofessional. Another problem was that the General Manager was known to show favoritism towards certain individuals and treat others completely wrong and with utter disrespect, even if they did their job well. Meanwhile, the others who were “favorites” pretty much could do whatever they pleased and break employee rules. I found this very wrong, and unfair. Certain individuals had to adhere to employee rules while others did not, for the sole reason that our manager liked them more and talked to them more than others. It almost seemed as if these people in management abused their roles as managers, and used their authority to demean and disrespect others that they thought to be “below” them. It was all sow  wrong to me. Due to this culture created by the management team at Panera, I chose to leave. I was not going to allow management to talk down to me, demean me, and disrespect me in front of customers and my fellow coworkers. The hours were"
bad,"Panera was my first job ever. My location is extremely busy almost all the time, making work very unenjoyable due to the constant work with little to no breaks. Management is also extremely inconsistent. One night you could make yourself 10 sandwiches with the chill manager and the next you’d get written up for eating a bag of chips by the strict manager. The one thing I really liked about working there, though, was my coworkers. They were absolutely awesome and supportive. Overall, I wouldn’t recommend working at Panera."
bad,"This store had one of the highest turnovers. They will keep you as long as you do the work and show up for your shifts, but the tendency is to overwork their employees, not pay attention to availability sheets, and really there is zero communication between managers."
bad,"When I first started working at Panera it was a good time. There were a lot of people who were very good at their job that have recently left, including managers. As of late there has been a lot of turnover and some questionable management decisions."
bad,Panera is a great company I enjoyed working for them my hrs was just not right for me it was 4am hard time getting my kids on the bus for school but if I could've change hrs I would still be there
bad,"Working at Panera was alright, the pay was general and people were nice, but it was extremely repetitive and annoying to work. You generally make food, salads & sandwiches, and close up at the end of the day. It get really busy during rushes."
bad,"At the time I was working here there was horrible management, with one of the managers constantly talking down to all the employees. Didn’t find it very kind or appropriate"
bad,"I have worked here for several years now and it has gotten worse with almost every passing year.  This place has so many obnoxious and unnecessary rules that you will not find at another establishment which have recently become much more heavily enforced.  It is no longer a fun environment to work in, it is a toxic environment.  The only reason that people remain employees for so long is the fact that nobody else can match what they pay us."
bad,"I was a delivery driver. You drive around to houses and businesses delivering food. Then you come back and brew coffee, help with dishes, serve food, unless you have another order on the screen. I learned time management. The workplace culture is for extroverted people who like to talk to people. Nothing is hard. The hardest part of the job for me was dealing with immature millennials  and management. You could say the most enjoyable part of the job is that nothing is serious."
bad,I do like working for this company I always have something to do there's not one moment you stand around and do nothing you're always on the go you have to be multi-talented and speed of service is required. Time goes fast soon as you know it you're going home.
bad,The company has been going downhill over the past couple years. No teamwork or appreciation. I enjoy the flexibility and simplicity but otherwise it’s not a very friendly place to work.
bad,this company was ok to work for its a lot of work on any manager and employees must have that I can do this factor in your life. Lots of knowledge to be gain while employed with this company. Hardest part of the job was getting orders made and out on the specified time frames. Most enjoyable part of the job was meeting friends!
bad,"i loved the food at Panera bread and the staff was amazing but i did not like the slow pace of the job nor, the management. i learned alot about customer service and patients with customers."
bad,"Drama, poor management, no respect of availability that you give, you end up doing 2 or more jobs because there are no consequences for coworkers just standing around/not doing their job. If you need a job badly, go for it - but I still wouldn't reccomend working here."
bad,Learning all the ropes and the first few weeks were fun but it got to a point where everything was become repetitive. Rushes and super busy as well as stressful. Managers become easily irritated with customers which causes them to give that attitude right back to you . Discounts were 65% off a meal that you could only use once 1 hour prior to your shift to 1 hour after.
bad,"A lot of the work there is good and not too hard to handle. The workers there are very friendly and likable. Working there for a long time can start to feel routine, but that's the job. the only thing that I had a problem with was financially. I was given empty promises of raises and promotions for my hard work and long employment."
bad,"Poor pay mixed with poor work life balance are not a great combination and do not make happy helpful employees. Prepare to work when you're not in a store if you're a manager as well, thats expected of you. Everyone from Managers to cashiers has the same expression and demeanor of ""I have to get out of here"". if you like working in an escape room and love to be yelled at by angry customers well this is the job for you."
bad,environment in the food industry is very hard. everyday isn't the same. would train you in other areas of the store if they feel you are ready. only bad thing was management.
bad,must be skilled at fast pace work. the better and harder you work the more you will be scheduled. make speed and accuracy your friend. this is a great job to get your foot in the door. if you are in school be careful not to over work yourself. focus mostly on school.
bad,"My managers were all amazing people however the panera I worked at was not corporate therefore we were not allowed to accept tips, the pay isn’t worrh the hassle."
bad,it was an experience learned alot i actually liked working there but thing happen .they just really need to get on top of hiring enough people to be on the line ...
bad,Panera is a great job to have if you have not had one before because its a team setting and helps associates learn to work many different jobs at once.
bad,"The company as a whole is charitable and good to employees. The location I worked at in particular went through two awful general managers in two years. The first was stealing from the donation funds and would clock in for an opening shift and leave for hours while staying clocked in. The second denied payment to employees who she didn't like and would cut their hours, schedule them to clean drains as their only work for the week or both. She also went through the books and lied about the number of hours she worked."
bad,working at Panera as an baker in the beginning was fun and enjoyable. After a year the job became boring an I became restless. Management was fine until new management was hired and became impossible work with them.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,GM favor people and is cheap. You can be loyal and they will still do you dirty. They pick and choose who they want to favor. Make you feel like your nothing.
bad,I think the store is completely on organized and has poor management.  People have you do their jobs and  you are surrounded by completely rude customers.
bad,"They do not pay well for the amount of hours worked. Great management, just not the best at taking care of their people. Do not get breaks as a manager even for a 16 hour day."
bad,Overall it was a great experience but the one I was working at had a lot of drama and some of the people there would help the one's they know. I mean I wouldn't go back.
bad,"The work is easy. Just the management is horrible. I was fired for giving my opinion on a manager who was being very rude and disrespectful towards me. Now I am currently a single mom with no job, searching really hard for a job. They don't care for you."
bad,Very busy work environment. It is easy to advance within the company; I was promoted to an Associate Trainer within my second month of working at Panera Bread.
bad,I don't blame the  management for how panera is ran I feel that it's the higher ups that's don't give the  management  what they need to do there job.
bad,"It started off good and well, even became the ""golden boy"" of my GM, but over time, the job lost it's shine, along with the GM. I did essentially everything that was asked of me with a smile on my face, but that turned into taking advantage of me. The GM constantly cut peoples hours if you did something to annoy her."
bad,"When i first began working there it was hard but i got the hang of it. The amount of tasks you have to complete are ridiculous, and its for such little pay.on top of that, because I messed up and went over hours they have only been giving me one day a week. its not professional, they pick favorites it's a stressful and depressing work space.over all it was nice but they are people that say one thing and do the other. the way the devise the hours are deplorable, one person had 1 or 2 days while other will have 5 or 6. In conclusion, I don't like working with those people or for that company."
bad,"The coworkers can be cool people to work with, but there is alot of drama between everyone. Management would stand around on their phones during a lunch rush. Don't get too adjusted to the schedule as the managers almost never let you off on time- they'd let employees off an average of 45 minutes after your schedule says, you have to constantly remind them of changes to your schedule, and they get easily irritated with any questions you may have. It's pretty much a glorified fast food job where you serve overpriced food and get lectured if you're not fast enough even though they're constantly understaffed."
bad,"If you're just starting off in the work force then this job is a good place to get your feet wet. After a while though, and if you're trying to support yourself, the meager pay, rude customers, and various other cons no longer seem worth it."
bad,"Didn't work there long. Company is always hiring. The Management is kind of pushy, and closing is always a hassle. They give away their left over food at the end of the day."
bad,"I worked there for almost two years and never really enjoyed it. It was always so stressful and the managers would always be pacing around and would yell at you if you did something wrong, even if you just started. Very little room for upper movement."
bad,"Poor management team, Some locations have strong teams with very good routines. the management team and coaching can make or break a team. A lot of micromanaging because the buisness is very complex. A lot of rules to follow. It was a very corporate build."
bad,"They Provide you with a lot of work that deserves at least $9 and up but instead still pays $8.25. The General Manager has favoritism, if you don't let her control your life as she pleases; she can get very unprofessional."
bad,"The work/life balance is absolutely awful here"
bad,"My direct supervisor was wonderful but I did not care for the district manager.  Restaurant Management is very stressful.  I had a great crew and enjoyed the fast pace, but the position was just not for me.  I am a very hard worker and pride myself on having an usually strong work ethic, but I just did not enjoy going in each day.  Hospitality management is not for everyone!"
bad,Working here was the worst. This was my very first job and the management was terrible. I would work every position. I really don't have much else to say about this place.
bad,"Great costumer service experience"
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"i feel the overnight staff  get  the majority of the workload in nyc locations which are very busy. Also, once i asked for a transfer to a different store, i was shorted hours for 8+ a day to 5/hrs a day. Wasnt worth it"
bad,"A typical day at work was always fine for me. I enjoyed my work as well as my customers. Customers made the job fun and the environment was almost always relaxed. There was seldom a time I found the work to be difficult. I was being paid minimum wage, but I genuinely did not mind. The main problem I had was that management more often than not exerted a strong sense of immaturity in many things that they did. On the occasion that coworkers or myself made mistakes, management was also fairly unprofessional about the manner, embarrassing and raising their voice at associates in front of customers."
bad,"When I first started working at Panera Bread, I actually really liked it. As time went on, it proved to be somewhere that pushed their employees past their limits in some situations. A few times, their employees safety came last, unfortunately."
bad,"A typical day at work for me was to come in and usually be instantly put in a bad mood. For the first 5 months I was put on dining room and dishes which was made for two people but 95% of the time I was doing it by myself. I would ask to be trained on something else and was always told it would happen but never did. I was trained on line (making food) maybe 5-6 days and then they never put me back on it. They finally trained me to be a cashier and do barista which was where I wanted to be in the first place."
bad,"• Cash register operation "
bad,It was a fun workplace. But They don't want to give us the raises and I am looking for a better opportunity to challenge me.
bad,"This is an okay job if you are in the fast food business, but they have poor benefits."
bad,"I met some great people working at Panera, including my best friend who is amazing! The customers were great but the managment was so bad. I also worked at a Panera in Mechanicsville and I love working there, managment was amazing! The virginia beach stores, not so much. Every manager I worked for was two faced and horrible at there jobs. The best part of working here was meeting great customer and making decent money."
bad,Poor management and working conditions rude to their employees yelling is constant at the younger employees poor drive thru times and poor team work minimum communication
bad,A typical day at work involved me starting work immediately with no breathing room and I ended up staying later than scheduled most of the time. The schedule was determined by how well the managers liked you and nothing else
bad,It is a good working environment if everything is put back for the next day and no one miss places tools which is a common issue. Lack of drive from most other associates that I see working there.
bad,"I sent 3 years there. And it was ok. They didn’t offer me much room to grow. The people there weren’t always the nicest, and they didn’t offer me enough money to stay."
bad,The people at this panera sucked the managers showed favoritism and it was a hostile work environment I will never work there again and I don’t suggest you do either
bad,Management does not care about well being if employees.... will have to travel to cafes 30 to 40 minutes away from your home..... will schedule on dates that you made very clear you can not work.... Job does not have seniority. Does not train properly and expect you to work miracles.... Panera is a awesome company but poor management is making the company go down
bad,The job has it challenges and management cares about them selves. We are all over worked get paid little 12.75 isn’t enough to get by on when asked to take a day off there’s a big problem
bad,"I cant really say i enjoyed working here because everyday i would drag myself to go to work. I did not feel welcome nor wanted. I was just there because i needed the job. However, it was very hard wanting to work there"
bad,I would not recommend anyone to work for Panera they expect so much from you 12 plus hr days no help for upper management no development I would not recommend to any one to work at Panera
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,working at panera has been a challenge. i work at a recently opened location and we didn’t have the right amount of staff opening  through my struggles i have become a better harder working employ
bad,"Overall, it was very stressful, and difficult. They were very lenient with my hours due to school and family situations, but it was a very demanding, especially in the back, it was like a whole other world. I did not like my experience there at all."
bad,They don't give me enough hours and I have requested more hours.  My coworkers are also not the nicest to each other or to me.  I would like to find a new opportunity and wanting to try different things.
bad,It is a fast pace stressful environment where there is no consistency with management. Everything there is always changing which adds onto the stress. Simply a terrible place to work
bad,"Management focuses only on what works for themselves and the schedule. Managers frequently arrived after the associates for the opening shift and were unavailable when you needed them. Despite workplace harassment from one or two employees on a regular basis, these actions were overlooked for a long time and brushed aside."
bad,"When I started I used to love working there. Some of my coworkers really did feel like family and I honestly probably did see them more than my own family. But due to a number of reasons I basically broke under all the stress that was there and from being burnt out in just a year. It got to be unbearable. Problems with communication between everyone, people who are good at their jobs having to do work that some lazy employees couldn’t bother doing, understaffing due to company budget cuts, and regional managers putting way too much pressure on the managers who then put it on us. It just turned into a nightmare. I actually would get nightmares from working there. It just all got so bad and toxic. No one wanted to come to work anymore. No one wanted to be there. Even some of the costumers could feel it. It was hard to leave but it really took a toll on my mental health. After I left it felt like a weight was lifted. I’ve been happier. I miss some of my coworkers but that’s pretty much all I miss."
bad,This place is terrible as a work environment in Hopkinsville Kentucky  I would never recommend to anyone because the managers are so full of themselves and never seem to get their heads out of their but
bad,"Overall, the management was awful, nor was the place clean. Constantly got yelled at for things that were not my fault. I did twice the work without getting paid for it."
bad,"When I acquired my job at Panera Bread I was excited and the managers seemed eager to have me on board. However, I was told by one of the managers that the higher you went up in the company, the more demanding and unrewarding the job became."
bad,If you need a minimum wage job that is flexible with hours then I recommend it. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers and management puts a lot of pressure on employees.
bad,When starting out at Panera Bread I was learning how to maintain dinning and coffees. Within the first month of being there I also learned how to prepare food in the morning and to do the dishes also. Prepping the food in the morning is essential and they put me in charge of prepping the five days that I work. It’s crucial to finish on time because if not the workers won’t have food to make there products. There is no cutting corners either because later they will run out of something. Then they will have to take their time to prep out more.
bad,"Not really the ideal job...low pay & not many raises. You’ll do a lot of work throughout your shift. Management does give you off all the days you request off which is good. Overall, all the managers are amazing. It’s just the overall job culture that’s stressful (& low pay). Not very good benefits"
bad,"I was promised a lot during my interview only to find out that most of it will not be provided now that I have been here for a few months. There is no holiday pay and no accrual of vacation or sick days. They are VERY cheap with labor and people will be cut off the schedule even when it's necessary for them to stay and help the Cafe. Something specific to my cafe is  management is absolutely horrible(excluding 1). They pick favorites, are very lazy and rude to customers, blame you when they make schedules that don't work and are upset when you can't come in on your days off.  Don't work here."
bad,"For a business that complains about how understaffed they are i find it to be quite interesting that they are always cutting people's hours. I worked at the one in Irondequoit so maybe people in different markets have different or better experiences than i did. I'm constantly having to beg for hours or beg to be cross trained, my needs aren't being met at this job so I'm deciding to look for somewhere else that has reasonable management and fair distribution of hours."
bad,The managers pick favorites and if you’re not a favorite you’re stuck in the same position/get the bad tasks. Some people never got out of the dining room from the moment they were hired/quit. You get asked to stay longer past your scheduled times a lot and work long shifts. Call outs are common and the rest of the staff has to suffer from them
bad,"Even though I had worked there for such a short time, it was productive at first. But then everyone started to get less and less hours. After that, everything became so unorganized."
bad,They hired me at the end of the school.uear and ultimately cut my hours to nothing. I have not worked in the past 3 weeks. I was not aware that my hours would be cut.to nothing.
bad,"The day includes setting up the bakery and lobby, displaying bagels and pastries, greet guests and take orders, fulfill drink and smaller orders, and complete transactions. Workplace culture changed like the weather. It was inconsistent and managements cared more about being employees friends than properly training and checking for follow through. The hardest part of the job were the cliques. The best part of the job was seeing the regular customers."
bad,"Policy changes were ineffective and a waste of company resources. Store management was strong, but cooperate leadership was non existence. However, got to brush up on my Spanish so it was a plus."
bad,"This was the most disorganized and rude work environment I have ever worked for. Turnover was SO fast, and every time I went in there were people that were new. The managers did not communicate their wants, and they forget to fire people. They gave me a .13 cent raise once."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"I have worked at Panera Bread for just over a year now and already know over 15 or more people I once knew have quit because of the horrible management, pay, and inconsistency of this work place. It sickening how useless some of the managers make you feel no matter how much you try. Managers pick favorites and if you are not on the favorites list you will most definitely feel left out."
bad,"On the plus side:"
bad,It is a line cook job. Great first job. You will most certainly learn how to handle pressure. It is just like every line cook job I have worked. Its not bad
bad,Working here was good for building customer service skills. That is all. This job was good if you wanted to relocate geographically. No opportunities to gain higher job titles
bad,"Constantly made mistakes on my schedule after they were given my availability. I was a very active high school student which they knew and still would scheduled me outside of availability. For example, on days i would have track meets or meetings even though they were given my sports schedule of knew well i advance that i wouldn’t be able to come in. management wasn’t the best."
bad,Really horrible management. They will leave you out to dry you have to figure out a lot for yourself. The people are cool and its a calm environment but not recommended for first job.
bad,"Closing duties take forever to complete. Food is average, managers are dirty, and customers can be impatient. I would not want to work here ever again."
bad,"Bakery ops side of Panera can be incredibly fun at times, but in the long run it is not worth what the job requires of you. In order to be a night baker with Panera you have to mostly give up living a normal life, but the shift differential isn't enough to make it worth any kind of long term commitment."
bad,"The work is easy. Some of the shift managers are disrespectful and must be put in their place, their one shift manager that would try to make you do some task that you are not paid for but i ignore. They do have favorite employees. no one has a problem with me i think."
bad,"This job is stressful if you are a student, just because they don't really work around your schedule. If you are working closing, you will get out around 10:30- 11 latest, which isn't convenient if you're a morning student."
bad,"Panera was sometimes slow, but there was always a lunch rush. They had very few workers so this made it difficult when things were busy. Management discussed the work of other employees to associates which I found quite inappropriate. Some of the employees were great people. Most of them quit because management was so bad, so they had to hire several new employees. The workplace during a slow day was relaxed and tolerable, however on a busy day, the managers became irritable and the associates became a bit hostile."
bad,Manager and Assistant Manager are bias and don't know what they are doing. It's hard to communicate with them because no one wants to do anything about a problem or they deny it was ever brought to there attention.
bad,"Poor management and regional leadership. Often pressured to perform tasks without support or against training. As a catering personnel, there were issues with how the company presented what it did and what actually happened at times."
bad,"Direct management is helpful and caring but corporate is terrible. They don't understand the life of the every day associate at all and expect so much from the people at the bottom getting paid barely over minimum wage. Frustrating, but is in accordance with how it is in America these days."
bad,I did the work of 3 people with no acknowledgement or pay increase. Kind of a gross place to see behind the scenes. The other employees were this companies redeeming quality.
bad,"A typical day at work includes clocking in and washing hands to prepare to make food. Line working is very fast paced and easy to get the hang of if you’re good at memorization. If you’re not fast enough, coworkers get annoyed. Cleaning up the kitchen was a daily task done at the end of every day and was probably my favorite part. Hardest part was most definitely line working."
bad,My biggest complaint with panera is that employees were not fired due to cleanliness. I worked with people who did not wash their hands despite constantly touching their faces. It was disgusting.
bad,"I never got enough hours, granted I was currently in high school at the time but hardly enough to pay my mother back for my first car. Even after I graduated I never got enough hours. It's fast paced at that location so you have to be constantly on your feet."
bad,"Great to work there on the rare occasion you work with people who know what they are doing and do it without much complaining.  Very cliquey workplace, even amongst managers; you won't be listened to if you aren't in their clique.  Managers also avoid irritated customers for as long as they can, often telling you to ask a different manager to handle the issue.  I like receiving yearly progress reports and I'm not sure if it's a manager thing or Panera Bread thing, but I never received an in-person progress report in my years working there."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,the employees are great and also the discounts but some of the managers are pretty irresponsible and professional and the pay is pretty bad especially for all the work you have to do and also you barely get raises.
bad,"Super busy most of the time, keeps you on your toes. Management can be complete office dwellers. Associates are mostly great though, making friends here is easily done. If you get promoted, there's tons of room for moving up. Plus, free food."
bad,"I worked there during high school.  One summer I contracted mono and was out for a month.  I notified the managers when I got sick, but they never relayed it to the GM.  Needless to say, got fired because my managers didn't notify her even though I had a doctors note."
bad,"From my experiance, working at Panera has it’s pros and cons. It is a good starter job, but they are slow to promote individuals. Also at the end of the night the left over bakery items were donated to charity."
bad,I have been the best that i could be and i don't feel as thought i was being awarded as i should have been. I was working 10-12 hour days with no break and no time to eat. As an assistant manager i helped my customers and employees
bad,"You will meet good people here, make lots of friends, but I can promise that the management will be horrible and likely be the reason you quit. The stores are very sanitary"
bad,I loved the concept of Panera Bread but was not pleased by the system. It has a lot of details and it may overwhelm a new hire and demotivate the passion.
bad,"at first the job was great. It was a fun atmosphere with fun employees, but as time went on, things became more stressful. The management kept changing hands, so the staff started to become more weary and stressed out with all the new changes constantly happening. a lot of the staff started to bicker amongst each other and tension was high. It became more and more a job I could not continue on with."
bad,The management had favorites and they would receive the best hours and times of day to work. The customers seemed to always be angry with the prices or the food being messed up as well.
bad,"You don’t get paid as much as you should for the work you do. Management has a tendency to make things personal. Scheduling, however, is pretty consistent. You get paid time off after you accumulate it. Even get sick time, which is great."
bad,working there was a terrible experience. most customers had no patience and respect. the managers would always micromanage the entire staff. breaks were barely doable for us employees. Don't work for them.
bad,Very fast paced environment but lacked strong management and the will to get many employees to listen and do their job properly as a team. Many times jobs were stuck onto one person.
bad,"I understand some people were meant to be in a fast-paced environment, and I have thrived in one before Panera bread, but for a new employee, the expectations were high."
bad,"Lots of internal drama within the workplace, managers switch out often with little consistency between them. Workers are not excited to be there and don't really care about the quality of their work."
bad,"Panera never gave me my job schedule on time, I had to keep calling and texting the managers for it. I wasn't given enough hours when I needed them. Always calling in for someone to fill in for the day."
bad,Panera Bread has been an interesting roller coaster over the last five years. The currently seem to be in an identity crisis by trying to be everything at once and not doing a great job at any aspect of it.
bad,"Okay, the managers at the Monroeville PA Panera Bread seriously suck. Got little to no training and then they expected me to know everything the next day. Sit on their phones all the time, and barely help. Called in sick one day and got yelled at because I couldn't find anyone to cover my shift yet I didn't know a single person or have their numbers. Totally never working there again, nor I recommend working at this company. Managers basically made me watch other people and hope for the best. Yeah, no."
bad,"A scam, bad food, bad prices, everything comes in bags. certified microwaver. Not healthy at all, I dont understand the appeal to eating this food, it's not good"
bad,"The company potential is there, some stores might be great, mine was not. I always gave 110% but that wasn't always noticed. I knew more about the store than some managers above me. I would get half the amount of hours to coworkers who would only give maybe 40% to their job, but just happened to be friends with the manager. After complaining about these issues and nothing changed, I felt unappreciated so I left."
bad,no one knew what they were doing even the people in charge. everyone was rude to each other. they work people way too hard. they ask you to do tasks that arent even your station.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"Management was poor and they were not very forgiving with sudden schedule changes.  Customers treated me very poorly, and managers did not do anything about it.  I had many negative encounters with very unkind customers"
bad,Great company. Very innovative.  They didn't care enough about cleanliness.  The district manager. (Joint venture partner) was clueless. She was scared to make a difference and not very committed
bad,Many long hours and under terrible management all the time. Constantly forgotten about with my shifts.................................................
bad,I found the lack of opportunities to grow in the company very  unappealing. The managers of the company did not make the employees close in a fast paced manner and almost every time the bake and pan up person arrived there would be trash and other items in the work area.
bad,"What usually happens on a typical day is, you'll have your rushes which makes time go by fast, but then it'd get slow and you start to clean, and more people come rushing in. What I learned from working there is I don't really want to work in food service if the managements going to be like that. The hardest part of the job was, some of the coworkers got too stressed out, and when they got stressed out, so did I. But the most enjoyable part of the job was when you worked with the people who are friendly and like to have fun; it made things a lot ,more fun and simpler."
bad,"I am currently working at Panera Bread. I meet many different types of people every day along with maintaining relationships regular customers. "
bad,"I left Panera bread because of the lack of communication and management, management would ""walk all over you."" Pretty much just use you. "
bad,Panera could be better in many aspects of treating their workers with more respect and patience. I was treated horribly as a worker here. Some of my old co-workers were horrible.
bad,"I did okay for myself here, but there was never much room to move up in the company besides management. The company does not provide fairness to all employees and does not provide further training when someone is falling behind"
bad,"My experience with Panera Bread has taught me a lot about the work force. It has taught me time management, management skills, food safety, and lots of other things that I had not known before or from my other jobs."
bad,Work at Panera bread is usually good but they were very unorganized and dirty they slacked with their workers but overall it was an ok job
bad,Panera Bread was very unfair and the management was bad and overwhelming. One of the managers there would be so pushy and rude and would send people home just because they wouldn't do exactly what she wanted and was very unappreciative of our work.
bad,Working at Panera was a good experience. Panera just needs improvement on management and how they treat their workers. Panera has great customer service but poor attitudes toward associates.
bad,"Disorganized run company - They don't appreciate someone working hard, Compensation is low for the work load required"
bad,"not a bad place to work, must hit your numbers. not a good place for advancement. Upper management not very good to work for."
bad,"Panera's daily management shift requires travel paths to be done every 15 to 20 minutes to ensure café cleanliness.  Labor tracking is done by the hour using chart thresholds and all shift administration work is only done during non peak hours.  Peak hour managers are on the floor supervising the line and bakery providing assistance to associates and providing exceptional guest services.  Not a fast paced environment in comparison to most casual dining restaurants."
bad,Just a high school job that isn't that great.  They over work you and except too much out of you.  It is not a great job by any means and I would never think about doing it again
bad,I was an opening cashier. I worked in the bakery section. greeted and helped customers. I cleaned floors and tables. me and my co-workers got along well. I enjoyed brewing coffee.
bad,"Energetic and fun co workers, unsatisfactory management, discounted food and work around school schedules. If you call in sick they will hate you forever. Nice customer...most of the time. You can learn a lot about customer service and proper food handling skills."
bad,big food industry that likes to cut corners and not use the freshest food. they do not treat their managers very well. they cant pay me a fair wage but they can afford 2 ceo's with multi million dollar wages
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,It wasn't the best but it definitely wasn't the worse. It would be a good job for a teen who doesn't really need money. Great hours and great pay and ways to get raises but the amount of free time you get is slim to none.
bad,"High up management will throw anyone under the bus to save their skin with little to no care for them. No care for staff that literally overwork themselves, almost into sickness such as: Pneumonia, ruptured appendix, colds and the list goes on. At first manager will show care and compassion to lure you in, but after awhile they will care less and less about you. Availability does no exist in anyone's vocab, you will be scheduled many days but the second you say something about you being overworked, you hours plummet to single digit hours a week. Overall managers are petty, higher ups see you nothing more than lack luster employees, and if you complain say goodbye to your job."
bad,"At This company I am charged with multitudes of duties from helping with sandwich production to taking orders as a cashier. I will also go out on the floor and talk to customers about their experiences with the company, see how their day is going and overall customer satisfaction. Some customers know me by name and ask for me specifically. The overall experience i would say is that of a warm and welcoming staff with exceptional service provided by myself and the crew."
bad,"I am responsible for tending to the customer's needs. I may a nswer any questions a customer may have, straighten up the store, put things away to their proper place, replenish merchandise, ring people up on the register. Ensure that each customer receives outstanding service by providing a friendly environment, which includes greeting and acknowledging every customer, maintaining solid product knowledge and all other aspects of customer service. Maintain an awareness of all promotions and advertisements."
bad,"a typican work day would include •	Check with customers to ensure that they are enjoying their meals and take action to correct any problems."
bad,worst experience ever. I wasn't there more than 2 weeks very unorganized
bad,I love this job but I'm just in need of a better opportunity.all co-worker were helpful
bad,Making soup salad and sandwiches. Cash handling labor management and inventory. Customer service and problem solving skills.
bad,"During the day, I would work on the line field and serve our customers to their needs of food and service. And during our inventory days, I would make sure our products are put up to company regulations."
bad,"This company started off as one I had enjoyed working at for many years. After being there for a few years, I realized there was no opportunity for growth from the position I was in. I had felt that as a team there was not a want to set people up for success nor were there opportunities for people to be recognized for their accomplishments in the company. I had chosen to part ways so I could thrive in a better environment."
bad,Location so badly organized and corrupted owner. Also employees didn't keep it sanitary enough.
bad,Hardest part of the job is making every customer happy. Co-workers are great wish more hours would be given to the employees already there rather than hiring more people. I enjoy interacting with regular and new faces all day!
bad,Disrespectful staff. Management did not care about you as a person. Worked there for 6 years and had to beg for a raise. 
bad,"I didn't really like working here. I liked the food, but it was just a job to get me through high school and college."
bad,"It was nice working for for a while until, getting new mangers and they where kind of mean. But it was fun while it lasted."
bad,"Communicated effectively and provided excellent customer service. I was responsible for assisting customers with their orders, light food prep. In addition assigned to clean before, during, and after the shift, as well as assisting Shift Leaders and Management with any other tasks"
bad,"My day would consists of two halves: Three hours spent making Paninis in the kitchen and then the remainder of the shift on the line preparing food. The first half of the day was actually quite nice, I would spend three hours listening to music and making the exact same sandwiches for lunch. Once lunch started things would get worse..."
bad,"Working for Panera Bread might seem like a good day. But due to the people they hire they show lack of enthusiasm of the job. Mangers show selfishness needs and the organization of the company is very poor. We can write pages of complaints but they have never helped or fixed one of them. Moving up in the company is close to impossible unless you kiss up to the managers. Not hard work. Our clientele is very poor. They are very indecisive,and have no care for the employee taking there order. They make huge messes. Sadly we are not a restaurant and are not allowed to take tips, for how hard we work. I feel like a immigrant. Working my talbone off for a dollar."
bad,The management was good and the co-workers were fine but I felt the place was dirty. The pay was not good enough for the work you had to do. Dining room duty was the hardest and easily the worst job you could do.
bad,Poor Management styles affect the overall company morale. Panera associates all carry a low morale for their company because they are paid too little. This leads to a very low incentive to put in the work required at a fast-paced place such as Panera.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
bad,"My entire time working at Panera Bread, I enjoyed working with the people I was with. However, the unsympathetic and unreasonable attitudes of my District Leads ruined the experience. The pay compensation was unfair and they paid people more for threatening to leave or being their longer instead of actual performance."
bad,Some of the staff are very welcoming to the store itsself. They are smiling and quick when it comes to the orders being taken. They have a nice music selection
bad,"I was trained in most areas so an average day for me was scattered around the store. I was lucky to mostly have competent managers but there were times in my two years that our store had bad ones. It really depends on the manager on most days. If they're solid, you'll have a good day."
bad,No room for advancement and constant moments of them telling you it will happen. Also no work life balance missed out on being a mommy in the important things for my child.
bad,"The discount on their food is nice. The quality of the work environment really depends on the GM. Expect very needy customers that will always have a complaint. As an associate the work is fine despite high expectations on quality and speed. But any higher than that and the stress and epectations start to outweigh the compensation... unless you are an assistant manager or GM. There is also not enough of an investment into Labor costs or labor hours, causing them to almost never give out overtime and severly understaff most days."
bad,Working at Panera was not something easy. I made a lot of advancements through the company but the downfall was the turnover rate for the people they hired. Just because you do you job well there doesn’t mean other people are going to as well.
bad,"it was a fast food place. managers were nice. the people make the workplace, and the people there were great and friendly. some of the funniest people i know work there."
bad,"As an asst. mgr. I worked 60+ hours a week mostly closing shifts.  The pay was less than $35K per year.  If you have a good GM and enough AMs to share the workload then work is bearable.  Otherwise, it is hard to get everything done without working crazy hours.  I left after one year."
bad,Love the employees but its pure CHAOS. Everything seems to go wrong. Lack of training is the biggest issue. No one really knows what they're doing and is winging it. You will be given tasks that you're never been trained on and expected to perform like Kobe Bryant in the final seconds of a game. But I believe in you...may the odds be in your favor.
bad,"I don’t mind working here. It’s a good first job if you need to start working to pay for gas or anything else. The management isn’t the best. Most of the managers are nice but they seem to pick favorites. They also give you hours that are most inconvenient for you. When you first get hired, one of the mangers will ask what days you know you won’t be able to work. No matter what even if you tell them you can’t work a certain day of the week, they’ll still put you on the schedule for one of those days. I also was barely trained. Two of my training days they had me just take off and never had me make it up. I never got any training days on cash and was basically thrown to the wolves without knowing anything about the register or anything else that you need to know for cash. Pay isn’t bad. I’ve never gotten a raise before but that’s not really anything I’m worried or pressed about getting. They pay minimum wage."
bad,Management needs to improve and treat all employees fairly there is a lot of favoritism. Working at Panera can be highly stressful at times because lots of people like to call off all the time or we get busy and management get flustered.
bad,Panera is an okay place to work for a high school student. They do not pay enough even for a college student. There are multiple managers and most of them are cool.
bad,"The assistant manager position is not for new mothers, anyone with a heart condition, or anyone that can't take drugs to remain ""up"" for over 12 hours. The working hours are completely unreasonable and erratic. You have to be a complete degenerate to work here."
bad,New company took over and it is just unbearable to work at a place where they treat you unfairly. Busy and under staffed all the time. They expect the managers to role out the old employees and bring new ones in.
bad,"I mostly worked as an opening and closing manager which consisted on making sure everything was set and ready for opening, with closing making sure everything was ready for the next day. "
bad,"Its not bad, just the pay for the speed they expect you to maintain aswell as keep the quality is not enough. Preppig food and the actual making it isnt bad. Its a step into thr food industry in one way."
bad,they expect too much for little pay. the place needs a lot of cleaning. you may get burned from the ovens. i learned how to make amazing sandwiches. great people
bad,"I've been working there for almost two years, and have made wonderful friends over the time I've worked there. Despite that, combined with the lack of training of incoming employees and the difficulty of talking to management it makes for an extremely tense environment for all employees. Plus there is not benefits of any sort to people other than managers, no holidays off unless you fight to have them, and a barely livable wage for those who work so hard for the cooperation (for reference, I started at around $10 per hour, and now am at $12) and all this stress is not worth being able to only scrape by. By now the only thing that keeps me here is that I have solid hours because of how long I've worked there, and the fact that the people who you work the assembly line with or at the registers are so close knit, and we try really hard for each other. it's a good start if you want some experience, but otherwise, don't waste your time."
bad,Working with food. Taking peoples order. Making food and drinks.  Always being out of things. I didn't enjoy this job at all.
bad,"The managers weren't very good and I didn't really enjoy my time working here very much, I did like working with my coworkers."
bad,"Working here is extremely stressful and the closing shifts are especially stressful as a lot of times there aren't enough associates scheduled and the work load can become overwhelming depending on the amount of customers that the cafe has that night. As long as you do what you are told and show up for work on time and everyday that you are scheduled, job security is great. Management is alright, but can also be inconsiderate and hard to work with at times. The product that you are selling is not the illusion that is advertised. For example everything is considered ""fresh"" but our soup is actually frozen and so is the pasta. Same goes for the bread, the dough is frozen and panera doesn't mix it. All the bakers do is pan frozen dough and throw it in the oven. So the ""fresh"" illusion is annoying because you feel like you are deceiving customers as we aren't allowed to pour soup up front because the managers don't want customers knowing the truth."
bad,I enjoyed working their. I got along will with my co-workers.
bad,"A typical day at work starts at 5 am with spending the morning in the bakery. I set up the bakery case and put up bread and bagels. Around 11 am I move to the cafe line where I make sandwiches, salads, and consolidate the food onto a tray during the ""lunch rush"". I go home between 1 and 2. The hardest part of my job is the fact that the company goes through employees so frequently that no one is properly trained, and I end up having to do the jobs of 2 or more people. The most enjoyable part of the job is probably the hours. Management is trained to talk down to employees and do less work but most of my co-workers are very hard working."
bad,"At the beginning I had a great work experience, until all the efficient managers left and relocated. Schedules were never consistent. Very importantly: all the good workers were punished to do my work and to close, while all the incompetent workers were allowed to sit on their phones and do no work and never faced any consiquences."
bad,"day is my enjoy while my good time, good people"
bad,It is a good job until management is not sure what to do once it gets busy. Pay is fine until the summer. If you are looking for 40 you won't get it..
bad,"I am still kind of new (Working for about 5 months), but from my experience it is OK but really fast and is really annoying when people complain about having o much or not enough lettuce after not specifying how much wanted. I also have had a pretty bad experience with people just leaving their plates and other trash just on the table when you clearly see other people putting the plates and there things on the trash can thingy, sorry i don,t know what its called. Also be ready to feel rushed because there are timers for both drive-thru and in store lines. The drive-thru has 5 min and in store has 3 min to complete an order, that does not sound to bad right. Wrong the problem with that is during lunch rush you get like a group of 3 to 7 people and Panera expects you to finish a in store order in 3 min, no thank you it is pretty much impossible without getting half the other associates to help."
bad,"Hourly wages at Panera were not fair for everyone. New employees with no service industry experience would sometimes have higher hourly wages than employees who were trained on all the modules and had been working there for a longer time, which sometimes created tension between employees. It was a simple matter of unfairness, which I found ironic given how much managers stressed ""integrity"" and ""fairness"" during meetings."
bad,"Panera was my first job, so I didn't know what to expect. Got a discount on the food and the ppl I worked with were friendly, but we were understaffed."
bad,"wasn't there to long because it seem like training just to be in the dining room took forever and I was only given 6 hours a week, and that wouldn't cut it when I really needed money but overall it seem like a good job."
bad,Poor management.  Worked with a lot of college age students with a very poor work ethic.
bad,"Customer service is the main part of working at Panera Bread. I prepped food, trained associates, and cleaned. The management constantly changed and was not very great. Although, I learned a lot from working with many different kinds of people and meeting new customers everyday. I enjoy many of my co-workers and we work together to make every day a success. The food business is not the right place for me and the distance is hard to work with."
bad,"Upper corporate management like to implement various micromanagement methods into our daily lives, as a way to ""improve efficiency and the customer experience."" Very little of these changes improved anything at the store I worked at; it was far more likely to disrupt any flow we had established. Many changes were completely asinine and appeared to have never received any input from actual store associates. We were also almost never allowed to close due to hazardous weather conditions, like blizzards, while every other business closed around us. If I didn't enjoy some of my coworkers and managers, I would've left a long time ago, but now a there are many newer associates with awful attitudes and no initiative to do anything past the bare minimum. There is also very little regard for cleaning tasks to maintain the store (combination of corporate demanding cleaner stores when my store does not have the time or associates to keep up with that and associates making zero effort to do anything) or properly rotate product."
bad,Depends on the size of your bake which could make or break your wallet lol. Small bakes equal less hours. Bigger bakes.... well yeah. My bakery management team is great.
bad,"One of the most boring jobs I’ve ever had. It was always slow and overall there was just a minimal amount of work to do. Great if you don’t like doing much at work. The hardest parts were the training videos which took 5ever to complete. Free pastries, though!"
bad,"This job was probably my least favorite job. I had to memorize the ingredients for all of the food that Panera makes, and had to deal with snobby customers, which majority were. The job to me was kind of like school. They literately want you to memorize all of the ingredients,and would give you a menu to study so you could remember them. I do have to admit though, ALL of the managers were very helpful and lenient when you did not remember the ingredients or get orders wrong, which I did a lot. They would all just laugh at me and tell me with practice I would get better. Sadly I only lasted about a month there. LOL"
bad,"I enjoyed working for Panera Bread, but unfortunately I was laid off do to the time of year when the stores get a little slow and miscommunication my mananger."
good,"I worked at the location at Farmington Hills, Michigan during 2003. I should have declined the job when the fat lady with a mustache who was interviewing me told me she thought I  was ""weird"" and afraid to hire me because my favorite job was a waitress at Dennys instead of the awful desk job I had before.  (If she wanted to see weird, she should have looked in the mirror) A different manager at the second interview hired me.  2-They'd ""lose"" our paycheck at least once a month. Yes, even before Christmas. 3-Management was degrading and mean.  First theyd tell me not to go outside at night to get the breadracks, and to call management and tell them if they're left outside. So, I did that, only to have to manager then call me a ""big baby"" for not going outside to get them!  They'd nitpick at my work like a bunch of fussy old ladies because I didint' get the ""right"" amount of sprinkles on the brownies.  Yet they refused to allow me to have a dispenser which told me the right amount of sprinkles for their stupid brownies!  So it was a losing game every night at work..   The delivery would drop the boxes in my way to the pantry, and I'd have to spend an hour moving them to get to the pantry.  Then management told me not to move the boxes. So I couldn't get to the cookie dough and bread in the pantry.  Then of course, it was my fault and the fired me.  Never was I so relived to get fired in my life!    The miserable lady who fired me was watching me walk out the door, so I grabbed a bagel, took a big bite and looked right at her before I left!  I hope things improved since I worked"
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,I started with a lot of hour and they would work with my schedule and then they started cutting everyone's hours down significantly because they kept hiring too many people.
good,"Definitely a good job if your looking to work constantly but have no benefits or incentives. Store is understaffed, management dont know what their doing, and its an all around stressful environment every day."
good,"They don't care about your health or well being. Rather you come to work than the hospital for real problems. Don't believe in confidentiality- will yell your personal business and issues right out in front of everyone, even customers."
good,Unfortunately we got some managers that take everything personal and they decide to put not hireable because you quit and you put in your two weeks even though you leaving got charms just because you left they decide to put a new ice not hireable I don't think that's fair especially when you already know that this is the man you want to go back
good,"In the beginning, Panera was a positive upbeat environment to work in. I enjoyed coming into work every day and looked forward to being able to get paid for being in a place I loved. It provided a great starting place to work and have benefited from there. However, when the manager changed it became a more negative environment. Hours were cut to unreasonable 3-hour shifts which were not worth the time. New employees were not given proper training because they were too cheap so more work was put on others who had been there longer. We felt used and were not given the respect and care that employees should have. It's sad that a place that I once loved to work at had to become my worst nightmare that I had to quit."
good,very busy from the minute you walk in.  There is no down time.  you are in position from the minute you walk in.  you are not one to be in a role of just standing in a position and not doing nothing.  So of you want a easy job this is not for you.
good,I have worked for Panera for a year now. Like everywhere else it's hit or miss with liking people but some managers at Panera take it to a whole new level.
good,"Working at Panera was my only regret as an employee. Never again will I work for such a place, with managers who don't care about their store, and a company who's HR doesn't even work with employees to better their environment. never again."
good,A lot of drama! A lot of work but no pay! May be treated unfairly at times! I have been working there for about a year and eight months! The atmosphere can be overwhelming at times! The management can be better!
good,Cut throat environment. Some rude employees and boss. Easy come easy go.....money is king. Employees are the little worker ants. Didn't feel the love and commodery....competitive atmosphere but sterile cold sloppy team structure.
good,Panera was a complete mess. The management was all over the place. You would think that for having 4 managers that they would be better but it was terrible. They fired me and didn't give me a reason and then sent me a letter a few months later stating that I hadn't shown up for work in months.
good,"managers were mean and humiliating .Not a fun place to work!!!!"
good,"Panera Bread is a disappointing place to work, the management is terrible and they don't work with you to help you on your scheduling. It is always busy but the managers don't train you well enough and then you get yelled at by customers saying you are ""incompetent"". The hardest part was keeping my cool while trying to do my job."
good,"One of the better places I have worked, enjoyed my crew.  Had nice managers to work for.  Enjoyed the atmosphere and the types of customers we attracted.  Would work there again."
good,wierd hours low pay no benefits. left to become manager at mcdonalds.
good,I gained a lot of knowledge in the customer service field. I became a certified trainer for the staff. I learned how to teach and how to supervise. The managers constantly changed so I also learned how to adapt to a changing work environment. The hardest part of the job was leaving. I had a lot of fun working with a high number of customers and pleasing them with high standard customer service. Working here showed me that if you want to get the job done you have to do it right and with quality behind everything you are asked of. The most enjoyable part of working for Panera Bread was connecting with the public and making their day.
good,"They have the highest turn over rate within my 3 years of working for this company. They try to maintain a ""non fast food"" mecca with relaxing atmosphere for their customers all while it is a sweat shop for their employees. Managers are hovering constantly over your shoulders hoping for the speed of your sandwich crafting to increase all while the quality plummets."
good,"I didn’t like the hour, the manager or the staff. The manager had favoritisms towards certain employees and the staff were moody with me. Young people is what I think."
good,"Work hard, be honest, keep your individualality to yourselves. Do what is asked of you but ask questions if you've never done the work asked of you(they dont teach you everything you need to know until they demand it of you during a busy time of the day, which is usually lunch10-2)"
good,i wouldnt say that panera bread is the worst place to work but in the location that i worked in it needed better staff. i would work really long hours up till 1 in the morning some nights.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,You get to meet nice people wish management was the same glad to have made some lifetime friendships there . Management was a nightmare customer relations were good
good,"Panera Bread is a safe and comfortable environment to work in, but also very stressful. Patience and good spirits is key when working at Panera. When applying make your availability very well known because they will disregard and schedule you outside of your availability if they feel the need."
good,"Job was aggravating, managers was aggressive and unfair. They don’t really care about you. If you’re sick they don’t care you need to still work. I threw up on the job and they still made me work until I said I wasn’t going to anymore."
good,The work environment was fun but the job was fast paced. There were little benefits and some of the managers were unprofessional in disciplining the associate workers.
good,"It was fun at first and turned extremely horrible place to work later on. The management is not there for you, and the crew are not very nice. It was very stressful and not very well compensated"
good,Very stressful and fast paced. Management sucks and barley knows what they're doing. Barley get hours unless you pick up someones shift. You will get yelled at if you're not fast enough on the line. Only good thing really is the free food at the bread bashes once a season. Tend to put you on break a hour before your shift is over.
good,"I didn not like working at panera bread, the enviornment was not good, the benefits were bad and the management team changed constantly, and i did not like the way the store was ran"
good,"Overall okay experience, job wasnt hard just boring and there are usually 3 managers on at a time so its stressful. Didnt give me the hours i wanted typically"
good,Most days while working I would become very stressed and no one would try and help me with what I was doing also if I would do something wrong they wouldn’t try and help me the would just get annoyed with me
good,"Let's face it even though Panera is better than working at a burger flipping joint. It is still the food service industry. That being said I never did get tired of the food while working at Panera. As it really is much healthier and fresher than a lot of fast food chains. Still the hours were long, the schedule changed a lot, and it wasn't a good balance of work and life."
good,"Horrible place to work. I wasn’t paid the amount I was supposed to and they refused to let me be a trainer even though I had learned every area. I had to basically teach myself every area because they would schedule you somewhere and tell you to figure it out. Management was harsh and unprofessional. The general manager treated me like a I was a child and was very rude in every interaction. They played favorites and no matter how hard I worked, I did not get a raise or better hours. I almost always had to stay one to two hours after I was scheduled off and I worked 50+ hours 6days a week for a couple months even though I was “part time”."
good,"When I first started at panera I loved it, now it is poorly managed by half of the shifts or managers, there are too many ‘favorites’, and no one likes doing their own job that they were hired for without complaining."
good,"Just horrible need better managers, need to care about employees.The hourly wage sucks its not that many benefits for the employees. The uniforms could be better the aprons for employees could be bettter"
good,The managers just sit around eating for free while the workers have to pay for their food and you'll be lucky enough to even get a break. The managers don't help at all just stay on their phones in the office.
good,"There is a lot to do during the work day. Staying busy is a must. Hours during the Summer suck, and pay isn't that great. management is all over the place and hardly help. The hardest part is having to do everyone else's part since everyone is new."
good,"Management is favored by certain employees. At times, they don't give enough breaks and expect a lot of employees. Give a lot of training, but not a lot of place to advance."
good,I loved the customer interaction but there was no room for advancement with the store that I was in. Management keep more things going on in the store than the employees did.
good,"My typical day was to come in and open the bakery. When we would open i would be on the register taking orders from guests. Also , cleaned and kept a tidy work place."
good,"I was subject to some bad management. I worked at two stores over my year and a half. The first store trained me on a lot, but didn't officially certify me, so when their training system changed. I knew a lot but didn't have any credit. I wanted to advance and was vocal about it, but wasn't scheduled for anything advancing. I ultimately left because ""School was starting,"" but really because some of the closing managers were brutal."
good,unorganized and hard to work for. management very unbalanced and schedule changes daily. empoyees quit all of the time and no one is very friendly
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,i would come in set up the front end of the store and start cleaning a ringing up customers as well as making drinks helping catering and the food line. The customers are AMAZING as well as our co - workers the management team is ok and the hardest part of the day would be lunch time the line is typically half way out the door for atleast 2 hours but the best part of my job is pleasing the customers and getting great feedback
good,"over-priced moderately made and kept bland food and a casual hangout with free wi-fi for a half hour doesn't make up for the awful experience you get with their food to be honest. "
good,Panera is a fun place to work. The management left a little to be desired. I worked here while in college. Management played favorites and scheduled very few hours for those who were not 100% committed to the company.
good,Not a fun environment to work in but a great place to eat their. The day working their is not fun because i would get in trouble for doing the right things following the hand books.
good,"Your lured in with false information and there is no room for advancement. Moral is low due to lack of skills in Bakery Management. The better you think you have become, they let you know that no one can be 100%. Isn't 100% what you want from your bakers?"
good,Lunch time it gets real intense. it can get to be very stressful
good,great co-workers but sucky management fast paced need to be a face learner
good,"I appreciated the opportunity Panera gave me by working there but we unfortunately had disagreements and I ended up leaving, but I did however make some solid ties that helped me by pointing out little things I could do to improve customer service or overall just improved the working environment."
good,"I have specific hours i could work per outside scheduling, they worked with those hours then slowly started dropoing the hours. Panera is not family friendly as stated. Worst place to work. They have employees who downgrade other employees who are intellectually disabled, and constantly get away with it. No matter how many times hr store manager and district manager were involved. One employee has had issue s with many employees and yet everyone was disciplined for it except for the one employee becauss she was older and had been there longer.. Such a poor company to work for."
good,Don't recommend. It was frustrating dealing with customers and management. Never fully stocked on plastic utensils and cups. Yelled at by customers daily. No tips.
good,I was hired as a sandwich maker and put on something else. I worked maybe at the front of house for a total of maybe 3 weeks and was put in the boh since then and didn’t finish my proper training.
good,"I really enjoyed my time with Panera some things are better left unsaid at the end of the day I always did what was asked of me , I always went above and beyond for the company ."
good,"Panera is very stressful place to work. High demands and changing workloads. Upper management has zero regards for Panera standards. You are treated like a number at Panera. They are only concerned with numbers and want you to cut staff to bare minimum while keeping up with drive thru, deliveries, and catering orders. You will work way more then expected due to no overtime rules. If offered a job, I would highly reconsider."
good,Like i said very fasted paced it was like you found out something new every day which i felt you should have been told from the beginning for instance they did a clam chowder but only on Friday which nobody informed me of that just little things like that very poor training
good,The people who work there don’t do anything and others end up taking the responsibility and not getting credit. We would also leave late because the managers wouldn’t let us go especially on school nights.
good,always busy but never organized. when you come in to work something always happens to where you have to end up doing more than what you signed up for. be prepared to actually work
good,i was being scheduled 5-6 days a week and would be scheduled 7-8.5 hour shifts but would not be allowed to clock out until i was there for about 10 hours i was also being called in on what was normally my only day off in a week not allowed to clock in to print out training plans and be random help for a few hours. i was averaging about 50-60 hour work weeks as a part time employee without benefits
good,"I trained in one store for another. Everything I was told was different at the location I was hired for. Walked in day 1, no help where anything was located. "
good,"Terrible pay, bad managers, bad schdule. Now it makes me type alot more for some reason but what else is there to be said? Don't work here go somewhere else do something else."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Fast paced in catering. Long hours. Low/ no existant tips. Tips are pulled from your check. Early morning in the afternoon/ evening. Earliest i ever went in was 2am.
good,"A typical day would be come in and clock-in, then not even in a minute into the shift they would boss everyone around, i'm not gonna complain but this was a different type of bossing around, they would be mad if something wasn't done that they were suppose to do but made an associate to do. Besides that it was a good work experience i had to focus on school for the last days so i had to quit since they scheduled me on the wrong days and said ""well I don't care if you cant work that day we need someone in"". I quit focusing on my finals passing them. It was a good first job."
good,"extremely stressful every time i was in and you only get discounts on your lunch breaks, management was awful and honestly the food is pretty gross and all frozen"
good,"I think that Panera as a company is pretty cool. There are a lot of things to do, and it's nice that a lot of food gets donated at the end of the night. I also love that the workers get tips split up throughout the entire store. My personal experience with Panera Bread started pretty okay, but ended in a terrible place. This is because of the way my store handled conflicts. People who cause trouble get to stay around most of the time."
good,it was not my best experience because the management was not organized. they were not very good with scheduling when asking for time off way ahead of time.
good,"Doesn't work with you, not flexible with hours because if you're a manager you have to work whatever hours they put you on, you don't have a say. You do way more work than you are paid for."
good,Unless you want to be a slave to ur job dont waste ur time management sucks. You do your job and others bt if you dont do the managment favorites jobs ull be written up
good,"Working at this location was very slow paced at times. Lunch rush was always fun because you were actually doing something. management was very moody, never knew if they would be in a good mood or bad so it made for a stressful environment. Loved most of the people I worked with on day shift."
good,The management was inconsistent and there was a high turn over. There was a lot of unnecessary drama between the staff and the management to the point of it being inappropriate rumors circulating the restaurant.
good,Panera bread thought me a lot about dealing with mangers and other people and understanding that a work place is a work place. Panera also tought me that some jobs aren’t for you and that’s okay.
good,"It wasn't the worst place to work, but not the best either. The working atmosphere catty and two faced, especially with the supervisors. Some of the other co-workers could be cliquish and downright indifferent. The pace was very hurried and more often than not you were tied down from the moment you started and until you finished, with no breaks. Stressful and very little help from others."
good,"I know to look at the ratings I look as if I am very unsatisfied with this job experience, but that is not the case. I actually loved this job and put my all into every aspect of it. I became as educated as I possibly could. I know it may sound as if I am making me sound like the most perfect employee ever, but I did all I could because of me being such a competitive person. It took me a very long time to understand that when going to work I wasn't there to make friends, though its nice to have team members to talk with, and feels great to be able to gain a friend and just feel like a family within. Instead I witnessed management telling one employee that didn't like another to keep saying nasty things to them it won't be long and they will quit. Other times I witnessed management speaking with certain team members about the others and that alone made me feel very uncomfortable as it wasn't positive statements. Also to you had cliques and a hostile work environment to go along with that. Now it wasn't always that way just my last 8 months of working for this company. i do not have any bad things to say about the company itself, the management shift was when everything seemed as if it corrupted."
good,"If your a student looking for flexible hours under 30 hours a week, it's great job for you. For a person looking for full time employment with benefits its not a good place to work. They offer full time but give you part time hours after your hired.  The only way to get 40 hours a week is if your a manager and it takes a year or more to be considered for management training regardgless of your experience."
good,If you are looking for a place to work that sucks you in to the job and you don’t plan on moving up then. This is the place for you for sure! Be careful when applying.
good,Panera was my first official job and I stayed there for about two years. I learned how to work long hours from five in the morning till three in the afternoon. My manager saw that I was a hard worker and after a couple months she promoted me to be a trainer. I also learned four positions at Panera Bread. I had to deal with angry customers and in a way it was a good thing because I know how to handle tough situations.
good,"Made a complaint about unwanted touching basically  & management came after me with left field issues that they had with me, trying to make me look like a troll or some sort . I was eventually fired, can’t say that it applies to all of the chains cafe."
good,"Making deliveries to multiple stores and loading and unloading heavy cabinets and touching all the produce twice every store(putting it on the cabinet,then taking it out and putting it where the baker wants!!!0. They keep switching routes and cant keep people in the warehouse. The drivers are responsible for everything that goes on their. My most enjoyable day is leaving to go home tired from all the loading and unloading and lifting of the produce."
good,a typical day is when you start by having to park in the back where homeless people hangout at 430 in the morning and walk by yourself to the store. open for an hour and a half and deal with over 50 customers a day and managers constantly failing to do their jobs but yell at you even when you are doing your job right. managers wont clean up after themselves but will yell at you for their own mess. then they will cut your hours and promise you raises that never happen.
good,"When I first started working here, all the managers were so thrilled.  They kept saying, ""We're so happy you're here.""  I think that's just something they say to new people.  I met a few people, and everyone was so friendly.  But I didn't know that the people who had been there the longest had done what the managers were supposed to do, like cover other people's shifts, and pick up the slack that others were leaving behind.  The managers were saying, ""Make sure you talk to a manager,"" about things, but nothing was getting done.  On top of this, the managers were yelling at different coworkers, causing them stress.  If an order went out wrong, and a customer called in to tell the manager about it, we got yelled at.  If someone baked too much, we got yelled at.  It's just a negative place to work at."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,I have been there almost two years and don’t make very much. They have started to hire people in making as much as me and won’t give me a  raise. And if you work during the day you make more money than the people at night.
good,it's not a place to work if you do not like to clean floors and sweep after people. its not a place if you cant stand on your feet for 8 plus hours without a break.
good,Its a joke - they will not allow you foster the right culture because leadership doesn't understand work a great culture looks and feels like. Please  get back to doing whats right - and never stop doing what is right !
good,The staff was all really nice and easy to get along with. The day usually went smooth with good team work. The management wasn't very good at communication though.
good,"Work here was very difficult managing school and work. It was a fun environment always very busy especially every morning, regardless of what day it was."
good,"Working for Panera Bread was a interesting experience. The management needed ,and probably still needs improvement. The management is what caused many of my former co-workers to end their employment at Panera Bread."
good,"They don't deliver on their promises, they don't advance you, they flame to be understanding of personal issues but then they will fire you be cause of call outs"
good,"For a first job this really was not that bad. They worked with my school schedule and paid more than minimum wage. However, the raises suck. They will promise you promotions and will never give them to you. They will expect you to do more than your job requirements. The only good time to work is if youre closing so you can get free bakery items at night. Otherwise, they expect you to pay for over priced food with a bad discount and wont offer any other benefits really. Sometimes you will work with a great crew for awhile but the managers move around so much you probably wont stay long either."
good,"love the people i worked with, but the company and management is horrible. they do not care about their workers. everything is about money. i got all the hours i wanted and needed because i was a favorite, but the workers who the manager didn't care for worked 6 days for barely 30 hours"
good,"Very nice atmosphere.. however customers are very rude and treat the employees like trash.. "
good,"This place is hard work! not much room for slacking or laziness. I've learned more about the importance of ""teamwork!"" And sometimes it does matter who's on your team."
good,"if you plan for working for this company, be aware at first you are going to be trained in dining and not right away as ""cashier"". also there is a lot of favoritism in this company with managemet, they constantly gossip and talk about others."
good,"The management at the location I was at, were completely not understanding at all, and were not friendly. The work environment was kind of hostile, and no one seemed to get along. I was often doing other peoples jobs, and people often did not come into work. If you asked for less hours, the managers were absolutely not understanding, and would do the opposite of what you asked them to do."
good,"Everyday work day at Panera is busy and makes the time go by. As working as a manager there, it is horrible. The managers higher than you talk to you like you mean nothing and they do not respect or treat their managers good at all!! They expect you to have no life and work 10-12 hours a day. I would not reccomend this company to anyone."
good,"Co-wokers call out all of the time and you end having to cover for them morning or night shift. The pay is only $12 and hour which sucks because you have to be a baker and a janitor, but it is an ok entry level job."
good,This is an okay place to work in high school. The management was very poor and advancement opportunities weren't there.
good,"The overall concept of Panera is wonderfull and they have the best systems and tools in place for learning and maintaining and clean and professional environment.  The issue with this concept is they expect one individual to do the work of 3 people which is unreasonable making it hard at times to maintain said systems and tools.  They expect management to maintain a ""healthy"" labor budget by literally running a skeleton crew at most times which is ridiculous."
good,"Panera bread busy hours are of course (12pm to 2pm) .. During those times, everyone is very busy & the managers are VERY lazy & disrespectful.. You will feel like your being torn into different places.. I don't recommend this job for anybody especially if this is your first job."
good,"The work hours are long and irregular, however you meet a lot of great people and learn a lot of new things."
good,"A typical day at work is pretty quick paste. I've learned about different cultures. My management team is very team oriented. Co-workers are team oriented, the hardest part about the job is dealing with difficulties of not being able to understand the language of the different diversities. The most enjoyable part is getting to know the customers and making them smile and want to come back."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"It's hard to rate this company, due to how some places are run.  There are locations which are excellent, then there are those which shouldn't exist with the leadership in place."
good,I lost my job due to having a tattoo along with three other girls who have worked there over a year.
good,"Low wages, inconsiderate of employees and their safety. Never worked scheduled days. Not flexible hours. Too many workers on the same shift people get sent back home early"
good,"No job posting for advancements. "
good,Its a fairly simple job but it can get really stressful at times.  You just have to be able to work well with others and be professional at all times.
good,"Fast paced restaurant environment, enjoyable if adequately staffed. Good management opportunities are available but the pay is not equal for the amount of work and effort you perform."
good,I learned the value of proper food preparation and its temperature requirements. Maintaining a clean work area is most important. The hardest part of the job was remaining polite and calm after each encounter with a particular manager's inappropriate behavior on a regular basis.
good,The management team doesnt work well together. They arent on the same page. Making the food and tasting the new menu items is the best part. It was ok
good,"No real tips, share with everyone. Management is very unprofessional, don't really do to much to help out the team and employees don't work as a team well I'm working there."
good,Working here was a mistake and I regret leaving my last job I regret working with a manager who was extremely unprofessional who pretty much never gave us minors breaks and who then would be mad at us for slacking after a hard day at school and other priorities
good,panera is a very busy store and will raise your stress level. working on line for lunch rush or dinner rush can be crazy and non stop for a couple hours.
good,I worked for Panera on 21st ave across from Vanderbilt...and I’ll tell you it was very busy most of the time we were understaffed so we were always being rushed...managers don’t care how something is done as long as it gets done so I wouldn’t even eat from there 🤷🏽‍♀️ Oh and not to mention the old guy that works the register on morning shift is always coughing and has a runny nose he will blow his nose in front of customers put the napkin back in his pocket and serve you a muffin without gloves lol..but anyway the pay is terrible for the amount of stress you endure benefits and pto don’t start til after you’ve been there like a year...so I wouldn’t recommend working here to anybody unless u have a record and can’t find a job anywhere cause they will hire anybody!!
good,"The management here was atrocious, the work was un-fulfilling and the pay was not great. There were many times that one was asked to do things that were way past the expectations that can be held for a high-school student. Would not recommend."
good,"During my few months here I noticed that one person just stopped coming to work and that should have been my clue. The guests make a ton of incredibly odd and sometimes unreasonable requests, the manager was incredibly rude and not worth coming in to see, and the tips sucked. Being a team player wasn't enough and being sick at the time didn't help either. I wouldn't avoid working at Panera but I would avoid working at this one. The other managers were awesome though"
good,The best part of this work establishment was the regular patrons I grew to know well. The worst part was the favoritism and unfair treatment.                      There was little to no organization which made working there stressful and tense.
good,Come in and expect problems and work until you cannot physically handle it. Some great people but so much laziness and very poor GM. Would not recommend and females I know to work in this cafe.
good,"At first I thought it would be cool to deliver, being on your own for the duration of your shift. But the places you deliver to are mostly huge office buildings and college campuses. Very difficult to try and find your clients, especially with multiple orders. Taking the time to find a customer would lead to the other orders being late. Out of the three managers I met, two of them I had pleasant experiences with, but the other one seemed very snooty and seemed to look down on the employees. Didn’t even make eye contact with me when I first met her."
good,"I worked at Panera for only 2.5 months. I intended to work through school. However, I told the manager I could not come in as soon as school let out and work until closing (3:30-9 but I’d always end up having to stay until 10-11) but, she would ONLY schedule me those hours. Plus, she never ever had the schedule made. I would only know when I was supposed to come in the night before or the morning of. I could never make plans outside of work because I never knew when I’d have to come in. Another thing, one time a co-worker was called a very inappropriate name (of sexual tendencies) by a male co-worker and when she told the manager (the only one there that day), he just laughed. I’m not sure if they have new management or not but I truly hope so."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,It was a very stressful job due to lack of management involvement. The pay was not enough and going to school and work at the same time was nearly impossible due to low wages. People were lazy when it came to cleaning up or doing anything at all and nobody wants to work in a workplace that always does the bare minimum for their employees. Was understaffed and forced employees to stay at work after shift was supposed to end. Sometimes denied breaks on 8+ hour shifts due to how busy it was.
good,"management let a lot of things slide that should not have happened in the first place."
good,"the management took themselves and their employees too seriously, didnt provide breaks under 6 and a half hours, would purposely schedule people a half an hour short of giving a break"
good,They are okay but can do better. They help with flexible hours and give you the time you need for vacation. But empoyees are really under paid for the job they do.
good,"Panera is a great copy if you're working for corporate. If it's a franchise run away fast and far. It's not worth it. The cost management isn't effective. They do not train effectively. Uppermanagement just screams and yells. You can't do anything ""right"""
good,I come in and set the lines up. train employees and not getting paid for it. make sure all the products have correct lables. the hardest part of the job Is there are not enough people to cover the shift. I'm not getting paid what I should be getting paid for the experience I have.
good,Work hard and work fast or leave. No standing still must be on your feet the entire time and you are lucky if you have time to take a break. I sliced bread everyday up to 30 loaves. I injured my side and doing so..I was told not to report it to the hospital by management when I went to the hospital in terrible pain.
good,The job was not bad in the beginning I honestly enjoyed it and learned a lot of important skills. I've been working there for a year and have yet seen a promotion when others who have worked there less than I have get paid more than me.
good,"Work is very fast-paced and you will never have time to relax. On most days, that’s a good thing, but can add up to be overbearing. Staff is very friendly and approachable. Manager staffing is varied between good and bad managers. A lot of work for not enough pay. Lots of workers quit quickly, turnover rate of staff is high. Needs more staff in general."
good,"I learned to be very patient . I felt that you where treated different by each manger .he hardest part of the job was when others called in ."
good,"Panera is a very fast and hard working place"
good,"Depending on the shift i could come in at 5am or 7am, this would be for morning line work, my job would be to set up the line area and make sure everything is ready for lunch time. While getting that done I also have the job of making all breakfast orders that come in as far as breakfast sandwiches to oatmeal along with and regular food items. Then after breakfast is done I'm ready to work the lunch rush from 11-2."
good,"Management was not flexible at all and didn't seem to care about your personal life. Lots of responsibilities were expected from you, too much. Not good pay for the work I was doing."
good,Management was horrible. Constant issues with scheduling and not listening to employee concerns. Work tasks were exhausting and overbearing. Overall the job was disorganized.
good,If they had hired someone else when I was there maybe I would've stayed and kept my hours like I was promised I would've stayed. There was no order unless our lead was there. When my big boss came in she was always saying that things needed to be done before lunch and my boss just gave his duties to someone else and let them get in trouble for it when it wasn't done right
good,"The managment team was pretty bad,everyone around the workplace was picking favorites."
good,"El tiempo en q lavore, no me gusto la forma de los horarios de trabajo, reducían mucho horas de trabajo."
good,"Scheduling is very inconsistent.  One week you will be set for 30 hours and the following week you might only get 12 hours.  "
good,"If you enjoy working in a fast paced restaurant, this jobs for you. It's easy to learn but could be stressful at times when you're the only one running the line, especially for breakfast."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,People came in to work drunk and high all the time. The managers were rude to their employees. The managers lied blatantly during the hiring process. Nobody got enough hours.
good,I wouldn't work at Panera again. It lacked organization and the feeling of teamwork.  The area had very rude customers and the co workers weren't very friendly either.
good,"Managers lack communication skills, while associates are trustworthy and very wellcommunicated.  Schedules were not made according to employees availability but to the benefit of the Manager.  Responsible and hard-working employees hours were cut while the  New hires and unreliable  employees hours were increased."
good,Very political work place you only advance if you kiss up and know the right people. Everything is a clique and if you show any individuality at all you are immediately shunned and will have a bad time and be made to do stuff that ridiculous
good,Come in to everyone greeting you and get to work at a fast pace depending on the rush. Managers are very reasonable with getting minors on break. Great staff
good,"Scheduled me for 64 hours one week, knowing I had a second job I had previously committed myself to. Management practically never gave us breaks and would become upset upon asking for a 15 minute break for a 10 hour shift."
good,"The management is awful, and my number one complaint about my cafe. My schedule is not respected, and neither am I. The most enjoyable part of this job would be my other coworkers, I look forward to seeing them. Management is fairly unhelpful, and there is a giant lack of communication."
good,"Can be a fun place to work, met some cool people. Not hard or intense work. Have to be ok with dealing with the general public constantly. Some room for movement"
good,"The job itself was pretty easy, the customers were nice, but the the managers talked about me behind my back and only gave me 6 hours a week. Even though I was repectful to customers, did my job, and never was given a bad review"
good,The job overall is a pretty easy job. The managers on the other hand aren't so great. They aren't really professional. It's not okay the way they talk to their employees about other employees.
good,"Management is very bad, and there is no room for advancement in the company. Employees are great, and very fun to work with but the managers are very mean and not very understanding."
good,"Personal experience and also from the belief that it was franchise owned, the managers were not on their game. There was a lot of favoritism amongst managers and crew members. They do not recognize hard work, and take your hours away if you have emergencies."
good,job was ok at first but once i became pregnant with my 2nd child workload was too much no one was understanding of my high risk and i was still expected to work the same way i did before i was pregnant.
good,i moved up with panera from associate to trainer then to training specialist . great culture. very warm. they like to go younger. high high turnover. management is scheduled for 50 hrs. you will work 60+.
good,Best part of the job is who you work with. They were cutting costs a lot when I was there. Raises were limited. Some managers were good Wish they promoted more from within.
good,"While I did enjoy waitressing and being a barista, management was disorganized and everything was very confusing for a long time regarding schedules and shifts."
good,"In the beginning it takes some adjusting because things can become fast paced when it's busy. I eventually got very good at my job and I really enjoyed working during the rush hours like lunch time 12-2pm. I was fast on the register, accurate, & time flew. But cashiers are also expected to keep up with checking/making coffee, cleaning the dining room, and behind the registers, we would sometimes bring things out to customers, too. I also had to prep some side items in the back. In the mornings we heated up bagels and packed small cups with cream cheese. There was always plenty to do. I only left because I wanted a more 'professional' job. This is a good start if you are new to working."
good,"The company does not care about its associates, or any one for that matter. They treat everyone like dirt and will constantly remind you they will replace you whenever they ""feel like it"". You will have 0 job security and will not enjoy your time there."
good,The GM of the store in Asheville is a compulsive liar and pretty much doesn't know what she is doing at all. She cuts corners at every opportunity. This is not a fun or nice place to work. its also really difficult to get a raise because she takes forever to submit the paperwork.
good,It was a ok environment alot Of stocking merchandise over head and relatively strait forward pulling pallets out opening boxes stocking shelves not super exciting but you get a workout!
good,good for those who like third shift bad for those who need and want a set schedule.
good,"You have to start somewhere.  Working at the bottom is a great life experience.  You'll learn a lot about customer service and if you're lucky you might pick up a thing or two about management.  Otherwise it's a great way to earn some cash while you go to college.  I picked up skills on training people to do a job, 80% of whom moved on to training others as well."
good,"Panera bread is a good concept and I'm sure some of the stores are good to work for. This franchise though, i would not recommend. They, upper management above store level, tell you one thing and mean another. The say you get quarterly bonuses but they are non existent, like it covers a dinner out to a Fridays. They tell you quality of life is why your ""competitive"" rate is so low to start and yearly increases they will do whatever they can to prove you did not work hard enough to get a competitive raise, even when your numbers show it. They never have enough managers to keep a store staffed and then expect you to put in extra days, hours, doubles ect. Your ""quality of life"" does not exist. The upper management plays games and is never fully truthful. They lead with fear that if you don't do what you are expected to do you can be let go at anytime."
good,started out here as a prep cook and eventually worked up to general manager. had a great district manager who treated her staff very well and was firm yet fair in her actions. worked here for 6 yrs and was terminated for texting with another associate during business hours. felt i should have been suspended or talked to first given my work history for this company. it was a new district manager that handled my termination and i only worked for him for a couple of weeks. felt the termination was handled unprofessionally and unfairly. the nature of the texts was personal and not work related other that they were sent during business hours. the other employee was not fired and was just as guilty of which i had proof which this district manager refused to look at. until this manager took over the district it was a fine place to work.
good,Very busy location alot of work not enough pay! GREAT STAFF and great food
good,"Little emphasis on planning and stable process performance.  Every day could be something different."
good,"I worked at 1 location in Burke, VA for a month.  I was expecting a transfer to a place closer to Alexandria, VA but no moves were made that I could see. I was to deliver food in my own vehicle and if there was engine trouble I am in to support myself  but the delivery won't be made there is only your salary + whatever tips to make any fixes. Panera needs to implement a system for car needs."
good,I kept asking for more hours because I would only get about 10 on each paycheck (which is biweekly) and I wouldn’t get anymore. They always told me it’s because they are constantly hiring new people so they can’t even give decent hours.
good,"When you are hired, you get this very warm welcome wagon of managers and employees smiling at you and making sure you have what you have what you need. However, as time went on I realized that: "
good,Its a very nice place to work. Most associates and most managers are pretty nice and friendly. It’s very easy to get the gist of your job position and expectations.
good,"The job was okay, it just wasn’t what I wanted to be doing and I felt I needed a change, management was fine a tad inconsistent at times. I would say the most enjoyable part about work would have been the food that I was able to go home with at the end of a shift."
good,Panera is a family oriented restaurant with lots of opportunity to meet new people everyday. I personally enjoyed my time working with my team and meeting the local customers. the only downside was poor scheduling by management.
good,Panera was a good first job but i just don’t make enough money to make it paycheck to paycheck. Also i can’t see me being a Panera worker for the rest of my life.
good,"Had a hard time getting along with some co-workers and some would start up trouble by trying to over-manage the place since managers were very busy. Workers who did not take place serious would get away with it, and nice workers would get over looked."
good,"They dont trust their staff. always creating a stressful work environment. they also dont pay on breaks nor do they allow worked to get free food. it's too easy of a job to be stressed all the time,"
good,Panera Bread has been my place of Employment for 6 years. I’ve never had a set schedule and within the 6 years. I’ve became a team trainer and a Shift supervisor but my pay has hardly increased. The people I work with are worth their weight in gold. But managers could use a lot of improvement.
good,Started out with 24+ hrs a week then slowly the cut my hrs to where it isn't even worth the gas to come to work when I ask for more hrs they say they don't have any yet they keep hiring
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Organized and ran front counter/ bakery. Opened at 5am, set up bakery including all baked pastries, breads, bagels and group sale items by 6am and handled customer operations through lunch. Completed all general operations according to policies in place."
good,I've workerd here for four years and can't say much. There is little room for promotion unless you fit their standards as a perfect employee. The employees are all pretty nice and the management is decent to say the least.
good,"The management was awful. There was zero room  for growth. I want to grow not be stuck. No one would listen to the things I had to say, meaning even requests to managers.Food isn't fresh"
good,"Most days always end up being very fast paced during the breakfast, lunch, and dinner rushes afterward it gets very slow. Managers tend to pick favorites among employees which can be annoying.  You will end up having to move a lot throughout the day performing tasks for customers. My fellow cashiers were very nice to work with and were friendly."
good,eh its an okay place to work. you learn to hate the smell of bagels and none of the managers really care unless its them asking you a favor. the manager is unreasonable.
good,"The first manager that I had was great and I had few issues with. He was promoted to another store, which is when everything fell apart."
good,"I learned many interpersonal skills. The location at which I worked was extremely busy during most times of the day. The friends I met there were wonderful, but the management was poor. The managers did not help much on the floor, and they fired the only decent manager we had. After that, everything went downhill and the turnover rate rose dramatically."
good,"I Have Wonderful Customer Service Skills, Wherever I Go Its Not Greatly Appreciated. I’m Just Looking For A  Place I Can Grow And Help Others As Well.  Panera Didn’t Give Me That Spunk I Was Looking For."
good,"The managers never wanted to do their job and were rude to their extremely hard working employees. And the store was always running out of supplies like foods/ ingredients, cups, and silverware."
good,I worked for Panera Bread starting in 2014. I left in mid 2017. I started at $8.00 and after two and half years and a lot of begging for a raise my pay was raised to $8.25. I'll do you one better. The new people being hired were starting pay at just over $9.00. That's a load of bs.
good,"Panera Bread helps you gain experience in customer services and is a good choice for a first or side job, the coworkers were great but management was very poor."
good,the whole place is understaffed and there is no place to move up with Panera and very underpaid. alot of people who are not working are making it hard for the people that do work.
good,"A typical day consists of making coffee, smoothies, taking customers at the register, bussing tables, managing condiment stations."
good,The job could be great. A lot of personal drama/favoritism. Management is never on one page resulting in employees never on one page. The typical day ranges from relaxed to stressful. Most enjoyable part is when everyone works as a team.
good,Working for this company for as long as I have you tend to see all the ins and outs. But overall working there for 5+ years got me nowhere. Hence my leaving. Hardly any raises given. No benefits. Slow promotion process. And very low pay for the amount of work the associates are dictated to do
good,I worked for almost 2 years and was told I would get a lot of raises and only got one. The job was fairly easy and not hard to learn. I became a certified trainer which was why I got the only raise I did end up getting.
good,This is a fast paced early morning restaurant. This was my first job so I had nothing to compare it to. There was always promise to promote but that didn't materialize as we were always loosing staff.
good,"Panera has some good benefits, however the way managers treated you, and other coworkers treated you was toxic. Loved the regulars who came in on a daily, made the shift nicer."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Management had no control of the store and was always hiding in her office or flirting with other employees. Every order came out wrong. There was no order. Had me lift heavy boxes and climb 8ft ladders while 9 months pregnant.
good,"I Received Nine dollars an hour.My Co-workers were friendly, Easy to get along with and I got special discounts. I was Very great-full because I was at a Time and Place in my Life that I couldn't find work. Management and Communication between Shift Leaders, Assistant Mangers and STORE Mangers was horrible and there was a huge lack in Advance Promotion or Open door POLICY'S.... Overall, I desperately Needed the Money.  Thank you ...."
good,"very fast pace "
good,didn't really like the pay that much especially cause they weren't giving me hours the management was kinda unfair towards me sometimes at least that's how i felt.
good,"they have flexible schedule. They don't meet your hours, a lot of times they are short on pay roll.  I wish they would value their employees more. They give food to charities."
good,Panera Bread is a well-known family restaurant. It can get very hectic on certain times. Not a lot of employees being crossed-trained to cover breaks. It gets supper busy and the management is poorly trained. Barely get raises no matter how good of an associate you are.
good,Team work and communication was not much but I had great use of it and help others enforce it while on thr job. It was a more fun to me then work . calm atmosphere.
good,Friendly co workers but very disorganized schedule. made for one week at a time and it's hard to make plans in advance or book appointments. Most of the time when you come in for a training shift the person training you isnt there or is in another shift position so they put you with someone else last minute.
good,"Management needs serious fixing. Voicing your opinions to even the top dog managers, at least in my stores case will not have any positive affects, and will more than likely have negative ones. A typical day at work includes hectic breakfast, lunch, and dinner rushes with little help from management. When you need a manager most, you will have to search for them, or manage to get them off of their phone and out of the office. District managers do not take complaints from associates, or even associate trainers seriously. It's a shame because I love the people I work with, but even the pay doesn't make it worth staying and not trying to find a new job. Also, as an adverse affect of the managers staying on their phones, the schedule has a tendency of being posted a whole 8 hours before it starts, making planning your outside of work activities nearly impossible. Never in my year+ experience working at Panera has the schedule been posted by the deadline."
good,"The management at Panera Bread is so poor, making it difficult to enjoy your job. I had worked there for over a year with no raise. When asked for a raise, they pushed me aside. Do not recommend working here."
good,"As a delivery driver I had to rely on tips, because the hourly wage was very low. The managers were nice, but could be unhelpful. The pay was not enough to cover most living expenses."
good,the job was cool but management sucked the mangers are very unorganized and are overly stressful. they play favorites and nobody listens when you have a complaint
good,"Poorly managed, upward mobility is a struggle and favoritism is the main drive behind promotions. The company itself has a great culture and would be great to work for if the individual franchises were run better."
good,I prepared food and worked on cooking line.Was required to clean the kitchen and the dining area during the shifts. Also unloaded trucks when the weekly food order came.
good,"Management was a pick snd choose situation, with some well hired and some not. The people were alright to work with, although quite snappy, but hours can be extremely hard to come by. They also hired too many people, and seem to be looking for any reason to cut that short."
good,Managers didn't care about anything. They would sit in the office all day playing games on their phone or talking on the phone. They don't really care about the employees.  If it got busy you would have to beg for help. But you learn how to work together and the other employees are very helpful. They didn't always give you a break unless asked for.
good,"Was great to work at until FMI took over. Food was changed, and the quality of it was horrible. They fired bakers, and made staff take over, so they got paid way less then the bakers did. all their food comes frozen now,when before everything was made in house. truly disappointing."
good,"The job becomes very exhausting, grating, frustrating, and stressful after a while. I'd say if you're looking for a decently paying, relatively flexible, part time summer job, this is perfect. Otherwise avoid."
good,"They do not pay fairly, and they will overwork you and expect you to do multiple jobs plus pick up other people’s slack. Will not be respected by certian managers."
good,"I got a long well with most employees and management."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,needs to treat employees better. too much favoritism in company. company don't hold people accountable. everyone cant voice their opinions. too many illegal things are allowed to happen.
good,There is definitely a mold problem with in the building because working there for maybe an hour or two to my throat would start to tickle my nose start to also tickle feeling irritated and the mini fridge that the pureaes where Cept in smelled of molds and whenever I would open the fridge my nose wpuldfeel extremely irritated and constantly would feel like I have to sneeze
good,My husband is in the service and only has weekends to talk and I was told if I change my availability to only Monday through Friday I wouldn’t get scheduled at all. No benefits worked out. I cut my finger and had to get stitches but it wasn’t covered. I was an associate trainer and promised a raise with the promotion NEVER GOT A RAISE!
good,"I started a week before they were switching companies. I was hired by the first company at an hourly rate I was promised and received"
good,"It's not an awful place to work. The company has good values, but none of the managers will follow it, or the higher ups don't let you follow the values in my case. It's easy to get overlooked for promotions as well"
good,"Panera bread is a good p/t place to work.  There is room to advance (if you work hard at it).  They do give an employee just one benifit( discount on food). "
good,Some of the people there were cool. It was very organized. But they want you to do too much for the job that was required. Yes I'm a hard worker but I felt like I was the step Child anytime I clocked in
good,"Working at Panera Bread was a fun experience, but the lack of manager direction and dedciation to the job was frustrating.  It is difficult to want to work when your manager is in the office all day or is disregarding Panera policies and state food safety laws"
good,"A typical day at Panera is stressful. We are always understaffed and the demand always exceeds the supply. I learned how to communicate effectively with customers in a way to avoid conflict and resolve problems. I also learned how to work 3 stations independently at the same time. Management is hit or miss. Some managers and understanding, caring, and passionate about what they do. Others are negative, degrading of employees, and unprofessional. The workplace culture is fast paced. Everyone is stressed during a rush which we get everyday. The hardest part of my job is convincing the younger employees to take it seriously and act professional around customers. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to create and handle so much food!"
good,"Poor local franchise, low morale, uncleanliness, lack of upward mobility in the region, free meals for managers, busy days go quickly, good training plan"
good,"Work flow was generally steady with periods of incredibly high production.  Most of the staff was warm and friendly and very inviting, however management was often none of these things.  Be prepared to work incredibly hard only to have social connections with the right people be more important to advance."
good,it's fun to start out but not a long time thing to stay their. unless you want to be stuck their for a long time then it's good to be their for  a career
good,"Management had favorites and if you weren't one, you will have less hours and sent home early every day. The guest that come in are really nice and friendly. The other associates are lazy and except others to do their job."
good,The mornings are the best the earlier the better it's a great start to your day. The managers are set the mood of the day with the opening hours. Lunch rush help speed up the day.
good,The management was very poor at the Palomar location. They were not organized at all. Also the back of the house was disgusting as no one ever cleaned
good,Was not a great workplace. The envitoment held a lot of tension. We were always busy Very fast paced. Managment needed work. I would not recommend unless your just looking for a job with hrs.
good,"Pretty much the same as the summary. Not really much else to say really. I'm just filling up the space.  I mean, what else is there to say about working fast food, am I right?"
good,I left Panera because they flat out told me that they weren't going to give me any hours anymore and they treated all the associate like they didn't matter.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to meet new people, and becoming very close with my coworkers and being able to work with them everyday. The hardest part of the job was closing dining, especially on school nights, I wouldn't get home until 10:30pm sometimes 11 maybe, so I wouldn't have time to do my homework most nights."
good,"It is very fast pace, and Always understaffed! The management in cafe and higher up only care about the numbers and not the staff and physical capabilities. Panera is VERY strict on their standards with very little wiggle room, no matter the circumstances. They try to mass hire to prepare for school and holiday seasons, but training is poor as you can feel current staff is overwhelmed. West Lafayette GM is Horrible! Hes a hothead and very rude.  The Mall GM is pretty much oblivious to all issues and never takes responcibility. "
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,registers and barista station are well equip. you help people people with order and ring them up. Opening in the morning is relaxed and gets fast paced during lunch.
good,"Panera would be a better company if the management was more professional. Employees get yelled at in front of customers and personal situations are made into jokes. Managers pit employee against other workers, things are stolen and people are written up without warning."
good,the way things are set up you need to have all star associates who can do the job of 2 people.  There is never enough labor to get through a shift.  A GM is just an associate with keys and a safe code.
good,"Not many pros to the company, many cons though. In my interview I explained that I could not have any less than 36 hours per week and really need 40 when I have bills to pay and what not. So they decide its okay to just cut my hours down to 20 per week without even asking me if thats okay or bringing it to my attention, when I was hired on as a full time employee. Thanks to their very poor managing skills I am pretty much broke and I really think they do not even care. Definitely do not recommend working here at all."
good,Management was typically siding and showing advancement favorship towards worker's who had more time in on the job as opposed to correcting wrongs. I felt undervalued.
good,I worked this job while in school. Depending on location it can be great but management could be hard to work with. The environment is overall a great one.
good,"Any day as a driver at Panera Bread could be different. Very busy and fast, sometimes the store can be pretty dysfunctional to the point where lots of orders go out late, all of the drivers get really competitive about who takes what, everything has to be done very quick. There are aspects that are nice, like scheduling, and having time to myself in the car even if it is just for a couple minutes."
good,"Fun if you like dealing with customers, easy to use computer system. Management is not very flexible, and often come off as rude; workers are treated only as assets, not human beings."
good,"My day is filled with doing dishes and the occasional preparing soups or salads"
good,"Customers were always so nice, food tasted amazing. Just not my favorite choice of work place. I was really looking forward to getting trained in more than what I was trained on."
good,Customers are horrible and rude and requesting off days is a pain. Only 5 people can request off a day and you need 2 weeks in advance. Also switching days is hard
good,"It was good place to work, always  fast paced, always busy, learned different jobs.  I got to work with old friends and made some new friends. My hours kept getting cut and could make enough money to survive."
good,"Was not happy with the pay. Fun people to hang out with, have to work for a lot and know the entire menu. The hardest part is knowing what is all on the menu and to keep the customers always happy!"
good,"If you are not favoured by the managers you are basically screwed. The hours are strenuous (especially for me because I was a student and I would get home near to midnight when the store closed at 9), and when I express to them that I am in school and these hours are hard on me they told me then I should close faster. The icing on the cake is the fact that they don't even post the schedule in advance, so you literally don't find out if you're working that week until the week of. Their schedule basically controls your life."
good,the company was very diverse I enjoyed working there besides the fact that many customers didn't really speak eglish or was elderly and couldn't hear well so id have to raise my voice or try to figure out what they were saying overall my manager was sincere and somewhat understanding.
good,"At the Tippecanoe Mall location, the effort wasn't worth the stress. Being a student, I found it very hard to work and get to class because the management ignored my schedule and had me working over the time I had agreed to upon hire. They were often rude and didn't really praise you for going the extra mile for the customer, even though that's what the Panera board always preached."
good,"They constantly make false promises, and it's extremely difficult to advance in this environment. I strongly do not recommend working with these employers."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,it was a fun job until I got sick and then was verbally yelled at and told that I was not ill. I had never called off in my time of working there and always came in early for them if they were short. I stayed late but when I got sick with the flu they didn't believe me. When starting there I was told that I would be making 9.25 an hour but when i got my first pay check i was only being paid 9.15
good,They expect a lot from employees without much in return. I worked there for over 2 years and could not get a raise and advancement in my position even though expressed this need. Had me training new employees even though I was not considered a trainer
good,"Flexible scheduling. A typical day at work is taking customer orders, helping with complaints and making drinks/food orders. Its okay...nothing burdensome."
good,The management was very hard to bear and deal with. The way employees were treated was inexcusable. But otherwise having the opportunity to learn many things was a win win at working at Panera Bread.
good,"a typical day at panera was always a busy day, always rushed. management wasn't a good team. Co-wrokers we fun and friendly. the hardest part of panera is the speed of having to complete an order under 5 minuets plus having phone orders at the same time. the enjoyably part of the job was the co-workers very friendly people."
good,"They are usually short employees which makes it hard to do the job and adds a lot of stress. Doesn't pay well either. Company keeps raising the food prices, but doesn't give employee raises. Currently cutting back on supplies too, so always running out of things. Not good customer service and hard to do the job."
good,"a typical day at this job is getting there alittle early  getting ready for the job to start clocking in and going to work.The most enjoyable part of my job is visiting with the regular customers, They are Great,they make everyday a fun one,when your having a particularly hard day of work They always have something nice to say or a big Hug that's one of the reasons I work here."
good,management went down hill when new gm came. we lost 2 managers since then. Other then that you will be getting new managers in and out once you start there
good,"The higher ups (Dm, Gm) pick favourites and stick to them no matter what. Spent a year of hard work just to end up quitting and going to the labour board to deal with being denied breaks for 11 hour shifts, being denied proper wage, things of that nature. Always pay attention to employee turn over rate."
good,"A typical day at work had many things going wrong. This did not allow for great costumer service. Management was unorganized. A lot of communication issues. Co-workers were nice, they kept to themselves. The hardest part about the job was closing. The most enjoyable part of the job was washing dishes. I learned that in chaotic environments, such as Panera Bread during rush-lunch-hour, communication is very important."
good,"I am a shift supervisor at a franchise. There is no work/life balance at Panera. I work at Panera and go to school, and as a result I barely have time to do my homework. Let alone something that I enjoy to decompress. This is a stressful position with very low pay. The closing manager is the only manager on duty for 6-8 hours and we are always understaffed. "
good,"Room to grow, a typical day is ensuring everyone gets to work and the job gets done and customers are pleased. Company has deep ties in the community and take pride in all work."
good,"Gets the job down when it comes to making very small amounts of cash. But if you are one of the better workers, depending on the manager, some people may try and take advantage of you and your skills."
good,"My co-workers are great and a couple of the managers/shifts are awesome too. I just can't get passed the idea that such an A hole  is a GM at my location. He is a huge hypocrite and such a D-bag to his employees. He talks about everyone behind their back, mocks everyone. He also lets PRIVATE information slip. He should have been fired long ago for that reason alone. He talks about medical conditions of his employees and pushes unrealistic goals when he himself can't meet them."
good,I would've loved to still be working for Panera if they were under new management. I feel the managers weren't as hands on as they should have been. The weekly schedules were constantly being changed and it soon interfered with my personal life.
good,"Inconsistent scheduling."
good,"The Panera I had worked at was staffed mainly by high schoolers, who didn't understand how a work environment was different to that of school. However, along with the hourly staff, the managers had a tendency to act childish and crude. There were crude and rude joke thrown around at any second, the managers would yell at their friends or significant others on the phone during work hours rather than taking care of their responsibilities, there was little sense of urgency for the costumer or organization. Overall, it was an unpleasant and immature place, thus my leaving."
good,Company has great food. Need to work on Management and how its run. Also lots of promises that are not fulfilled. Not enough people working at night to get everything that needs to be done done correctly.
good,"A typical day at work would generally be stressful and unorganized, people are to do multiple jobs at once that they wouldn't be compensated for and didn't sign up for, I learned the realities of the food industry, however, management could be very unprofessional at times. My co-workers were very reliable and easy to socialize with, however the hardest part of the job was generally management, and they wouldn't give anybody space to do their job because they're afraid of being hounded by HQ if something isn't done right. The most enjoyable part of the job was certainly the employees and people I got to meet in the process."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"customers are clueless "
good,Panera was a tough job for me to work because the management was unorganized and always understaffed.he most enjoyable part of the job who interacting with customers who really valued and enjoyed the preparation of the food.
good,"Responsible for opening and scheduling team members"
good,"There are many ways that Panera could be improved. The benefits are great for today's economy, but the company overall is set up to make one fail. No matter how hard one works, it's never good enough."
good,I enjoyed my time here but one manager ruined it for me so that would be the only thing I didn't like great starter job.  I would have to be there at about 6 am and if I was a minute late I would get chewed out. I would work until 9 then if they didn't have anything for me to do they would send me home which was why I left I was paying more to get there then they would actually let me work.
good,"Although I really enjoyed my time spent being a trainer as much as I enjoyed helping my co-workers and customers after five years with this company I learned how easy it is for a store's culture to change for the worst. A typical day was always very busy which I enjoyed, however, attending to customer needs while training new employees was a challenge. The hardest part of the job was dealing with a unprofessional management team who hired their friends, refused to help when busy, and enjoyed bringing those working under them down. They also brought illegal substances into the work place and when I addressed it I got a threat instead of solution. The pay was okay but I had to point out the benefits I brought to the job in order to achieve a raise. Overall the experience was a very good lesson and has made me grow as a person."
good,"Little cooperation in setting any member of the team up for success. Every evening I'd come in to my station left a mess from the day crew and management showed no compassion in helping me get ready for my long night ahead. Most nights you worked alone, creating thousands of dollars worth of baked goods. "
good,"Aside from the pay and some kind coworkers, I will never find myself working there again in the future.  The management as a whole has a poor attitude and on numerous occasions is disrespectful to the associates."
good,"They honestly are a great company, but some locations are trained better then others they promise there employees things and never follow up"
good,"learn how to deal with customer directly, learn preparation in limited time, and get ready, like the team worl specially when everybody does his work."
good,Great place if you were in high school who wanted to make some money after school.
good,"I would come dressed in my uniform, clock in get my register and count it to make sure i started with $200 dollars. Then ring in customers orders. If they ordered pastries, bagels or barista drinks I would get it for them. When there was any down time I would do some necessary cleaning up. I learned how to improve customer service and keeping customers happy. My co workers were easy to get along, I grew very close to a lot of them. The hardest part of the job was during our big lunch and dinner rushes. Maintaining a fast  speed and making sure everything was accurate. The most enjoyable part was communicating with nice customers. I got to know reoccurring customers on a personal level."
good,"On average, the customers with make your day with unexpected tips and conversation. Making others smile by giving your helping hand is my favorite part."
good,"A typical day at work includes taking care of customers and making sure the front area is organized and clean. While at Panera Bread, I learned patience. The management team was not well organized; they could have done better to work together. They also could have done more to assist the associates. My co-workers always did their best. They worked to the best of their ability. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude and unruly customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was bonding with my co-workers, becoming friends with them and enjoying their company."
good,"This was the most unorganized job I have ever had.  Give hours to those that don't want to work, versus those that do.  "
good,"They paint a mince picuture for you when you get hired. But it was completely different. I didn't think I was going to feel like a was in highschool all over again. A few of the managers are AMAZING, don't get me wrong. But some of the othe managers are not professional at all. Makes me wonder how they get to keep their jobs and I had to lose mine."
good,"It is a faced paced job. There is a breakfast, lunch, and usually two dinner rushes. These require the entire staff including the management team to be working at full speed. You will learn loads about customer service & satisfaction. Every management team is different based on the location."
good,Panera Bread has great food. Not enough hours to give out. Work schedule they give out be little to none and if over staff they will cut your hours. Has great work benefits
good,My specific location had some managers that were lazy but the over all experience was not bad. My coworkers were very helpful and made work fun. They did not do very well with advancement. I did not get a raise until about a year and a half later.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Depends on the location but the particular one I worked at was unorganized, managers give you an attitude when other employees call out, not enough pay but they want you to work extra hard and extra long hours. Managers get upset when you worked your scheduled shift and have to leave. The job is not hard but depending on the location you won’t have the best time working there."
good,"Working at Panera is a simple job, good for students who can only work a few hours a week. Management lacks. Raises are not given when they are promised and nobody receives their 6 month raise when it is due. There is no room to grow or move up in positions. Most of the employees are fun, positive people who are great to work with. Overall, Panera bread is a good first job but it does not pay well for individuals who have bills to pay."
good,"The day starts with constant customer/employee interactions. Communication from support center to stores is not optimal. "
good,"Your coworkers become sorta like a proxy family, this can be a good thing and a bad thing. It is easy to fill the void when someone moves on to better horizons. But it is also very easy to get caught up in it all and get stuck in a rut of doing the same job. I really didn't see myself working at panera for more that 2 years, but now I'm finishing my 3rd and working towards my 4th. Good for high schoolers and college students who don't have many job offerings"
good,"I ultimately left because they couldn’t schedule with my availability. I experienced a management change from one manager who was far too lax and hated by his staff to one who was much more strict, but rude and off-putting to her staff, especially the ones who had been there a while. I also never received a raise or promotion even though I worked there six months. Training was also subpar, I had to figure most out by myself and never received official training on anything other than drive thru"
good,They are highly unorganized when it comes to management. Everyone at work complains about work and it us extremely stressful to work there. The scheduling does not par with what I have constantly been saying that I need. They are too needy. You have to be up to par with the speed of service. They are a decent place to work for if you have never worked with food before. If you have you will realize that this place is not worth the trouble.
good,A typical day could be anything from busy to dead slow depending on weather and public events. The people are overall fun to work with and can be your greatest allies in a group effort or venture. I will miss the peaceful morning right before the lunch crowd.
good,Managers tried to do my work for me while on break and it ended up in me needing to stay over my scheduled time by 2 hours and if the closing people dont finish in time you are forced to help them
good,"I personally felt like it was an okay job, it got extremely busy in the morning and afternoon. I worked in dining room so you were responsible for running food to the tables, cleaning tables, assisting customers with their food like returning food back to window if order was wrong, getting extra dressing,butter etc. Also, you have to make sure trash cans aren't full, change out the coffee, clean bathrooms, and refill and make bubbler drinks. If you close in dining room you are expected to do all of this as well as then clean the entire dining room area, clean out and wash all the drinks and sweep and mop the entire area included the bathrooms. I felt as if the pay didn't match all the work that was given to you. The hourly pay definitely should have been around $12-$13 to match all of the work you had to do..."
good,Its was an okay place I didn’t last long due to irrelevant reasons but I really would recommend someone if they’re determined and passionate about the job.
good,"Is a kind if job for students max a"
good,"Company process is good on paper but the labor expectation vs what’s needed is not balanced "
good,"I was a delivery driver, all I had to do was buss,run tables,and deliver the food. "
good,Very strict management and very busy work hours. Worked for over 8 hours and only received a 30 minute break. You do get a pretty generous discount and free drinks.
good,Management is terrible makes the place none injoyable to work. Will run their best workers in the ground. If your lucky you will be in the same position for for a week until someone call off.
good,"Not the best place to work"
good,Overall the days went by quickly because of how faced paced it was. I worked with very nice people. The management was very strict about just talking after a big rush of people.
good,As much as I didn't like working here it was a great start for me. It was my first job and opened up my eyes to the different type of people that I would have to encounter in the work force. All in all it helped me grow
good,"I like my coworkers and most of my managers, but I never got a raise, the costumers were mean, and I rarely ever got breaks on 6+ hour shifts. The management is a complete mess, too. While they're all nice individually, there is a clear lack of communication between them. I've cried and had anxiety attacks at work numerous times because of the awful working conditions."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Personally, there were many things that I did not like about the specific location I worked at, but I made the best of it, until I was ready to leave."
good,"Overall, a decently run company. Anyone can become a manager, with literally no skills or personality. Corporate does not listen to the opinions of it's employees about management or the food or how things are done in the cafe in general. The pay is terrible for the amount of work that is asked of employees, even management doesn't get paid enough. It is not worth it to advance in this company. For a high schooler looking for a first time job or someone just looking for part time work, it might not be that bad. Overall, employees are great, but corporate and the pay make it not worth it to stay very long."
good,"typical work day: drive, run around the dining room to fetch dishes to then wash them because the dining room attendant is too busy chatting pure nonsense with the customers. and whatever the manager wants you to do. these tasks vary from replacing the light bulbs on a ladder that supports only 225 lbs to scrubbing floors and area tiles. sounds fun doesnt it? I only liked one of my managers cause she was attractive the rest I could care less for them. disrespect me right back at you.. hardest part of job was when you made less than $50 after an eight shift and since you cant clock yourself out, you're held against your will to do those daunting tasks."
good,"Panera does not treat their delivery drivers right if an incident happens on the road. Even if no one was hurt and nothing was damaged, they will still let you go. Doesn't matter if you had a clean driving record and was a hard worker, they will tell you that you can't drive anymore. Don't waste your time applying for this position because its not worth it."
good,"It's a job.just do your job according to standard. Customers are amazing. Come in setup, work hard. Teamwork makes the dream work! Cashiering is easy just make sure you greet customers as soon as they h"
good,Great place to work in just as long as you’re okay with no raises aside from the legal minimum wage change. Some managers have anger issues and another one acts like it’s high school & spends their shift gossiping. Employees are allowed to slack off very often & rarely get disciplined. At first seems like fun but then no one knows how to do their job during extremely fast paced times.
good,Management could be worked on. Pay isn’t great AT all but it’s a good first job to have or while in school. Advancement in company is lacking. Work doesn’t match pay
good,Some days tension can be high but that is normal for any food atmosphere. Being an employee there now for a year I can say I have leaned a lot . The management team is OK. But overall i would recommend anyone to work here.
good,"At Panera, Hard work goes un-noticed. I was the first one in or the first one out depending on the day. you can be great at your job and still no advancment."
good,"I like working there, I just don't get enough hours and you usually have one task all day which can get quite boring or even repetative, especially in the customer service areas."
good,Covelli Panera is not a bad place to work if you have the right staff and team members! It a fun place to work where you build great friendships and learn a lot about yourself and self control.
good,Still trying to figure out how there can be 3 managers working one shift without much getting done at times.The GM only was active as in working with the rest of us whenever the higher ups were there. She mostly hid in the back office. According to the GM it wasn't her job to manage. Definitely noticed that it wasn't a fair employee treatment. As well as an overall inconsistency.
good,"When I first was hired, they were in the process of switching to a new location, so I only got to meet two of the four managers that I would be working with. Training was excellent, even though the trainers were obviously not informed when or where they would be training people, also received free food during training which was very nice. The transition from one cafe to another was perfect. Moved to new location and every thing went down hill, maybe five people were actually working when they clocked in. Then they switched managers and none of them cared at all about their employees. The general manager is awesome and the only person you can ever really go to for help but he is also overworked. "
good,"Do your self a favor and don't apply to be a delivery driver with Panera Bread.  The base pay while in the store is 9.00 per hour , when delivering your pay rate changes to 6$ per hour. "
good,The managers know what needs to be maintained and they enforce it. Cleaning is very important and customer service is a must. Do not work here if you needs livable paycheck or if you can’t serve food and clean at the same time.
good,"Overall the people were nice, but being a delivery driver got stressful at times. People were lousy with tips and don't get payed enough for mileage. A lot of the time I was cleaning the dining room and mopping floors. Also being a new comer, they stacked me on hours, almost 5 out of 7 days of week and a whole day on weekend if you asked for less. Wouldn't work there again to much commitment and too stressful."
good,"The job was fun, the environment was fun, but whenever there was a problem management did not attempt to solve it. Besides that it is a good job but management has to change"
good,"This place is not somewhere one would go to work full time for years.  If you're looking for a place to put in your time to help give you time to prepare for something better in life, this is it."
good,"It would be a great place to work if they actually had management willing to help their employees in a time of need.  Spending 11 hours baking for an entire store chain, knowing that it was harder on the employee, never seemed to bother management nearly as much as you would think it would."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Management was pretty poor, would micromanage the employees. No breaks even for long shifts. Would get very busy at times with only a few employees scheduled. You did get a 50% employee discount."
good,Panera bread is more of a stepping stone place to work than I feel it is meant for a career. I am looking for a career position. Some of the staff and managers are very professional where as some of them are definitely not.
good,Panera Bread was a great first job . They gave me a lot of respect and helped me through the steps of being the best employee I could be . Panera Breads system showed me responsibility and respect .
good,"The hardest part about this job is that there is a lack of communication between managers, everything from scheduling to days off, how situations should be handled to the way managers communicate with one another could be very frustrating This lack of communication showed and effected team morale"
good,"I looked forward to working here in the beginning. I was excited to come into work, do my best and walk away with my delivery tips in hand. It was easier than living paycheck to paycheck, and I generally made good tips because we're a busy location. It wasn't until I met a particular employee that my job changed. "
good,"There was no leadership, the time scheduled for me was posted a day before or the day of the next week. There was no real penalty for showing up late or slacking off on the Job."
good,The management was so bad that it was hard to believe any of them ever got a job in the first place. They should have way better training for the managers. The job itself was a good and enjoyable job.
good,"While i worked at panera i saw a lot of ""cliques"" and favorites. These were the people that had first choice in where they wanted to work, who they wanted to work with. Some of management was great and the rest was not so much. I don't recommend it as a full time job if you can avoid it."
good,"Panera Bread was fine to work with. Again, really enjoyed working with the people, but the management seemed too into themselves, they were really hard to talk to and now the store I worked at, they aren't even there anymore. Wouldn't really recommend working there unless you just really can't get into anywhere else or you're starting out on your first job."
good,"I came back from maternity leave and as a breast feeding mom, I had no support during pumping because I had to come off of my position at specific times. I felt pressured to stop breast feeding for fear of losing my job."
good,"Panera is a good job for gaining experience in a working environment. However, as I have gotten older, I became craving for more responsibility and a better work environment."
good,"there is a shortage of managers.  the get-go around the street pays $10.00/hr plus a $500 sign on bonus.  there is always turnover.  the start pay is only slightly more than minimum wage.  there's an employee incentive program of  $0.25/hr pay increase if you refer a friend which is ridiculous.  that's above my pay grade.  the days i do get off i'm always on edge that you will be called in to come in.  if you don't come in you are peer pressured/manipulated y you didn't.  this could be a great job with the right ppl, mgt & pay.  it does have flexible hrs & a more fun work environment but other aspects like pay, being overworked, constant change in management, etc need drastic improvement. what can you do?"
good,"when I was working there we had a change of management, it could have gotten a whole lot smoother. The new GM immediately started cutting hours and increasing workload. I was planning to stay it's in the company for many years but that quickly changed and I had to leave immediately. Managers are severely underpaid. Favoritism is certainly a problem."
good,Working for this company gave me a really good idea on how most businesses run and allowed me to expand on their ideas to make it even better. I personally learned tons of skills working for this company which has helped me immensley when I move forward in my career. I did on the other hand find some situations unprofessional and noticed how some things did not run how they were supposed to but as time flew by we progressed from it.
good,"Although personally I loved the managers and people I worked with, they would refuse to listen to the hours I needed. I said I could only work a limited amount of time while still in school, and they continued to schedule me."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Inside Sales Remote Panera Catering. They want tons of calls little to no commission. Promotion entails more calls. Wack and dumb way of thinking and operating.
good,"The hardest part of working at Panera were the hours, sometimes I would work a later and then be expected back at 5 am. The most enjoyable part of working here was my co-workers and being able to interact with a diverse group of customers daily."
good,"Really depends on management. It's a good place if you like change. You can easily transition to different roles, since duties are sectioned off. So for example, if you don't like cash shift, you can ask to be trained for dish. Downside is that if someone calls in sick for a certain section, you'll be expected to close or manage a section by yourself, meaning double the work."
good,It gets really busy so you have to always be prepared for a fast paced work environment.I learned that even if the customer isnt always right you have to make sure they leave happy.
good,Management  and hours are inconsistent. Some managers are hostile and hard to approach. Clear favoritism is shown from the management on to the employees.
good,"The management team never listens to associate as well as always switching managers. When asked for days off, I would usually get it. However, if I couldn't work certain days due to college, managers will still schedule me the shifts I couldn't attend to."
good,Management was disrespectful at times and had no real value of family. They were dstirct on days off they didnt care about if you had a family emergency they still wanted a doctor note and that was a hippa violation
good,"I would not recommend the ""new"" version of this company to an outsider. The upper support team is amazing and professional with the exception of this team the company is very negative. I would absolutely advise potential associates to apply and welcome the opportunity. The management experience has changed."
good,"typically the work day consisted of running orders, checking orders, making sure the systems received the orders than next checking your co workers attention to the order. cleaning tables , and greeting the customers and having an upbeat spirit. the management was really poor at the time because people were underpaid as well as they picked and choose who they wanted to have certain hours . the most enjoyable part is watching the customers leave happy no matter what."
good,"Would not recommend pregnant people to work here. I left because they wouldn't abide by the doctors orders even after getting a doctors note, they also said they have a business to run."
good,High expectations and intense environment. Management pushes you to work outside of availability and drives promotion. Opportunity for quick promotions. Can be rewarding but equally can be stressful
good,Managers were horrible and always picking favorites and never appreciated anything. Fired me because i couldn't come in because of school. Job is stressful and fast paced.
good,Went in at 4am and worked until midnight some times. They paid very little. Came out to about 3 dolars an hour. Not sure how much more I'm supposed to say.
good,the most enjoyable part of the entire job was interacting with the guest that would come in. I loved the people that i was working with and the management did the best that they could in order to make things run smoother.
good,"I am a small 5'4"" woman and I was given tasks that were inappropriate for a girl. This is not to say that I don't think women are capable of many different tasks, but to send a woman out to tell a homeless man to remove themselves from the patio is just dangerous."
good,Pretty normal job. Very fast paced. Especially in drive thru. Be prepared to work if you are hired. Everyone tries to work together but a lot of the employees butt heads.
good,"I was an associate. I had to take customers orders, clean tables, stock everything, do the dishes, and help on line and barista. They would schedule me 35-40 hours a week when I was supposed to be part time, and I was in high school. I did not mind the money and some of the coworkers went to my school so I did not mind being there that many hours. However there were a lot of issues behind the scenes. They allowed things that should not have been allowed. Some managers had favorites and if you were you would not have to do anything, and if you were not you would have to do everything. I was always generous and helped as much as I could, I covered people, did what they asked, but they ended up taking advantage of it. I ended up leaving because I got really sick with the flu I couldn't get out of bed or eat anything for a week. Everyday I had to work while I was sick I found a cover. One day the only person I could find (because we were very short staffed because of people constantly coming and going) was going to be like 30 minutes late. They wanted me to come in because I had not but I told them they would just send me home because I am too sick to be around food, and they did not care and told me if I did not come in I would be fired so I had no choice. I enjoyed the customers and it was a great learning experience for a first job."
good,"They want consistency, but not with the managers. Management uses their power to make employees quit, or get terminated. Drama is crazy over there. Super easy job, but the employees make it worse. Everyone has a problem"
good,"The work that I do at Panera is not stressful in itself, however. there is a lack of what I refer to as the three C's. Communication, consideration (co-workers being considerate) and Consistency. There are too many different approaches to how to do certain tasks on the job as well as a lack of management willingness to recognize when there is no work being done by some and all the work or most of it being done by others.  The last statement does not affect me directly, but the three C's do and it would be a much better place to work if those three C 's ere adhered to and followed on a CONSISTENT basis."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"You won't be able to afford rent, or afford car maintenance at this job. Definitely not a long term job. If you're willing to wear down your vehicle with under minimum wage pay then go ahead. You could say ""oh, well that's why it's a part time 'teenage' job."", and unless your parents are paying your maintenance bills, you won't be spending any of what you make to stay on top of things. Sure, try and get more hours but then you're driving more (more wear and tear) and if you're having a bad tip night you'll only be getting paid ($5 an hour for me driving) the driving amount. When the time comes where your car breaks down or you get a flat and can't pay for it, you'll be stuck on dishes until your bi-weekly pay is enough for your vehicle bills...unless you have to pay rent then you'll have to either find another job or stay on dish to scrape up enough money."
good,"I really did enjoy my time at Panera, work humor and people who do work there are usually great. Lots of negativity at the work place, and little recognition for those who do work hard. Overall it was a fun experience but advancement seems kind of hard for those deserving and those who aren't seem to run up the ladder."
good,"Before we were bought out, the previous owners CARED about their employees. They would offer raises, free meals, lots of praise and recognition for your work. Now? Don't expect raises, promotions, free food, or any recognition AT ALL! The managers care and they try to make all schedules work.Besides my managers and the pay, I hate this place."
good,"Exhausting work with little to no compensation or pay. Managers were alright, not very helpful or present. Nice discount at any Panera bread, 40% percent off your meal and at the end of the night sometimes free bread of pastries."
good,"when i worked at panera they seemed like a great place to be, had great associate training, and really seemed to reward hard workers. however after a year i had gotten on the wrong side of one of assistant managers, and was pretty much shut down and shoved off the schedule even though i was supposed to be becoming an assistant manager myself. this totally ruined my experience there and i would never return to panera simply because of how one person in management can pretty much end your career there at whim."
good,"Panera doesn't pay employees fairly. They are overworked with little benefits. This place does teach you how to work hard and deal with customers constantly. I would not suggest it to somebody trying to advance careers, however as a teenager/ young adult looking for job experience, panera would be a great way to go."
good,"Great job, pays very well. Outgoing costumers, but mangers are very immature and rude. I wouldn’t recommend anyone to work at the Panrea on 15th In Tulsa ok. Not sure about others."
good,"Depending on market, job titles and expectations differ. "
good,I would often get stressed out because I would have different people telling me what to do at the same time. I felt I wasn't getting paid enough. I felt like Panera wasn't the best fit for me.
good,Was really fun at the start got alone with everyone all in our positions all would go well new boss  got things confused and told me i was a liar my policy call me a liar or a thief and I am gone because i am neither
good,"Started working there because I heard they were really good for giving their employees a lot of hours, which I needed. Got hired right away, was okay for the first couple weeks. Then it became overwhelming because they had me 4 pm- 11 pm almost every night, and as a student I couldn’t balance it anymore. I had to change my availability and the manager got an attitude with me about it rather than trying to be understanding. There’s no communication whatsoever between manager and employees, anything important I always found out through hearing employee conversations with other employees. There was a lot of favoritism as well which I think is unprofessional. Then all of a sudden I went from having 26-30 hours a week, to only 4, with no warning. Very unpredictable scheduling after that."
good,"The coworkers are usually fine to deal with. Must be able to work at a fast-pace. High chance you won't get many hours, depending on your availability."
good,Mostly young people work at food places and the managers are older and never treat you like an equal or like a respectable individual and in return creates a toxic stressful environment for the workers which makes you feel like you'll never be good enough.
good,working over night independently producing mass quantities of baked goods working in an environment with great people always learning about new and updated items Panera is putting out
good,"I worked at panera for about 16-17 months I used to enjoy panera but now I feel as though I’ve out growned them , panera is an okay dining spot for the most part I feel as though they could work on promotions and achievements a little better & their organization could be a little better like the scheduling and making sure the following weeks schedule is out before the week .. panera in Conshohocken had a lot of personal relationships and they couldn’t separate the two .."
good,"I would not reccomamd anybody to work at this place. The management is terrible and lazy,they expect you to do other employees jobs."
good,"I would go in to work and open the lines, but the thing about this place is just that the manager really doesn't care about you. You're underpaid, unappreciated, overworked, but no one acknowledges your efforts. I like the employees, 2/4 managers are amazing, but the rest are full of bologna. I would recommend working here because it's easy to get a job and also it's good for temporary work, but.. everything else is bad."
good,"Very fun atmosphere love the people I work with I just need more pay, they’ve been making a lot of changes in the company and I don’t like the direction in where they’re going."
good,It’s a great place to eat and hang out at. They really are a good corporation. I learned a lot about what they give back to the community. Sadly my experience wasn’t that great. The managers I had didn’t communicate very well with each other. When I told them I was going out of town (4 weeks before hand) I got a call while I was out of town saying I was on the schedule and got in trouble for not showing up. They messed up my schedule multiple times and didn’t want to take the credit for messing it up.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,The job is pretty simple. It's bust during certain hours of the way and then dies down during other. The management at the particular one I work for is poor. The hardest part of the job is when we get swarmed with orders and we don't have enough employees.
good,"they do not give breaks when they are supposed to, they like to love to move your hours around constantly, and you always stay longer than you should, so if you have a busy schedule don't apply here."
good,"its a little difficult to move up or even get a decent raise. management  usually sucks but the work can be easy until managment forgets to manage,  then you have short staffed shifts, or are unprepared for peak rush hours"
good,"worked for this company for 6 years and have yet to be advance, like all places there is high favoritism. the management is fair but sometimes strict. its a job that keeps me employed but i am happy to work there."
good,If Panera actually ran according to their ideals (concept essence and cultural values) then it would be the perfect job. There is too much politics at play in this business. Only certain people move up if they are liked. Turnover is high. As long as you keep everyone happy then you can keep your job.
good,"When I first started working at Panera, I was extremely pleased and I loved the different type of customers that came in. However, sometimes customers were rude and impatient which made it a bit hard to do my job. I enjoyed the learning experience of having patience though."
good,"I have stuck with this position only because I enjoyed the customers and I enjoy customer service. The store was kept clean."
good,I loved the people that i worked with. the manager seemed to have an issue with communication. the hours they has me work were a little crazy for the amount that i was being paid.
good,"Panera is a great place to work if you are an associate.  Once you become anything more, you are forced to be available 24/7.  You do learn a lot of skills and there is plenty of room for advancement but it not worth the pay or the hours.  As a manager you don't get to take breaks and when you finally want to sit down to take a breath of air, someone is calling you to do something again."
good,"management advancement by previous job title type seniority doesn't work in a new chain, particualrly one that wants to reduce food waste/their carbon footprint. "
good,"I’ve been working at panera bread for going on to two years and my experience has truly been mediocre. The pay rates are not fair ; people who are hard working make about 8.75 per hour where as terrible workers make a lot more. They’re unorganized , they management is immature and even while working full time the benefits aren’t worth it . I would not recommend working here to anyone I even remotely like."
good,Great place to work  because of the co workers .They pay cheap ( typical restaurant) . You will never get a pay raise. You hardly get enough hours and management talks to you like you are a child.
good,"Working for Panera is a cluster if the store is run poorly. Very little work/life balance. It feels as if you're always on the clock, especially as a scheduling manager."
good,This franchise is run like a fast food establishment. The staff is all part time without benefits. The food is premade and finished off on site except for the bread.
good,"It is a good company to work for, but the location I was in was difficult to embrace and love my job because not everyone was held accountable the same way. "
good,This may be a great work place for some people. there's not a whole lot of flexibility with school/life. Management was okay. Better for full time workers.
good,"Learning new things, great co workers, office manager easy going, taste testing. Diversity, I enjoyed serving the community. making gourmet sandwiched, salads. The worst was dish washing. Tons of dishes to wash everyday, but always have gotten the job done."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"How well a workday goes can vary, but a combination of poor/incompetent management, (varies by manager) + very high volume of customers can make it a living nightmare at times. Other times, it's very slow and we can all relax. "
good,"It was fast paced and I was usually pretty busy. The hardest part was working the food line during a busy time like lunch rush, dinner rush, or during the peak of the holiday season. I was enjoyable because the majority of people I got to work with your nice people. My manager was not always the happiest person on earth. Overall my experience wasn't terrible. I just prefer not to work in the food industry anymore"
good,Poor management and no advancement. Regular changes of hours with no notice and poor scheduling leading to confusion. Inter-office drama had a strong influence over scheduling and duties.
good,You go in speak to all the other associates put you apron on clock in and get to work or look at deployment which is where you would be at for the day or night. The management is good all the way up to on person. the workplace is very clean and efficient. the hardest part is honestly nothing and the most enjoyable part are the associates they always have positive attitudes and have very good work ethics
good,"This place is great for minors who think that $8.50 an hour is a lot of money!  As far as the company, their benefits are terrible. No medical benefits unless you become a shift manager.  You must work there a whole year just to get 1 week's paid vacation.  Most of the shift managers are terrible slave drivers who work you long hours... 9 or 10 hours a day. They give you a break when they can, only 15 to 30 minutes at most. If you are a minor you will get a full 30 minutes - not because they care about you -- but only because it is the law! They treat you like garbage and make you sweep and mop before you can go on a break, go home, or get your pay check.  They will never let you out on time, they talk down to you most of the time. Whenever there is a mistake with a sandwich they will come up to you and yell at you in front of everyone, and interrupting the customer in front of you.  They yell at you even if the mistake was not your fault. They are just terrible. It's a shame because this company could be so much better if they treated their employees right. They treat their customers like gold. There is a lot of turnover with employees there, and I can see why.  This is a good place though to gain experience in all aspects of the restaurant business. You can also move up quickly if you are eager. This is no job for any middle-aged person though.  It was an easy job to get hired. Easy interview.  A quick way to get a job."
good,I learned many things however it got very boring fast and you would just sit there and do nothing however management was relaxed but rude. Many tons of friends but quit within a month.
good,"Never got breaks, did a lot of hard labor for no real compensation. Managers didn't like to give raises and I worked for over 4 years with minimal raise opportunities while working consistently 40 hours or more a week."
good,"it was hard to keep people there so we were often short staffed, making your daily job very stressful.  managers were generally not very helpful either, they hid in the office when it was busy instead of helping."
good,"Immediate managers were friendly, I did not appreciate the hospitality of the corporate managers of the many times they would come into the store not one introduced themselves, which I guess is the case in a lot of jobs, however it lacked the hospitality."
good,Baking for Panera Bread was stress free and required little thought or special skills. Some of the coworkers made this job unbearable and I'm guessing the third shift hours have cultivated this negative attitude for them.
good,Awful training / Supervisors not well trained   never enough hours/ on line training was very confusing computers never working/ Assistant Managers not well trained.
good,"Management is very unprofessional when it comes to handling schedules, conflicts, and angry customers. If you're good at your job, you end up picking up the slack of everyone else. Managers invite you to tell them what others should work on, but nothing changes so it's a waste of time. You are held responsible for everything being done correctly though so you basically have to pick up the slack. The schedule is posted the same day every week, but changes are randomly made sometimes without anything being mentioned. Managers are allowed to tell employees that they work when they're not even on the schedule which is unacceptable for a business.  You're expected to just know that it changed. The GM is very passive aggressive. If you're not her friend, she cuts your hours and is rude while you are at work. It is an overall bad work environment to be in."
good,As of this year (2017) I will have worked at my specific Panera Bread location for 3 years. So my views may not reflect the actual conditions of the company.
good,"The job was manageable, the work itself was not difficult, but the managers expected the job to be your only focus. Known for making employees cry due to stress. Managers picked favorites and were unforgiving asking for shifts covered even due to illness. The other employees were fun and kind and made the work enjoyable. The job was physically demanding and exhausting. Managers gave better treatment to those who gave up their lunch breaks than to those who took their lunch breaks."
good,You walk in and clock in at the time your scheduled. Walk tot he line wash your hands and get ready for a rush with at least 20 people waiting to order food. Before you start to put on your gloves you have to make sure your line it's stocked and cleaned. I have to make sure the food that goes out to the customers  looks good and have the right measurements of food.
good,"quick paced and demanding but not difficult, solid foundations of teamwork and personal accountability, misleading ad campaign (food is not all natural - most comes in the form of frozen goo)"
good,"The majority of my shifts were in the morning and afternoon, which I liked. The pay was pretty good. However, there's not much respect for life outside work. Your shift doesn't always end at the time you were scheduled to end, which was frustrating for someone like me who was working and going to school at the same time. In addition, if you're not part of ""the clique"", you're seen as the black sheep. In fact, some people who were only working there for a few months were promoted to higher positions over people who were there for a year and a half, like me."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,I was able to advance to management quickly but the lack of leadership is very stressful. I work long hours and I am responsible for every aspect of catering. We lack management and have struggled the last year.
good,My experience at Panera were good and bad. Working with people on a daily basis is wonderful although it can be tedious.  It's a great job for young adults.
good,Working here was fun and enjoyable.  I loved that we had regular customers and always knew what they wanted.  I really was impressed at the care they really took in preparing customers orders.
good,"A typical day at Panera Bread is filled with fun employees who like to have fun, but also know when it is time to get work done. I have learned the skills of managing a group of employees and successfully run a shift. The employees who work at panera are nothing but nice individuals. I would say the hardest part of my job is to make sure I stay calm during our busy rushes. Sometimes it can be overwhelming, but have to just breathe and stay calm."
good,"Erratic, long hours. Some employees are very motivated and a pleasure to work with. Others were hostile and not interested in excelling at their job. The company had some unrealistic expectations of management staff-I.e. To frequently stay well beyond scheduled work time, leave very late in the evening and return very early the next day (with many employees living a good distance from the store)"
good,I would get the store ready for openings. I didnt enjoy this job because the management was very unfair and one of them stole from me. I also was given so may different positions due to them being short staffed. I did enjoy working the bakery side of the store.
good,"you get short breaks and they overwork you, but everyone has a great camaraderie. Some managers tend to be hypocritical and rude, and also the costumes are an issue in any restaurant."
good,worked in a privately owned panera and it was horrible. so man rules that made working hard. managment was horrible. the people who worked their were great. supervisors were not the best though. pay was very low.
good,The job wasn't for me. The only thing I liked about it was that we donated the food a the end of the night. I didn't enjoy the management there. I also what not paid fairly for all that I did for the company and worked really hard.
good,The general manager was never on the ball with scheduling. I was productive during my work and kept to myself and I was still scolded. The only good part was the employee discount.
good,Panera is a good place to work for the best thing I got from working for them was the knowledge of baking. They are not very fair when it comes to life situations and when time is needed when it comes to leave. Schedules are never regular so there is a lot flexibility that is needed.
good,It's a great job for starting out but not for the long haul and it doesn't offer munch in benefits and growth is biased and political so not much of a point
good,"At the time i worked there, it was fun, working late , cleaning every day, helping customers, serving food. Low pay was a real treat. Managers sat back and watched us work."
good,"the job itself was alright but only if you're prepared for extremely busy mornings and afternoons, management there sucks though. overall I would have stayed if management wasn't so rude"
good,"Being paid only $8 an hour, and little to no raises this is only a high school/ part time type of job. The managers are all young and not really experienced."
good,"A typical day changed for me through the three years there. Some days I would wash dishes and others I was a cashier/bakery department. "
good,"The overall environment of panera was lovely, however the scheduling was the major issue that led me to leave. Since I was still a minor and still in high school, my hours were already limited due to legal laws, but then I was starting to be scheduled during school. Also a manager brought inappropriate beliefs to work."
good,"Working here was a great first job but a lot of the time I felt as if I wasn't getting paid enough for the job I was doing. I was a full Time high school student so when our manager made us stay really late at work it was hard on week days. I didn't feel as if the company and management took very good care of us. I did make a family there though, but employees tend to drop like flies because it wasn't fun to work there."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to put a smile on a satisfied customer. The hardest part of my job, yet is most exciting to me, is being able to keep up with the fast pace environment."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Helping guests with their orders, while making food such as: salads, sandwhiches, pouring soups, etc. all kinds of cafe foods and drinks. also making barista drinks and various fruit smoothies."
good,they over work you and under pay. They expect too much from their employees.  They are willing to work with school schedules. They are not afraid to work you 40 hours a week.
good,"Advancement within the company is almost impossible. Higher level positions are always hired from outside the company not from within. Managers didn't know what they were doing in terms of inventory, managing employees, handling customer complaints, etc. Employees were always taking for granted no matter how excellent they performed at the job. Lousy pay for the amount of nonsense you take at this job"
good,"I had one boss, who will remain nameless, he always yelled at me and other staff infront of customers! Even when we were doing our job perfectly fine! He also would yell at customers and tell them to hurry up ordering!!"
good,This is a great stepping stone for someone to get out in the work place and start discovering what real work is like. It is not always fun and it is working with food and people which can add all new layers to a job but overall it had great pay and regulars who were amazing.
good,Nothing really major wrong just poor management. Lost of changing around of jobs during Shifts and poor stocking at the end of the week .
good,"I've been with for a lil over 8 years, it was great and now I'm just looking for a job where I can apply my skills, I want to love my job and the people I work for"
good,I would recommend for high schoolers to work here. I liked my co-workers and the costumers were very nice. The hardest part about working there is learning a new position.
good,"A typical day at work included working behind the scenes at the food station preparing meals for customers. some foods included, Lobster rolls or shrimp English rolls, Panni's, Sandwich's, and Salads. Management at the Panera I worked at was not okay and I prefer not to touch on that subject. My co-works included. The hardest pat of the job was the co-workers and management and I didn't really enjoy my time here."
good,"Panera personally was not my favorite place to work at, my manager was unreliable and the environment wasn't exactly the friendliest."
good,"Working for Panera Bread is not that bad. You have the ability to push yourself to your limits and learn as much as you can in regards to the product you are working with. But the management is not great and none of them seem to be on the same page with each other. The hours are over nights from 9pm-7am, which leaves little time for a life because you spend the day trying to catch up on sleep. The pay is okay, but for the amount of work you do in a night, you definitely deserve better."
good,"A typical day at work would be making sure everything is stocked and clean for the customers. Providing an every day oasis for our customers. I would also wash dishes, change coffees, clean bathrooms and would make food from time to time"
good,"The hours were long, balancing school and work was difficult, the managers were always caught in problems, my co-workers were always in drama. I learned how to work properly in stressful and fast paced environments. The hardest part was balancing school, working, and my personal life. The most enjoyable part of eating the food."
good,"I liked working there until management changed. I went from working double shifts, and 35+ hours to barely two days a week. Under old management I was promoted and given a raise. The atmosphere there was very pleasant to work in."
good,it wasa one of my worst jobs most of my co workers were rude 2 of the managers were horruble and always brought their bad days with them im glad i got fired tbh i didnt care about the job i was only there cause i needed money
good,"I was a manager in CT where it was great, I transferred  to the Atlanta market it was the worst mistake, they are so disorganized, not customer, employee, or management driven. Needless to say I am no longer there. However, if it was CT I would still be.  I love Panera but just not in the Atlanta market. I found a lot of racism, and harassment , when reported was told I was making trouble and misunderstood the GM remarks.  However I know racism and have been in Management for 24 years experience. A typical day at work could be from over staffed on day shift to not having any staff at nights. the hardest part of the job was to change the culture of the store. the most enjoyable part was getting to know my customers. "
good,"The pay was not good, but the work environment was decent. However, employees did not get benefits or the right amount of training needed to move up to management or assistant trainer. I was there for four years and was trained on the same thing."
good,"I can only say that Panera Bread has a bit of a frosted surface until the sour and bitter texture what the job is on a day to day basses."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Slow to give raises earned for learning additional skills. Half of people hired on will be leaving in a couple weeks to a couple months.
good,"A typical day would be nonstop busy. Lines out the door with only three production people two of whom were on drive thru. The remaining person was left to make all salads and sandwiches while also performing the duties of the ""QC"" Position. My co-workers were great, it was like family."
good,"Well let me just say this working at Panera is ok "
good,"I worked for Panera Bread for three years in Birmingham,Al. The management team i was apart of is very rude and unprofessional, Ive never met a set of people so disruptive and lacking in professional acts."
good,"My first official job, started off great then through the years realized I was a little too old for this job environment. Would recommend for first timers, Management is moderate."
good,"I come to work at 9, clock in and begin baking. I think the most important thing I've learned is time management. I work unsupervised by myself and have been for the last five years as well as have the responsibility of training people. The hardest part of the job is working overnight, i enjoy being self sufficient and my  co- workers i see for the beginning of the day and the end of my day are pleasant."
good,"Managers are nice and enjoyable people. Never worked at a place where the managers were actually doing the same jobs as new hires. The managers are really great leaders! Great place to work as your first job during high school. Trainers need to be more professional. Unfortunately, Dollar General paid me over $.25 more an hour than here so the pay is not good... I do like all that Panera gives back to the community. Everyday whatever baked goods are not sold they are given to the homeless shelter to feed the people."
good,The managment here is very rude and over works you. No matter what your going through. Never enough people working. Always short staffed!
good,Prepared sandwiches and occasionally did dishes. My co workers were friendly but immature. The hardest part of the job was poor management and certain people ended up over worked bc of favoritism of co workers. The meal discounts were nice.
good,"Each night I would come in and assess my tasks for the night, prepare bread and sweets, bake them and finish the product for morning. Clean and stock my area and often order supplies for the week. "
good,"co workers were awesome to work with. The customers were overall a joy to know and serve, the company itself needs a little help in concerning for the employees as well as managers."
good,"management was very inconsistent with what was told to us as employees. they shuffled us around a lot, to different locations and sometimes at the last minute or even mid-shift."
good,"I worked as a Baker in one of franchise stores for two years and it was terrible. The only thing that kept me going was the people I worked with. "
good,The job at Panera bread was very fast pace and enjoyable. my co-workers were great and I loved my job. I learned how to be patient with other people and that customer service is key.
good,"Store was always dirty and uncleaned.there was favoritism from management of certain workers. GM is young and don't really know how to manage a business. No rules were set in place, they were made as management felt like making them. Hours were flexible because if you didn't work you didn't get paid. Hours were cut drastically except for managers favorite friends. Panera Bread is not the place to work if you are a single parent. Hours are not guaranteed, cut hours but management gets bonus while workers suffer to make a decent paycheck.Just another fast food place with bagged products, over priced pre-made foods."
good,A typical day was very busy. I learned customer is always right. Management is not very appreciative of job well done. Co workers are great.
good,"can be stressful"
good,"This job was very fun, loving co-workers and customers, great first time job."
good,poor pay. they abuse hours and sometimes make you work days on end with a day off.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Not my favorite place of employment. I have been working with food for 8 years and this has been least favorite job. That may be because I am currently in school to pursue something other than food. This Panera is very disorganized when it comes to managers and employees seeing eye to eye.
good,"I was six month pregnant when I was employed for this company, and they no empathy for me being pregnant, wanted me to left heavy things while I was pregnant."
good,One of the best places to eat and worst places to work. There seems to be a lot of favoritism in the workplace and not a lot of benefits to even count for something.
good,"The hardest part of this job is no support from our management team. I have lost faith in the team representing this local chapter of Panera Restaurants, but not the company, personally. "
good,"Hectic lunch rush throughout the week, co workers converse about their week or weekend plans. Certain co workers will complain about limited labor hours. Majority of the co workers are tolerant of everyone. Managers are consistently changing. Within 2 years, Panera Bread of Darien has had more than 6 different managers. The hardest part of the job would just be getting raises or a steady amount of hours per week. Most enjoyable is having certain co workers who are actually your friend."
good,This can both be complicated and inspiring at times I would much rather discuss this in person or in an interview setting.
good,it was horrible the managers didn't help at all the would yell and scream at you for doing one little thing wrong
good,"A typical day of work included working cash registers, preparing food and helping customers. I really enjoyed this as my first real job. They constantly had new management in, but I always got along with the manager. It was, however, in many ways, a typical restaurant job. There was a lot of issues with the staff being immature, not getting along, not doing their jobs, etc. They also work you whenever. I did not have a life outside of work while working here. I really enjoyed my job because my managers gave me the opportunities here to learn every area, which kept me doing new and different things, and also gave me the opportunities to train new employees in all the areas of the store, which is a skill I have carried through every job since."
good,"A typical day for me if it is an opening shift would be to get to work and start to get the cafe ready for the day. In the beginning of the day there are not only a lot of administrative tasks that I must accomplish but also things that are necessary to get the overall operation of the restaurant ready for the day. This experience has taught me how to continue to fine tune my management skills and continue to learn all at the same time. As far as my co workers are concerned I really have great people that work for me and enjoy my day to day interactions with them since they are all usually in good spirits and work very hard every day. The management staff I work with directly are great people and do their jobs very well as well as support one another in whatever tasks we may need assistance with. This job in all honesty does not challenge me enough, however that being said there are difficult aspects of the job which is main when we get busy and have very few people working to effectively manage labor it presents a challenge to properly serve the customers. I feel like the best part of my job would be my day to day interactions with the regular customers that I see talking about their lives and their genuine interest in what I have going on and how I'm doing."
good,"Typical day:  rush around trying to finish everything as we always ran out of time trying to get prep finished or the line setup. "
good,"The position I had as a bakery manager was challenging but rewarding to accomplish the challenges.  A typical night was scheduling conflicts from employees and finding replacements, checking cafes for quality control, payroll, computer work with scheduling.  Also filling in where needed as baker if no replacements were found.  Also assisting new bakers and training and termination of employees not meeting the company standards.  I liked managing the cafes, training and the variety of cafes to manage.  I did not like the third shift I had to work.  That is why I am looking for other employment."
good,Panera deff could've improved their management. Pay was good. The best part of my job were all the friendly customers.
good,A typical day at work is casual. Do your daily rutine. I have learned from working their that i love working with people. The management could use some more oganizational skills as for the work enviorment and schedual are never consistant. The hardest part of my job is keeping everyone happy but that is what keeps me going everday knowing that i have a goal to achieve. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with good people. I helped open the store and have grown to know a lot of new people that i adore dearly. I need a new job to better my life for the future and the hardest part is going to leave my fellow panerians.
good,"Strong ethic values and morals, however job allows a very poor quality of life."
good,"Every location has a creepy assistant manager who will sexually harass the female underlings. Managers and customers do not treat you like a human. Better than McDonald's, probably."
good,Disliked the the lack of duties it was kids in charge of kids. the hours were cut but they would still hire.
good,Typical day started at 5am and ended at 2pm or the close of bussiness depending on what events where going on. Learned speed with accuracy of orders. My co-workers where team players.
good,sont hold your breath for a pay raise or a promotion. it can be fun but it depends on who works with you.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Its a good place for experience in a restaraunt, but they gave me no chance for advancement for being there for 2 years."
good,This job manager didn't help anyone with questions . They were never around just sitting the office most of the day and not helping with there day to day job.
good,"This is a good place for young adults attending college, They are flexible most of the time. The management is pretty helpful during busier times but communication from upper management lacks."
good,"They don't value employees, I work closely with Cornell university on a daily basis, I try to do my job the best I can while dealing with management who is incompetent."
good,"Not enough hours are given to me. The work is easy but fast. They don't pay much and, they don't give you enough hours. Management is good at making you feel bad about yourself even when you work hard. The food is just okay."
good,Panera is home to systemic managerial abuse with a power-hungry attitude towards management. Compensation for labour is subpar and room for advancement is slim.
good,"I was with this company for five years- I worked my way up to management. The work/life balance is terrible for managers. My general manager become aggressive towards me, and my district manager after I suffered some serious physical/mental health problems. I was an excellent production manager before hand but was treated like garbage for having a hard time physically....."
good,Managers have to work on their people skills and learn how to work with the employees to help better serve the people. Team work makes the dream work. You have to lead by example
good,"Sometimes, it was alright. But most of the time, the job was full of stress, and it didn't translate well into the pay. If you work the morning shift, expect to wake up at 3:30-4AM to make it there on time at 5AM. Being a cashier includes standing up front and cleaning the lobby area, organizing the pastries, etc. Food prep gets a little more flexibility in that you can occasionally go at your own pace, but don't expect to be interacting with a lot of people in that position. "
good,"This used to be an okay job, but the company itself has changed for the worst. Just their business ideas are taking a toll on the staff. The customers are beyond rude and entitled."
good,I didn’t enjoy working for this company. I enjoy being creative and leading a team but they offer very little opportunity for that. It’s definitely more of a corporation and micro management style.
good,"Ambiente laboral favorable. "
good,"So, I was instantly pursued by this company as soon as I applied. Got the job, went to orientation.... then heard nothing for about 2 weeks. 2 weeks later, I finally reported for my first and second day of work. After this 2nd day, I didn't work for the rest of the week. As a matter of fact, as I write this review, I STILL don't know when I am supposed to work next! lol None of the managers act as if they have an issue with me; the work is fairly simple and I picked up on learning how to do tasks very quickly. Maybe the managers at this location (Brickton Rd) don't know how to handle new hires, but here's a tip: don't leave us off the schedule for weeks at a time and expect us to be around when you are ready to work us. I'm here because I need money; if you're not willing to give it to me, then I'll be forced to go somewhere else."
good,"Panera is a fast food comfort food restaurant where it’s a minimum wage place and you don’t get a lot of advancement in the company, but you feel welcome there and some good experience."
good,The work is easy once learned the company doesn’t take care of their employees though! They over work you and you’re under compensated for your work!!
good,The district manager attitude stinks and treats the employees like trash. The associates do not get paid enough for the amount of responsibility given to them.
good,"Very corporate, hard to make friends, everyone is super competitive with no room to climb their job ladder.  A great place for students to work.  Part timers would dig this place but not really sure who is the manager?  The hardest part of the job was dealing with unreasonably demanding customers and having to accommodate them.  Good food but they need to go organic and work on recycling more of their garbage.  They supposedly give to charities and post it at the store in a banner form behind the register for customers to admire.  Nice music in their eating area with wifi for all your business needs."
good,"As an associate here about 2 years ago, I loved the environment I was provided with great coworkers and an excellent mission. Upper management is great depending on who it is. Management within the store can vary, I argued too often with one girl that eventually led me to quit. I have been a shift supervisor as of late and have never felt so unappreciated until I put in my 2-weeks and all of sudden I was the star employee. "
good,"I loved working here but it was really difficult to juggled both work and school. This is the main reason I quit. When I did quit, what frustrated me most is the fact they had me on vacation. I had asked for vacation in august to September but they put me down for July instead. I quit so fortunately my schedule wasn’t impacted, but if I had stayed my schedule would have severally been impacted."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Over the 4 1/2 years I've worked at Panera, my overall experience was just ok. I've been there through 3 different General Managers, many assistant managers, and hundreds of employees. Some of this is thanks to Panera's career paths and opportunities to grow within the company. But this is also where the company fails itself immensely. This creates huge gaps in employment rate and success in keeping those employees. Which then makes it harder on the current employees to effectively carry out their tasks from constantly being understaffed or just ill staffed due to improper training. They over work those employees they know they can take advantage of and let everyone else slide on not doing their job. The management is the biggest issue. Managers are supposed to lead by example and set the pace for the employees to follow. They constantly allow people to call out without covers, come in late without calling, steal food products, and slack off to talk about movies or sports. They over pay the people who do nothing beneficial for the company and underpay those who break their backs everyday going above and beyond. The managers never want to take on the responsibility of maintaining the cleanliness of the food products and storage, in turn making the employees not care about their work space either. They think constantly saying thank you fixes the fact that they're being overworked. There is virtually no sense of team work and theres always competition between shifts or zones furthering the issue of lack of togetherness in the company. From when I started to now, the company took"
good,"If you have the patience to work food service, and are willing to get dirty to do a job well done, you'll  go far. My ratings only really go for my own personal experience, but it varies from person to person."
good,Panera Bread is a devil job. That’s what other employees would say. I say it’s not a bad job. I really enjoyed it. Could have better management and overall it was a good job to me that taught me a lot
good,it was fun because you learn how to make different type of soup and sandwich. You had to clean the place like moping and clean the tables and bring the dishes to the kitchen and clean garbage.
good,Typically standing and cleaning and ringing out customers and making sure things are stocked and looks nice for customers to see when they come in and always make sure things are presentable and are served properly.
good,"at first i loved this job, but after a while the management showed their true colors. it’s very unorganized, and favoritism is a huge problem as well as gossip. i made plenty of friends at my job without intending to, but also a lot of childish “enemies”. they ask for too much for the amount they schedule and pay."
good,I only recommend Panera for someone looking for a first job or even first job in the food industry. No room for advancement.no benefits. Great work and life balance.
good,When I applied I was supposed to be a cashier and they never let me be a cashier which really made me mad and one of the managers he downgraded women so bad anytime he would be around he would give the hardest jobs that we couldn’t even do to us instead of the guys and he would let the male workers do whatever they wanted I’m talking about the Panera at the rim definitely don’t recommend if you wanna be treated like dirt
good,It was a very fun job at first but no one understands how to do their job. People don't listen to recommendations at all and the place is going downhill. The management is poor and they don't pay us employees what we deserve.
good,i worked at panera for 6 months it inst a bad place to work but i would rather work somewhere where i can be scheduled more so i actually have the chance to work and possibly be payed more
good,"Working at Panera Bread was fun and I loved what I did, but they seemed to have a horrible time at scheduling. A lot of coworkers had awful schedules. Either working non-stop or not working for three weeks (me)."
good,"They don´t want to improve, they don´t listen ideas, they don´t provide training or professional development."
good,"I enjoy working for Panera when we have a full staff but when understaffed its annoying."
good,"stressful and can be hard to balance with personal life"
good,"Good job for someone just starting out.the people and environment is great"
good,"The management company the runs Panera doesn't value its staff and is not flexible to the needs of the staff or management."
good,"on any given night the manager is required to monitor labor. the goals are unrealistic and in order to achieve them, the manager is often required to run the store while short staffed requiring the manager to work their job plus two others"
good,Horrible management bad pay extremely hot I do not recommend this job at all only thing that kept me there and sane were my coworkers who I became very close with
good,I like the position of catering coordinator but not the way things are run. I also do not like that we had to be at odds for product that is benefitting one company. It was a catering versus cafe atmosphere and was stressful
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Panera is like most food service jobs.  Lots of stress, lots of demand, little compensation.  Despite what their corporate videos tell you when you are first hired, they do not like for you to call in sick.  At All.  Even if you are visibly sick.   Management is hit or miss, and they often do not communicate with each other.  So one manager will say to something and the next will say not to do it.  Hours are very hit or miss, so if you need a full time job look else where.  Because one week you’ll have a lot of hours and then the next 3 the will be cut in half."
good,"I opened bakery meaning I had to set out the bakery items in the display case, put the breads and bagels up on the wall, cash-wrapped cookies and baguettes and more all in an hour. I arrived at 5am and the store opened at 6am. I learned that this company cares more about their ratings than anything else. The manager was constantly late meaning we couldn't open the store but they did not get fired. I have seen other coworkers walk in late and get fired on the spot. The most enjoyable part of the job was honestly just the free food and the food was good."
good,"Panera is pretty much a blackhole. Once you get sucked in, its hard to come out, unless you decided to just walk out. Management is pretty okay and if you are in it for the long haul it is easy to get promotions and move up, but being able to move out is next to impossible. Scheduling is always a mess and sometimes doesn't come out until the day before the week starts, and not to mention the entitled customers. Overall its an okay place to work, but don't get sucked in."
good,"Great place to encourage advancement. Willing to train, and has good ideas on how to succeed. Most ideas are not followed through. If you dont have a family this is a great job, with possible great pay and advancement."
good,Good place to work for minors. Easy and fun. Decent management. Great food. Slow hours. Barely any hours to be honest. Just a small summer job definitely temporary.
good,The company thinks they are better than every other fast food place. They sell overly priced food at a fast pace. You are not guaranteed your hours. If projected sales are not met then hours are cut. Pay is sub par and definitely not something you can live off of without another form of income.
good,"I would say not to work here for an extended period time. They dont always treat there employees fairly. The foods great, but the work environment is okay."
good,As a manager we often worked more hours than were scheduled just to be able to complete our assigned tasks. We were constantly understaffed. We frequently had to work in an associates role and then later during the day complete our tasks.
good,"From my experience working"
good,Typical day consisted of making sandwiches and salads on the line. Helping customers whilst on register. Cleaning and opening the shop or cleaning and closing the shop.
good,Most managers won't help out. It's like playing hide and seek to find them when we need help. They don't care about their job which makes employees feel less valued and unmotivated.
good,"The will put up a facade of ""work hard to get ahead"" and ""you will have room for advancement."" The second your good in one position, they will keep you in that position forever, unless you cross train and become proficient. Then they will throw you around like a ragdoll from one end of the store to the other. Then when you have shown that you have what it takes to be in a supervisor position, they will give it to someone who is a fresh face and barely knows how to run food, and they will tell you ""oh, you are not qualified"" after, yes, you are qualified all around."
good,"the hiring process was so quick, i got an interview and by mid week i was working. this was my first official job, i was still in school but they worked with my schedule. its a busy locations but besides that it was a good experience i just did not see much growth for myself i was already participating in every position."
good,"This is a wonderful place to work if you just need the extra money for college or high school. I do not recommend it if you are looking for full-time work. Benefits are okay, but not enough to get you X-rays, ultrasounds and is just for regular doctor visits. Management in the store is great and works with my constant changing schedule, but they lack in staying consistent with work advancement. The people I work with are wonderful except for a small few. This is great if you are looking for a first time job and want the extra money. However, unless you advance to shift supervisor or above salary starting pay is not the greatest and not a livable wage if you plan on trying to live by yourself that is."
good,"Worked at Panera for almost 4 years as an assistant  manager. I loved it and the assicotes, but the district manager and GM were horrible people to work for. If you like being disrespected and micro management and no properly training and constantly being talked down to or being told when you can and cant take your own vacation time then go and apply. Other than the management it is a great place to work for."
good,Worked there for a year and people who were new hires started being hired at a dollar more than I was making but management avoided me to keep from having to give me a raise so I will not be returning there this summer
good,"Working at Panera Bread means Low hours, Fast Paced, Stressful, with low pay and they will not increase your hours either, working at Panera bread wasn’t bad but I felt like I wasn’t getting paid enough"
good,Every time i came in for a shift you have to be ready to work and serve clients. When order pop up you have to work in a fast pace. Always satisfying customer.
good,"Managment was all over the place. People were getting taken advantage of and working for others, while others avoided all responsibilities. Minimum wage pay and late hours"
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"When i first got hired at Panera i was looking for a company that i could maintain a good salary while completing college. After a couple months i've realized just how much the work load is compared to the amount they pay. Many times i was working 12-13 hour shifts as an associate, many mangers wern't even working that many hours in the day. My store was completing under staffed. Even when they were hiring new people is was never for the correct position we needed. So others had to pick up the slack and work 10 times more. To be making the same amount of money i was making when i was 16, is ridiculous. I have never seen food more over priced and staff completely under paid for the work they put out than at Panera Bread"
good,only problem is managers and the company itself. they do not work together they do not give you enough pay for everything you do. they will abuse your work
good,"Most days working there can be enjoyable, but when there's a rush I feel like everything is so much harder to deal with and it could have been handled differently rather than panicking. When I worked there, there weren't a lot of employers working at a certain shift so I had to learn how to handle with the customer's being upset and how to make them feel more comforted rather than getting irritated with them. The best thing about working there is being able to share the amount of closeness with each employee and being friends with outside of work. They taught me how to get out of my comfort zone and being outgoing."
good,Working at Panera was very stressful. During most rush hours employees were too backed up to get their work done and managers wouldn’t do much to help. The pay was very low for such a long job and the hours were not very good.
good,"Customers as well as employees rude. It was alright being there , there were days that the time wa very well invested nothing wrong. Just managing was off."
good,management was very hard to work with. the other coworkers were very rude and sometimes volatile. pay was too low but the work load sometimes became too much for a new worker
good,I work hard but barely get paid enough. My boss likes the way I work and how fast I get things done but is unable to give me more pay even when I switched over to night baking
good,"I worked here two years. First year was great. Great management team, made some great friends that I still have. But then the management team fell apart. Stopped caring about the cafe and about their workers. Stopped communicating with each other and staff."
good,Panera is great place too work but they don't pay enough and its bad because your working extra hard just for some change which makes no sense. Pay your employees more.
good,It was a good first job. Teaches you work ethic. I dealt with racism and rude customers. This job also helps you become independent and self-reliant. It teaches you how to work quickly.
good,"Typical days were very fast paced, fellow co-workers would shout and yell even in the most public place of the store, management would not let you leave even if your shift was done and past being due if someone else called in."
good,It’s a good job to start off with if you are getting out of school and out of college looking for a quick and easy job to work with for a beginner stage
good,"During my time at Panera bread I had a manager throw my food at me and curse me out in front of the customers. Management was horrible and the team all gossiped about each other as if they were teenagers and not adults. I didn’t have trouble with the company, but the job was just not for me."
good,"Typical day at work(no such thing)"
good,Corporate uses this store as a tax write off and everyone working there from a manager to the employee works too hard and is underpaid for the work condition we are forced to be in.  The more experienced employees must always do extra work while the new employees learn how to work there.  All in all its a terrible work experience and I do not know why anyone would work at that specific store.
good,"There is a  saying ""SO FAR SO GOOD"" it was like that learnt new stuff and had disadvantage of using it. Fun to work with such a low quality of management and always got 1 of 10 rude customer."
good,"Panera has very high expectations in all facets of its business."
good,"Fast-paced environment that fosters change, but does not prepare its employees for competitive advances. From day one, every employee that was not brand new expect me to know how to do everything without being told. That was the most stressful part. But in this industry it's about being pushed to the limit just to make sales, so I cannot blame the managers for being pushy. They should try to be more consistent with what they expect and what they actually do."
good,"Fast-paced"
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,While working at Panera I didn't receive much recognition and always found myself exceeding expectations only to get as much as a pat on the back. Employees always ended up fighting against other employees for raises or different positions and it ended up making the working environment very toxic.
good,"The managers would always schedule their favorite workers more hours. The crew didn't like following rules, and wouldn't work as a team. I was never trained in any position at the store, and was then consecutively reprimanded for not knowing things I was never shown."
good,Panera is a fast paced working environment.  There is a lot of pressure for all team associates to work to perform fast and deliver to customers asap.
good,"great place to work if you are a high school student. management very unprofessional. no advancements. Easy place to work, great customers, lots of regulars"
good,"With high Manager turnover it is difficult to keep "
good,overall the employees are very great to work with however management at Panera bread needs improvement. this is especially in communication for a more effective work flow
good,"A typical day for a cashier is ringing up customer's orders in a timely matter and accurately. The management wasn't the best, didn't always feel very respected. Did learn how to work in a fast paced environment and manage time wisely."
good,Panera Bread is your typical food service job.  It is fast paced.  You have to be quick when making food as you are timed. The customers are mostly rude to you and spend all their time complaining about everything.  The management is poor.  They hire incompetent managers with anger issues and that know nothing about how to run the food line and make food according to the recipes.
good,This job is not for those who wish to learn a variety of job skills and progress through a workplace hierarchy. The majority of employees are high school and college students who don't hold much individual financial responsibility and are looking to make part-time income as they take classes and prepare to apply themselves in another career field.
good,It was my every first job and I have worked there two times around. The problem I have is that the management lacks the ability to ensure the associates actually do their job. It's the little things that don't get implemented or taught and makes it very frustrating.
good,I faced a bit of discrimination and i never got a raise. It is long hours sometimes with no breaks and very fast paced. The management is perfect when they want to find your errors but bad when you want a raise or a day off. The other associates are nice and the customers are mostly nice. Bad discouts.
good,It has a decent workplace depending on the manager at the cafe. As a baker its stressfull because extra work is always added on to your workload. We barely have enough time to fonish our job as it is
good,The location I worked for did not take care of its people and had poor management. There was no control. Employees and managers alike had no pride in their appearance or product. I have seen much better company-owned location.
good,"While I enjoyed the people I worked with at this location, there was a certain monotony about working here that drove me away. There's nothing inherently wrong with this job but understaffing was an issue."
good,Went downhill fast after a few long time employees found other jobs. Management didn't hire for months even knowing said employees were looking elsewhere.
good,"The 3rd shift hours worked for me at the time, but the pay was terrible. They offer little benefits. Upper management was terrible as well as all the G.M.s and shift managers. You really have to try to get fired."
good,long hours and no time off you work until the lines are clear with no time to have family time Bosses contancely sending you emails and texting you even when you not working the Best part of the day is meeting the customers who u learned their name cause they come in too see u all the time.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,High demand with no pay off. Managers short with employees. Cliquey employees. The hours were okay but its very hard to get days off. Very detail oriented workplace.
good,"4 different district managers in only a few years of work and none of them could move the management teams in the right direction.  All assistant managers are brand new and are expected to hit the ground running but the management training doesn't prepare them for daily shift running.  District managers hire their favorites from their past jobs and bring them in at higher salaries and they can't perform.  Daily conference calls, multiple checklists, paperwork, shiftly and nightly emails take away from the face time with customers."
good,"Panera as my first job was okay. Learning experience for how professionalism is not suppose to work. The food industry is not geat to work in from the start. It is very stressful, my management team did not help the situation at all. It was ran by adults still suck in high school."
good,It's fast pace the training is okay but there is favoritism and management is hard to get ahold of when either calling in or trying to ask a question.
good,"When I first started at Panera, I loved it. The staff that I was hired with were hard working, fun to be around and all around great coworkers. But as my one year there came closer, things changed in a negative way. People were getting hired who were very unqualified for the job, continued issues with our GM and scheduling manager, and lots more issues arose.Unfortunately, it became a place I was unhappy to be in."
good,"A good place of employment for teenagers. Not many benefits and extremely stressful.I think the best part of the job was having a good group of coworkers, however management needs some work. I learned how to further my communication and collaboration skills along with developing my leadership skills."
good,"I like dealing with people, interacting with them and from there knowing something a bit about them.  Work is indeed fast-paced but I got used to it as long as you keep yourself focused and organized, you're on the right track."
good,They hired to many people so your shifts are cut short or you don't work much during the week. The pay was fair at 9.00 an hour. But the managers were okay to work with they could have been better.
good,"the job started off good enough, but the longer i was there the more they took advantage of me without ever raising my pay or giving me the rest of the training i was required to have"
good,"Management was lazy, and the Paneras I worked at all went downhill quickly. The good employees left out of frustration and were eventually replaced with poor employees."
good,The people you work with are ok it is structured to not be to stressful but upper management is the problem and the procedures change way to much on everything
good,"This is a good first job. They do a lot of training and if you had a good training manager, which I was very fortunate enough to have, you will learn a lot of good skills. The work hours really vary. There were weeks where I got 30 hours and others where I only got four. It's really hard to plan any bills. The employee discount is okay. You get 60% off on up to $10 worth of items on days that you are working and 20% off on up to $10 worth of items on days that you are not. The management is okay. A lot of the time when you ask them to help you with something, they either delegate their help to someone else or ignore it. The guests are really rude and complain about everything. They always try to get things for free and it gets really frustrating."
good,"I had this job in high school and it was very easy to balance school and work. They are very flexible and understanding about school. But, I left because I felt I was not getting enough pay for all the work I was put to do."
good,"The job overall is a good job that you can always come to, but it's not a lot of unprofessional managers , their isn't and compensation for the hard work that you do. I"
good,"It's all right for a ""pay the bills"" kind of job.  There's no advancement and no real benefits. The pay is absolutely terrible.  Management is tricky ... some are great to work with and some are difficult."
good,"I enjoy the work, assisting the customers, and get along well with coworkers. Learning tasks is fairly easy from shadowing under more experienced coworkers or using charts."
good,"It would be a lot better with proper management. Your schedule pretty much has to do with if the boss likes you or not. When there are good positive people working, the day is good."
good,Working in most food related jobs arent the best. However panera isnt greasy food so you dont stink at the end of your day. Fairly easy job.  Not very over whelming
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,I was just too far away from location for the pay. I had many successful projects and days but the company moved me too far . As a general manager I want to spend my time in store not driving
good,"Panera Bread is a company that has many positions. There are literally, six to seven ways that orders are received daily. The work is tedious and it takes a while to completely comprehend and become accustomed to the policies and procedures. However, it is not the work that creates a difficult environment; it is the staff and management. If you are a hard worker, I do not recommend this company for you, simply because your hard work will become a reason for other employees to work less. Even your management staff will lean heavily on you, while allowing the less productive employees to do whatever it is they want and collect a paycheck. Panera Bread does, however, know how to create a fun environment when dealing with tough situations. There is usually some type of singing, dancing, joking, and teasing throughout the week. Every so often, there are nicknames, cartoon characters, and other fictional characters given to most employees as a way to increase morale. Every birthday that is made known is celebrated at the store, on your famous day and they truly make you feel special!"
good,"I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone, I agree it's better than most fast food restaurants out there but its not worth the low salary and hard labor that we have to do. In addition management sucks, no one cares about you unless your're ""friends"" with them, if they don't like you. you get no hours"
good,"Long hours and poor pay. Poor work life balance. Company will always come before family even though motto of this franchise is faith, family, then work."
good,"They do not give a far advantage. While they give their employees a 15 or 25 cent raise every 3 months, it is not worth the amount of work you do for that much. It is hard to move up in management. Some people who are managers shouldn't be managers."
good,"Panera Bread is a corporation that claims they are all about family and working with you, when in reality they have VERY poor management and a very high turn over rate. Management has no respect for their employee's at all."
good,"The food was great, the hours were not. Due to them 'needing' people to work there they hired many people so we all got limited hours. The only people that got the most hours were the ones the manager liked or was friends with. I had to stay after closing (9pm) 2 hours and did not get home till almost midnight, and had school the next day."
good,"Very Fast paced, I got burned a lot. I have multiple scars from working with hot pans, ovens, etc. Lots of hands on work such as decorating pastries/cookies."
good,"Would not always get enough hours weekly, sometimes poor management, at times we would be understaffed. It was busy when busy and slow when slow. Enjoyed the food and some co workers"
good,"It was a good work experience but I did not like how they cut my hours.I also did not earn enough money to make working there worth it, hence the reason I stopped working there."
good,Fun place to work. few opportunities to advance within company. Poor pay and work hours. Not a place to work if you’re looking for full time. Great first job for teenagers.
good,"A typical day at work would be to come in, prep for the breakfast shift,  clean the tables, make fresh coffee, count my money drawer, and stock for the day."
good,"At first I loved working at this Panera location, I loved making the customers happy. It was a mostly fun work environment, although  toward the end it began to get stressful. I learned a lot and was trained properly at this location. However, I was discriminated against for a trainer position that I was more than qualified for simply because the manager in charge of the promotions made it known she did not like me."
good,A typical day at work was horrible bosses did not know how to do their jobs right. their was lack of staff. The most enjoyably part of my job was the customers cause they were really nice.
good,"I have been a baker here. The bakery job itself at Panera is great. Good pay, vacation time, and health benefits. The culture is terrible. Management is worthless, if you have an issue you basically have to go through HR. You are constantly in the middle of drama. Sometimes it feels like high school all over again. If you can get past the toxic dump that are your managers and coworkers, you'll love it."
good,It's was overall a relaxed fun job but the pay is low and there are no opportunities to advance. A good job if your going to school and looking to make some money.
good,"Being alone at night is my favorite part of this job.  But the product, while decent for convenance food is not amazing or worth what they charge.  "
good,One must be quick and knowledgeable for it's very busy especially on weekends and they work at a very fast paced. The discount there is great for the food
good,"Panera has a very relaxed environment with tons of great food to offer and appreciate. This establishment is consistently busy which is good for making the day go by fast, it's still a typical food service type of job with cleaning duties associated. Would suggest Panera over many other fast food establishments."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"new manger every 3 to six month, and the last one they had who was an alcoholic, and fired everyone that had any issue and was not white. so he would look at you very closely so he can get you."
good,This was my first job and I feel like it was a good place for that. I got a experience in the work force. I learned some new skills. They pay was decent for how young I was.
good,"A typical day at work involved several call outs, and having to do multiple peoples' jobs while doing your own. Even as a manager. What I learned was just typical food industry info. Managers were always hit or miss. The reason I was able to move up as quick as I did was because my original manager saw my potential and passion for the job. However, as soon as he got promoted out of the building I was constantly overlooked, despite all I did. Essentially, the last 6 months of me working at Panera, I worked 6, sometimes 7 days a week. I had paid lunches, but hardly ever had the time to actually sit down and eat because of the business and understaffedness. The most enjoyable part of the job were the regular customers. I genuinely had fun getting to know them."
good,I have learned to manage my time very well only on the weekends. They assign me to one position but ask me for lots of other favors and expect me to be on top of everything all at once. I'm only human.
good,"47 hour work week with two days off each week, sounds great, right?  It sounded great to me as well, but while the company markets itself as a modern brand with work/life balance, and a ""clean"" environment, it lacks heavily in proper management.  "
good,Working at Panera bread was a good  experience.  Management should have a better communication with each other and its staff. I liked how it was very diverse. You can meet people you can learn a lot from such as co workers and customers. I think company policy and rules should apply to all staff even if they have more experience than most. Dining room can get very crazy so I think they should have a lot two attendants in the dining room  on both morning  and night shifts till a certain time to help with the work load which can be overwhelming.
good,Panera Bread is a decent job fora those who's are getting there first jobs in highs school. The specific panera that I work at currently is very unorganized and the management isn't all that great. But I have worked at several other Panera Breads but overall it's a good company with good working opportunities.
good,"The employees I worked with int he mornings were amazing but as the day went on and the shifts changed, not so much.  Closing crew wasn't motivated.  Most of the managers didn't care why things didn't get done, they just needed to be done, customers be damned.  When I tried to advance my position in the store, the manager decided to promote another, newer employee that had yet to meet the qualifications of said position and needed more time to achieve them, not giving me the chance to try and advance."
good,"A fun job to have if you dont enjoy change.  It is a very repetitive job, and a very fast paced job.  They don't like to promote people, only people they actually like, which is very rude."
good,"Most of the company at Panera Bread is known as a wonderful work environment. The corporate customer service department lacks that wonder. There are a few shining stars that push on through sheer charisma that make the day enjoyable, but most days are mired in confused clients and equally confused management. They do their best but few in the department seem to know what their own proper procedure is."
good,Not a good place to work at a lot of favortisim with different employees. You have to kiss up to mangers to get what you want not based on work ethic.
good,The work environment was not extremely terrible but there was some very unfair things that happened. I am glad that I got out of there when I had the chance. Some days they would schedule me when my availability said that I couldn't work.
good,The location I worked at was poorly managed and chaotic during every lunch rush. The responsibilities are not doled out realistically and the tasks required are sometimes required to be done without reasonable accommodation.
good,Work at Panera is basically moving from one upset customer to the next. It is extremely fast paced and stressful. You are expected to memorize the menu during your short training time. You see a lot of food wasted and thrown away. Upper management likes to make new rules all the time that makes the production line worker's job a lot harder and more stressful.
good,Panera was ok the management sucked and they were often very unorganized. If you want hours they will give it to you and they often changed the schedules without you knowing.
good,"Panera is an excellent place to start out, I learned so much about how to be a good manager and what it takes to run a busy store. During my time at Panera I have enjoyed being able to grow within the company and make many new friends. I am very thankful for the time and experience I have received from Panera."
good,"The people I worked with were pretty friendly, but the work itself became demeaning."
good,Working at Panera was a decent part time job but I am looking to get out of the food industry. It was an enjoyable job but I would like something different.
good,"After working for Panera for two years, I can say it has helped me with time management, social skills, organization. Good starter job but not much room for advancement. Corporately owned so as an associate you are at the ""bottom of the totem pole"", that being said I work exceedingly hard for a minimum waged job with no real improvement within the company."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"each store is as clean as you make it, but the upper management does not want to be bothered they make it pretty clear they only want there bonus, so they try and make you happy till then, then they forget about you."
good,A typical day required taking a lot of orders and packing up items for donation. I learned that some customers may be rude but customers are always right. Management was sort of uptight. The workplace culture was very fast paced and talkative. The hardest part was getting the managers to change an order when a customer changed their mind. The most enjoyable part was some of the workers.
good,"It was always busy at this location, you were never really slow unless there was a store happening. The pay was good, though the higher up management was not extremely friendly. The associates however and shift managers were very pleasant, always having a good attitude and were very polite and helpful."
good,"Working at Panera I learned to make certain meals, learned how to use a point of sale screen to place orders, and picked up on hosting skills. I wish that management at this specific location would've been a little more attentive."
good,Panera Bread is a good company to work for but there are definitely some down sides to the job. Management is constantly changed out and dont really know what theyre doing.
good,Panera had very rude employees and managers. The managers seem confused on what they were doing and on how to run a shift. Employees lacked in being customer friendly.
good,"This type of employment is based off of race, it has nothing to do with your experience at all. If you are not a certain skin complexion you will get no where, I can say this from experience."
good,"They said I would be a line cook but, I would have to do dining room for 3 weeks first. Three months later and they never put me on line cook even after successfully closing dining room and dishes for 3 months. They were unsanitary and made you do cleaning of mold that they didnt provide proper gear for."
good,"Well I love working for the company But sometimes the Mgr. does not make you feel like you was doing good on the job. I work hard to become Asst. Trainer and I know that I was good at it no matter what the mgr. team said, the empy. they like me. we had un when some off the mgr. was not there they just was un happy and made us un happy."
good,"Hours can vary. Many times you become short staffed due to high turnover rate of employees. Minimum wage job, raises were once a year. "
good,I started working for Panera when it was one of the top five companies to work for in the country. I left when it was pretty much the polar opposite.
good,"I currently have been working at Panera for almost two years. I started at a Chicago location and relocated to a franchise in Texas. The differences between the two are staggering. Before relocating, I loved working as a baker. The conditions here in TX are atrocious. Management could care less about employee grievances. The stores are all disgusting as far as cleanliness goes. There is no organization what so ever. The bakers never have enough supplies to work with. The equipment is all broken down. No one seems to care about baking the bread according to the rule book, they care more about getting it done than doing it right. Working here has been horrifying."
good,"Panera bread is a great place for college and high school students, or if you have a physical issue because the customers alone are more understanding, with a team of coworkers that help most of the time. The management could use some improvement, however regardless they make sure the customer is first."
good,"A typical day at work is cleaning, cleaning, cleaning. If you don't like touching other peoples chewed up food, this job is not for you. You have to be very polite to every customer. The management though is scattered throughout different people, so you will get yelled at for doing something wrong even if another manager told you that was how to do it. Most the co-workers are friendly, but if you need someone to cover your shift well good luck. No one is willing to help you when  you get sick. Also you only get 50 percent off on the day of work on the food. Thats limited only till 10 dollars. So the most you will ever save is 5 dollars."
good,Days were long because it was always really busy and understaffed or extremely slow and too many people with nothing to do. Managers very much played favorites often in an inappropriate way.
good,"Typical day as a line-worker (closing shift):"
good,The job was not bad at all I just worked at one with terrible management. I eventually left because the pay is not great. Other than that I enjoyed working there because of some of the customers and co-workers that I had.
good,"Non stressful workplace.  Job roles would switch daily. One would either be preparing food, cashiering, serving, or doing dishes. Job roles changed daily according to managers discretion."
good,I loved working here. But my manager was so mean she would scream at my co workers in front customers made it a joyless work environment
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"The entire time i worked there, there were always people complaining about someone on the staff, many times it was the managers. The work environment was overall stressful."
good,"It was a job with many empty promises."
good,the store was not doing so well when I started so there was a lot of craziness for the first few months. when the new GM came in the store was back to good shape.
good,"enjoyable place to work as far as communicating with customers, management unprofessional and disorganized, long days, employees under appreciated"
good,"-Being reliable every day"
good,"fast paced environment, managers need to be more organized about scheduling etc. very un organized scheduling wise, there would be too many people working in one area and not enough people working in other areas."
good,Easy job to have. Benefits are decent for managers. Pay is not in line with area markets. Opportunities are far and few between within company.
good,"Days here are really fast paced and it gets hard to keep up with some customers who demand a lot (it is retail after all). But on the good days, if you have the right chemistry between management and other co-workers, it's fun to work here and to develop relationships with the regular customers. The hardest part of the job is that they have so many food regulations and almost always get no help maintaining those standards"
good,Typical work day good if the Gm wasn't there as he gets stressed out to easy and takes it out on employees and that had been brought up to the district manager several times
good,"A typical day at Panera Bread, Highland heights is challenging, yet successful. Here at Panera bread we are big on customer service, especially our cashiers. We greet the customer at the register with a smile and remind the customer of our rewards card to help insure that they are receiving rewards in exchange for their daily visits. For the line workers, whether its opening line for the day or working through breakfast, lunch, or dinner rush, we have to always be on our p's and q's. I feel that the different rushes are the hardest parts of the job, yet if we are skilled and consistent, we will get the food created properly and to the customer in under 3-4 minutes."
good,Working here you have to know it gets very busy. You are always busy doing something which is great! Keeps you busy and makes the time go by faster. Only con about this job is management. District and General managers need a lot of work when it comes to helping employees. Favoritism is a huge downside of working here. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the people you meet. Everyone is amazing and nice and make work worth going to.
good,"This company wasn't the easiest to get hired, there are online courses and workshops to attend before being accepted. Panera takes the comfort of their customers seriously, providing a home environment and cafe to eat and socialize with friendly, helpful employees."
good,"Great environment, but needs betters employees and better management. Food is tasteful, very hardworking, friendly, uplifting, biggest duty of this workplace is BOH, lots of dishes, need more prep people, need more drive thru people, and employees should be more recognize for their hard work in this establishment"
good,"Opportunities to learn were not offered to me, despite, at times, having more experience than new hires. Former shift manager was often erratic. Different shift manager would often be passive-aggressive."
good,"Very flexible with my availability, but they expect too much from employees, and there isn't enough room for advancement, which causes a high turn-over rate"
good,It is very tiring working 6 or 7 hours without a break being on your feet all the time. We are supposed to get a 30 minute break after 5 hours per company policy but many times I do not get one even as others who do the same work as I go home early. This makes zero sense and is very bad for morale. One brings this to the attention of management but it does not change so I have decided to search for a different job where I at least rate a break the way my coworkers do.
good,"Panera bread snellville is an awesome company with a heart. A typical day consisted of of moderate cleaning, many conversations with customers, and big smiles. The management, however, is not as enjoyable as the job. They tend to abuse power and have very little respect for the employed staff. The most enjoyable part of the job, though, would have to be the co-workers. It truly is a family environment."
good,"I enjoyed my job, coworkers, and managers in the beginning of my time at Panera. Towards of my time working there, I became pregnant with my husband and I's first baby. At the time, we were switching management and getting breaks at our designated times was unbearable. If you work a 5 hour shift, legally you get a paid 15 minute break in the state of WA. I wouldn't even get a break unless I begged long time managers that I had been working with. Newly pregnant, I was starving. I ended up moving to Tacoma and wasn't able to make the drive across the bridge to work with the amount of time I was working, it wasn't worth it. Turned in my two week notice and my hours got cut."
good,"I typically started my day very early at 5am and it was non-stop with very few breaks.  I learned several things about baking.  There was a high turnover in management.  Often times, the general manager worked less hours than required, which made it so  the other managers would have to pick up the slack.  The staff was a lot of fun and we all got along pretty well.  The hardest part was being on salary and getting paid for 50 hours but having to work more hours.  There was not much room for advancement.  The most enjoyable part was working with lots of great, different customers."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Fast paced environment, making the time go by fast. Learned how to work in customer service. The reason i stayed so long was because of my great coworkers. Working with the public has it's advantages and draw backs, but altogether it was worth it."
good,"It is not bad working here, but the worst part is that some coworkers are a lot lazier than others, therefore the work load on people is very disproportionate. However, it was a fun and friendly environment, and a 65% discount is not so bad either."
good,An good place to work for young people just starting out in the workplace. Environment is like that of a fast food restaurant.
good,"decent place to work if you are a very tolerant person. a lot of my coworkers would call out and not show up. hours were all over the place. manager gave preference to certain individuals regarding working nights so i got stuck with basically all night shifts. one manager left and the managers who came to fill in were totally distant, critical, and totally unhelpful. "
good,"While selling a very good product, and with a commitment to customer service, quality and cleanliness, Panera struggles with a corporate culture that limits hours, earnings and advancement. I worked with great people - friendly, caring and committed to their work - but upper management kept a very tight rein on employees. It is always a pressure cooker to get work done faster. Raises and hours depend on keeping a rushed pace at all times."
good,"For the most part the co-workers where team players. I like that you can meet new people from all walks of life,and I did enjoy company meeting."
good,"I liked working at Panera at first. I love the drive and message of the company and they idea that ""fast food"" could be healthy. Unfortunately I've found that advancement is very rare and often managers come from outside the company. I would like to advance and found that it is not going to happen with this company."
good,"A very repetitive job, as long as you get through the day you will be alright. The managers that ran my store weren't very good."
good,"Managers do not manage, they fill holes.  The company provides very little labor variance to accomplish great amounts of work. Compensation is not in a fair range for expected results."
good,"Panera has too few employees in its support center to handle the call volume it receives. The work environment and morale have gone down significantly, and there have been many times where agents aren't allowed to go to the bathroom when necessary because of the high call volume and calls in queue. The management does not seem to care about their employees at all, just get those calls answered, and they haven't hired enough people to handle these calls. People should be able to go to the bathroom when they need to without asking and being made to wait until they can barely hold it."
good,"I must say as a corporation, they really over exaggerate advancement opportunities that get repeated throughout the hiring and training process. In my experience/journey with Panera Bread, it's seemingly only an entry level job just to get a simple example of what working a minimum wage job in the world is like. A raise could happen, but even at notable performance after an entire year, you'd only get bumped up a quarter, and another if they decide to make you a trainer.. it does build up over time, but the time investment is  too much for what they give you, a manager I knew only got paid around 10/11 dollars an hour after being there for several years. "
good,"Because the store is incredibly understaffed, the workload of three people is put on each of the line employees, which is two people. Product continuously runs out creating more unneeded stress. Management does not listen to recommendations made by employees to help the store out. Co-workers are incredibly hard working and easy to get along with. Learned a lot about food safety. Most enjoyable part of the job is creating relationships with the regular customers who come to Panera because of the food quality and service."
good,"every day i came in to work the person who worked before me never did anything to help me out, so i was always backed up and i felt management always jumped down my throat. Food cost to much. Management never listened to my open availability they consistently gave me closing shifts that got me home after 1 am when i had classes at 12 pm the next day which eventually messed up my school work."
good,"Independence Panera Bread is definitely fast pace.. Very busy.. Learned how to have great customer service, speed of service, multitasking, and keeping on your toes.. Most of my co-workers are very friendly, we are like a family.. The hardest part of the job is when there are a ton of guests in line and you are the only one ringing on a register.. Most enjoyable part is you get to learn all different stations and do them when you send co-workers on break.."
good,"Fast paced hard working environment. Company doesn't necessarily recognize and reward employees hard work. Acquired customer service protocols, independent thinking, multitasking, problem solving. The hardest part of the job was the physical strain. Wasn't allowed to sit down other than breaks. Most enjoyable part of the job were the coworkers. They are all hardworking and even during tough times, we still portrayed satisfaction and gratitude."
good,"A typical day at work would require working in multiple areas of the restaurant, such as the drive-thru, bakery, production line, cafe area and barrister. The hardest part of the job was managing crew members with different standards or non-committal. The best part of the job was making the guests of the restaurant happy."
good,"For a typical teenager this would be a pretty good job, the pay is at least a dollar over minimum wage and the hours are always open. "
good,The typical work day is what you make it. If you are proactive than problems that come wont be big. But if you are reactive then you will be behind all day. You always want to set yourself up for success in the food industry. I always enjoyed having a customer leave satisfied
good,Setting up the bakery and handling the customers needs. Preparing the food as the orders come in and cleaning up at the end of the day.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,You arrive for the day and may not necessarily know what you will be doing that day. I have been told that I am moving up the ladder for almost a year now and I have stayed the same.
good,"Expectations compared to salary became ridiculous at times, but other times it was a fun and challenging job that taught me an extraordinary number of valuable management and overall life lessons."
good,Overall the past two and a half years have been a great learning experience. I've learned a lot about customer service skills and basic job skills since working there.
good,"Typical day at work- I clock in and make the food that people order.  If there are no orders to make, I will ring someone up, or clean something. If there is someone new to the job, depending on how new they are, I will train them on what to do. I do this until we close or my shift is over. The management is very unorganized and is constantly changing.  My co workers are enjoyable and easy to get along with. The hardest part of my job is working during peak lunch hours when there are many order that need to be done, and other people are not able to help me. The easiest part of my job is when i am out in the dining room talking to customers making sure they have everything they need."
good,"nice place to move up in, but once you hit the top of store management and they feel they have gotten what they can out of you, no more development happens and they start looking to get rid of you."
good,"To job seekers:"
good,"The managers are what ruined panera bread for me. At first I loved the job, until all of the managers left the Canton CT cafe. After that my hours were cut, and I felt very uncomfortable attending my shifts."
good,"You definitely learn a lot of useful skills like time management, basic use of a POS system, barista knowledge and maybe even food prep or dining service and more. It's like any other workplace with its ups and downs. I suppose the biggest con is management. "
good,"this job is great for students but there is opportunity for growth, it may take some time"
good,Its a decent job and the people were the best part being able to interact . However management is what drove good workers away
good,"Catering can get really busy at times which wonderful. I have learned how to deal with stress in a professional manner. I have learned how to stand up for myself and not let people take advantage of me. Some of the management can sometimes get too stressed and take it out on the employees. All my co-workers are wonderful, everyone is really friendly. The hardest part of this job would be pleasing everyone."
good,"I began working at panera bread about two years ago. I enjoyed working there at first but then I quickly realized what kind of leadership there was. The general manager had to be one of the most selfish people I have ever met. He didn't care about what you had going on in your life so long as you showed up. Case in point, a co- worker's grandmother died in the middle of the night and so she call the general manager to let him know. He then asked if she could come into work anyway. I'm glad I worked there because it was a great experience. I also learned more about working with people. Every job has its ups and down but if there was one thing that I learned from this job it's that you need to value your employees as much if not more than the management team."
good,"Pros; Great Co-workers, Nice place,  Some good customers, Good Employee discount ( 66% ) butonly when your on the clock. "
good,"fast paced, nice people, nice pay , good food, welcoming environment"
good,"Panera Bread is a nice company they have good food and usually the people that come to buy the food are nice and wonderful people too."
good,"I had many different jobs during my time at Panera, my primary job was to manage an take care of the dining room.  To make sure everything was kept up and the customers were satisfied.  The biggest thing I leaned at Panera was face to face customer service.  I learned how to deal with different attitudes and how to handle many different situations. "
good,"As my first job,I was a cashier at Panera bread. It was a great learning experience. I great to try a lot of delicious sandwiches and salads. Reading and hearing about customer reviews and comments was enjoyable because many of my customers were satisfied with their visit and the endless comments about how great the food was. "
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,They Promised hours that they did not have and they also not really nice to emplyees
good,Training was fun. Planet bread is fun! It depends on where you go how you experience will be
good,"Panera itself is okay for a company but the people that you work with will drive you nuts ,and around Columbus Oh,it seems like they only hire based on what you look like,no advancement and no raise"
good,"I enjoy working at Panera, but am ready to jump start my career now that I have a masters degree"
good,"stressful, no apprieciation for large amounts of work. 7-10 day striaght shifts with no overtime."
good,Food preparation was the most enjoyable part of my day. That was my area. The most hardest part was trying to please the general manager
good,The management here is always out of order and contradictory.
good,"At Panera Bread, the job is very strenuous, and can be just as stressful at times. The hours are harsh, as I am not used to working overnight. The management varies from store to store. There are nights where i work alone, but the other bakers I do work with occasionally are, for the most part, easy to get along with and fun to work with. The hardest part of the job is trying to get a full night's bake completed in time for the store to open. As someone who loves both cooking and baking the overall job is very fullfilling."
good,"Good experience, good start in the resturant industry, it is a little stressful but nothing too crazy"
good,"Panera is a good first job. it teaches you basic skills in order to land a somewhat better second job in the future. Some people that you end up working with may, or may not like you. It's a mixed feeling."
good,when i did work for panera bread the work environment was toxic and non-welcoming. the management was poorly executed and co-workers weren’t always so friendly. i also rarely got scheduled to work just all around was a bad experience
good,"While I enjoyed the culture and the customer base here, I found it difficult to advance within the company. Cons out weighed the pros when it came to title, responsibilities, and pay"
good,You need to be extremely passionate about working here. Requires patience with both fellow workers/associates and customers. You have to be really passionate about guest service and associate wellness to really love this job
good,"Just like any other fast food chain, fast paced during lunch and dinner with random sporadic burst in-between. On days it's fully staffed without any call-offs the speed of service will be phenomenal, accurate and an overall enjoyable experience."
good,"Panera Bread is a great place for people looking to get as many hours as possible. As a high school student, minors are likely forced to work many hours with little flexibility."
good,The management was never on the same page and there was a giant lack of communication there was countless times we would run out of food because they forgot to place the truck order also a few times the schedule was incomplete for the following week
good,I loved the people I was working with until the teamwork became lazy. Managers did not handle situations correctly. Didn’t follow my schedule availability
good,"Had fun while I was there. Very friendly employees. Management here was unexperienced. Most of them have a sorry personality. But this establishment was in Florida. "
good,"When working at Panera, you will gain so many friendships. It is easy to quickly move up in the company. The management needs some work but if you have a good team working together the cafe does great. Its an easy job and they do work with your at home schedules."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"It is a very fast-paced, hectic, and competitive work environment. A good first job to work temporarily but the compensation does not match the labor."
good,It wasn't that bad of a job for a kid but for the amount of work that you'll end up doing for Minimum wage was not worth it looking back but overall not a bad job
good,"not a good place to go into management. poorly ran on corporate level. The company, Panera is much better than the branch sold to other company to ran Northwest area"
good,The managers had favourites an showed attitude. Catty workplace and coworkers were a hit or miss. We had discounts but they had kept changing the policy.
good,Panera can be fair with employees by offering small bonuses to hard working employees. Unfortunately Panera is also quite greedy with money often enough no matter how hard I worked I was getting paid the same as some of my less productive co-workers and not getting recognized for it. Corporate only gave the General Manager $3 to spread out for 70 employees for a raise. The job is easy most days and as a driver you're expected to fill in wherever the team needs help to keep things efficient. Great for a first time worker but not much more than that.
good,I was a associate and I felt that most of the people hired were unable to perform simple task. Managers threw me in and I learned everything fast but coworkers were all lazy an d nothing was done to whip them into shape. I left due tot he stress of rush hours and a lacking team.
good,"Working for Panera bread is ok until u get hurt on the job , workers comp  takes u through so many loops ....and that's if u get it, which happen to me and I got cleared to come back and couldn't get no hours"
good,They never really had any shifts under 8 hours and at the time I had been going to school. I had asked for more hours thinking I would've handled it but they piled on a full-time work schedule when I only applied for part-time.
good,"Always growing, always learning.  Many facets to order from.  Constantly changing, complex menu.  The work quality and your time off for managers can be challenging to say the least.  Old software, 3 kinds of software, not of it communicates to one another effectively."
good,"I would not recommend it. Often overworked and not compensated enough for all the work you have to go through, you can get a better job in the food industry."
good,The company seems to be the least concerned about associates. Basically people don’t stay very long; they find better jobs. As a delivery driver I have
good,"They give benefits"
good,It’s a good job for high schoolers but not to move up . They lie to you just to keep you around and make false promises. It’s not the worst place to work but there’s a lot of things that needs fixing.
good,Enjoy working there. Management helps when necessary. Nice and helpful co workers. Decent pay but could be higher. Cross training is a must bc they do ask you do other positions.
good,"management was unprofessional and would never get back to my questions and never really “had time” for anything. they kinda just hid in their office until stuff hit the fan or we were extremely backed up. this was also in 2016 so i’m sure management has improved. co workers were very impolite to me, but since they were so unprofessional i’m sure most of them have been replaced and this review shouldn’t affect your decision on working there."
good,"I worked in Panera Cartering which was basically me alone doing big orders that could range from 50-5,000$ it could be very stressful and my last week there were multiple days I had to come in at 2AM. My store never got any help because it didn’t make as much as other stores in the area that’s why I was the only caterer doing all the work. You are basically on call 24/7, and you can not refuse orders. The only good thing is that I got all the tips so I ended up making a good amount of money for a good job, but they work you like a dog hardly ever getting real days off"
good,I learned a lot from working at Panera Bread and I'm grateful for the opportunity.  I'm ready to get experience in more fine dining environments as I strive to become an Executive Chef and then a business owner.
good,"I currently work at Panera. I am a front end cashier and work 5am-2pm most days. If you are looking for a job with a set schedule then this will be good for you. They are pretty flexible with availability and if you request time off you normally get it. This job doesn't pay very well though. I make 9.75 an hour and this isn't very much to live on. This is a high-stress environment and is very fast passed. The people I work with though are pretty good, I only have problems with one manager, the others are helpful."
good,Very stressful environment but not crazy difficult. It's your average cashier job. You can get nice customers and rude customers. You have good work days and bad works days.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"A great place for someone fresh out of high school or new to the working world, however, if you have any foodservice retail, or customer service experience, this company should only be considered as an Absolute Last Resort, as they are seemingly unable to truly compete with the surrounding businesses in much else than atmosphere."
good,"From the two years I worked there, we were constantly understaffed, but we didn't have enough funds to hire more people or get paid more. Sometimes the managers would have a bad attitude towards the customers, which isn't a good thing because the employees will think it's okay to have a bad attitude. Sometimes it was difficult to get days off because we're so understaffed."
good,Wasn’t the best job but it helped  here and there. The management could’ve been better. I’d say the job is for people who can keep up with the pace...
good,It’s a very slow pace work place. The management needs improvement. I wouldn’t recommend or ever go back. The job gets boring and not many things to do and keep busy.
good,Work is just fine.Career growth is a yes.Head management is a big NO.If you're not friends with them they will f@ck you. Good for gaining work experience.
good,Managers get paid more just to sit in the office on their phone all day and when you ask for help with something they look at you crazy. Don’t work here it’s not worth it.
good,"The management was extremely poor considering how many managers there were. Communication between the different employees was not professional. The schedule varied week by week and changed frequently, which was inconvenient. Multiple employees tried to tell management how to do their job."
good,"When I first started I was hardly trained. We were understaffed for a long time with almost no manager help. The help that was offered felt like formative and interpersonal relationships weren't important to quite a few of my managers. I felt made fun of for asking questions. The coworkers were amazing. Despite poor care from managers, they created bonds. The corporation ""Manna"" had little concept of what lower class individuals and groups were like. The whole establishment wasted so much food that team members would've happily and safely enjoyed."
good,They have very poor training. I didn't work there long because of poor training and because of certain life circumstances i had to go through. I had to just walk out i didnt get the chance to quit or get fired.
good,As a bake I can cry blamed when store managers don’t order everything we need to fulfill all the products they need. My direct manager likes to change schedule several days after they come out even the day they come into effect. Also retail managers can be very rude at any store in town.
good,A typical work day at Panera their are not enough people for the amount of customers in the store. Management was constantly changing. The hardest part of the job was not have employees to work. The best part of the job was the flexibly.
good,I was given many opportunities to learn many different positions. Sadly the downside with this company was that it had low tier shifts manager who could not handle the pressure of the job. They would go to lunch and never come back.
good,It was a good first job experience. It really tested how well I can accomplish multiple tasks while assisting customers but it eventually got overwhelming.
good,Though I had some issues with certain managers most of the people I met through this job became extremely important to me and they will be in my life forever.
good,I recommend working there if your young or inexperienced for real for real. They pay you every other week and sometimes the don’t let you work if u not scheduled to work.
good,Panera was a fine second job. It is good if you have good coworkers and managers like any job. It was excellent when I first started but with changing coworkers and managers it got worse. All depends on who you work with
good,Well when I first started Panera I got about 20 hours (3-4 days a week) but after a month or so my hours got cut out of no where I would rarely get called in.  I used to check my schedule using the website provided but it was down for a couple weeks so I had no way of knowing if I was on the schedule or not one of the managers said he would call to tell me my schedule and never did so one day I was supposed to work and never even knew.
good,"need more hours "
good,"Best thing about the job (i worked drive through, front counter, barista etc) was some of the friends i made. i ended up quitting because people were beginning to be hired in on a higher wage then me, who was an opener there and 5 am every morning under minimal supervision. Then they only offered like 25 cents more. Management was horrible. Got a great discount but they were super stingy on food."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"It can be stressful and fun at the same time, as long as rules are followed and no mistakes are made then the managers are happy and everyone has a good time while working hard"
good,"It was alright but that job is for a high schooler ,pay was alright ,had too many mangers ,people leaving ,was hard to move  up ,even when you ask multiple times"
good,Working for Panera Bread has always been a hit and miss type of job. There are days where you can be overwork and underpaid for the amount of work that is placed on you at times. Management could be bias sometimes towards certain associates.
good,I learned a lot about teamwork during my time at Panera Bread. It is very fast paced and stressful. I enjoyed talking to customers but always felt like I was being talked down to by management.
good,management could have been better but overall i enjoyed the experience and you get a lot of experience with customer service. Definitely fast paced which could get overwhelming
good,"A typical day at work consisted of clocking in and getting right to work. Like all places, you weren't allowed to stand still unless it was absolutely dead. I learned a lot about working with customers and other people, as well as standards a food place should hold themselves up to. However, management was always very detrimental about calling out. If you didn't have a reason to give your shift to someone, you weren't allowed to do it. If you called out, and nobody offered to cover you, that was on you as well, even if you were states away. Calling out while you were sick or injured, they required a doctors note (mind you, this is a part-time job, so no insurance to pay for these doctors visits), and still asked you to find someone to cover you."
good,"I worked myself to the bone at Panera, and while recognized as one of the harder-working employees, I was not able to make the job work. Managers seem to come and go randomly, and thus the flow of the store is interrupted regularly. High employee turnover means they are constantly understaffed. Less motivated and more disrespectful employees seem to get away with flippant attitudes and slacking off with no repercussions, while employees who bust their butts get chewed out for minor infractions. Some of the rudest and most entitled customers to top it off. Some managers tried their best, but aren't able to change the whole structure of the store on their own. Wouldn't work there again."
good,Working at Panera was an above average startup job that is for anyone who needs work experience. generally on the positive side of things . Customers were mostly respect however with Panera being labeled as a high end restaurant some customers were on the snobbish side of things. However never truly had a horrible experience with customers.  The management at my store was somewhat bad  and helping out at two other stores However this wasn’t too badshowed the sometimes management was a little sloppy but pulled through. Overall Panera is jobs another fast food restaurant Disguised as luxury
good,"The customers were rude and made very nasty remarks. The general manager (at the time, she is no longer there) was unfair and mean. She revoked my promotion because I was sick. The crew itself was the only reason I stayed so long. They gave me anywhere between 30-50 hours per week and I almost never had a day off. When I did have a day off, they would call me in."
good,Starting off was nice but as you advance you realize there is nothing but self entitled a**holes around you. The management was all over the place and we often received bad reviews on our food because they didnt stock correctly.
good,"Im a prep cook at panera"
good,"A typical day of work starting work at 6 am would be setting up the drive thru, production line,and dining room area brewing coffees, stocking pastries, and bagels for customers. The pace starts to slowly pick up once the cafe opens so be prepared for the peak times starting at 8 am until about 2 pm. Management at this location has been all over the place and the new general manager is very rude and inconsiderate to the workers lives outside of the workplace expect his own. I worked with the company since the age of 16 at another location that has since closed I then moved to the new location and everything about the Panera Bread experience is not displayed at this cafe at all. It is a good first job if they actually take the time to train the associates correctly, working for the company we were constantly understaffed which caused major stress in the work environment. Be prepared to be on your feet and in a fast paced atmosphere."
good,Too many teenagers working there who call in on a regular basis. Mgt. expects others to cover for them. Management plays favorites. No raises unless you make management.
good,I loved working at panera but the managers were terrible and unorganized. The other staff made work fun. Time went by pretty fast. the hardest part about working there would be printing the labels and the most enjoyable part of the night would be cleaning up after close.
good,"on a day to day basis the management would pick favorites, I first hand witnessed my store manager make fun of a coworker which later affected her day to day work life."
good,Panera used to be a fun place to work at. However due to them becoming severely understaffed in September of last year  it quickly became a stressful place where both the customers and staff were unhappy. The management needs to work on hiring more people and the whole company needs to be improved. I wouldn’t recommend getting a job here unless the company undergoes severe changes in the next few years.
good,The manegers are good but the GM is not so good. Hardest part is wokring with some of the employees who dont care as much. Not much training was involved.
good,"I loved my job as a night baker and spent over a year trying to be a great baker. It was difficult to know how dark to bake products because every manager wanted something different. Noone was on the same page and the only other baker couldnt help me or she wouldnt have had anytime off. It was rough work and I often had to run the entire night with no breaks just to get everything baked by morning. I was already struggling then the bakerys items were changed and the management team was restructured. After getting a new boss that was not familiar with me and a new gm at the restaurant, I started getting screamed at every morning because I wasnt fast enough. Nomatter how hard I tried I couldnt get everything baked on time.  I felt like I was letting everyone down so I decided I wasn't cut out for baking and it was best for everyone if I leave. Everyone that I worked with and all of the managers were very nice and I miss them alot. I wish I would have stayed and sat down with the other baker and tried to figure out what was slowing me down and what happened that caused us to not communicate."
good,"A typical day can be really busy or very slow."
good,"working at Panera bread was a good experience, but not something id want to stick with for the rest of my time. It became a very temportary job and I ended up leaving due to lack of flexibility, stress, and to pursue a job or experience that was closer to my interest"
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"This job is primarily for high school students or freshmen in college. It’s some good cash. If you are good, you will get a lot of hours. But be aware, if you are good they will try to take advantage of you. The only reason I stayed almost a year is because I made really good friends. Got promoted once. If you are nice to the managers and do your job, you can usually have your way with them. Also, don’t think when things are slow you can chill out, they will make you clean the gunk out of that place (literally)"
good,I was just cram pact with work would have been a lot easier if I had somebody helping me. in that case I would have had a wonderful time but since we didn't it was very stressful and very hard work for the amount I got payed.
good,"I use to look forward to going to work at Panera Bread but the management team overturn is insanely high. If you’re looking to work with adults who can not communicate without taking offence, then it’s the job for you! Every time I know I have to work, I’m depressed. I’ve never felt this way about a job before."
good,"The store I work in is located in an upscale business area, meaning that we get a lot of traffic during business hours and whenever large events are held in town, however we are often poorly equipped to handle these rushes, and many of our new hires quit within the first two weeks. The general manager has changed once during my time there, but we swap around normal managers like candy, so we rarely know what to expect from our managers on a regular basis. Coworkers tend to be unreliable and often try to push jobs off onto each other, or new employees simply aren't trained properly to begin with, often leading to confusion about procedure and what is actually required for the position they are working."
good,"Please be aware, if you're just looking for a job, it will fulfill that need. Nothing more. Nothing less. Raises are few and far in between. Disciplinary actions are not taken seriously."
good,"Working at a Panera Bread Hub can be easy and fun but also stressful. It's a good job for flexibility and advancements. The workplace is relaxed for the most part. The hardest part of the job would be catching up with all the big and intense orders and the most enjoyable part of the job is working afternoons, due to all the orders being complete."
good,panera is fast paced the manager was always extra but nice . no benefits i work bakery and get paid 9.50 a hour. not a bad job. people were prettty nice.
good,It was cool for the summer. When school started back they promised they’d work around my schedule but started scheduling to close every night on school nights.
good,"A typical day for me would consist of either running the cash register or running food to tables. Along with other general customer tasks."
good,a few of the managers there think their you know what doesn't stink and treat people very badly because they can. the mngmt. team doesnt work together whatsoever.
good,"This is outside of what type of work environment that I am used to. I feel the customer base is very spoiled and impatient with some of the associates. It is at times fast paced and a little hectic, the hard part for me is getting to know what they offer on their menu. I have been kinda moved around with very little training in each section that I have worked in. Some of the people that I work with are very nice & have been very helpful."
good,"During my seven months at Panera Bread, I was taken advantage of, never moved up (even though I knew all positions), constantly stressed, and ignored."
good,a typical day at work would be stressful due to the fact that the people I was working with had trouble getting in the same mindset and work ethic as me.
good,"you would walk in with the appropriate work wear and ask a manager where you will be working, either cash or dining room, the tables and floors were usually a mess when i get there and trash was full. Most associates dont change or clean, instead they run food or take orders or just stand around."
good,Not a company that promotes it.  You are encouraged to be available all the time.  Even on PTO DM will email and text non stop.  Integrity of upper management is lacking.  If I was to do my 9 years over I would have stayed a shift supervisor and never advanced past that.   Pay in the long run for what responsibility is is better ph.
good,This was my first job growing up and while it thought me a lot of things such as work ethic and communication skills! it also showed me about more management
good,"I really do not like how you can't get a raise working for this company.  yet in still, they want you to learn all positions. The job is pretty good for high school student but not an adult paying bills."
good,It was ok. It could have been better. The management team lacked efficient communication skills and could have been more clear in expressing what they wanted done.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Panera is fine to work for for a few years. If you are interested in food service management Panera is a good place to start. Shift supervisor and Assistant manager positions are fairly easy to get and provide a great education about people management. If you are interested in moving beyond that within the company I would recommend you reconsider. Promotion to GM usually comes with a level of responsibility that far exceeds pay level increase. At our particular franchise most positions above GM are reserved for family members and friends of the franchise owners. Overall my advice is to go for it at Panera but don't give more than a few years before moving to another concept.
good,"Always feel short-staffed, lots of call-offs, associates late for their shifts.    Managers Rarely get a break while the  associates always get theirs.  Managers work SO hard.  Assistant Managers make about 20/hr and GM makes great money and they both get bonuses.  Shift managers get NO bonuses and 25% less pay but are expected to help the AM and GM get Their bonuses and to work as if they make the same money.      GM cuts corners every chance they get to get their bonus.  Panera does do a good job with training plans for the associates.   If you like a slower-paced job, Panera is NOT the place for you to be a manager!  Associates can get away with being slower though it seems.   Associates get a cut from the TEAM TIP POOL, results in about an extra dollar per hour , managers get nothing from that."
good,This company has grown quickly and has always been understaffed. Work life balance and career development opportunities are minimal now that the company is so large. You will have a very specific role to perform and won't get much exposure outside of that role. Overall a good name Company for your resume. Pay seems average to slightly below average.
good,"While some of my local management team were great, the overall direction of Panera was quite frustrating.  The amount of work required to be done in the amount of time you were allotted was insufficient to complete tasks to specifications.  Stress was high and pay wasn't high enough to justify the overnight work and stress levels.  I was required to take an unpaid half and could never properly take it due to work structure."
good,"At Panera Bread, I am trained to work on my feet and be as efficient as possible, I am not only trained to interact with customers and assist them in solving any problems they may have but also making sure that everything is done properly so that there are no mistakes in the costumers order. I am able to open and close the store, I clean, stock and multi-task to my best ability. The most enjoyable part of the job is the team I work with, being a team player is one of the most important roles at Panera Bread. The hardest part of the job would be taking apart machines, cleaning their parts and putting the machines back together such as the, bagel slicer or the ""bubblers"" that hold about 18qts of liquid. The management at Panera Bread is poor in quality, I feel as though no one really takes their job seriously and are lazy workers. I want to be a supervisor at the store but it's almost impossible to be promoted at a busy location such as the Panera Bread in Whiteoak, which is where I work."
good,Wonderful job teaches you a lot of good knowledge that helps you grow and become more advanced to helpful this is a great job for people looking to learn the trade and get their hands dirty and get some certifications under their belt to carry on and expand the knowledge
good,"I started at Panera because a friend recommended I work there. She also worked there. I didn't realize that career advancement would take so long, if it happened at all. Eventually I was just written off the schedule without explanation, even though at the time I was working 2 jobs."
good,"Working for Panera Bread was very much a job for people still in high school. The schedule was generally flexible, but promotions are virtually nonexistent and wages are low, with rare raises even though you were supposed to be interview and considered every six months, which was not enforced by upper management."
good,"I did enjoy this job the first couple of months, but next thing I knew so many managers put in their two weeks after our really good GM was relocated to another Panera.  It was hectic from there and if it weren't for that or the poor GM we have now, I would say it's a good place to work for and every Panera is different."
good,"They pay more than anywhere else for food service. Management from GM up needs some work, but the shift managers are decent. As is the case with any food service, unless you want to go into management, there is no opportunity."
good,Good enviroment friendly environment great place to work besides bad scheduling and poor management at time however the pay is decent for the type of job it is
good,"I was young when I worked at Panera, so it was good for that time of my life. If I was 25 at that time, I couldn't do it. Management changed too much to build any rapports."
good,"Panera bread has a clean working enviroment. They ensure the work area is clean for customers. However, Panera Bread as a workplace would not be something I’d recommend to a friend."
good,They manly hired high school and college students. The environment was very lax. And the managers only did the minimum unless it was swamped. The other employees only half did their jobs.
good,"It was a great place to work as a filler job to pass the time before finding a more permanent place to be,  I enjoyed working with the public and seeing the regulars that would come in."
good,I wasn't even done with my 6 weeks training an was already working by myself. I have many years of baking experience an I'm telling you this is one person doing a two man job. They had me going to other stores sometimes two stores in one night then back to my own store an the others were about 45 min away one way. I was getting sick with the stomach virus an told them I may not be able to get through the whole night an told them why an they said ok an if I started feeling worse through the night someone would relieve me. After 4 hours of working I could not make it any longer so I called them an they said I had to suck it up because there is nobody to relieve me. I worked another two hours an called again an got the same response at which time I told them I quit an I walked out
good,"You work alone at night, doing too much in too little time. You see other people for at most 2 hours of the night. It gets lonely, but if you're someone who enjoys alone time, it's perfect to blast music and get things done with. It's hard work and can be hard on your body if you push yourself too much, but catch the raises and you'll be well compensated. The fact that I have benefits here is important to me. It's a job that you can really be proud of at the end of each shift."
good,Recently transferred to TN from another state. Loved working with the company before (5 years) but in TN the management is terrible. Nothing is ever good enough.
good,it was a nice job at first to work at but one of the managers was really lazy and would put down workers who would always work so hard and would make you feel so stupid.
good,"On a typical day at Panera Bread, I would make customers orders as the cashiers rang them in. I also assisted wherever i was need around the restaurant. Managers were switched around frequently which very much so affected the workplace."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Panera was a ok company, we had a lot of fast paced times and very much do business. Panera would be more for people who want o work on the food industry, me i wanted it for customer service."
good,Multi-unit manager overseeing 18 cafes and learned to partner with many different learning styles and personalities.  Company serves a great product and healthy.
good,"At times it can be like a soap opera working here, a few great managers and one or two under qualified, must constantly ask for hours or be over looked, same goes for training, if you want to move up."
good,The facility is in the midst of a transition. certain personnel in management aren't as knowledgeable about their duties as they should. No oversight within production
good,"This job is ideal for a college or high school student. They are practically always hiring, and are good at giving hours. Management was good at working around everyone's personal schedules. Some managers were pretty rude and snotty, one of the managers was racist which was the main reason I left. The can get stressful especially on weekends but normally is tolerable. The co workers were my favorite part of the job as they made it pretty fun"
good,It is a job and would be a good stepping stone but nearly no one would want to have to work into the environment for long. It is hectic and even if you put you are unavailable certain days and times they tend to ignore and schedule you anyway.
good,"During my time at Panera for the past year, I have learned to approach a myriad of problems from multiple angles. I am also able to perform several different job positions, even without having been properly trained. Although this may have come off as some sort of rant, I assure every one who will be seeing this that my time at Panera was nothing short of a beautiful life lesson. It' s been a wonderful experience that I would never change if given the chance."
good,"The it is a good company to work for, but there is no work life balance there.  Managers are not given what they need to succeed at Panera and they are always fighting an uphill battle."
good,"Mostly alright company, just needs more focus on personnel development and advancement. Hours are flexible and the people are great. .................."
good,the long route is too much for one person. Do more out here than any other driver in the nation but due to the number of stores are paid less. Management does not care about employees or what they need
good,Was a stressful workplace went threw 3 general managers upon opening of dec 7th 2017 and it’s august under pay felt like I wasn’t appreciated went from 40 hrs a week to 25 without warning
good,"The salary is okay, it’s just the hours are not enough , yet they offer more hours to new employees than the ones that worked there first. Why hire new workers when we are fully staffed in the morning and not give other employees more hours? It makes no sense how they schedule me and my coworkers sometimes. I get 4 hours , and maximum 6 hours , which is unfair since I worked there for almost 2 years and still no raise , no benefits, nor hours ."
good,"Panera Bread is a good job for a high school student, but as a college student it is not money to support oneself while paying for school and bills as well as having money for food and doing fun things."
good,"My time at Panera has been tiring I have not seen a shift different from 5am-1pm since I started working there. I have not seen any offers to advance in other positions. I have seen people start working and become management without anyone asking if I even want to learn a different position. It is frustrating to feel stuck and have to get up at 4am for minimum wages. Honestly the people there are good until a little thing goes wrong, then everyone is snappy and ready to bite your head off I like a few people I work wit but I cannot deal with the drama."
good,"My coworkers were lovely, they  pretty much welcomed me with open arms. I would say that it wasn’t my ideal first job, but it was a good and bad learning experience."
good,"It a productive and active environment. Some days are really hectic with unlimited phones calls from cafe managers. It all depends on how everyone handles their job, because if the chain of production is efficient then the workload would be effective for all. Everyone needs to be ready to independently handle issues as they arise and not wait for those responsible."
good,"I was about 17 when i started working at Panera, I left when I was 18 and only working .50 cents more than what I got hired on. I was running shifts by then and trained in everything."
good,"A typical day consisted of taking customers orders, making drinks, consolidating meals, and watching over other employees. The most enjoyable aspect was creating friendships with coworkers."
good,I would appreciate if management would give more autonomy their teams. Alot of us know our jobs quite well but feel micro managed and under appreciated.
good,"The job is just a job.  The management is hands-on, but are not interested in your hard work, or whether you can be clever with your work or not.  They don't reward you, or recognize you.  Only 1 of 6 had for me.  The coworkers and guests you get to know are the only ones that would make the job enjoyable."
good,"I enjoyed this job at first, but after awhile I worked way too hard that job advancements were never offered to me, but to new workers who were not very experienced and were not there in the time I was. Management was not the best and pay could have been offered more."
good,"your all ways busy not much down time unless you make friends with the mangers, they definitely play favorites hard.  you need great social skills to survive there"
good,thought management was appropriate and provided good supervision. Wished compensation was more competitive. Job duties were reasonable and able to be completed in time allowed.
good,The job itself is hard have to be able to multitask on hundred percent of the time must be able to change gears at a moment's notice can be busy 2 hours a day and then some coworkers can be nice and fun to joke with but there's also the ones that cop an attitude and bring pretty much the whole team down
good,"the managers were unfair and unreasonable. did not hire people at the same pay, they were. I did learn how to multi-task when managers would be too busy with paperwork to help deal with problems in the kitchen, with employees, or even with customers."
good,The company has good views and has a great platform that it stands on.  Appreciated its efforts to ethically source their products as well as how they allow their cafe's to donate the product at the end of the day.
good,you can learn so much.The hours are not very good though and i feel like the pay could be better but overall a great place to work.the management is awesome there.i learned about all different ingredients and they do a good job of education everyone.It is a fast paced environment to work in.
good,"There is a very high turn around rate for employees and there is a good reason for it. Training is virtually non-existent, managers play favorites often, the pay is terrible, and often the employees that are trusted are the problem."
good,"It was an ok place to work, but it would be a great place for someone to have a first job. Panera has good food, so receiving discounts was nice. The management could be better."
good,"Panera is a great place to work for someone looking for their first job or a college student.  Typical day includes preparing food, cleaning, and ringing customers up.  This job can be fast paced."
good,"The environment of working there made working there tolerable. The better you work, the more hours you get. you do get to keep bread at the end of the shift. Friday lunch rush are hectic."
good,Easy work but the managers promote and work based on if you're their friend. They don't do their jobs properly and make the associated pick up the slack. Most of their time is on their phones in the office.
good,I've been here 6mos sometimes this job makes me struggle due to not really having a team to back me. I've been actively seeking other employment for awhile now.
good,"Panera was a good first job. I learned a lot of my customer service from working at Panera and learned how to think fast on my feet when there was a problem. I was a very hard worker and always did the best i could, including helping my coworkers whenever they needed help."
good,"The hours for a Manager at Panera Bread were grueling. I would open at 4 am and leave my shift sometimes at 5 pm.  The regular staff was paid very poorly and sometimes no call no showed, while I would have to open by myself. I was not allowed to write up staff members for any reason. The GM was powerless to do anything due to the owner micromanaging every day. Not to mention screaming at us on speakerphone."
good,Started as a great place to work. Now it seems employees and management are not trained correctly. Several are basically there to get a pay check and care about nothing else. No work ethic.
good,The work at Panera is very stressful and not worth the wage. They expect you to work faster than humanly possible. There are a million things to keep track of and do in addition to the tide of people coming through the store and the managers have no sympathy when it comes to forgetting one small detail.
good,"Panera would be a better place to work at if it were more organized. Regularly, you hear of people calling off or no call/no shows because Panera doesn't punish them half the time. You will probably get screwed over once a week. They regularly have fundraisers which ends up making the work environment stressful due to low labor from hour cuts. However, the pay is okay."
good,"Would not recommend. Fast paced, brutal. You're constantly expected to be on your feet and moving. They don't really care about giving employees breaks when they need breaks, they just want to get it out of the way because of their legal obligation to and will sometimes put you on break 10 minutes after you clock in. You will be expected to train people without being paid as an associate trainer."
good,"As a trainer at Panera Bread I usually worked morning shifts on the line ( preparing food) but, I knew every position in house. On the regular i was put in the ""floater"" position. Being a floater means that whatever position they need me to slide too, depending on how busy we are, I slide with no question. Management at first was very easy to talk to and, seemed to be understanding. After a 5 months of working things started to change. The work environment was very stressful, managers were not understanding nor, helpful and this led to certain employees not caring. My favorite part was the people, which is Panera Breads focus, I loved all the guests I encountered. The stories people shared, the smiles I created, and the life time friendships I made. The hardest part of my job was getting managers to listen to issues and the resolutions that were given by me and other employees. In the end I hated working there because it was always something negative, or too much work thrown on half of the employees. I LOVED training people and, helping people no matter what I was doing."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"I really liked my job at Panera,but i was never trained right away to bake products.The persons I worked with had issues with one another and tried to get me in on them.We always had a large turnover of employees at this store ,it took me a while to get certified and another wait for a raise."
good,"I learned a great deal about customer service in this role.   75% of my time was spent as a cashier and I enjoyed that.  I did not have one manager I reported to, but many managers with different managing styles and expectations."
good,Working for panera bread taught me a lot about the culinary industry. It was great when i worked for a franchise that allowed me to move up into a higher position and take on more responsibility. The panera bread in Vegas did not have such opportunities and i had to seek employment elsewhere. For someone starting a career in the culinary field i cant think of a better place to start.
good,Panera is a good place to work if you are in high school. It is not a place to work for as a career and the people that work there aren't dedicated. Everything at Panera is temporary.
good,"Overall ... it's a place to work."
good,"Learn new things everyday. Good physical exercise. Great interaction with customers. Friendly co-workers. Nice general manager."
good,"I worked at Panera Bread for 5 years at 4 different locations in KY. A day at Panera Bread depends on the store, but you'll feel a lot of negativity and laziness in the air! If you need help, don't bother the managers! They're most likely smoking/vaping out back no matter what time of day it is. If you're lucky enough to get ""promoted"" in a couple of years, you'll be discouraged when your responsibilities go out the roof and your pay only increases by a dollar and some change."
good,"Prepared food and beverages for customers."
good,"Retail panera is easy. Baking is a whole different department. Overnight work that includes manual labor will crush you, but if its something you're passionate about it might just be worth it. Panera baking is an excellent gateway to greater culinary positions."
good,It really depends on who you work with and what kind of management you have. I have enjoyed my job and my time with the company but some days are definitely better than others.
good,"Panera was a good first job and could hold you up if it had too, however I wouldn’t recommend it. They don’t pay well (minimum wage) and it can be an extremely stressful and overwhelming job."
good,"Once you get to really know the people that work there it can take off some ease of trying to perfect everything; the people there will show you the reigns as you work along. theres multiple rotational managers usually two to three, so you can't really mess up that bad."
good,Wouldn't recommend this job at location on Hulen. Cool people to work with but it is ran poorly. Needs new management. There are many things in the store that should be changed.
good,"- My typical day at work Panera was really great."
good,"For the amount of pay and as many employees are employed there, we often were expected to take on way too many tasks than we could handle. It can be a very stressful environment with pressure coming from the managers and fellow coworkers.  The management is overall nice and willing to listen however the changes that are promised never really seem to happen, and they expect too much from their employees for the low salary and hours they give them.  The hardest part of the job is not being able to leave when we are scheduled to leave, especially when we have already spent hours working at the cafe due to the poor scheduling of employees or call-outs, which happen often.  The most enjoyable part of the job was that it is often fun to be around coworkers and managers when there is little stress and the cafe is slow."
good,The poor management made the job extremely unpleasant. The customers were also apart of the issue and the way things were handled.  I would not recommend taking a job at Panera.
good,It was an ok job to work at. Wish I could go back. Loved meeting new people everyday and the everment was an ok place most of the time. SOme of the people I worked with were easy going and very friendly.
good,"Being a night baker, you are by yourself, which at times can be depressing but sometimes its nice. you are constantly running around trying to get your bake done, are cleaned, dishes done and whatever else before the bakery opens. its very frustrating at times but sometimes in a way can be rewarding. I am too much of a people person so this job has been getting very down on me. also you literally do the same thing every night..."
good,"I worked as the Catering Coordinator for about a year and I only received about as much money as a cashier, even though my workload was ridiculous and I would sometimes work 50-55 hour weeks just to get my orders in on time. And it was either a ton of orders, or it was none, there was no in-between. So I'd either work my butt off and not get paid that much, or I'd do nothing and languish from poverty."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Not an easy job. A lot of stress and hard customers/managers to deal with for the pay. The worst is your first few months there, then it gets better as you become familiar with everything and everyone and the managers aren't as harsh on you. I liked that it was fast-paced so there was always something to do and although the pay wasn't good I did get a lot of hours for being part-time. I guess it's a good experience because it prepares you to deal with a stressful and fast-paced environment, rude customers, and angry management."
good,Its a job if you need on. it is extremely hard under paid and very much pressuring the people are sometimes rude and believe they are above you and you can never be right .
good,If you're a cashier you work the registers and help customers with their needs. Clean up any time you can if not helping any customers. You are required to smile a majority of the time.
good,"For starters, it’s not an awful job. The pay is low, but it’s incredibly easy work. Each location is different, and the location I’m at just seems to always be facing stressful days."
good,"I normally went into work at about 5 o clock monday, wednesday-friday and i was scheduled until 10:30 the managers never helped us so we didnt leave until close to 11:30 and no one was trained so no one knew exactly what they were supposed to do"
good,"Great job for someone looking for a second income, part time work and/or high school or college student. Must be able to multi task at times and can be fast paced"
good,The job itself was ok buit the management is really young and can be unfair at some times.  They don't sit down and talk to anyone and let people talk bad about each other.  They are professional if they ever do though.
good,"The communication between bakers and mangers is aweful. You never know what to improve on. Bakers complain about other bakers on a daily basis just because they don’t like one another, I got told on for not talking to another baker. How stupid is that? It’s a great job with great pay if you’re only working there for a year, but after that expect things to fall apart."
good,"Be ready to work less than 40 hours and more than 30. You'll easily get overtime but they'll never allow you to reach 40 hours, not even the assistant managers."
good,"after a year and a half with the company, advancement opportunities that were promised were not followed thru on. Also, raises were very small. overall, good job, but not a place for a career"
good,"If you are looking for your first job then it will be a fit for you. Otherwise, put your energy into finding something else. Advancement opportunities are sparse. If you do happen to move up you take on a ton of responsibilities. You will be performing multiple roles outside of your own.  For the work you are supposed to do the compensation does not match. Not much work/life balance after moving into management."
good,"Always short, managers very snappy and rude. Even with a doctors note still write up for missing shift. Was there for over a year, did everything to make my way to management position but kept getting bumped down due to lack of associates"
good,"I enjoy the fast paced environment of Panera Bread. I’m a transfer from a Colorado Springs location to Chula Vista. Overall, the management is absent, and other associates spend more time socializing than actually working."
good,"Many managers are far too friendly with the staff. They don't act with appropriate manager behavior, it is more like a playground in which they pick favorites."
good,Faced-paced during the whole day but overall good atmosphere. Friendly staff that is always ready to help out one another and training is fun-filled for everyone.
good,"Pretty decent job, not hard to be promoted in some locations. Management differs from location to location. You make great friendships, almost family."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Great place to work if you're juggling work and school, the food is always a plus as well. Working with others that work as hard as you is also nice to have."
good,"Panera Bread gave me great experience in customer service. The down side is management and working at 5:30 am or until 11:30 pm. They also can be very flexible when scheduling, but if they accidentally schedule you for when you told them you can not work, its on you to find a cover. The biggest downside for me personally was the hours. I would close at 11:30 and have to come back in the next day at 5:30 am."
good,"Overnight baking was fast paced and required a great deal of self motivation, though very simple. The supervision for the Bakers was excellent, but the store management was inexperienced and unprofessional."
good,It was a great job to work my way through highschool and college. I learned a lot about customer service and how to get a job done in a timely manner.
good,"Overall, working at Panera Bread was pretty fun. Being able to talk to managers and co-workers was good too. But, I felt like there was no room for advancement. Most people were locked to a certain job without being offered what the really want to work as."
good,Would not recommend this job to anyone.Management makes the job unbearable. No training and no documentation. Expected to know the job within the first two weeks.
good,"When it comes to the actual work, it's easy. Nothing to do, anyone can do it. But the environment that your in, with the people they'll hire and some of the management itself. It can be a very stressful work place."
good,"Having customers making sure they are always happy, Management may not always be fair but seem to do the bare minimum. The company itself has great values."
good,I worked here for awhile. I thought nothing of it. Literally. 0 thoughts about this job experience. I made money and did my job well until I did not work there anymore.
good,"I was always kept busy as i prepped. Nobody bothered me in my station. I did not have to be under pressure, I worked at my pace . did not need supervision."
good,"I had fun while working at this job, lots of cleaning involved, you show up on time and do your job and no problems would arise. Communication is definitely a plus"
good,"First off I would like to say that this may vary for all Panera breads. But I'm located at one of the most busiest branches with the most inexperienced managers, and careless employee's. This has been my most stressful job ever hence i worked at chickfila before this, and even that was hectic, but its all about the management."
good,The managers and co workers are very helpful when you first start working there and they are all so sweet and kind to the customers . They always have a smile on their face and will greet you from a mile away.
good,"Loved the company as a whole, quality of management not the best. Great atmosphere. Positive guest interactions and care. A great first time job, quality company."
good,"I had a fun time working at this workplace but it was only temporary.  It was good to pass time, I liked all of my coworkers. It required a lot of teamwork."
good,"Daily job would start the same, then managers would switch you around to the busiest parts of the store as needed, making life difficult. They expect too much when it comes to your customer service, no matter how good you are they will expect the impossible."
good,"Panera offers a fast paced and friendly environment to work in. It's not difficult to learn and become certified in every area of the cafe. I definitely experienced a different take on fast food. Managers are friendly and encouraging, for the most part, however, I found that the district manager is much more willing to listen to complaints and suggestions. She was also the only person in management to make changes that associates desired. The most difficult part of the job is how fast paced it is, but if you're comfortable in that kind of environment, then it's pretty enjoyable. The most enjoyable part of the job is definitely how much warmer and friendly it is than other fast food restaurants."
good,"Most of the times you have to be at work by 4am. In the morning you need to set up all the stations. Though the management works as hard as you do, they are not very understanding."
good,"I do believe Panera is a wonderful business. However, the staff at the Williston location are very full of drama, pettyness, and angst. I do not believe this is a place anyone would want to commit to being more than a few hours a day."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Panera Bread is a good first job. It teaches you good customer service skills, how to manage money in the cash register, and how to make basic food items."
good,"My original application stated that I would simply be a delivery driver, but I was later asked to help with prep. This was supposed to be an infrequent task, but I was later placed on the schedule to work full-time prep without my full say. I basically lost my job as a delivery driver to myself and on top of that was the only employee asked to do other miscellaneous tasks such as cleaning, plumbing, and even repairs."
good,Honestly feels like you are back in high school. The management sucks we are always running out of product and almost always short staffed. The food is expensive and the customers will never stop reminding you.
good,I worked as a cashier. Greeting and taking orders were my main responsibilities. The best part was working with customers. The worst part was closing and cleaning.
good,"The managers were never available when needed and there appeared to be a change in management regularly which caused chaos."
good,Most days were good and others were horrible. Really an easy job overall just horrible when it came to getting things done. I was the go to gut for everything when it came to getting thing done because others didn't want to work. I was constantly over worked and under paid. But I did meet a lot of nice people while working there.
good,"Panera Bread could be a good place to work for some, however, the work/life balance is not what I expect, the lack of promotional opportunities is difficult to germinate growth."
good,"This was not the best job I've ever had.  The management was poor and played favorites with the other workers who had been there longer.  The employee discount was not large, maybe 20%, I can't remember.  As always, customers can be really snobby about their food, especially a ""higher-up"" type restaurant like Panera. Overall, dreaded this job."
good,This job was meant for high schoolers. If your a high school graduate looking for good money. This place is not the place. it does teach you customer service and the way to deal with customers.
good,Pretty good place to work but they don't give enough hours ro part time employees.  Sometimes the kitchen staff would et the orders wrong and the drivers had to take the blame
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers. It was a very fast paced restaurant, we were always understaffed which caused the managers to constantly help out which they all disliked. It was a caring environment with very nice people. But it was poorly run from the district manager down. Which caused everybody to have bad days."
good,"I would show up at one of my four stores, clock in at that location and then proceed to drive around the area and cold call different business to try and get them to order from Panera."
good,they don't let you eat the food. they count everything there. the leftover food they throw away at the end of the night. overall the experience to with their was good
good,You are put into a certain position and it is your responsibility to do all the task and cleaning regularly. I learned how to deal with customers. You were working with managers close to your age and so most of the time they were enjoyable. Most of the coworkers are fun to be around. Hardest part is being quick and taking on more work because they don't want as many closers. Most enjoyable would be working with coworkers.
good,"My coworkers were great. The assistant manager was very rude. I believe he is no longer there but he thought he was above everyone else, would look down on you, treat you like you were less than him. The actual manager was very sweet but unfortunately I worked with the assistant manager more often."
good,Working at panera is really good if you are just starting in the work field. They have lots of things to help you and are always about the team. I learned how to build things in order as well as keep myself and others safe while working. The management was a bit shaky here and there but they were always there for their team. The workplace is usually clean. The hardest part of the job was when breaks were given out and it got busy. The most enjoyable part was the celebrations with the team.
good,Panera Bread can be a fun work place with the right people. Food here takes longer to make than the average fast food restaurant. This creates many impatient customers. This issue is exacerbated by the fact that the one I worked at has a Drive Thru
good,"I just gave a review, what else you want to know. I ended up in the food industry because of the 2010 crisis. No jobs available, only the low paid and that's what I've been doing. Love to cook, pays the bills."
good,"It was fun at some points, but other times miserable. The managers were not very nice people, but the workers weren't that bad. The scheduling is not fair at all, I only get one day a week there, which is not nearly enough to pay for my car insurance and gas."
good,This is a job where you would have to deal with disorganization and confusion. Its still probably better than others but from my current experience i get enough hours to get by
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Panera Bread is a great company but the Upper level management is not the best. They need more work on how to deal with employees and how to get them developed and move up in the company.
good,"Our location was the busiest in all of Central Florida, but it was horribly understaffed, and the employees regularly did the work of three people. My manager and my co-workers were nice, but the store was micro-managed by the owner of the company, causing a lot of stress among the team.  We were not allowed to give very much for customer satisfaction, making moving up in the company undesirable."
good,"It was a okay place to work, but management is terrible. They will blame on you everything what happen, even if you do a the right way."
good,Great place to work at great working Bierman great team everyone works together to get all of the customers taken care of and have a personal experience every visit
good,Management was really young here but they did a great job. Co workers were fun and got along for the most part. Dining was a busy job that was impossible for one person to do but that didn't matter. Customers were cranky about the prices a lot.
good,"A typical day at work is very busy and involved, you're constantly doing something. When I come into work i usually go straight to line and begin making paninis for the day. After I'm finished with those, i finish setting up the line so our other line workers have their stations set up and ready to go. Depending, I could end up training a new employee, or just an employee switching to line, on a station and showing them how everything works. My management staff and coworkers are great people and I very much enjoy working with them all, they definitely make time go by faster. I would have to say the hardest part of the job comes with being understaffed and consistently busy, it gets a little chaotic with everyone rushing around. The most enjoyable part would be getting to talk to the customers, there are many that I am on a first name basis with. There is one customer in particular that gives everyone on our staff a hug when she comes in and brings us goodies quite often."
good,"When I first started working here there was a a woman manager, and she was just plain rude and nasty to all the guests and associates. After she left the new GM was a man and even though he still struggles with being a manager he is doing better than she was. Working here you have to deal with upper class people, meaning snobby customers, you have to deal with there always being short staff so there is always a line out the door, and the managers put the stress on the associates every time they are stressed. I'm not saying this is a bad place, on a good day everyone gets along and the managers work well with everyone. I would suggest working here if you haven't worked before or if you're only looking for a part time job because even with 30+ hours you won't be getting paid much for the work you put in and there is never room to grow, they are always making broken promises or giving people names like 'trainer' to make them stay longer."
good,"Working at Panera was fun and easy. I was always around a bunch of people. I learned that you cant be shy and that helping people was a good thing. Although, the managers need improvement the work day was awesome. co workers were the best part of the job made plenty of new friends and made work so much more fun to be at."
good,"Enjoyable with the people I worked with being kind and sweet. The hardest part of the job is moving up, other than that I would recommend working here."
good,Our rushes are lunch and dinner so around 12:00 P.M and 5:30 P.M weekly. Our busiest is when the furniture market is in town.
good,"Was a decent job but the General Manager was a hassle to deal with. Made my working environment uncomfortable. Other than that I learned and perfected every position within a month or so. Co-workers were amazing. A typical day at work consisted of customer care, cashiering, and making food and beverages."
good,"Team oriented environment. Checking the store, making sure that everything is correct and in oder. Management could be more organized. Most co-workers are very helpful. Hardest part of the job was trying to get more than 25 hours a weak. Enjoyed the environment and people."
good,"Over the last four years I've learned a lot through this company. The good, the bad, and the ugly. The co-workers are incredible and get along very well working as a team. Room for advancement or raises seems nearly impossible, as you can't move up higher than a shift supervisor if you are in college."
good,"A generally fast-paced environment with an unfortunately unreliable staff and mediocre management. Management tends to hire teenagers and first-year college students that don't have much in the way of work ethic and the younger employees often run roughshod over the management. Despite these shortcomings, Panera Bread is a decent choice for a first job, otherwise not worth the trouble if you're looking for a well-managed place of employment."
good,I have learned a lot of management skills during my time at Panera.  A typical day is busy and keeps you moving! makes your days go by very fast.
good,Not a fan of the 3rd shift. The some of the management only looks out for themselves. People think the bakers are machines and not people.
good,"The shifts could be long, I did not like washing dishes for 7 hours. Some of the people in management at Panera Bread franchises probably do not even have a GED. Coworkers were a bunch of college kids for the most part which was nice. Hardest part of the job was dealing with unruly customers or unrealistic management"
good,I felt management could work on communicating with each other as well as with the employees. I felt that me and a few coworkers had to do way more work than employees who were there for way longer than us.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"poor management, they weren't on the same page"
good,"Easy and productive place to work, However, I'm only working here because I'm finishing up with school. The management is decent, sometimes all over the place when it comes to advancement opportunities."
good,Very busy place. Definitely will help improve your customer service skills. Things are done in a specific way and management will not have it done any other way.
good,"hours allow for a balance in your life.  Management is often one sided and everyone is not heard, rather ignored.  Friendship between upper management does not allow for fair treatment of all managers."
good,"Most managers are super nice, but then you have the occasional ones who make you rethink if this job is for you. I learned that the only way things are going to get done is by teamwork. At panera everyone is included in the team with is really nice. Although there are those few people that can  disrupt that flow, you just have to bend backwards and keep going."
good,"I do enjoy this job but the management doesn't take employee issues seriously. They are consistently sending me home early, so therefore my hours are cut extremely. I am having a hard time keeping a steady paycheck because of that."
good,I enjoyed working with my managers and coworkers. We all worked just as hard to satisfy customers. I learned a lot at this job fast and met great people.
good,I love panera bread they donate thee food eveyr night which is great.. they currenty dont have enough employees and one of the managers are rude but its a great place great vibe
good,"Work environment was unequal and people were treated unfairly. There were double standards set by managers, so as long as you were a ""favorite"" employee, you were fine. It was also unsanitary."
good,"A typical Day at work would involve me clocking in, walking around the dining room cleaning tables, washing dishes, cleaning the bathroom, helping with barista, taking orders and making sure people were happy and got great service."
good,The team members were nice but the managers kept changing. People can get overworked and stressed. They system kept changing so when you showed up at work you did not know what to expect or where to find things.
good,"I love panera, the over all atmosphere is great. The customers are great. I had a problem with all the managers except two. The others always talked so bad about people. Always had an attitude. And don't get sick or have a family emergency where you have to call in, because your hours will be cut. And I don't mean just a few hours I'm talking about only getting one day a week."
good,"I enjoy working with my coworkers, but management is awful. No raises, and never recognize workers for doing an outstanding job."
good,"Over night shift work, very busy, you bake all the baked goods for the cafe to sell for the next day. 3rd shift work where you work independently or with a helper"
good,there was to many personal relationships between staff and management which made it hard for those who worked hard to be promoted within the company.
good,This place makes you regret working. The managers are really hard to communicate with. They make it seem like you are bothering them when you are asking them to complete their every day duties so you can continue to complete yours.
good,"loved the job have a schedule, work with a great bunch of people, management is hard to work with sometime they lack communication skills with fellow employees"
good,"Get skilled quickly from how fast you need to learn everything."
good,"It is a very quiet place to work for if you work over night. I would come in from 9pm to 7 am and bake t"
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,A typical day at work consisted of coming in and prepping the food I would need for the day to make the salads. Through out working here I learned that your coworkers is what makes work fun not always the management or the way the establishment is ran.
good,I often had too many hours and I was a full-time student at the time. So I got very little sleep and not enough study time. The work load could be overwhelming.
good,"A typical day at work was me running around trying to clean off everyone's table, get them their food, re-stock the drink station, make some of the food, and then run back and was some dishes."
good,I enjoyed the job but working in the different stores was a little difficult. Not really a convenient commute and rude coworkers.
good,"As this was my first job, it was alright. The work was simple and easy to learn. The coworkers were great, but after our general manager left, we had a lot of problems with all of the management team. The only benefits you get are half price meals and you can take home pastries at the end of the night if you're the closer. I learned a lot, but I probably wouldn't recommend this job if you're looking for something long term."
good,"I am a ""Floater"" at Panera Bread, and I often work in multiple areas every day. I know how to prep the food and assemble it quickly. I clean the dining area of dirt off tables, and take out garbage, and remove dishes from our busing areas. I can ring people out and take orders on the phone. The management are nice but super harsh, particularly our district and regional managers, who often ask the impossible of the employees. The worst part of this job is the customers, but it is also the best. Sometimes I'll have a day where all of the people I help are in a bad mood. When I work I try to have a big smile and good disposition even if I'm not doing well; when I have a day with a bunch of mean customers sometimes it seems like I just make them more irritated because I'm happy. On the other side of the coin, I sometimes get just one customer that I help in a small insignificant way, like blocking the men's bathroom door so he can take his four kids to the bathroom without people coming in, and they are so appreciative that I go in the back of house and cry for a minute."
good,"Overall, it was a fun place to work. But, management was not the greatest, and there was constantly something going on in the store, which became distracting."
good,"From my store, and hear-say, I think the Panera Bread company itself needs improvement. Job duties and expected work need to be reevaluated."
good,It was not a balanced schedule and the reason why is because the managers would always change who did the schedule. I wasn't treated with respect.
good,"I learned how to work closely with my team members and management to complete many tasks ranging from providing service to the customer to fulfilling daily cleaning and training duties during my shift. My coworkers made the work environment enjoyable and fun even when we were in a breakfast, lunch, or dinner rush. The sense of family among team members made the stressful situations much easier to deal with because having a positive influence around you definitely puts you in a positive mood. During my time at Panera, I learned how to deal with difficult situations while interacting with customers, time management with life outside of work, and that having a sense of family and pride amongst my coworkers makes long work days enjoyable."
good,Hours are always being cut and management likes to be bossy and not act like a team player. The hardest part of the job is sometimes lifting heavy products because management does not show sympathy if you are hurt. The most enjoyable part is the discounted food.
good,"A typical day at Panera particularly at the location I worked at which was one of the busier cafe's in West Michigan was busy and stressful, the mostly fun part about the job was my coworkers. When I first started there I loved my job it was fast paced, a new challenge. They offer cash register positions, dining room, line workers and drive-thru. Once I was trained on all positions a lot more was constantly expected of me, more work than just one person should handle. The way they decided raises was on performance and they were supposed to do reviews every so often but those were often done late or not at all. Management was the most stressful part, my GM would constantly be stressed out and take it out on us. He did the scheduling and yet was always asking people to stay late or work long hours. I once worked an 11 hour day with only a 10 minute break. A coworker of mine once worked a 12 hour day. Forgot about sick days, even if you call within 4 hours of your shift they would sometimes still give you a write up and even when you could find someone to cover your shift they'd give you smuck over not being there. Overall it was fun but my managers made the job much more stressful than it had to be."
good,"The management was unorganized, the staff wasn't properly trained, the employees don't get awarded for their hard work. It was not a place that I wanted to grow with the company."
good,"Very nice environment, i learned many things like dealing food and customers. Some managers explain but many don't. Co-workers and good. Hardest part of the job was closing when nothing is done right. The most enjoyable part is working with the new people, and learning new things everyday."
good,working for panera bread wasn't the best nor was it the worst.The company tries to put a authentic feel on its products but its really just overpriced ham sandwiches.
good,"It was okay. You get paid minimum wage while the work is physically challenging. If you get hurt on the job, they won't care and will make you continue to work. No matter how many times you cover people's shifts, nobody will cover you. Management will threaten to write you up over one mistake."
good,"Well, here my days often changed, seeing how in the six months I worked there I went through four different job positions. While I worked there I was a trainee, on food preparation, a dining room worker, and a dishwasher. I learned how to operate a commercial dishwasher, how to make certain dishes, how to properly operate a  grill, bread-shredder, commercial coffee makers, commercial tea makers and soap/soda disposal units. The management were honestly very unforgiving and often said hurtful things to their employees. The co-workers were often not in the best of moods because of the very stressful and fast paced work environment. The hardest part of the job was definitely having to stay on top of the entire dining room when I was working their. But the most enjoyable was for sure when I was a dishwasher and just had to clean all the dirty dishes and keep to myself."
good,"Though working at this company was a good start to my independance, it always felt understaffed, as we were often overworked.  Working with my fellow employees was definitely the best part, as I made many good friends.  Most of the managers were easy to work with, and it seemed like a good place to grow within the company."
good,"Responsible for the customers experience is very important which takes being knowledgable, being fast pace, accurate, and good at what ever it is you're doing. Staying focused and helping others is very important, and being aware of your surroundings. Mangers in my opinion, firstly always act professional, and stay focused on work. When I talk to a manger I expect them to be helpful, a resource to me, understanding, caring for their workers. My co-workers preferably should be organized, helpful, friendly, reliable, on time, and like myself go above and beyond in any work environment. I don't like work to be a social hour. When I go to work I expect to work, and it's hard when others don't see it that way. I enjoy the rewarding feeling of work at the end of each day as long as I know, and others know I always do my best."
good,"Just overall not a great place to work. There is a lot of double talk, unfulfilled promises, and it takes entirely too long to set a plan into motion."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"I learned a lot about many different types of food, such as Quinoa, Edamame and Gruyere and Fontina cheese. Panera does a good job of using interesting ingredients in their recipes to entice customers and keep their taste buds craving that ""something special."" The company invests a lot of time and effort into creating a warm and inviting environment for customers to feel as though they are at home, warm by the fire or in a cozy chair in a nook by the door."
good,"You get paid minimum wage."
good,Most days are really great and can be fun...the worst part is dealing with people who are rushed and not quite polite.
good,"Working for Panera was not for me. Depending on which manager I would speak to , everything was done a certain way. There no clarity on the correct way to close the store. Everyone there seemed to hate their job, making it an unpleasant work environment. Also one of the main managers seemed under qualified and knew nothing about the products or how to run the store."
good,"Excellent entry level manager trainee program.  Upper management has a tendency to micro manage, and operational expectations are not entirely realistic or looked at on an individual bakery-café basis."
good,"As soon as I clock in to begin my night shift, there is already a line at the door. I have to count my drawer and ensure that there are $250 dollars in it and record my findings, whether it is under or over. Situations like this has trained me to hone my skills in expediency and excellent customer service simultaneously, My managers can concur that I'm quick on the register and reliable to serve every customer during rushes, On the other hand, matters are made more difficult when a customer approaches, as I'm taking an order, with a complaint. Also, to my left, there is another customer ready to receive her pastry item. What do i do? Prioritize. I finish taking the order, then hand the pastry to the customer on my left, since it takes less than 10 seconds. Lastly, i handle the upset customer. The division of labor takes place when i ask my co-worker to take orders while I assist every one else. "
good,"I've learned how to time manage with having so much to do in small amounts of time compared to the task at hand. This can be a stressful job, but you do get used to it as time goes on."
good,"Great training schedule and program, I have learned how Panera works."
good,A typical day at work consists of two different scenarios. One of these is getting the production line stocked and ready for the lunch rush and preparing food for customers. Other days I run the store and make sure that the employees are doing what needs to be done. I am a shift supervisor and the fact that there is always something that needs done is why I love my job the bad part of my job is that I work with a lot of people that are not willing to take responsibility for their actions. The hardest part is doing things by the book when higher managers are having you do things a different way.
good,"Very busy, very small pay, no opportunity to move up. Micro managing managers, who get paid the most while the employees that do the real work get paid nothing."
good,"This was my part time job my senior year. It was very fun, and exciting. Staff was very friendly and fun to work with. I typically was a cashier or made crispanis, they were flat bread pizzas that panera use to make. I learned how important it is in life to have a job and responsibility. Management was very fair and understanding, they worked with your personal schedule if need be. The hardest part about the job was probably rolling dough. hah it was pretty tough, at least for me. The most enjoyable part of the job, was probably being able to have fun at work and work with co-workers that were very friendly and helpful."
good,You never knew what you were going to walk in and see.  there wasn't a strong management team.  The customers that came in were amazing.
good,A typical work day consisted of fun with customers and lots of mismanagement. There was never a day that we had enough associates there to preform the duties necessary. The co workers were fun but not work oriented. The hardest part of the job was coming in everyday and having to see managers upset from the moment I walk in the door. The most enjoyable part was the lovely customers.
good,This company promises work/life balance but fails to deliver it. Retaining quality employees is difficult because associate pay is on the low side; support from headquarters in STL is lacking.
good,"I worked at Panera Bread immediately after I graduated from college. Since I had a degree in Food Service Management, I thought it was the best place to begin my career. Within 4 months of me working at Panera, I was promoted to Associate Trainer and asked to join the management team after I completed the proper training. Unfortunately my management aspirations never came to fruition because of internal management issues. The employees were not challenged by management to do their very best so the cafe suffered because of it. I love Panera because of all the guest interaction, as I am a people person but was one of a few employees who actually did their job. I am grateful to Panera for teaching me how to be more efficient, have a better sense of urgency, and for honing my interpersonal skills (with guests, fellow employees, and upper management)."
good,Panera is implementing a lot of change focusing on ease of use for the customer with advancement is web ordering and table service.
good,Wanted more hours but haven't had enough the last year. I work part-time there and need more hourly pay though.
good,"The day began with being prepared to serve customers as soon as I was at the cash register. A pleasant demeanor and an efficient style of work were what I offered daily. When a customer was rushed it was my responsibility to take care of his/her order quickly yet not be affected by his/her manner. Cleaning the coffee area, soda area, tables, floors and the restrooms was understood to be automatic. Keeping aware of this was essential for a clean store. I learned that this kind of work is exhausting in terms of standing for an entire shift but it is also challenging to handle busy and down times along with varying customer expectations. The management was only focused on how quickly a customer was served. As soon as a customer opened the door to entire the store we associates were expected to take the order and then have the food ready within five minutes. I volunteered to begin Cold Calls for the new Via Panera catering program when it began in 2005. I designed a plan to visit every professional office and store within a ten mile radius taking them free bagels and cream cheese. While there it was my goal to schedule a lunch meeting with those individuals who were responsible for meals at conferences, meetings or in-service programs. My co-workers, for the most part, were great to work with and understood what needed to be done each shift. The hardest part was the lack of respect that all workers received from the management of one of the two stores where I was assigned to work. I enjoyed marketing the most."
good,I liked working as  a server by being able to interact with customers.
good,Some days are very stressful. We created our own fun to make the day go by faster. Its a great place to start if you have never had a job but always be looking for something better. Raises are hardly ever given and if so its barely enough to survive. Hours are given to the favorites and the hardest workers. 
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"I enjoyed working at panera, but it wasnt worth the money for the amount that you had to put up with."
good,Panera Bread as a company is a very friendly place of employment. I have gain lots of experience dealing with the general public and also dealing with a wide range of attitudes and individuals as co-workers as well. There is no such thing as a typical day because each day brings its own set of situations and problems. I enjoy the fast paced environment which utilizes muti-tasking skills every second of the day.
good,Fast pace work environment with great co-workers to make the day go by faster.
good,"A typical day at work is taking customers orders and communicating with my co-workers. I learned to be more patient and how important communication with our customers and staff is. The management in my opinion is very well put together, except the general manager that basically yells and gets mad for no apparent reason, but all the other managers are great! The hardest part of the job would probably be dealing with hard customers, you know, you try as hard as you can to be nice when someone is yelling in your face and it's just really hard to keep you patience at that point. The most enjoyable part of the job is that I'm friends with all my co-workers and we manage to keep work fun without being unprofessional in front of the customers."
good,This is a good place to work if you want a part time job and you're a high school student or in college. Not a good place to want to move up in management. A lot of mis-communication between staff and management.
good,"A couple of good things about working at Panera was the discount and meeting some amazing people BUT as far as management goes, a lot of the managers slacked and made the associates practically run the store on the busiest hours of the day while the assistant managers decided to hide in the office and leave everyone else to slay the high volume hours during lunch and dinner. Worked there for a year and five months, and for being there for that long where I worked more for what I got paid, the plus side about raises was that every six months I'd get a raise, but the downfall was it was basically chump change. They'd give me a 20 cent raise, and while I would do what I needed to get done, they still werent satisfied and wanted me to learn new positions like salads and sandwiches, but when I did in fact want to take up positions like that, they wouldn't even give us that room for growth !"
good,Compensation/Benefits - I started at $8 when min. wage is $7.25 without any job experience. I was called five minutes after inputting my online information and had an 'interview' the next day where I was immediately hired. 30 min. before/after a shift or on break we get 70% off food but only 20% off duty.
good,"Panera Bread is a fast paced cafe'. To be a succesful employee, you must be able to multi-task, demonstrate great customer service, work well with others, finish orders in a timely manner, and be very accurate with every order thats processed. I have worked here for over 5 years, and I have seen many people come and go. Panera Bread has strict policies, and disobeying them will result in termination."
good,"Being a baker for third shift takes up your whole life. A lot of the times you work alone, the work load can be unbearable in cold months. Not enough pay or chances for advancement."
good,Panera Bread is a job. nothing more than that. The company does move you up but doesnt pay for the position. In This place you go to work and leave... that's all.
good,not very good management. was very stressful at times. But I enjoyed the customer's and serving them and I also enjoyed the company of my fellow co workers
good,"My experience with Panera Bread wasn't an enjoyable. The amount of pressure and amount of hourly pay are unbalanced to say the least. As far as managers go, there was about 8 so the saying ""too many chiefs, not enough Indians"" rang quite true. it isn't a horrible place to work for perhaps a first job, but as a second or third job, one may be disappointed."
good,"Delicious bread and pastries, healthy kids' menu, and their coffee ain't so bad either. They have free wi-fi. The only drawback: a bit pricey just for bread and sandwiches, even if they are yummy. Also, there tends to be a lot of people loafing around - literally."
good,A good place to work. If you are not interested in Fast Food then this is NOT the place for you.
good,Issues with the schedule and managers make it difficult to have hours be consistent. Improvements need to be made on training new employees. Good place for people that want part time employment with little responsibility.
good,"There is always something that needs to be done and i loved that, my co workers were great, they made my job more enjoyable. I love working at panera, but the hardest part was management. They were very unprofessional and talked to their employees very horribly. This job was said to be flexible, however they respond poorly when someone has to change their schedule due to life problems."
good,"I have worked for a few places but Panera took the cake for the worst. I left after a couple of months because management talks down to all employees that arent management and they use their employees. I still love the food, it was disappointing since I loved Panera before working there."
good,"I enjoyed learning how to bake. I strived for hard work everyday and was excited to learn more here but I did not like that my hard work was not appreciated or it was ""too much"" by the person training me. I had to travel 40 minutes for training and it was difficult to do that almost every night. I did like my upper management but there was too much drama for me that I could not focus on the task at hand. I did not like how scattered everything was, I like knowing what to expect and to be able to show how hard I can work without being criticized for my ability to multi-task and keep busy."
good,"From working at Panera, I have learned customer service skills, how to operate a cash register, and how to work with a variety of age groups. A  typical work day would be me coming in doing my job, talking with my coworkers, cleaning, and leaving. I did not find the work place very diverse. The hardest part of the day is the process of closing. It is a pretty long process. However, the most enjoyable part of the workday is creating memories with my coworkers."
good,Not a good life work balance . Varying schedule has made it difficult to plan life events and see my family. Great opportunities but not great raise incentives.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Working with the people there was manageable. We grew a close bond and I grew bonds with the customers that came there every other day. It was a easy job.
good,I didn’t like how most of the managers were males and their attitudes. managers had favoritism and they were bias. Management was terrible I do not recommend
good,Is it good first time job for somebody 16 to 21 years old. The management is very laid back and they need to get new managers at several locations it's a pretty fun place to work for young adults
good,The managers at 1380 Market Street(more specifically the general manager) is always itching to write someone up or yell regardless of whether the person was doing their job correctly or not
good,"Baking food and baking food and baking food, food. And then we baked food. Sometimes we would bake food and then bake more food, in the ovens. If the review process is going to be complicated, then people will decide to not do it at all. Just let me simply answer the question."
good,"-Some customers were very rude"
good,"3rd shift, it is what it is. Being a baker at Panera is VERY PHYSICAL. Keep in mind every single carbohydrate is baked nightly.  I make decent money, all bakers are not compensated the same. This job is %90 self managed. Lots of call outs all the time, so one baker is stuck with a 2 person  job, this happens alot. Huge lack of integrity amongst a good number of employees. Very hard to get a set schedule. Almost NO ROOM FOR ADVANCEMENT.  It takes some 8 years to go up one position. Depressing. The money at times is not even worth it."
good,night baking provided me with the experience of working independently to achieve a goal and also allowed me to maintain my employment after transferring states which was cool
good,"I worked there for almost four years and it wasn't terrible. Definitely worse jobs out there. The management was laid back but borderline too laid back. Felt like they didn't care much and there really isn't much opportunity to get raises. Even taking more responsibility, like becoming a trainer doesn't result in any kind of raise."
good,"Standard work you'd find at any restaurant; very hard work, expect to work an hour or 2 more than what your shift states. If you work the night shift, usually the manager will let you take a couple of the leftovers from the bakery."
good,"Panera is usually packed and the one I worked at was always understaffed so I would be working 2-3 different positions during one shift. There are 3-4 managers working daily which makes the work environment a bit uncomfortable and on edge. Management doesn't really care about the workers needs, and customers are generally rude."
good,I should note that this is specifically for the Houston Franchise.  Management here is never satisfied.  They twist numbers and are constanly on you about not meeting goals but somehow always meet their bonus.  The do little more everyday than find ways to cut corners but will always be the first people to blame you for an unsatisfactory product or issue they created but were unwilling to take credit for when they created but were unwilling to take the blame for.
good,"An unhealthy lack of sleep is guaranteed.as a manager, you may be schedule, a “close/open”.  Or any variety of grueling 10+hr shifts chain together to drain you, with no sympathy or thanks. For 5 years, the worst/ least amount of sleep I’ve ever gotten. And I’ve been a chef for 25 years."
good,"At times, this job would be difficult with all the rushes.  However, my coworkers made the job more enjoyable.  Lunch and Dinner rushes were the toughest part of the job considering it would get extremely busy.  Other than that I really enjoyed working there throughout the years and I am happy to have worked with all the people that worked there."
good,"Nice for kids in high school, college or even only wanting part time. Weekends are great to work and help is always needed during the week. Pay is decent, you’ll gain a lot of experience and meet a lot of cool people :)"
good,"It was nice in the beginning as I progress on, it's been really hard on me. They keep cutting people's hours. A friend of mine asked for more hours but in results they cut her hours. I'm barely making enough to pay my bills."
good,For a person with anxiety it is a very hard place to work.  They scheduling is weird. Definitely would not recommend for teenagers. If you are wanting to be a manager I would recommend.
good,"I enjoy working in a fast paced environment so this was fine with me. I was promoted to manager and I loved learning to lead a team and have other responsibilities, however it took me away from my home life and I found myself at work more than I was in my own bed sleeping."
good,The jobs adaptability with personal life vs. Work-life was exceptionally good. The managerial experience was lackluster and subpar I felt that the general manager lacked enough social conviction to confront and handle situations.
good,"Management needs to change, more flexibility with school and work needs to be available for students, we need our schedule on sundays for the work week starting Wednesday (we usually get it Tuesday)"
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Pretty basic job for students or those who are retired. They don’t pay much and often ask for much because they are understaffed a lot of the time....
good,"They want everyone to e-learn all the positions, yet there is no compensation for cross-training.  I worked there almost 2 years, was cross trained in each position for a $0.25 raise."
good,"Great hours poor pay , some of my co workers are easy to get with while others are unfriendly and the managers are great and know what they are doing and lead very well"
good,"At first, it was a really fun place to work at but as time went by, management became messy and could not keep associates under control. People started quitting and I was eventually the only person working on the line during closing shifts."
good,If your just starting out this is a great first job. Its better than working at a mcdonalds or burger king but still is nothing to stay in for too long unless you see promise in it.
good,The employees got along overall well and worked hard to make it work many that made it happen were over worked and under paid but that is corporate for you. No overtime even for those who wanted it and deserved it. I would work there again but I only worked part time
good,Too much on the employee. Manager doesn’t do anything. He doesn’t want to help when needed. Instead he doesn’t reply leaves you to figure it out on your own.
good,"This is a great job for young person starting in the workforce. But for myself, after 12 years it was time for me to move on to more lucrative endeavors. I do appreciate my experience at Panera, but it was just time to move on."
good,"The workplace was fine and met all of the food safety requirements, however it was hard to escape the chaotic nature of work. It may have just been the store or the management of the store that I worked at but it consistently felt like the store was understaffed and over-stressed. There was also inconsistency with how many hours a person would be given a week, which is a big part of the reason I had to leave."
good,"Fast paced environment with upper management and a lot of micromanaging going on."
good,"if you wanna work at a place with fast-slow paced work with decent co-workers, this is the place for you. However, the management, low wages, and no room for improvement in the workplace is what most people move on for. If you want to also fight for your hours against others without getting a chance to increase them this is also the place for you."
good,"My manager is incredible most of the time, but they are not cooperative with specific schedules, they don't care if you have other priorities, and they work everyone so hard that we all are in so much pain most of the time."
good,"This place was okay to work at. I never recieved the proper training, and was left by my self the first day working there. But otherwise it was a nice and fun place to work."
good,Nothin boss was very bad I been the for 5 years and they give my promotion to someone else less experience the hmm was horrible at job the hmm before him was awesome.
good,The people I work with are amazing and my best friends. Our general manager is basically an overgrown child who is so rude and disrespectful and makes people cry! Almost no opportunity for growth or raises even though they say that's what they're all about. Don't even get me started on the completely entitled and rude customers. The job itself is actually amazing as are the co-workers. The biggest issue is the GM and the customers.
good,"I liked working for Panera Bread but my pay was too low and too many managers in the beginning.  It was a new store and I opened with them which was both exciting and crazy.  Crazy because there were so many managers and corporate running around I felt like half the staff could go home which is exactly what happened to me one day, sent me home? Thanks"
good,They would never put you on the schedule if even though requested and then take back days you requested off and they approved it then scheduled you for it and wouldn’t believe you that you took the day off. Some of the managers were not good or nice.
good,"I worked at Panera for two years starting when I was sixteen. I loved the job at first because I met so many people my age and made some really good friends. It wasn't just about having fun though I put in a lot of work and hours and got slightly promoted to associate trainer. However, despite the ""promotions"" unless you are an assistant manager, or a general manager the pay is not enough to support yourself even at full time with expenses."
good,"A typical day at Panera bread is that in the mornings to lunch are busy. Have a line in the drive thru and in the cafe with also catering order being made. But after 3pm it starts to slow down, but around 7pm to 8 it picks up again for the dinner rush. But after that it slows down till closing."
good,"my experience at Panera Bread was okay. I enjoyed the work environment and the people I worked with, however, I wished for a more organized organization."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,The job is not bad. The people I worked with were cool and the managers were cool. However after school started this year a lot of people left and we now have new management . Panera now feels like a drama invested highschool . Everyone talks bad about others and speaks down to others.
good,"The night crew is meant to ""close to open"", meaning they have things set up for us in the morning. Not always done. it's hard to get assistance when you need it. People often are not working when they should be, just standing around."
good,"I like working here, but as with many companies, they over hire frequently. Several of my coworkers who are registered as full time get less than twenty hours a week."
good,The job itself is awesome especially if you like interacting with people. I love cooking so being the morning prep was great. The management wasn’t the best but i enjoyed the experience.
good,Working at Panera teaches you how to be flexible and expect any curveballs thrown at you. At times the environment felt great but there are bad days depending on what causes the issue.
good,"This is a good job as a stepping stone or as a way to make extra cash. Youll tend to be asked to do additional tasks that werent part of what you were hired to do. The people there are great, the managers are great people, but corporate doesnt know what their doing and it effects the chain of title all the way down"
good,The work can be hard but at least you get discounts on food and free fountain drinks. The work environment is also alright compared to most places I have worked at.
good,A typical day here includes times of high stress with intermittent times of complete deadness. The hardest part of this job is keeping your managers happy between the rushed closing procedures and lack of tasks during slow times.
good,When I first started the team and management were great! But at the Auburn store they changed managers and it was a down hill fall from there. It was brought to the store managers attention more than once that staff was worried and felt abused/hazed and harrassed. Yet all that was done was smooth talking an no results. I don't doubt other stores are epic. DO NOT WORK FOR THE AUBURN STORE
good,"I delivered food most of the time which I enjoyed a lot. this was the most enjoyable part of the job for me. the hardest part of the job was when no one was communicating with each other, that means that sometimes the orders were wrong or missing something"
good,"So I've been working here for a couple of months now and a typical work day would go as follows. Deliver orders, help run food to tables, and if really needed make smoothies/coffee. The job is overall very easy, but the problem I had was management. The first problem was when I first got hired they told me they would call me and tell me when to come in and work. I waited five days and still didn't receive any calls, so I went over there and they admitted that they forgot about me. I wasn't placed in the schedule so at the end of every work day for a week or so I had to ask the managers whens the next time I could work. The second problem I had with management was when they tried to put me in the schedule to work after I already put in time off for vacation (out of state). The final problem I had was when they tried to fire me because I was apparently a ""no call no show"". This happened as soon as I came off of vacation, apparently the next day after I got off vacation I had to work. I had no way of knowing that because you can only check the schedule in person and if you could check it online they never showed me how to. They said that they called me multiple times and texted me multiple times. Both are untrue and I even showed the managers this. The managers here are good people, but they are not good at communicating with their employees and keeping track with what days employees have taken off.  "
good,"If you just need hours then this job is for you. Its hard to get fired here, no call no show np there desperate to keep people because of the hours. Work life balance iw exceptionally hard but if you dont mind that then you'll make good money"
good,"Panera Bread is a fun place to work a lot of friendly people as well, my job to clean the dinning room, and to take care of all the costumers in and out."
good,"Good hours, a lot of cleaning, a good job to have while in HighSchool it is very flexible the pay isn’t the best but it’s manageable for a HighSchool student."
good,"The store I was at in Madison, WI off Old Sauk and Junction Rd, needs new management. I've wasted 2 years old my time there that I will never get back. I've watched good workers leave because of the BS."
good,"This location is a mess from a management standpoint, new general managers and regular management are gone through like socks, most general managers from other locations refuse to be transferred to this location because of the management problems. Managers continuously fail to finish schedules and other important paperwork on time."
good,Hardest of the job alot of physical work.  I learnt too work faster. My If someone doesn't show up early instead of deducting your pay you work longer hour too catchup
good,"Fast pace, many times you are lone person stocking ALL baked goods, and making several urns of coffee in just one hour prior to 6 am opening. That means 5 am start!"
good,Panera bread is a decent company to work for. I have have three raises in two years and I do fell appreciated in my work. Their management needs help and the amount of disrespect given to their employees in unfair. The work is hard and you are constantly being told to move faster. The contentions are clean and organized. The only reason I've stayed for as long as i have is because of the customers.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Delivery driver is tough. Traveling on route 22 is a pain already. Add in bed bath and beyond headquarters where half the orders every weekday go to. It’s so annoying. You can’t catch a break here.
good,Panera Bread is my first and only job so far. I had started working at Panera Bread at the age of 16 and it has taught me how to work in a fast past environment. A typical day for me would be preparing the food and making sure my station remained stocked and clean. It has taught me to be able to react quickly to change. The hardest part of the would be the work environment. As time went on the work moral just decreased. My coworkers attitudes have gotten less helpful and my managers have also not enforced the rules at all. My work load and skill set has increased yet my pay has stayed the same.
good,"Working at Panera was definitely an eye opener to say the least. I liked working there but the management was the biggest part in making sure everything ran smoothly, of course. We had a few amazing managers but due to personal reasons they had to relocate. After that, the cafe started to fall apart and really is the reason I am leaving. Overall though, the other associates I worked with were amazing. I made such great friends there and honestly, if the working environment was a little better, I would stay."
good,"Panera is decent to work for, they pay fairly well and most of the managers there are good at their jobs. There is a major lack of communication there that has bred some drama/complications from time to time."
good,I dont like panera. that is why i quit. worst manegment ever. otherwise it was an ok job. unfair pay. the best part of the job was making smoothies. end
good,"Nice environment with pristine standards, but a very stressful place to work. While working here, my schedule was unfortunately mismanaged at times, but managers were very kind, helpful and understanding."
good,"Working at Panera Bread was okay, it is just that they never scheduled me enough. Some of the managers treat people differently or just have an attitude that they don't want to be there anymore."
good,"I worked at Panera for about a year and a half and in that time I learned that many people who had asked for raises never got them (one guy had been making 8.75 for over 3 years), this location is particularly stressful due to a mall being directly across the street and it was not uncommon to have a line to the door for a couple of hours. The training here was pretty good as it is not a mentally demanding job in terms of how to assemble things and whatnot, though the cashier system can be a little confusing if you've never used one before. The employees were mostly all friendly and willing to help, though a lot of them are younger and tend to slack a bit even when there's stuff to do. Management was either really good or horrible."
good,"The environment exhumes hospitality and warmth. Among the diversity within the stores, relationships are easy to build with fellow associates and customers of all demographics."
good,They drag their heels when it comes to learning a new position. So don’t hold your breath. They hire new people without letting their current employees a chance to move into the position.
good,New company bringing stress to employees - greediness overlooks care for its hardworking employees. Numerous people greatly under compensated for as much as they are relied on. Get paid to do your job AND someone else's. Looking for something better.
good,I enjoyed working at Panera mostly because of the coworkers I worked with. The customers were always somewhat entitled and the management lacked sometimes when it came to how they treated their staff and the hours. Lots of people called off requiring others to come in and work on their days off or stay later than their original shift.
good,"The delivery driver position was fun, got to be in and out of the store most of the day."
good,"I made a lot of friends while working there. It was very stressful, especially at lunch time. Dinning area would be probably one of the more stressful jobs just because you have to clean around the workplace in the kitchen and dinning area and pick up after customers a lot & sometimes you’re the only one working that shift."
good,"I rarely have time to do personal things. You even work outside for free if you are scheduling manager, hiring manager, or even in charge of food cost"
good,Very fast paced. They basically throw you into driving regardless if you know the area or not. They constantly mess up orders causing you to drive to the same places multiple times and causing people to never use the service again. Sandwich makers also put the delivery bags in the wrong places so you have to go searching for them before they end up late
good,I think that Panera has the potential to be a good job especially for younger people just starting off in the workforce. I just believe that with the wrong management you can find working here very stressful and you won't feel as if anything you're working towards is worth it.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"it can be stressful but it teaches valuable skills such as time management, how to deal with stress, and incredibly useful skills revolving around customer service and other job skills"
good,"I liked the actual work itself, also some days were busier and therefore harder than others. My coworkers and I worked closely together and I made great friends!"
good,"A typical day involved panning up daily breads and baking half of them. The night baker would bake the rest. Panning up the cookies and pastries for the night baker. Mixing and panning the scones for the night baker. Cleaning duties were listed as daily and weekly. Daily was keeping the work area clean and restock. (ie: sweep, mop, wipe containers clean of debris) Weekly cleaning entailed de-greasing the rack oven and deck oven vents/hoods"
good,Was a great place to work with a lot of advancement opportunities. I have been there for almost 7 years and I have worked my way up in the company. I am just looking for something new o expand my skills.
good,Doublestandard always pressuring for more everyone will step on ur head to get to  the top dey also have all benefits wen u do become full time and if ur good u will get hours
good,Panera is a good place to work if you are looking for a first job.  You are able to receive customer service experience as well as food service experience.
good,"This job was great for building strong customer service, communication and team building skills. High physical demand to work long hours standing on hard tile in a fast paced environment where speed and service must coincide. Great place to build a strong work ethic."
good,"Employees come and go often and therefore being understaffed is very common. A very relaxed environment, but colleagues are a joy to be around. Management needs improvement with the district manager belittling all and being highly inappropriate."
good,"Customer service, cashier friendly environment also was a Floater specialist prep all products, asst on Training other's this was a Awesome Job would Go Back.."
good,First job where i stuck it out. The politics of it i was not for. The district manager was super racistt but what made it go by was having great co workers and my team was great but know that if youre not Caucasian you probably wont make it too far in the NYC market because of the DM. prior to her things were pretty great and there was a lot of growth opportunities from within.
good,I have learned a lot from dealing with difficult customers to learning about my own strength. my favorite part was the discounts on the meal but that is only when you work on the clock.
good,"I work at the Panera Bread in Long island city Queens. I like my coworkers but I hate the general manager. She is very bipolar and the worst part is, after she has a fit, she pretends nothing happened! I have been denied the right to use the bathroom by this woman. Will definitely  contact human resources when I quit.If you live in New York, definitely try other locations."
good,"Over all the store was a disaster. Management did not treat you or acknowledge your hard work. "
good,"Just work a lot, the work culture is very organize and preppy. Everything about it is clean and just so energetic. The food is fresh but the manager sucks. Kept messing up my schedule up."
good,"When I first started working I thought the job was good for my second job, but after a while it became terrible. The fact that there were 4 different managers who weren't on the same page made the job very difficult."
good,"It was a nice environment, but they need to do better about hiring management. Working there was a fun environment, however the management always seemed sort of uninformed about particular issues. I hope its changes since."
good,"In general, it’s a good first job. However, for a first job, you get minimum wage, and you can’t easily go up the latter, plus they cut your hours a lot."
good,"it was okay. the culture of the job was cool but the management sucked. worked there for 4 years and was overlooked to become a shift manager. when they finally did ask, i was already over the whole company. wanted to leave badly."
good,"I learned to get more efficient with the dishes. Also, I learned to work with people. The hardest part was closing shifts late at night. I learned that working in a restaurant involves dealing with many people."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,I was an overnight baker and it sucked because management was just that a manager never a baker so they didn’t really know anything about baking just only knew what the book said. Didn’t pay enough for the overnight hours and if you wanted to get out on time you didn’t have a break or lunch
good,"A good place for a student to work or for a seasonal place. I would recommend to a person trying to move up in their career. No room for growth, bonus system is flawed."
good,The staff is friendly and inviting.  Jobs are laid out daily so there is no confusion for what the day will hold.  Willing to work with a school schedule and any emergencies that occur in personal life.
good,"only bad thing is that i continuously working whilst on break, since im the baker i have to always keep an eye on the ovens, having shifts decreased and increased is always tough when you have bills/rent to pay, but working with an amazing team is the best part of the job, the bonds you make with the co-workers makes it worth it. the hardest part of the job is making sure you don't mess up a single thing."
good,"I made 8 dollars and hour and would work my butt off for over 20 hours a week (while in high school). They would always throw only me on dining and was expected to close dining all by myself (while the much smaller areas had way more people to close). People doing easier jobs got paid more than me. Hours were too much for someone trying to have a part-time job in high school. Cool management for the most part (had one manager who would sometimes get very angry but everything was cool for the most pat). If I was feeling sick they would let me go, and if I needed a schedule change I could always switch with a coworker. "
good,I really like what this company has to offer. In the restaurant field weekends off are unheard of.. except here. They give managers one weekend off a month! Also managers get one 3 day weekend a quarter (which is like getting 3 extra vacation days per year). The hours are flexible and you can still have time with your family (especially if you open). Systems have been recently updated to make administrative tasks easier. With that said there are about 10 different websites which are all used for different things. It is confusing for managers and associates at times to know which website should be used for what purpose. There is very poor communication between upper level management and operations managers. Managers are usually scheduled 9.5 hour shifts 5 days a week. The expectation is 47.5 hours weekly.
good,"I have worked for Panera for 2 years, and had to fight for a raise. Every person is extremely expendable and you are not treated well by upper management. Workplace can seem very chaotic due to high turnover rates. Despite the poor upper management, co-workers are very friendly and inviting."
good,"Its productive work , a very easy job, and it can be stressful at times because you have workers that work together and some that dont. Other than that its ok."
good,Not enough hours or pay provided for how much they expect of employees. Was expected to perform tasks and training that was well above my level of compensation.
good,"The job was okay,  pretty quick,  but I always felt so stressed out because one thing I did wrong,  I would be getting yelled at and put down by my manager."
good,My experience at Panera Bread was determined by the management team at this specific branch. The hours were unfair and unorganized. Sometimes I wasn't schedules for weeks without reasonable rationale.
good,"A typical day at Panera can range from extremely slow and desolate to extremely fast and hectic. At least one terrible mistake is made and at least one customer will make the day worth it. Though while working there, I've learned that management isn't always as in control as you would expect. I've learned that even if you get along with all of your co-workers, you'll still hate some. And even though you're all working together, it doesn't mean that everyone works, together. And one last thing that I learned was that it doesn't matter how well or how bad someone is at their job, they might not show up for anymore shifts, all of a sudden. But all this doesn't mean that everyone I worked with at Panera sucks. Quite the contrary! Most of my co-workers are a lot of fun to work with, and I hope we remain friends in the years to come. While I would say that the experiences I am able to have with the people there (whether they be a regular customer coming in for their daily coffee, or having a conversation with a co-worker about the latest installment of the Pokemon game series) make for the most enjoyable part of the job, I would have to say that it also makes for the hardest part of the job. Dealing with the constant in-fighting, gossiping and just general incompetence of some co-workers (and even ex-associates) is maddening. Though some customers do not make easy, either. From ordering a simple food service employee to practically break their back (and risk their job and livelihood's security) to complete an inane task or tasks, then becoming furious when said task or tasks cannot"
good,"We never got breaks here unless you begged for one. "
good,The Panera I worked at wasn’t bad at all but the new management that had been placed was honestly bad. The managers gossiped and there was favoritism.
good,"Atypical day at work is that I make the coffees every hour,make fresh tea around 3 pm, keep tables clean, and the bins with the dirty dishes to the back to be washed."
good,"As a whole it's a job, nothing more nothing less. The culture is entirely dependent on the employees. As a cashier my interaction with customers was always the majority of the day, followed by cleaning and baking."
good,"The management is awful. What the company stands for, is great. But nobody really ""cares"" about you or how hard you work even though they push you because they hire ""within"""
good,"Panera Bread had a nice environment, everybody had a professional attitude. Everybody that work there did what they were told. I’m responsible and respectful to my team members."
good,"For me, Panera was to make some money while in High School, and if it was not for that fact, I would likely have never worked there. What this job illustrates in my life is more my work ethic to work afternoons and nights in addition to my hours in school. Other than that, I have nothing to say about this job."
good,"As an overnight baker, it was difficult to find the people suited for that job.  It took a special kind of person to be able to do the high level of quality and workmanship necessary at such a late hour.  It was observed that finding the right mindset at that level of pay was difficult."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,the company itself wasnt bad but this particular location was not managed very well. the managers allowed certain employees to come in later or not show up at all which led to a terrible call out culture and no one taking responsibilities for their actions.
good,"While working at Panera Bread as my first job I was able to have many learning opportunities. In this respect, I often worked alongside a team and dealt with customers regularly to reach their needs. However, almost all the managers had made inappropriate comments for the workplace about the workers and did not respect their staff; also, there are very few opportunities to improve your position as a worker at Panera Bread."
good,it was an okay job but the pay is VERY low for the amount of work you have to do. One major benefit is that you learn about multiply positions which grows your work experience.
good,"I was employed here at age 16 and was offered great flexibility in my schedule to balance school and work at that age. The working environment for me at this particular location at the time was less than favorable though, as I was surrounded by college students that did not seem to appreciate my presence or have any interest in helping me or making anything easier on me. "
good,Management lacks communication and will fire the new guy because the can't communicate things properly. Management should not let personal issues affect their work life and let it cause them to tell new employees the wrong thing. Then let the new employees go when they are confused from managements lack of communication skills.
good,Easy job but boss made it extremely stressful.  Always short staffed both management and employees.  As managers I feel we did too much with no compensation.  Building relationships with employees was my favorite part working there
good,"Typical day at work:"
good,"Good part-time  and  little of a full time job stated as an associate raised to manager,  stressful callouts and no hours so alot of the employees did 2 to 3 driffrent jobs not enough benefits out of the company to be consider a carrer or full time job great pay if u hustle and take shifts."
good,It was a nice little part time job to have. No as demanding as others. Half of the management was at least decent. Nothing too bad to say about the work plane.
good,"Every day is mostly the same, as you set up your time line the best way you see fit. The most important skill I learned is multi-tasking, and staggering your bakes so that there aren't multiple things requiring your immediate attention. Local management does what it can, but regional and higher are completely unrealistic in their expectations. Come in earlier to get everything done by x time, stay later to clean, but use less hours so labor cost is down."
good,Panera is a very fast paced environment that can be very high stress. I learned a lot about food safety and managerial duties when I was promoted from with in. But a lot was self taught because the training plan was not always followed.
good,It was a very taxing job. The management was catty and it was so busy. There were a lot of unsavory people. But I liked for the most part the people I worked with.
good,"More and more responsibilities and stagnant wages. Difficult at first, becomes easier with time. Every 3 to 4 months corporate will add new product or change procedure causing difficulties completing tasks."
good,"Our managers, while somewhat understanding of mental health issues, were often rude and belittling. However, my coworkers were a big part of the reason I stayed for so long. Our work days were hectic and stressful, but seeing customers happy made it so worth it."
good,"Panera does not follow all 12 steps of baking, only the last 5. Bread is not made from scratch, it is shipped in every day frozen. Every cafe is different. Some have a fair amount of working space, other's do not."
good,It was a good place to work except for the late hours on school nights. The staff were friendly and helpful. The customers were polite and friendly and discounts on food was great.
good,"Having worked at multiple locations at various stages of my professional growth I can say the best word for this company is inconsistent, high turn over for both staff and managers. There was very little internal promotion and the employee manager rift was tenuous at times and tho the company has good values the job atmosphere was difficult."
good,"Work is fun and fast-paced, lots nice people to interact with. Management is very nice too, understanding but strict when needed. Overall, I enjoyed my time with Panera."
good,"I learned a lot about having a job at Panera, but I didn't see much of a future for me there. Unless you click with the managers, you more likely to have a job after this one. "
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"i have worked at a couple of panera bread locations, most have terrible management. if you can get passed that then the actual work experience is fine."
good,"I come in and for the next 5 hours I clean, take orders, make food, prep, hand out the food, cash and close. Sometimes you are placed into a different position you scheduled for. Sometimes gotta run to the front of the house and use the register to cash out due to an on and off issue in drive thru. Poorly managed and handled. Fellow employees aren't reliable and are rude to the customers. Hardest part is knowing the lack of team work or urgency. Most enjoyable is closing and cleaning as it only takes one person."
good,Panera Bread has a quick pace environment but as an employee you learn to work at the speed that is needed to succeed. There are many learning opportunites at Panera but not many finacial benifites included.
good,"It was an ok place to work at, it was really easy work and there wasn't ever a need to ""look busy"" there so that was relieving. The only issue I had was with the management, but I wasn't the best associate so I get it."
good,"Fast paced, great people to work with easy to get a long with."
good,I honestly dont like working there. there are way too many teens that are careless about the food. kids  hate to clean. so i have to make up for what they dont do. panera sucks to be completely honest
good,"The only thing I enjoyed about working for this company were the friendships I built and the ability to stay up late nights painting, that's about it."
good,"A typical day is very long and fast paced. The volume and prep time of some of the product is very demanding and if not done properly TIME IS NOT your friend and you could find yourself quickly behind. They have a hard time keeping people yet I find myself a loyal employee for 7yrs and yet I still feel like I'm at the bottom of the chain, What I do applaud is that the management team does a good job of creating a positive work environment."
good,"Everything runs more smoothly if all employees put in the same amount of effort. Instead of playing around when the store slows down, it is better to prepare for your next rush or to clean your area properly so as not to force one worker to do it all."
good,"This was a very standard retail/customer service job. Managers could be fickle and often desire to mess with certain employees by screwing with scheduling or cutting you entirely (both happened to me numerous times). When I was a student, I requested a schedule shift for the start of a new semester; my manager replied by scheduling me full time with mixed opening shifts (5am) and closing shifts (10pm). On one occasion, I was so sick with mono I could barely speak and had no immune system, so I had numerous other viruses, and when I called in sick, I was ""written up"", meaning they cut my hours the following week. After a while, I simply began avoiding contact with the store manager because every time we spoke, it seemed to result in me either losing money (having my hours cut) or being written up (via switching the schedule the day before a shift and not telling me). I loved my coworkers, but the job was often a pain."
good,Job was not a terrible place to work but there was poor management at the location when i was working there. Also favoritism was shown to certain employees.
good,"Management is bad, the co workers are lazy, too many people mixed business and personal there, the men doesn’t do nothing but will watch you take out the trash lift heavy dishes they’ll move out your way instead of helping."
good,Working at Panera is okay. The management and hours can be bad. The co-workers are usually great though. Expect hours cut at random points. Pay is ok.
good,"Count my cash drawer to make sure it's at $200, learned how to deal with rude and difficult customers, management can use a little more organization and work on communication skills. Workplace culture is quickly paced and kind of uptight, but has it's good days. Hardest part of the job is fixing mistakes and most enjoyable part is greeting and holding quick conversation with loyal, everyday customers."
good,"workplace culture can be difficult and complicated, based on what location you work at and who you're working with.  A lot of drama can occur, but despite that, it is a pretty stable and flexible position despite hour cuts and low pay."
good,At first my experience with Panera Bread was really nice until years later when I realized being a manager there is way more trouble than it's worth since I know cooks in other restaurants that were making more money than me!!!
good,"The job overall was okay. It was fast paced, time went by fast. The management was not very good, and was changed many times when I was there and continued until after. It was stressful as a high school senior. I was constantly covering shifts, because of being called in by managers. That was my fault, I did want the extra hours. Managers said they would help you, but most the time wouldn’t. I did have a few good managers (as people), but they did not always do what their job entailed. It was just poor management. Why was I being scheduled to work while I was at school? Why did I end up working 12 hours because someone didn’t show up, nobody was scheduled, or a coworker walked out that day. I do not regret working at Panera, but it was not my best job experience."
good,They need to work on managers and their relationships with the associates. As well as how they treat employees and their use of favoritism. Other than that they company is great
good,"The Managers were pretty nice, same with the employees.  Most managers weren't too strict, but the company pays horribly and is very selfish with benefits."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"many people are in and out of the place, which makes for an interesting and diverse workplace. management has improved greatly over the years and the ownership very much cares for the store."
good,I really like panera only for the employees. The management is okay and the work isn’t that bad. But the hours and scheduling is bad. Would not recommend
good,It was 9 hours of apologizing to everyone for everything. One has to balance management tasks with managing the store. And no matter what you do it has to be done the right way or you will definitely  hear about it.
good,If you have a family I wouldn't recommend this place unless you're looking to be a regular employee or applying for a position outside/above store level.
good,My time at Panera was overall good. The main thing that I didn't like was the lack of professionalism the managers had. What I liked was intercacting with guest.
good,"I enjoy working at Panera Bread as a delivery driver, but I would like to move on to a job with a consistent schedule. Management at the Owasso location has quickly gone down in quality and it has made the atmosphere stressful. I do enjoy driving and receiving tips."
good,"This was my first job and it did a good job of preparing me for future workplace environments and the ever changing faces of people you will meet. I made some good friends while working here. You learn quickly that fast food is not that great quality of food, even here. Everything was prepackaged. Even the dough comes frozen in a box. Employee burnout and turnover was high. Management seemed to change every six to nine months. Some company policies and rules seemed to make no sense in a real situation. Some customers, especially here, could be very uppity and talk down to employees."
good,"Started as just a job for extra cash while in college. Made a lot of new friends. If you are trying to move up however, don't bother. Refuse to give raises, minors were hired in at a higher salary than employees who had worked there for years. Was promised a shift position twice and they gave it to inexperienced newer employees twice. Tried talked to the district manager about it and he cut me off. Tried blaming it on me saying I didn't talk to the GM even though I did multiple times."
good,"This is company tries to live up to the dine-in restaurant culture, with fast food speed of service. They highly believe in the idea of micromanaging."
good,Fast pace and great team work environment. Great customers to enjoy helping everyday.  Always a new experience of learning everyday.  Always working multiple positions to have a busy fun day.
good,"There is not too much training in the beginning, you are thrown out to learn on your own. Other employees were nice and helpful- more so than the managers."
good,job was quite stressful in terms of time management and the way employees were treated. could use much improvement in the way things were run within the company.
good,Being a cashier at Panera allowed me to learn new things at a fast paced  especially it being a high volume of customer service is important. The hardest part at my job was not being able to breath customers constantly coming at you saying there's something wrong with their order.  But it also taught me that you can't please everyone you will just have to do you very best and accept it.
good,The job itself was very stimulating and even fun at times. My biggest problem was the fact of my hours and how my managers who make the schedule are not understanding of my other priorities.
good,St. Louis Bread Company is a great place to work! The only reason I left was due to workplace disruption. Great culture of hospitality. I think that this is a great first job.
good,Working in the Franchise Office was unorganized and unprofessional. The other team members are rude and inconsiderate of others. I would not recommend that a positive person work here because it ruins your attitude.
good,panera bread brought in a lot of exciting people that were ready to try new foods every day. free wifi came with the store so people were able to use the internet to do their homework or stay busy while they wait for their food.
good,"There's never a free moment at panera, If you work here you will always be busy, either because of a line out the door or because of the many cleaning and restocking tasks there are.  "
good,"I begin my day by making sure the staff is functioning properly, if not, you must resolve the issues, The next priority would be to communicate with the manager of the previous shift in order to access and prevent any up coming problems, In closing the manager examines the situation of the cafe and ensures that staff has properly performed the job.  In addition the manager has to prove out the cafe"
good,"Good and fun coworkers , most customers not so happy , good for a first job , easy job not to much responsibility. As a cashier all you're really doing is taking orders , sometimes serving food , sometimes being a barista . Working at panera is like working as a team or being a family. Always had group meetings for new food items or changes in the store"
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"A flexible job that allows me to continue my education. Mostly dedicated management, who are willing to work with availability issues. Training is mostly on the job, which can compromise quality of service for the customers."
good,"Managers always in office. Customers are rude, management as wrll. They will find a way to get rid of you if you have been there a long time. This place got all of most employees barely spoke to each other, management really don't train new employees the right way. They could do better."
good,"Working at this job can be decent at times but it can take a very drastic turn depending on the time of day and the location where you work. The managers can really make your day great or really bad, depending on their mood/what is occurring during the shift. If you get this job, good luck."
good,There’s no good management there the only thing people would like is the employee good attitude other than that that location is chaos they make it look like they have everything together managers come in sick and make food sneeze and cough everywhere it’s just unprofessional!!!
good,The job was okay i got a lot of hours because it wasn’t a lot of staff. They was funny acting with dress code. I worked register and the people very ignorant sometimes gotta have patience with this job.
good,"The environment was filled with good energy that gave our customers a feeling of peace and comfort when dining in - knowing they are also filling their bodies with non preservatives, organic friendly only ingredients."
good,come in get straight to work. always with a smile on your face and always busy. co workers where fun but the management can be hard. and sometimes don't get recognized for the hard work you do.
good,"You don't get paid very much, and the environment is fast-paced. You are always busy. Even when I worked efficiently, I would have to stay late to close."
good,This is a good job to work if you just need an immediate job that gives you a lot of hours. But unfortunately they do only pay minimum wage when you are starting out.
good,"Long days, bad area managers and upper management.  Bad communication from upper management and impossible expectations.  Too many changes for the average employee, so they don't stay around long."
good,"The weekends are very bust days for Panera Bread, but durig the week it slows down. Customers always come in and love the food. Even though its my job to make the customers satisfied, it can get frustrating at times makig sure all the customers get what they want. But for the employees I work with make it fun,"
good,A normal shift was usually understaffed which was only chaotic when we reached peak times. Throughout my experience I gained great skills to carry throughout future jobs.
good,Working as a cashier and handling customers baked goods. Cleaning around the bakery and being a Barista when orders are made. Some of manaement just stands around and gossips while others take their position very seriously. There really wouldn't be a hardest part of the job and the most enjoyable is getting to make the drinks.
good,Great work place if we were fully staffed. Learn a lot of different strategies to help in the future. Developed useful skills that I could use for future jobs.
good,"The company itself was overall an excellent group to work for. However, the general management in Auburn was awful. The majority of assistant managers were decent at their worst, but the general manager was a nightmare to work for. I wouldn't recommend anyone working at this specific place. There's no method to the way people are deployed, it's normally very short staffed, and the general manager does way too much delegating-- even when it's time for her to step in. I understand delegation comes with the title, but there's a time and a place, and she never seemed to get that right. She micromanaged in all the wrong ways without ever properly managing. It's one of those jobs that's made extremely more difficult/stressful than it need be."
good,Panera very a very fun place to work. The key to success is good shift preparation. Management was very good at cross-training employees which made the shifts run much more smoothly.
good,"A typical work day at Panera Bread includes preparing food, cashiering, and maintaining the dining room area for customers. Working here has allowed for me to better understand that a customer's wants and needs are crucial to both company sales and their satisfaction."
good,"Management frequently changes, severe disconnect between regional and national expectations and local limitations, co-workers can be cliquey and catty but overall not bad. training is thorough and frequent. Excellent at conveying food safety standards and regulation."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"-stressful during busy peak hours"
good,"Disliked working with food"
good,"New person placed in management position, but does not have the experience for this position. Lack of communication. Important information is never passed on to staff people that need to know. You find out the changes by other employees not by the ones in charge. Favoritism with certain staff that is not doing their job."
good,The people there who come in and whom also work there .. make the experience at working at Panera wonderful. I love my customers there but Panera have it’s pros and cons.
good,"I currently work at a Panera Bread in the Bay Area. I am a line cook, as well as dining. I struggled with the management in my first few months because I saw the younger managers as being lazy and rude. As I worked there more and more, I started to feel more adjusted as to how things worked there. Young managers are very lazy there and expect you to do most, if not all the work while they sit and play on their phones. I love the other associates that I work with though. Although when it comes to closing shifts, no one except myself were in the slightest bit helpful. We’re supposed to close as a team and once someone was done with their task, they would leave without asking if you needed any help. That part is frustrating and as an overall experience I wouldn’t recommend this job to a friend. But that’s a personal opinion. You’d have to work there to see for yourself because I’ve had co workers say they highly recommend it to others."
good,"My opinion is a little biased because I was stuck between a rock and a hard place while I was working there, but I'm sure if I wasn't then it would have been ok."
good,"Good job to work for when you're young, the whole overnight baking experience was fun but hard on your body. I wouldnt recommend this job to everybody."
good,"Panera Bread was a fun job for the first couple of months, and when you get into the routine, it was relatively easy. The co-workers were very helpful, and usually would help me out or give me some pointers. You couldn't request days off unless it was around 30 days (or more) ahead of time, so I rarely ever got days off."
good,"This was the best job, at first, for when still attending school. It gave me an open mind to what a workplace can feel like, and more so what it shouldn't feel like. Regardless, due to their openness about scheduling, my personal schedule was usually taken care of."
good,Panera is a good job for kids to get the idea of what it is like to work in the world. It provides a fair amount of stress but at the same time it treats you like family.
good,"While Panera speaks volumes about clean food and taking care of guests they could improve how they take care of the people who work for them.  "
good,"I have worked at Panera for over 3 years now it was my first job. I was promoted to manager and was a manager for about 6 months when I had a sudden move. I did not work at Panera for about 8 months then found myself in Greeley working there again. I love Panera but they did not make me feel like my hard work was noticed and when it came time to move back up to be manager again they did not let me move up. Panera has grown me as a person but I am ready for something new, something I can apply to my future and I just want to enjoy my everyday work life."
good,Working at Panera was very enjoyable. I learned a lot about customer service and providing quick and accurate service to customers. If you ask for the hours and do the work you'll get them.
good,work nonstop 8 hours no break.Not enough pay.the work is hard.very heavy pans hot pans get burnedoven in the freezer push around screechy transporters
good,"There is little room for advancement unless you are handpicked at the beginning. Management only sees you as a puppet, not a person. I have experienced management make people stay when they are sick, even after they throw up."
good,"I personally felt like they do not offer enough for the work expected from you, for this job. minimum wage was what i was told that everyone received which was not at all true, and this was my second time working at Panera- i quit then later came back because i wanted to have that time of experience, longer. When i got rehired I found out that kids younger and with less experience than me were getting paid more than me- while their availability were much smaller, and they showed less work ethic. I've heard there have been some changes with management since i left, hopefully there isn't as much favoritism and business mixed with pleasure"
good,"I would clock in then check coffee, bakery, and bread shelf. Work at the cash register and lend a helping hand at dining if needed. Most hard part of job is management. The most enjoyable part is gaining hands-on experience and great coworkers."
good,"this shet was goofy, i did nothing at work, i learnd that panera is a waste of my time, management sucks everywhere, i dont care for culture, hardest part was waking up to do another horrible shift everyday, and nothing was good except stealing the food"
good,"During the time I was working there, the management didn't care about the employees. She wouldn't approve days off even given 3 months in advance for medical reasons. If you weren't a ""favorite"" you were treated differently."
good,"I never knew what cafe I was going to work at sometimes when clocking in I would get a call to go to another store. I did enjoy that though and added change and variety to the schedule. The typical day I showed up got the ingredients that were needed set up. I would then proof the product if needed, bake all the products, clean the baking area of the store. Before I left would often help assemble the display wall of products."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Panera Bread offers tangibility in your work scheduled, the ability to easily request days off as well as view paystubs, and hours worked all with their Workday app. However, if you desire many scheduled hours that usually wont happen. But that does depend location to location. There are 5  positions at Panera that do not include management positions, Baker, Line Cook, Lobby, Cashier and Dishwasher. These positions requirements, and duties range and you can be cross-trained in some if not all that are listed. Overall, this position is great for high school students, full time college students or those who just want a second job."
good,"fast paced, very busy, always on your feet. learned to work closely with public, high turnover rate of employees and managers. food prepared fresh daily. you meet lots of nice people."
good,"There are pros and cons with this company."
good,"Working in this place kind of puts me off the food. The producers used to handle food and dishes isn't completely clean. Although the store is under new management not everyone is treated fairly. Some are allowed to sit around and do nothing, while other would be chastised the moment they thought about standing around. The hours are not bad, but they aren't good either. I was lucky to get a lot of hours but for new people they would be forgotten about for months until they quit. I would not recommend anyone to work here. Luckily they placed a new closing procedure that is more helpful, unless the MIC (manager in charge) doesn't care. All in all, this job works you more than it's willing to pay you."
good,"A typical day at Panera Bread would be a fast paced work place with great employees to work with. I learned everything the store had to offer, the training is accurate. Management wasn't great a lot of manager changes. The workplace culture is exciting especially with the customers that value what Panera Bread has to offer. The hardest part of the job is when staff is short handed. The most enjoyable part of the job is when there's a full staff and everything runs smoothly."
good,"The franchisee that owns the Panera's in Columbia does not truly value it's employees or customers, and is far more invested in the bottom line, instead."
good,"A typical day includes temp checking soups, dates on stored ingredients as well as preparation and serving of foods. "
good,"panera employees definitely operate as a team, but the stress in the environment and the direction the higher ups are taking the business, the employees are expected to do more and more and be paid basically the same. the pace is usually very fast for about an hour or two straight at a time, which makes room for a lot of mistakes. the pace only increases every year is they are always testing new things. The hours vary but its definitely a better part time than a full time. standing the majority of the shift of course and little to no advancement is available. the management are usually drama queens but then so are the employees, but theres a decent mix of young people and older people. but the direction the company is headed, the menu is constantly changing each season but in my opinion the treatment is fairly decent and hours are pretty flexible and based on what you actually choose"
good,"I really enjoyed working at Panera. The hours were workable, the staff was incredibly friendly and the work was usually simple or evenly paced. Some jobs are more difficult than others. keep in mind that there will be days when the work load is harsh. "
good,"Panera Bread is a nice place to work if you are going to school or just like working, they do have a lot of operatunities to move up but they are more likely to hire someone from outside then promote from within."
good,"A typical day would be, wake up at 5:30AM and be at the restaurant for 6:30AM and begin setting everything up for the day ahead."
good,"While I always found the associates I worked with at Panera Bread very colorful and inviting, the management at a majority of the stores was very lacking."
good,"The employees were forced to move from the freeze area to the oven area, the same employee had to take products from the freezer area and put in the oven area, moving the employees from 20 degrees to 80 degrees simultaneously several times during the day. This was unhealthy for the employees. "
good,"If you are a kid in high school, it's a good first job because they teach you good work ethics and team building. The longer you work there the worse it gets because you find yourself doing a lot of work for a very low pay, for instance I am a Shift Manager there and I only make $8.55 an hour. No benefits..and I have been working there for 2 years... I have been a shift for 8 months and I am just getting my shift manager raise..."
good,Panera is a good place to start working. It allows you to learn new skills. You often work in different areas with different types of people. You also receive experience with money transactions.
good,"First job upon moving to California, moved here from Chicago a year ago. Starting out was stressful. I was trained on registers and I was left there after 3 weeks. Customer service is my strong suit. I enjoy interacting with people so they kept me as a cashier. I truly enjoyed all my regulars. I ended up teaching myself other stations like Food Production and Dining room. Management was difficult and wasn't consistent. Enjoyed my coworkers, made working at Panera Bread a lot smoother."
good,"panera bread incorporated is a fast paced work environment that encourages promotion from within as opposed to hiring from outside sources. punctuality is highly valued, as is reliability"
good,Fast paced job. Good training program. Communication is lacking though. The hours can be rough on family and social life. Gap between managers and bakers.
good,"The people that work for you are just as important as the customers that you have,  Treat your people justly and you wouldn't have a high turnover like this company has."
good,"Management had some issues. "
good,A typical day at work was setting up the line and preparing food for the guest. The management had very poor management skills. I learned how to work better under pressure dealing with the morning or afternoon rushes.
good,I love the comfort and I love the hospitality of the costumers. I love the feeling you get when working at panera. I could have a bad day before getting to work. As soon as I walk through panera doors and I see customers smiling it brighten my day
good,"The liking of you job is all determined by the amount of staff they have."
good,"Is good place as a first job, student or transitorily . Is fast pace job, good to gain experience . learn customer service, management  sometime not fear but can be handle. The hard part is the lunch time is full costumers. The best part is the discount lunch for employees."
good,"The store I was hired at has a high turnover rate and poor training. Pay is just barely above minimum wage, and the only real advancement is going into management. Lack of accountability fostered an apathetic crew, and resentment between day shifts has persisted."
good,"I worked at Panera for a year and a half. It was fun, my coworkers were nice most of the time and the management was lenient for the most part. But, they also did not care much for their employees. My GM just cared about money and not how happy his employees were. It is definitely a job for people wanting extra money or college students- not a long term environment."
good,I have enjoyed working with this company however it has been stressful. I have been there for about 4 months and have notice a lot of stealing and poor middle management. A lot of gossip gets spread around as well. If i could i would recommend an entire overhaul of the managing system in place and a bit more attention towards the loss that is occurring and not being dealt with regularly.
good,"Management is worried about saving their own individual backsides. Managers do not help setup for the next morning, they will leave tasks uncompleted to spite managers that work after they do. Anyone with a pulse can be hired and there is literally no standard requirement for job mastery or performance."
good,"I would recommend this job more so to teenagers trying to save up for college. This is no job for people that have over qualified qualifications, not for people with major responsibilities as for as household and bills"
good,"large employee turn over so constantly training new associates, if your good at the job you'll be picking up the slack for those who can't handle the fast pace. From the beginning of your shift until the end you won't stop moving and running around. You will never get out when your shift ends plan on staying 15-45minutes past your shift. Constant negative criticism for making mistakes which will be announced in front of all your co workers. The icing on the cake Panera probably has some of the most rude customers ever. Very hectic and stressful during peak hours. You may be asked to take your break an hour after the shift starts....."
good,"When I first started working at Panera Bread, it was a quick-paced job with wonderful management and an overall great working environment. A typical day for me was taking customers' orders, making drinks, stocking, and cleaning. I learned how to move quickly and have a sense of urgency, and I developed a great work ethic-- early morning shifts, no call outs, be responsible for covering shifts that need to be covered. If everyone is doing their job like they are supposed to, it can be stressful when busy but still a fun environment to work in."
good,This job is A LOT of work and multitasking. During my time while working in Panera I was very active always moving. Management was very strict when requesting off.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,A good place to start a career. Not great benefits. Managers are put under a lot of stress for what the are payed. Constant change is required to maintain your position.
good,I got this job when I was 16 and haven't left since. I am ready to leave because of the work to pay racio.  I do love my job.. it's all the baggage that comes with it that stresses me out.
good,"management could more understanding and better with communication"
good,"They are not very good with giving hours, only to certain employees get good hours. Some people that are managers, should not have become mangers. They do not know how to talk to people."
good,"Keeps the bills paid. Fairly fast paced environment with little to no accountability for mistakes or otherwise. Communication with management is almost non existent and good luck getting your ""promised wage increase"". Don't buy into what they're selling."
good,"General Manager Was a Jerk. Simple as that. The atmosphere was fun, my co-workers were awesome, but my General Manager Was a Jerk. I can't make it anymore clear."
good,"While the work/ life balance is nice (45 hours a week for Managers), there are several mixed messages about the company culture.  Panera brags about being about their people, however upper management wants people thrown under the bus.  It is never the GM (or higher's fault).  Unfortunately this creates a culture of discord and divisiveness."
good,Some of the people working there are amazing people and are great at their job and they care about their coworkers. others do not share the same attitude.
good,It is a great place to learn how to adapt to harsh and stressful environment while keeping calm. They tend to get a lot of schedule conflicts or people not showing up so be prepared for lots of calls to fill in.
good,"I got 5-10 hours a week,no more, despite asking for more several times. Managers would talk about employees, which would lead to drama in between coworkers that could have easily been avoided had the managers acted with maturity. Very unprofessional and unpleasant work environment."
good,"cashier/ customer service. taking peoples orders, having a smile on my face throughout the day, helping out in other areas that needed help, standing for a long period of time"
good,"A typical day at work would be taking orders, cleaning up, bringing food to the customers, and giving great customer service. I learned hot to take care of customers."
good,"Basically, if you like working in the food business, it's a nice place to start. Management depends on where you work and the individuals you work with because everywhere is different. You should be able to balance your life and work but the company sometimes doesn't make it possible."
good,"Panera Bread in San Diego cares more about what the customer thinks than their employee.  If the employee doesn't fit their model for what they should be they get in trouble.  They usually take the customer's side even if they are wrong and blame the employee.  They work you ragged and pull you in too many different directions until they burn you out and you move on.  Each cafe is it's own family, but nobody is paid enough to actually care about the work that they do or the customers that they help."
good,"If we want a ""starter"" job, a job to get used to fast paced and medium standards this is a good place to start. Most of the employees will be teenagers and this make it awkward for older adults."
good,"As a shift supervisor, a typical day for me was to mainly open or close the store and run my shift. I gained so much knowledge of what it takes to maintain a business and obtain much more responsibility. The hardest part of the job was undergoing more pressure which took me a little bit to get use to. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to teach associates my knowledge over the years and help them improve the overall culture of Panera Bread."
good,"Overall, the people are what makes me stay. I have worked there for a couple months and all the time, it is chaotic and is not the best work environment. Managers are always stressed and if things do not get stocked, the lunch / dinner rush is not fun at all. Overall it is not too bad, but I would recommend applying somewhere else."
good,"Panera is very flexible with schedule changes, and the managers are always willing to help if given notice. The managers can be kind of rude sometimes, and say off handed things but they can also be sweet. The only benefit of working at Panera is the 50% discount on food, and the amazing people who work there."
good,Tips were low which was disheartening.Management was very busy and often i was unable to get them on the phone. Co workers were diverse. the on board process was online.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"The coworkers are for the most part great. Largely understaffed, often when rushes would hit no matter how fast we worked we could not keep up with customer traffic. Leading to frustration in front of and behind the counter. Fun, light hearted place to work in down time, during rushes, very stressful and not conducive to employees success."
good,I was tossed into the kitchen with almost no training at all. The Location I worked at was really struggling to keep workers because of the insufficient training and stressful environment.
good,"I learned how to make espresso drinks and other blended frozen beverages. Also, learned to correctly serve people in the dining area. The most enjoyable part of the job was having the time to interact with customers."
good,"Alot of standing and walking. Answering phone calls putting orders in, preping food and serving as a waitress. Making drinks, setting up pastries and breads"
good,I worked with Panera Bread from 16-19 and it was fun. The coworkers were amazing and I made so many new friends! Management would give me to many hours at times and it impacted my grades and social life. I asked for a promotion and was told it would take several months and if that they would hire me part time but would not increase my current pay. Loved working there but need something new for my needs and adult life.
good,"This job is very repetitive, so if you like routine you may like it. I've loved all of my GM's, but the rest of management isn't always guaranteed to be the greatest. Many don't help out making food or ringing on the cashier and see themselves as better than the associates. You feel overworked most of the time and the pay isn't worth it. Also, look out for unfair pay. Some associates that were working their for 2 years were making $10/hr, while long time associates (6-10 years) were only making $10-$11/hr. So you may just start out at $8/hr while others will start out at $9.50/hr. It is very unfair."
good,It's an overall cool place to work at. Customers are sometimes friendly it all depends on your location and your experience with them. Management team sucks & they sometimes over work you. ( beg you to come in). I wouldn't recommend staying there long term because it does get stressful if your in high school & just need some extra cash it's GREAT for you. if your a college student with bills don't go for it. I started working there my junior year and now I'm a sophomore in college who recently quit & I don't regret it one bit. Good luck though. Oh and the pay sucks!
good,"Panera Bread is grossly underpaying employees, as well as management."
good,"Can be enjoyable to work here at times.  If you are not good with stressful and extremely quickly paced places to work this is not the place for you.  It gets quite busy during lunch and dinner, and occasionally at breakfast."
good,"I worked for Panera for 10 yrs and loved it at first.  In the last cafe I worked at I was under a terrible General Manager as well as a poor District Manager.  "
good,"Ok place to work if you don't like a home life, training was ok learned more by just doing it, food is very good but not everything is as healthy as you would think"
good,The insurance  SUCKED. The upper management didn't care about paying what the employee actually deserved and they took advantage of employees.........
good,"Panera Bread is a good first job or a job to work while you are in school. The company only cares about perception and if the employees are ""attractive"" by societies popular standards. Corners are cut with the food maintenance to maintaining the high standards they would like to customers to believe."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was when I had to deal with customer service. Fixing any issues a customer may have as well as my fellow co-workers.
good,i don't recommend working here unless you just love baking. it can be overwhelming. for just one and its a lot of step by step baking and its sometimes scary overnight along you hear a lot!
good,"The job is easy, though tedious at times. Very hetic rushes. Big family besides the management. Hard to get hours. Too many people call out. No full time, so no insurance. Not much room to move up either. People been there for 5+ years still at the entry level position ."
good,i was a cashier and waited tables sometimes. I really liked it. It wasn't a bad job at all. I was really sad to leave because I was moving. The management is not as good as it could be though.
good,"Mornings are usualy slow untill about 11 or 12 in the afternoon. Very busy from that time until 2 or 3 sometimes, very fast paced,"
good,"Panera Bread is a major company, their goal is to turn a profit. That being said, they cut hours and they force associates to take breaks. Management encourages promotions but doesn't act swiftly on the actual process of promoting. Co-workers are really fun and the environment is enjoyable. Would not recommend working here unless you are a high school/college student that is looking for a side job while attending school."
good,"Get items ready to go in oven whether from delivered cabinet or freezer. Bake items (Cookies, Scones, Sour Dough, Baguettes, etc.). Clean dishes and work area as you go. Co-workers are nice but beware of backstabbers. Some managers are good and the ones that don't like you go out of their way to make your job harder."
good,At Panera there is always something to do which isn't hard at all but can get tedious at times. This makes the hours go by fast and by the end of the day you are left with the feeling of accomplishment of getting through the day.Most enjoyable when there are plenty of people within the store to handle the rush of costumers as there is a bond that forms when everyone is working as a team. The hardest part is when there is a rush usually later on into the night and there is only a few employees (usually one) to make the food.
good,Very busy at lunch most times management was very helpful at lending a hand out at those times when it got very hectic  just a few not so much very likeable co-workers pay was not very good at all and did not give hours that I needed.
good,I love being able to help a tough customer or confused customer when they need help finding a healthy meal. A few of the manager's are very family oriented and care deeply for their employee's. I am able to grin and bear it when I am put in a difficult situation.
good,Panera is constantly changing their menu to stay up to date on the latest health crazes. Catering to their guests needs is what they are all about.
good,"it was very fast paced, lots of work to do most of the time. Solving problems and interacting with customers was key in maintaining a good environment"
good,the normal day is a fast paced keep you on your feet type of deal but once you learn to deal with the few bad apples pretty cool job.
good,"Hours are limited, and rush hour is terrible. Dining room is especially hard because only one person is assigned to dining room (cleaning tables, cleaning bathrooms, restocking everything, brewing coffee, cleaning up plates and trash customers leave on the table, helping out table runners) during rush hour. Managers don't give breaks easily because it's usually understaffed during rush hour."
good,"I just washed a bunch of dishes and I cleaned the dining area. I also took out trash occasionally. the managers were okay, and so were the employees. Good food though!"
good,"Anything you can expect working at a fast food place, you will get here. It is a pretty decent job. As long as you do what you are suppose to do, you will have a job."
good,So far I am enjoying myself and learning new things to prepare for customers. I have learned how to make new and interesting salads. I am currently learning to make sandwiches and it's getting better and better. The people are really nice and encourage me to keep moving forward even when I am a bit intimidated by new items on the menu.
good,Mon thru Fri 8am - 5pm work life. Learned alot about banking and its regulations. Very competitive work place. Best part of the job was the ability to go out and meet new people.
good,You would have a fun work environment as they but really they never do its more of a angry and stressed environment and not a lot of friendly people more of they just want to be paid and leave I think its just this certain location but still horrible co-workers.
good,"Standing in one place behind a register taking orders, cashing out customers. Loved working the drive up window but time pressure was more than necessary. Learned Barista skills. Most difficult part of this location was working with teens & young adults who disrespected the public with rude and inappropriate language."
good,It was fun and fast paced.Most employees were nice.there wasn't much room for advancement and didn't give me a whole lot of hours.The managers were nice and worked with you.
good,its a laid back relaxing place .. somewhat a home like work place...loved my time there enjoyed it learned a lot ...love the meetings and my job at the company
good,"Good Product, not great. I enjoyed most of my time with Panera Bread. I worked hard and it allowed me to have a good work to life balance, but management was more interested in personal advancement than the team or store."
good,"The job starts from 9 pm and ends at 5 am or unless the bake is behind. Everything needs to be done before 6 am and if the bake is over $1,800 we are suppose to get help."
good,"I learned to manage doing multiple things at once and build strong work ethic under pressure."
good,"Scheduled shifts vary each week, lack on consistency in management. lack of communication in management. The hardest part of the job is the scheduling issues of being scheduled to close several times a week. The most stressful part of the job is creating a staff schedule each and every week, even when the staff number is low to ensure the cafe can and will still operate as smoothly as possible. "
good,"typical day at Panera busy "
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"A typical day working at Panera Bread, I made sandwiches, salads and poured soups and arranged them on a plate presentably. Engaged with the customers and cleaned the kitchen, sweep mop, wipe counter tops and take out trash. I learned proper sanitation procedures and health hazards as well as safety hazards. I loved working with all of my coworkers, we worked as a team to get orders out within a timely manner. Although I did have great coworkers, I did have a poor management team to work with. It was unorganized and at times chaotic. They often scheduled six people to ring up orders at a time while only scheduling two people to make the orders. The hardest part of the job was getting all meals out under three minutes while having a full screen. The most enjoyable part was having very appreciative customers."
good,They gave lots of skills to new employees and easy to move up to lower management.  Lots of politics though and there is a clear ceiling for growth within the company.
good,"I run a prestigious store staffed with the best associates who help me run a successful business. The company sends me new managers from all over the south coast, who I train and develop to prepare them to go out and manage on their own. In addtion, I use my skills outside of these four walls, and spend time teaching orientation classes as well as training classes for the company.When needed, I travel to different stores and teach new managers how to write schedules and implement training in their cafes. I find great joy in working with all different types of people, and I've learned that accepting challenges is a blessing and makes me a better person."
good,"A typical day at Panera Bread was very productive however, sometimes there were a lot of issues with management. Inconsistency with management."
good,"There are always rude customers, but a good employee always greets them in a nice way and always remain friendly. The crew member are fun to work with but never get the two mixed. Don't play in a work environment."
good,"Co workers were, but lots of stuff we would run out of on the production line. Many people would get upset cause we couldn't make what they wanted on the menu."
good,"Panera has good opportunities for its workers  Furthermore, it is very supportive of its local community (donations, fundraisers, etc.), has enthusiastic staff and serves healthy, quality food.  I started out as a customer and to this day am still a proud customer who patrons my old store regularly."
good,Panera is a great company with great people. The position is very demanding and you really can not have much of a life outside of work. Not the best job if you have young children.
good,"I would just be a cashier for the about an hour or two longer than I was assigned each day I'd go into work, and the management wasn't the best, but working at Panera did teach me a lot. For one, it greatly helped me gain the patience to deal with rude customers, even when they were wrong, which was one of the harder aspects of the job. The most enjoyable had to be, by far, my coworkers. We were all like a big family."
good,"Line upkeep food stock"
good,"The staff was overall very friendly, great people to work with. Most of the management was great too, but the job was very stressful. Very long work days and work weeks, constant call-outs and no-shows, pay was not great, and raises were tough to come by."
good,"non stop from the beginning of your shift to the end"
good,"I have worked at three different Panera Bread locations and have found many pros and cons of each of them. Of course, management is different at each location and I have learned many things that I do and do not like within a work place. I continue to work at Panera when I am home from school as a way to earn a little bit of extra spending money and to occupy my breaks."
good,A typical night at work is sometimes crazy. We work by ourselves and we rarely see managers. The hardest part of the job is the hours since its 3rd shift.
good,"I love my job and all the advancements I have made here. I have learned a lot, good and bad about the running's of a large chain café. I like all of the people I work with and my days go by fast."
good,"I worked mostly in the dining room and bakery, so I was the face of the cafe (or one of the faces of the cafe). I was also usually a closer. So a usual day of work included general things like running food or ringing up customers and stocking supplies, but also cleaning (sweeping, mopping, glass, etc.) and overall closing the store. You learn about time management and customer service, which is valuable experience, and my co-workers were wonderful people with whom I have formed strong, lasting friendships. The hardest part of the job was dealing with management. In the seven months I worked there, we had had 3 GMs (the third being the worst of them) and word had it that there was a fourth coming. Both shift supervisors were on the way out and after replacing an assistant manager while I was working, the replacement also up and left. Because management was in such bad shape, communication and trust were breaking down at alarming rates and nobody knew what was going on anymore or who was really making decisions."
good,"Great place to work, fast paced, great product and services! Well managed, very friendly environment. Would reccomend part-time for college kids."
good,"Greeting and serving guest . Running food ."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Harassment and bullying happen a lot and nothing is done about it. Some who are not qualified get promoted including a high school aged boy who makes perverted remarks to many of the girls. Many unsafe and unsanitary practices are ignored by management. People play on their cell phones instead of doing their work including most of the managers. One manager gets angry easily and should not be working in that position if they cannot keep their emotions in check. Communication even between the managers is nonexistent.
good,"A typical Day at work would be managing the shift, picking up others slack putting in orders and working the day to day workday. i learned alot about shift management and having integrity and alot of other stuff like reaction to certain situations and working with others in stressful environments. how to manage and be able to trust yourself and learning from you're mistakes alot more than just management comes with the position you learn alot about just life skills and day to day things. Hardest part of the job was working with the management team i was in it was hard picking up all the slack and  doing more than one job description at a time. and the most enjoyable thing is working with the people that work there they make it a good fun environment to work in. Co workers were good here and there but the management crew is unlike a lot."
good,"The best skill I took from this job was customer service skills. I learned how to effectively get the job done while pleasing the customer. Our staff was always changing. The hardest part of the job was the hard cleaning we hard to do, deck scrubbing the floors and the tiles on the walls. The  most enjoyable part was meeting the nice people I did."
good,Panera was a good first job for me.  I learned a great deal in this fast paced environment.
good,"great place to work if you are a student of some sort.  Nothing to complain about the job in itself.  co-workers are friendly and management is good. Never had a problem if I had to call in,"
good,A typical day at work was fun and exciting and very fast paced.
good,Its a nice place to work. You need to be quick. Whether or not its to help address a customers' needs or getting their food to them. Once you get into routine you will get faster and know how to address problems. The co-workers are nice and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job is speed and accuracy. The best is when you get the breathers in between to get the stuff you needed done and stuff stocked.
good,"Overall, the work is not that bad, can get stressful when things get busy, but it is the unprofessional with the management that ruins the job the most for you."
good,"Working at Panera has given me many more skills than I had before. Communication is one such skill. This skill is key for a normal day to go by with less problems. A typical day at work includes checking food temperatures, making salads and sandwiches, as well as giving customers the best experience they can have while they take time out of their day to enjoy a trip to Panera. My co-workers for the most part came in with positive attitudes towards the day. As for management, we really could not get going for very long due to constant managerial rotations. The hardest part of the day would be to keep going in the middle of a three to four hour rush. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be working with said co-workers."
good,"A typical day involves a fast paced environment with zero down time."
good,"A typical day at Panera Bread would be busy rush throughout most of the breakfast, lunch, and dinner hours. I learned many safety regulations and became a cleaning expertise. Management plays a large role in your typical day whether it is counting down a drawer or helping you fill and complete orders at the food line. Co-workers are some of the greatest aspects of Panera Bread, as they are your friends, and also your greatest aid when it becomes busy. The hardest part of the job is having the deal with an irate customer when the line is out the door, it becomes everyones problem when the line is being held up, as we have speed of service goals. The most enjoyable part of my job is the satisfaction of ending your day serving happy customers and meeting expectations of your Co-workers and the management team."
good,Ok company to work for but not a good long term job. Company has a in your face management style.
good,Job does not pay enough for all the duties that they require you to do. They expect a lot out of a person working by themselves. Expect you to close up every night and all the time. the managers can be very rude.
good,"A typical day working at Panera Bread was very hectic."
good,"A typical day at work: Simply doing what they tell you. It was pretty relaxed job."
good,"It was okay. My biggest issue was the management and how they didn't seem to look at my time off requests half the time."
good,"Upper management in my particular franchise, Take Home The Bread, needs a little bit of an overhaul. But other wise a good work experience over my 5 years with the company."
good,Whether you are a cashier or you make the food it is a fast paced work environment.
good,I loved the customers. My co-workers kept me young. The food was delicious I still eat there.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"I take and fill guests' orders; in addition, I am the head opener."
good,"A typical day of work was full of providing product to the customer in under 5 minutes and managing the 2 other employees working beside me. I learned the ability to control my surroundings and multitask. I managed the 2 employees working with me but was paid the same as they were, they were generally hard workers. the hardest part of the job was the inconsistent hours and low pay. The most enjoyable part was the co-workers who helped me keep moral high."
good,"hard worker, good listener . always making sure that customers were happy , and would always help my team out in anything that they needed."
good,"once you get the groove, the job is the same night after night after night. This also includes things such as no raises, no meal breaks, and no toilet breaks."
good,"The management is not ideal, learned all departments of the cafe. The co-workers are the best part."
good,"Panera overall is a good company, if you're a customer. Their managers are decent, however some are much worse than others."
good,At panera most of the employees get away with alot of stupid things. But I feel im a good reliable worker and dont put myself around bad workers
good,Bonuses are worst I've seen in the industry.  Often don't give raises to staff.  $2/hr/yr allocated to spread among a staff of upwards of 40 associates.
good,"wasn't enough communication, some team workers were good, customers comments were rewarding,"
good,"I enjoy working for panera bread, its a very rewarding job. Not only do you get to interact with Customers from different nationalities and walks of life."
good,Started off on line making sandwiches. I learned how to read the menu what people wanted. My coworkers were nice people.
good,open bakery and helping customers all while setting up for the day of non stop customers
good,"was more of an after school job not a career"
good,Great job stability. Great opportunity to learn new things.
good,"Typical day was to stock breakfast items; count in your drawer. Than you would wait for people to come in which was usually a steady pass of people you are helping. You would take the order, bag the order or put it on a plate if the customer was staying. You also made drinks for the customer. You would explain the menu if the customer needed help. If certain food items ran out you would make more, cutting the bagels and bread for customers was also required. And general cleaning such as sweeping and wiping off counters. The hardest part was, some of the customers who would get mad if you didn't understand their order or they didn't understand something you were explaining. The biggest con was that I was told I had to find somewhere for my child to go or someone else to watch my child if I wanted to keep the job. Most enjoyable was the co-workers, most were fun and there was a slight fun atmosphere to the job."
good,"This was a great place to work. We always had a lot of fun along with making sure things were done correctly. This company advertises that all of the left over food gets donated to the community, but its a HUGE lie. The location that i worked at would give it to their employees at no cost and what ever was left got bagged up and thrown in the garbage. The amount of food that was wasted every day was just sad, especially with all the people out there in need of it."
good,"This company has it good and bad days, it all depends on the management.  One thing I don't like is I feel there is no room for personal growth, at least not at my location.  They also punish you if something comes up that you can not help and being a single mom I would hope they would understand I don't have the same living situation as others and I am playing mom and dad at the same time."
good,i would walk into the BOH  where i was on dishes and there would be a pile of dishes almost making it impossible to walk past.Then i would only get a short break. But there were a few good supervisors there that actually cared for their employees and i absolutely loved my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was closing the store and the most enjoyable part of my job was being around my co-workers they made me smile and actually be happy that i worked there.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Worked long hours."
good,"Used to be an awesome place to work but things drastically changed over the past year or so. Panera is all about customer service and management. The ones who make it all happen...cashiers, the people making the food, the people washing dishes etc...we mean NOTHING.  Hours SUCK. ""Benefits"" SUCK."
good,Prepare and bake products for customers to consume the next business day
good,"This was a fun job to have as a teenager. The people you work with become friends, so it was almost always a good time. From a career standpoint it was slightly less impressive. It is rare to see a crew member promoted to anything above an associate trainer. You are expected to do more work than what they are willing to pay you to do. This comes with any fast food chain of course. I was there for 5 years and I really loved the time I had there, until I needed to advance  to a career with benefits and a steady work week/paycheck."
good,I was young so at the time it was a great job plust I had a lot of friends and family that work with and around me
good,work grave yard had a lot of fun baking and making bread. got to work with a lot of different people got along with all of them. management wasn't so good they where hardly ever there when you needed them. the most enjoyable part of worker for the was the customer in the morning they where always in awe about all the product we would bake.
good,Id arrive at work at 8 in the morning to prep for breakfast and lunch. morning is not as busy but lunch time is the most stressful time of the day.
good,"A typical day of work often started out with morning laughter and getting the mind set ready for the day. Between 5-6 AM we motivated one another before opening the doors. The day always began with regular guests expecting certain faces, level of service, and a positive beginning to thier day. Typically we had a high number of ""regular guests"" so this was common place throughout the day."
good,My typical day at work is getting ready to close the cafe im a daily night shifter and i close either the line where we prepare the food or back house where we wash dishes and clean the back for the next morning.I usually just go in and work for a couple hours and prepare to close within the last two hours.Managment is great as long as you do your part your good just act professional of course.Your at work! I don;t think theirs anything that is much to hard to handle we've got it pretty easy.The most enjoyable part of the job is closing on time with all our associates and leaving the cafe clean knowing we helped customers and made it through the night.
good,"A typical day at work is you clock in, then you get your drawer counted down, then you take orders from there, I learned how to operate POS System. My management is pretty cool and the co workers are sometimes helpful. The hardest part of the job i believe would be washing the dishes ad closing dining room. The most enjoyable part of my job is making my customers happy."
good,Its an ok job. I have never had a weekend off. Not enough proper dock space to load and unload. Need more and better trucks and a bigger facility.
good,It is a good place to work if you are a student and want 20-25 hours per week.
good,A typical day at work is very busy
good,"The position is good for some and not for other, part time positions only, not enough hours too give out, too many employees on one shift, but overall management are good people both personally and professionally. Nice customers, great customer service"
good,"Cook foods, Greet customers, served food, cleaned and stocked the store, prepped."
good,Typical work day is very routine. The most enjoyable part of the job is we all work as a team.
good,Very Fast paced in the short time i was there i learned
good,The work is not hard as long as the prepers do their job in the morning. Its only a temp job unless your trying to be a manager. The environment is peaceful but a lot of college students crowding the cafe because Panera has free wi-fi. They would take up a lot of room and barely buy anything. Hardest part of the job was during rush hour and not being able to say anything to the college students who barely bought anything. I would have liked to stay longer except management and I did not see eye to eye.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Its a good place to start your working career. The management team is nice, and the associates are friendly. They could give out a little more hours. The job isn't hard at all. I enjoy working with my co-workers."
good,This was my first job but I actually liked it. Stuff and managers were friendly at the time I begun to work and free bread was given at the end of each night. some benefits and the pay was okay for someone who had little to no responsibilities or bills to pay.
good,Great Peers; Some of the Managers in the Bay Area Stores have poor customer service skills. poor Management styles
good,Mostly my fun came from the great relationship I had with the assistant supervisor. He really made work fun despite the horrible pay.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of taking orders, handling cash, serving to customers, and lots of cleaning and restocking throughout the shift. I learned how to deal with different types of customers."
good,"flexible hours, management isn’t great. pay for someone who does multiple jobs (flex) sucks. people who do less get paid more, and until you say you’re leaving is when you get a pay increase."
good,"They talk about ""no jerks"", but will allow customers to treat everyone like garbage and automatically take their side. In principle this is a great company, but watch your back."
good,the management wasn't too great at the time only because we were in a transition for a new gm. The customers were very polite most times. Lunch time was always fast paced.
good,It was an ok place to work. People did often gossip about others which is the main reason I left. I would always get called in which I never had a problem with but later on wish they would've hired people that wanted to work. Getting over worked and having to go to school is the main reason for me quitting .
good,"A typical day would be prepping food, finishing early then helping out with dishes."
good,The job is fun and difficult. The managers work with what they have. And often thats nothing at all. You may be left alone a little into your training.
good,"The company was well at first to work with and for. I did what I could and when helped excell in moving up in the positions at work though, when I had gone as farr as I could and was aloud to go, at that point I couldn't get past management? Was not able to geta  recommendation to move up to corporate. So I left the co."
good,"Depending on where you are put will completely shape your experience, the only bad position I’d say is the line. Management and everything else is decent"
good,"This was my first job, and for a first job it was great. I outgrew it quickly but the managemnet staff and my co workers were great caring people. Anyone looking for their first job should definitley consider"
good,"I worked at the busiest one in town, and it happened to be a training store for managers."
good,Panera bread is a great job but somethings do need to be fixed such as managing . Need to also pay more and have an understanding when an employee has to call off days before their shift .
good,The management was not very good they did not communicate with us very well and usually would be pinned up in the office when we were very busy. Overall I liked my job at Panera the management was just really bad
good,And there was a nice place to work and you got half off on your food and break ready to eat and if you work till at night you got to take food home woohoo
good,My experience at Panera was ok as a young adult but unfortunately the work- life balance is very low. Working long shifts at all times of day is tiresome to say the least.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Panera was a friendly environment. The work was easy once i caught one and I started teaching other people how to certain so I could be a trainee. Sometimes you just got the worst in customers , not all days was like that . The manager was racist and had remarks from here to there . And some coworkers took it upon there selves to report her to HR"
good,Working at panera could be fun but it was very unorganized. Sometimes it could feel like you were the only one working. My co-workers didn’t always have the same force and effort as me and that felt sort of low.
good,"The work itself is fun. The scheduling manager sometimes will just not put you on the schedule and I've had to remind her many, many times when I can work and when i cant and one point she just told me to find someone's shift and take it. The GM has promised raises many times to me but after 10 months I havent received anything more than a new worker. People cycle through alot and they're always hiring."
good,There were some good people there.  Management was terrible though.  Total abuse of power and cussing at employees and constantly yelling and playing around while customers can hear and complain.
good,"I fell like the work itself is perfectly fine, I just feel like due to being understaffed and staff leaving a lot of work gets put on everyone making the job kind of a chore. It can be fulfilling when everything moves smoothly but when you have to do multiple peoples jobs at once it can be quite tiring."
good,"Panera is a great place to work if you always want to be busy at a job. Although, the work can get very tiresome and you may find yourself dreading the next shift if you work as the sole sandwich maker during your shift (as I was one of them). Sometimes the workplace was not the most inviting upon arrival, with the sandwich area being cluttered or others leaving behind empty bottles or pans of ingredients for you to handle. Of course, I am only speaking for my exact establishment, and am unaware of other Panera Bread workplaces. People I worked with were generally cool, but there never was a consistent manager. One more thing to mention, the supervisor team did an inadequate job in preparing for the absence of workers when it came time for a new school year to start and the college employees to leave. This dilemma left the remaining workers and I much on our plate to handle, and in return we shared longer-than-average shifts and were shorthanded. If a store has solid management and a reliable group of individuals, I would imagine it would be much more enjoyable- unfortunately I did not have the best experience."
good,"If you are looking for a first or second job, it is a good place and where I work, the people I work with are amazing. The job is what it is and can get very stressful and tiring especially if you work a lot of hours in the week"
good,My experience at Panera was alright. I learned a lot about proper customer service. You  definitely need to be a hard worker and be self motivated. I was employee of the month once but still didn't feel like I was given proper benefits. I never got raises I was promised.
good,"Panera bread was a wonderful place and the people that worked there made it a great place to work.                                                                                            "
good,It could be slow for a few seconds then it can become busy. I've learned how to work a register and line. The hardest part was the teenagers that would come in and we had to kick them out.
good,I didn't mind working there my son has medical needs but thy refuse to work with my schedule so i had to put my 2 weeks in. The managers where not communicating with each other the schedules where always late you always got called into work instead of having a set day to go in.
good,"I wouldn’t reccomend. Not the cleanest and nicest environment. The managers were all good but the staff, not so much. I felt overly worked but i guess it was good experience for my future."
good,Panera was a good company its just the location i worked was poorly managed. They always wanted me to come in for work during school hours and would get mad when i couldnt.
good,"Staff was nice, management was okay. The work was easy to follow and easy to handle. Sometimes it became fast paced but working together and a good leader helped."
good,"Panera is a comfortable environment to visit as a guest. As a catering coordinator, my clients were thrilled with the product provided and the service that came with it. As an employee, the conditions are not optimal. The pay scale is no where near enough to provide for a household and there really is no room for advancement as a Caterer. There simply is not enough staff to support the cafe. This was the case at my location, I can't speak for others."
good,"Irregular schedule, usually never scheduled a full 40 hrs, but reliable. absolutely no overtime!! It can be stressful during rushes, hours sometimes super long, fast paced, the job it’s self is not hard & the pay is fair, I guess. As a  restaurant, you’re  only as good as you set you team up for. That’s when management comes in. With the right management everything gets done. Still a little bit of slack to be picked up on. Overall friendly environment, new celebrations often have bashes where we celebrate the Associates and workers for their contribution. The food discount is good."
good,"Management was a mess, they were all over the place with new hires and trainees. Not a good enough paying job to stress over while also going to school."
good,For the stress filled environment I would say it’s not worth 8.47. Managers are mostly chill and you might get free food sometimes. I would say the people that work there are the only reason I’ve stayed
good,"I was a delivery driver and of course at the store I worked at deliveries were hit or miss. Some nights I stood around and worked in the cafe and had only 2 or 3 deliveries. Other times it would be busy.,but could never count on the money. The MGMT was nice but did tend to play favorites. They were very good about giving time off if needed"
good,"When I first started working here, everything was going fine. I have been there for over two years now, and I feel like nothing has changed. I'm making only slightly more than when I started and I dont feel like I really moved up at all."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Was stressful but we worked well as a team. Fast paced environment. People seemed high strung. Helpful managers. Very understanding and insightful. Overall was a great place in the 8 years I have been there.
good,"They seemed to forget that we were college students. I was called in on days I had clearly marked as unavailable, and my coworkers and I were constantly picking up slack for managers. A headache most days. But we had fun."
good,You'd clock in and check your station to make sure everything is as it should be. Making sure all your equipment is in order and if there will be anyone working with you that day. You may be tasked with multiple positions that day depending on staffing which wasn't a problem.
good,Barley. any structure. Was getting paid  less than other bakers when I was doing more than them.                                                     .
good,"With Tuscaloosa being such a large college town with even bigger weekends during football season, nights and weekends can be pretty busy and sometimes stressful. The work isn't hard by any means, but the volume of it can make it tough. Overall, there's a great culture here among the employees, which for me makes it worth it and a job I would recommend to a potential applicant."
good,"Panera is a good place to start out as a first job, but unless you want to move into management there's not really that much room to as an associate. Associates are seen more as robots than people, as managers favor those who meet the fastest times."
good,"Worked with multiple people, the work is a lot but it’s pretty easy. Politics play a big role in the store. Expatations are high and usually can be achieved."
good,Panera is more casual dining. They deal more with prepping and /or heating up the food than actual cooking. The employees were great to work with but the managers were unprofessional most times. The company didn't give the employees raises the last 2 years I was there but they had no problem raising their food prices every six months. The supervisors worked harder than the managers and didn't even get paid $15/hour
good,"It was a great place to work, I had lost of great memories and the discounts were amazing and so were the people that I was working with, we all worked as a rearm and that was a great trait to have as a business."
good,My Panera was not the best experience. Though I met some great people and some hard workers but I felt the amount of work and effort I put wasn’t reflected in my pay. As dish I took on a lot of dirty unfair jobs that no one else would be asked to do. From picking up loose trash outside near the dumpster floor to coming into work to find a hallway full of trash bags from three shifts ago.
good,not the best place to be at. Poor management but the workers are all fun to be around. Depending on who you work with its okay. Would recommend if you’re younger and just looking for a part-time.
good,"the staff make integration easy and non intimidating, management is also very accommodating to new team members, however over time management becomes less helpful."
good,I was dragged everywhere. Once you show how good you are they take advantage. So people would be bad at their job on purpose to stay in one area. I cant do that so i was dragged and taught everything for lousy pay.
good,"Scheduled and paid for 48 hours, but expected to work 55-60. Good company to work for as an assistant manager, but not salaried. There was never a thank you, or recognition that work was being done for free."
good,"Work is easy but management is the worse. You have to work to earn the PTO."
good,My experience at panera bread was an upbeat populus. While management was unstable the hardest part of the job was managing your time when not in a rush.
good,"good company to work for and relocation is possible if it is corporate to corporate.  Baker , management, production, cashier and prep positions available."
good,"Overall okay experience for my first job. Had some issues with management over hours, as well as a bit of negligence when it came to breaks... Definitely lovrd the ladies who trained me!"
good,"Delivery drivers at Panera have a flexible schedule but the pay is ridiculously low. When delivering its $5/ hr, $0.35/ mile and gratuity. Good luck if you are in a area where gratuity is not part of their culture. Then you will be paying yourself to go to work. Panera should really look into this, and if customers complain because order was wrong and cancels it, poor driver just did a free service."
good,I was given only two hours of work at one point and knew it was illegal to be working 4 hours or less. I was also the only runner that would be running every plate.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Mediocre across the board is all I can think of to describe the work and culture at Panera. Management is slow to recognize and reward employees with potential to make the restaurant more than just mediocre. But it can be a fun place.
good,This place would be better for a student. Not really going to make enough money to support yourself there. Better be living in your parent's house. Good food. Flexible hours.
good,"They worry to much about labor and over hire all of the time leaving you with no hours! It can be a great place to work, when cooperate doesn't make management hire too many people."
good,It was ok not my dream job. I worked in the afternoons. It sucks that I get paid every 2 weeks then weekly cuz getting paid the minimum   in Florida is not even living standards. But its me I had a job and Power thru it And People were Interesting but overall ok.
good,The environment and management at this particular location is fairly relaxed and flexible. They dont force anything unnecessary and are always happy to see an employee move on to bigger and better things.
good,This place was great at first but with new management came a lot of issues. A lot of favoritism and unsanitary areas. Did not enjoy working at this location.
good,"Benefits and bonuses make it bearable. But there is extremely high turnover and very few incentives for hourly associates. I enjoy the people I work with, but higher ups tend to ask a lot of GMs and I would not have a problem with it if we were properly compensated. This company definitely is behind the curve on compensation on all levels. It is a high stress environment and expectations are through the roof which is both a good and bad thing. It can be a thankless job but if you are okay with that it can be a decent gig. Also there is not much room for advancement past the gm level."
good,"The company offers opportunities to move up, but it can take a while to get there. The e-learnings take up a lot of time and you will more than likely have to do them on your own time unpaid."
good,"management has favorites, the pay should be upgraded,hours get cut all the time so if you depending on 40 hours doesn't mean you gonna get them.best to have a second job if you thinking about working for Panera!"
good,"It's not a bad or good job to have, just an average one. Members of management are very flexible with scheduling and always offer to help when possible. Pay and hours are average at best, comparable to any other fast food or cafe type restaurant. Very much a job to hold while looking for something more beneficial and long term."
good,"The compensation for the required work was not aligned.  The Company is very aggressive and forward thinking, need to revisit the staffing cost and make changes."
good,"I loved working at Panera. The atmosphere was a fun place to work, the interaction with the customers was great. Panera arrived on fresh food and customer satisfaction."
good,"Delivery drivers for Panera Bread do not make a lot of money in tips like other places do, making it not worth the trouble - just deliver pizzas instead."
good,Most of the time it was a fun environment to work in. Be able to work at a fast pace and handle different tracks at once. Management could be improved organization-wise.
good,Working for Panera could be stressful if you let it. It was busy for all parts of the day. There is some breaks for the employees to catch up and restock all items that needed to be replenish. It did have awesome management and everyone enjoyed coming to work. I loved waking up knowing that i was going to be around good people who made the job that more enjoyable.
good,"The days were usually busy and it was somewhat chaotic, as you can imagine at those times. Otherwise, it was a pretty good work environment. Everyone was friendly, however, the training wasn't very good."
good,I worked at Panera for a little over a year. You had to fight for hours most weeks but if you truly show that you're good at your job they will give you more hours. Sometimes work does go unrecognized but the general managers are pretty good with giving out feedback.
good,"the job is ok for teens and college students, the management isnt very good and people come and go all the time, hours are flexible and they work with your schedule"
good,Working at Panera was fun yet challenging. Management could have been more professional but overall experience was fun. Coworkers were hardworking and kind and the atmosphere was like home.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"a typical day at work would be dealing with customers all day as well as prepping drinks and pastries for them as fast as I could. lines were long at times, kind of stressful but can easily be managed. management was great and on top of things. the workplace culture was fine, never had a problem working there. the hardest part of the job to make sure everything was up to show. the most enjoyable part of the job was seeing friendly faces every day."
good,"Never had enough people working, hard for people to move up. The pay is terrible. The only good thing is the people and the good discount of the few things off the menu I would eat."
good,"As management change, the work environment and stress levels got worse. In the beginning, it was a great experience, made close friends and loved working with the supervisors. Easy work, fast paced and good hours. By the time I quit, I could barely get work hours despite my work ethic and the time I spent working there and was forced to do more work than the new-coworkers. I felt like I was taken advantage of and hated that experience."
good,overall good place to work. early mornings are tough. work life balance is ok but not great. good people to work with. customers are rough sometimes. fast paced with min help. excepted to do a lot without help.
good,"The mgmt at panera told me I can't work cash cause I'm a guy. unhelpful, toxic, and passive aggressive are the nice things I can say about the location I worked at..."
good,Work Life is difficult not a lot of support for new managers at struggling stores. Never see upper management on weekends. People are great to work with and benefits are good.
good,"Develop multitasking, organizational, and communication skills along with a basis in customer service.  Most difficult to split dish and dining responsibilities in the beginning."
good,As catering coordinator with no assistant it was rough. I doubled sales quickly then was drowning in orders and was having to beg for an assistant. It was a lot of pressure.
good,"I only worked here for about a month, but in that month I dealt with as many issues as I had with over my full year at my previous job. Management was doing their best, but with only three of them, they were each working 70-ish hours a week, and that was even with guest managers helping out. I had multiple co-workers just abandon their tasks whenever they got frustrated. I didn't get very much training, so when I helped out in drive through, I wasn't able to help on production, leading to 20+ minute wait times. I never got off on time and got called in about once a week."
good,"I had fun working there in the beginning. The other teenagers there were fun to talk to, and most of them had a good work ethic. But some of them, and even some of the adults, didn't do their job correctly and disrupted the work environment. And management did little to nothing to make sure that safety procedures were followed to ensure the safety of other employees and customers unless someone complained about it more than once."
good,"Panera Bread, while an industry leader in the adoption of e-commerce platforms, also lags behind many other, newer companies in the areas of culture and employee morale. The business model that is in place is often deeply convoluted, and sometimes not communicated properly. The systems in place to achieve the company's goals often malfunction to the point of being unusable, making goals unattainable. Pay and benefits for managers and associates seems to be lagging behind other innovative companies in the same industry, and behind other industries in general."
good,"I have been working there for about a year, it is good for money and good hours, but the managers do not care about their employees and therefore can make a tough environment."
good,Panera Bread was good associate wise but head manager's try to take the power role to far. Customers vary. Panera Bread was good discount wise and has a very flexible schedule that can be worked with.
good,Managers were extremely passive-aggressive. Despite asking for more hours multiple times I was repeatedly given about 10-15 less hours a week than I needed to get by.
good,"They pay well, even starting and even if you are a minor, bu the customers are so picky. Because Panera is between a sit down formal restaurant and fast food the customers expect everything done perfectly."
good,Some of the managers are amazing others could be better. The other associates make or break the work environment. The pace changes hour to hour and it can get very stressful when there is a lack of communication. But it was a great place to start working.
good,"Typically, you work good hours. I was able to see my potential in some skills, however the management is poor, but your employees can mask that. The hardest is the customers and serving their needs."
good,"Poor management, extreme favoritism, lack of motivation to improve workplace. The people are typically nice but behind your back they are quite toxic."
good,What I learned during my time with Panera Bread was how to manage people. Stick to corporate standards. Learned how to challenge my self in a stressful environment
good,"After working here for 3 years I think it is time to voice my opinion on this company. I am an associate trainer, my starting pay was $7.50 while having previous work history. I was only given ONE raise within my 3 years working here. You need to be able to work in a fast environment. Also be prepared for extremely rude customers (mainly because the food is expensive). My first year-year and half was amazing. Great employees, made so many friends and management was great. Fast forward to now, I am taken advantage of, terrible lazy coworkers (not all) and no room for growing for myself. Managers typically do not care about situations that involved upset customers and typically told associates to learn how to deal with them ourselves even though we couldn’t  issue refunds, give away free food etc. "
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Lot of high school drama. Regulars are great. Have to be really careful about allergens. Some people get really picky about their food. Better to work in the daytime than to close. I hated closing.
good,"They work with your schedule if youre in school."
good,"He is really friendly, but low balls your hourly wage. Makes promises he can't keep, like advancing you. Short staffed made learning anything new impossible and every day stressful. The crew were great and friendly, mostly helpful depending on the person. Managers were knowledgeable and friendly for the most part."
good,I’ve worked at panera for 6 years. working in the store is like working in fast food but with way higher expectations. competant and hard working employees have to constantly pick up slack from the lazy ones. could go on and on.
good,"Working at Panera is good for one of your first jobs, and it's easy to learn most positions at the store, but management (at least at the location I at) is changing every few months and bringing up a raise is very touchy. Can get very busy during lunch and dinner hours, but between and afterwards its not too busy and easy to stock up."
good,"Your co-workers are awesome, most managers are good, however the hours are spurratic ar best and pay is bad to worse depending on what job(s) you are required to do. Dishwashers make no money(8-9$), line cooks and prep make anywhere from 8-10$ which is table scraps compared to some places and for the work load and hours it is not worth it in my opinion. Good first job for anyone new to the workforce, would not recommend for anyone who has worked in restaurants or food service before."
good,"the first 2 months were great."
good,Ok if you enjoy belittled by the mangers and some of the customers. They are not a balanced work place. Many unfair decisions are made. Not dependable. They do and take as they please.
good,"Panera was chill in the beginning mostly. But the lack of hours they gave started to dwell on me. It would have been VERY difficult to make ends meet if I didn't have a 2nd job. Only way to really get the desired hours was to be trained working in the back making the food, which I was only trained for cashier up front. Management was alright except for this one women, but about job has that ONE manager am I right? Good vibes, and good co-workers."
good,"This is mainly a job for teenagers, it's a good starter job. No matter what you apply for you'll be trained to do other positions as well. Most of the people on the staff are awesome but, it can get very stressful at times. Maybe more than what it should..."
good,It's an alright place. Coworkers are really nice and everyone gets along. It's sometimes fast-paced but that's mainly in the mornings. We all help each other out.
good,"well a typical day at work starts with me doing dishes and cleaning the dinning room from 11 o clock to 11 with a 2 hour break "
good,"The cafe is a demanding job. Especially as management. Same problems every day, and repetition is enough to drive you crazy. Flexible hours though, so there is that...."
good,don't work morning shift it's too stressful people on your ack about sandwiches no one it there to help you when I get busy you have to ask for help but everyone is busy so you're on your own
good,"It was decent, good people to work with as well, but little room to move up if that's what you're looking for. Can be stressful at times, but as with everything else, the more experience you have the less difficult it becomes."
good,"Major concern is who you are working with, if they care then you will have a lovely day. If not well everything will tumble down .Training is also very important,keep that in mind whenever you bring in a new employee. The culture is very nice  on paper but in real life expect sometimes something else. The hardest part of the job is knowing that you can do better but if you have a district manager hired from outside who doesn't get the concepts and values, forget it."
good,"Everyone at Panera Bread from the customers to the employees and even the mangers are very friendly and welcoming. However, they lack the ability to properly meet the needs of their employees while making the schedule. They sometimes schedule me for up to 30 hours a week when I asked that i work no more than 18 because I am a full time student."
good,"It’s not an awful place to work at. You get told to do more that’s outside of your pay grade. People get paid more than you when they don’t do anything. Very lenient with time off.. unpaid time off. Not stressful, easy work."
good,Pay for associates poor which leads to high turnover.  Management ends up working as associate and  not enough qualified staff results in a very stressful working environment.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,at my restaurant it was nonstop from the time you clocked in to when you clocked out. the managers didn't support you or really care that much. work ethic was low as everyone is so miserable with their job. definitely would only recommend this job as a temporary situation.
good,I loved all my coworkers however the management was not very corporative with your schedule. The work environment is very relaxed and there are some terrible customers but your coworkers make it fun!
good,They need more equal compensation for their employees. New hires make more money than trained associates who have been dedicated to the company for years.
good,"The work environment is often fast paced, especially during the morning and night. Wages are low and customers are very demanding. Management was good."
good,it was a good first job and definitely thought me that slacking on the job will make things harder in the long-run. It was good customer service experience.
good,"no time for anything, constant blame but also constant advancements. short staffed, shutting down stores because they are going bankrupt. always stressed out"
good,"Solid job to get your foot in the door. There are opportunities to climb the management ladder. I was able to become a trainer within a year. Now two years and eight-ish months in, the idea of me becoming a shift supervisor is being tossed around. Definitely flexible hours for school and possible other jobs. Overall not bad, but not exactly a career I would recommend."
good,The cafe is almost always busy.  Lunch is packed!  There is a lot of employee turnover because pay is minimum wage and mostly employs teens.  Managers work 12+ hour days.  It is a good place to learn basics if you are interested in a culinary career.
good,The work place can be very fun but a little overwhelming sometimes with it's transitions. The company can be a little more clear in how they would like things done.
good,It was a lot to deal with being a closer. They were very under staffed making working there very difficult because it was a lot to handle for 2 or maybe 1 person.
good,The job is ok. It needs  more team work from managers. They need to give associates more hours.The pay rate lacks for the price if the food they serve.
good,The hardest part of this job was getting product from the freezer. I needed to climb a ladder to reach most items. Risk of burning yourself is very high.
good,"Handled the inventory of supplies in the stock room, clean kitchen area, sanitized the equipment in the kitchen area and prepared the bread for the evening shift."
good,"Panera bread isn’t a terrible place to work at. Depending on your location of course. It’s fast paced and stressfull most of the time, and the pay and benefits don’t make up for it."
good,great people to work with. job can become stressful. not a hard job to do. be willing to work hard and no time to just stand around. hours are flexible if given enough notice in advance.
good,Love Alicia to death. Shes super sweet. Some of the coworkers weren't very pleasant but you can't like everyone you work with. Food was good and so was the discount.
good,"The job requires much of you with little to no benefits. The management doesn't necessarily work for benefit of the employee, but instead benefit for the cafes overall success"
good,"I worked at panera while attending college. The managers were decent, and the customers were friendly. I enjoyed working there. I did want to be cross trained into catering, but that didn't go anywhere."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Enjoyed my time at panera but my position only offers overnight now. Doesn't work for me. "
good,"The Nampa location is probably one of the better run Panera's in the Boise area. Part of the reason is that the general manager has quite a temper, and it keeps everyone in line. Most of the employees who quit do so because of not getting along with the GM. The employees who have been there a while are amazing and super easy to get along with. Getting promoted to a trainer is quite easy, but don't expect many other opportunities for raises/promotions. Regional/upper management prefers to just shuffle people around from cafe to cafe instead of actually promoting people. I would recommend working at Panera if you are looking for a steady, simple job with decent pay. Just don't get on the GM's bad side..."
good,"needed a second job to make ends meet, not too much to complain about."
good,"Over the past year I've grown with the cafe, but recently times have changed. As a minor, they have been scheduling me a lot of hours from 13 hours shifts to 10 hour shifts on the weekend. In my time though, I've learned to do 3 peoples job at once and with that it has helped me with time management and helped me develop once close bonds."
good,"I started working at panera bread when i was about 13 weeks pregnant. After telling my managers that i was expecting, i expected a little lueniency with getting things such as bathroom breaks, breaks for snacking & resting, and manageable shifts. Within my first two"
good,Underpaid for the amount of work that is needed and some of the things that they require you to do are awful. I was working as a line cook and sometimes while i was working with food and such they would want me to go and clean the bathrooms (if someone made a big mess that included feces at times) then after that i would be stationed back on the food line . It wasnt the greatest experience or the greatest pay but it was money.
good,I️ think panera bread is a great place to eat . We did try our best to keep it clean. maurice is a great manger but the rest is just like a regular employee and very unprofessional.. It’s a warming place you can feel very comfortable in as well
good,I'm looking for other employment because of the hours. And it's managers are not strick enough. and they love their minor's.  Then training sucks. They have new people training new people.
good,"This was a great company to work with. The customers were great and I loved working during peak hours. The place is like home and gives off a family feel. Also, the food is great."
good,I could not see myself going back to work there. I talked with the managers multiple times about the jobs I was doing but only a few actually payed attention and cared.
good,"Leading the team by communicating, coaching, motivating and building sales. Focus on both FOH and BOH to build great team work. Ensure that BOH and FOH employees are providing all guests with the highest standard of service and food quality set by Panera Bread. Constant focus on labor cost, food cost, supply cost, and repair cost. Manage cost control standards while maintaining high quality, presentation and guest satisfaction."
good,"Come in, get in position, do your job and leave.  Can be difficult if in a busy store, but for the most part it is a pretty easy job.  Advancement is possible, just need to be willing to dedicate your time."
good,"It was a pretty busy place, especially during lunch. I had good team members times it would get hectic but we all worked together and got the job done ."
good,I worked there for a little bit. I loved the job. Minus when it was understaffed and I had  to do my job plus someone else’s. That’s when it got stressful. I’ve never wanted to not go to work. And the managers were nice. Most of them. Some had attitudes for no reason and took it out on the people who worked there. Which isn’t cool.
good,Onece you get to anything above a shift supervisor be prepared to sell your soul to Covelli Enterprises. It's a trap. We charge too much and pay our associates too little.
good,"They do a great job at wworking with your schedule, however they spread you way too thin! The associates work harder than the managers but get payed less."
good,I loved working with people my age. It was nice to work as a team. I wasn't okay with how often I would have a new manager. I still visit to see old coworkers.
good,"Flexible work schedule. If you are a hard work, they will take advantage while others are not pushed by team managers. It was a good transitionary job."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"-Fast paced when you hit the rush"
good,"Keep it simple, keep to yourself and you will be fine. Lots of hours if you want but can be very stressful at times depending on your store. Can be full of drama and sometimes there is lack of communication would be my biggest complaints. good for a part time job"
good,"I believe I had a general manager that wanted to hold me back and not succeed.   Minus that I had fun with the job and our managers were great and we had quite a bit of fun with bread bashes and after parties.  The company is definitely a decent place to work, but after 4 years I had no career advancement and was going to have a child so I had to go else where."
good,"It's a fun place to work very busy environment, enjoy working with lots of employees family type environment.I learned a lot about running effiecient shifts. I excel in guest service and food cost and running great labor."
good,"While it was nice that they worked with my availability and everyone was kind, the overall cleanliness of the store is a 2/5. There was very little room for growth and the managers barely listened to requests. Easy to do, and you can always rely on the company to be desperate for new hires, but for me, their cleanliness standard wasn't worth it."
good,"All in all it's a very easy job with very little pay. The Panera I worked at was filled with very young teenagers bring a very unprofessional vibe to the environment. "
good,Employees are not paid enough for what they do most start at $9.25. The general manager does not communicate with employees enough or listen to what days and hours employees can work.
good,it gets very stressful if you don't have a team that work with you and help out when things get hectic. Give you the hours sometimes but cut hours most of the time.
good,Management often relied on their staff too much and often did not prep enough for the day to come. Employees were friendly and willing to help eachother at the end of the day to close quickest for everyone
good,"There were a number of times I tried to ask questions or give ideas that were ignored. I don't think it was people being mean, I think people were always afraid of losing their job. Because of the fear they kept people down. I didn't get the impression co-workers stood behind each other, it was more like stepping over each other."
good,"I would feel like that I would only do the dirty jobs that no one else would. Also, most of the time I would be cleaning up after employees would were not doing there jobs."
good,Excessive amount of work for little money. The coworkers were fun and easy to talk to. The jobs were easy to learn and the hours were really flexible.
good,"A huge lack of communication between shifts gave a sense of animosity between openers and closers. Was employed full time, and recieved next to no benefits. No paid time off, no paid sick days. And the only real perk was a once a day 65% off, for purchase while working, this did not extend to benefit if you were not working. Breaks were not paid, and were required to be taken for 30 minutes if working more than a 6 hour shift. Never given employee evaluation or review, in my entire time with Panera Bread."
good,"Too many call-offs. Too many minors employed, not enough adults. Mall security called frequently. Under-staffed. Management under too much stress. Building not maintained. Leaking ceiling in manager's office. Panini presses often not working. Air-conditioning was never working."
good,"You're lucky if you get at least 12 hours a week. I barely got 11 hours, and when I asked for more hours, they told me that I cant get more than 20. At least give me 18! And I always worked closing shifts...."
good,"Management has gone down hill, they only care about making money yet never give raises. Also expected to work insane hours with little benefit. All associates underpreciated. At least you get free food."
good,"In the year that I was there, the store manager changed four times. No one got a raise, and it wasn't until after I left that anyone got any sort of a promotion. Most employees were either hispanic (and didn't speak english), drug addicts, or both."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"I loved working here and the enviornment, it was fast paced but also not stressful, the management made everything run smoothly.  It was a good job and would work there again."
good,A typical day consists of working hard. I learned good customer service. Management varies on location. Workplace culture is healthy and relaxing. Hardest part is the physical labor. Making drinks and food can be enjoyable.
good,"Like any job in food service, a Panera experience is all about location, position, teammates, and management. You can have great customers, a busy, quick-paced locale, but uncooperative co-workers and management; or great friends aming the staff and management, but a stressful, arduous local experience."
good,"Very poor manegment mostly the district manager but store mangers as well. Not a bad place to work but overnights can be stressful, basic kitchen and food prep work but changes are constant to food products and prep of products. They pay very well and benefits are a plus, but managers are horrible about handling issues when it comes to other managers and equipment or environment and rarely get resolved in a timely manner."
good,"The management was messy, sending out our schedules the day before and forgetting to file important information. The training is not extensive enough for the demands of the job."
good,Panera is a great company to work for and the value they have for their employees are great . The payroll department has a high turn over due to the management . It is supposed to be one team but it is really what is best for the director
good,"I loved working here, and I was grateful for the opportunity to do so. I loved almost everyone there, it was so fun working everyday. In the bakery, you just get pastries for people and make drinks and cash them out. So easy and fun! Unfortunately, I was not given enough hours and a few of the managers did not like me, so I left after being off of the schedule for a month"
good,Ever growing concept. always thinking ahead with new products and innovativeness. not a place to grow within as i have experiened twice as an employer of the company
good,"like most food work low pay for long hours, the culture is good but there isnt enough room to move up, while they do promote from within those spots are rare to find."
good,Night baking is ok...you have to do everything by yourself...management tells you they are only a call away but only offer bandaid answers to big problems...and only a selec few get time with management...u can work here for m ok nths and never meet your manager.
good,"Very fast paced, hardest part of the job is getting the accuracy of each order completely right whether it be a phone in or face to face with a customer, the management was very rude and unorganized, the other employees were sympathetic and helpful, the most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know customers and co-workers and creating fun relationships."
good,"Some days at work would be busy, some wouldn't be. Days like Easter or major sporting events usually kept the work place steady and quiet. Weekends during the summer are definitely a busy time for people to come, especially during the 11-2 time period. I don't regret my choice of working at Panera. It was a great place to learn new things, meet new people, and get a good hands on learning experience."
good,"They will give you the hours you want, but pay and advancement for the workload you put up with is not there. Management is constantly changing, and what they expect of employees is downright insane, even when they are jam packed busy. I understand yeah the customer is always right, but have some respect for your employees, and stand behind them in situations."
good,"Totally understaffed, ridiculously stressed staff, overworked, poor management, no professional experience, no benefits, not organized.  Overall, terrible."
good,Management was not very professional at this location. Customers made the work place what it is today. Peers in the work place very understanding. Would recommend.
good,"I love my panera family, customers and employees. If the company compensated a little more, the overall experience would be worth it! It's a place that you can consider home, outside of home."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,A typical day at work is usually chill without any problems. I learned how to constantly find something to do and get better at every position on the line. The hardest part of the job would be keeping up with the orders as we got multiple at a time. The most enjoyable part would be the short breaks we got.
good,Work at Panera is pretty difficult. A lot can be asked of you and business can pick up a fair amount. The management is polite and helpful when they are needed.
good,"Its a nice environment to work in , you learn to communicate with and deal with customers . The employes help each other around the restaurant so the work load would be easier for everybody , sorta like a family environment ."
good,"I worked at Panera bread for almost one year it was the first job it was really great at first but as soon as the head managers would become comfortable with you they would honestly treat you like dirt. On a constant basis, we would be called stupid and be deemed. The environment was alright if your okay with hearing your coworkers talk about getting high and partying all the time which sucks when there 30 years old and have kids. You will always be on your feet but that's not hard other than that its a job and it pays money but I wouldn't recommend it"
good,"a typical work day consisted of stocking, organizing and helping our panera customers. i learned that if you work hard you get what you need but also that some people od not appreciate you."
good,"The staff was friendly, the restaurant was clean and well maintained. A lot of customer interaction and working as a team to ensure quality dining experience."
good,Working there isn't difficult if you can deal with the general public. I learned how to be more patient with people and how to be genuinely nice to people who didn't deserve it. The food is not that great but the staff is a family.
good,Enjoyed working here for many years. Eventually had to leave the company due to poor management and them not wanting me to advance in my education. The pay way also minimal.
good,A typical day at work would include taking peoples orders and making drinks such as smoothies and coffee drinks. I would also food run and many days I would have the closing shift which would include cleaning the restaurant.
good,"You most new line workers/cashiers start their job on dining room duty, which is busy unskilled labor. Once I got to line duty, I felt like I was never fast enough, and when we were slammed with orders and our wait times were over 3 minutes, managers would become upset. I left because they started to schedule me for times I stated I wasn’t available for from the beginning."
good,I would most likely never work here again. The customers are very rude and demanding. Managers are horrible at scheduling and give most of the hours to new employees. Its just unfair.
good,The job itself was good. But there are issues with people moving too fast up the ladder  (friends with manager) and I'm a hardworker there for 3 and a half years and i earned my way up.
good,"This was my first job ever and I enjoyed it. The management at the branch I worked at was poor so we often dealt with many different managers and confusing schedules etc. However, my coworkers were great."
good,I don't get a lot of hours so I don't get much opportunities to move forward. It is a nice work environment and most of managers are nice. If I can get more hours and move to a different position I would stay.
good,"Though the management at my store was very inconsistent, the work pace and moveability of the job made every day different. Working as a cashier, dishwasher, and sandwich maker I could move and have many different shifts available."
good,"Panera Bread is a fast paced fast-casual restaurant. There are 3 main components to Panera outside of corporate, the baking team, the store team, and the FDF (fresh dough facility). These components should work in harmony, but often are working in disarray. One team blaming the other for a mistake and no one willing to take the blame. Communication and management are poor at Panera. Even though all the guidelines and training are well thought out, they are rarely followed through with correctly. Its hard to tell what direction Panera is going because of new ownership, but as far as I can tell they are more concerned with saving money than having things run correctly."
good,The management at my location was good but it was impossible to get a raise and they would bring in management from other stores instead of promoting the people at the location.
good,"•	Accepted Award for Partner of the month for excellent performance and teamwork "
good,"Panera Bread is a great place to work if you are not looking to advance in the food industry.  Its a fun place to work if you are just an associate but  once you get into mid-level management it gets to be very stressful with no work/life balance.  Some days i would be working from 8am to 11pm.  They gave bonus/benefits to management who had been working there for a year.  The only thing keeping me there was the environment.  Like I said, its very fast paced but you will end up making a few of friends along the way."
good,Great company. Depends on your cafe for your experience. Just go to work learn all you can and you should be fine. Fast pased and good customers. good.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,This is a great first job great starting pay although work could get hectic during rushes and could become frustrating when customers were rude as well as certain managers.
good,"I trained new employees/managers, completed numerous opening tasks for cafe and bakery while tending to incoming guests, kept food temperatures to company/food health inspectors’ standards,  and managed 3-4 crew members during shifts."
good,"I enjoyed working for Panera Bread for the seven years. I had the pleasure of meeting alot of really great people along the way.  That was the hardest part about leaving,  were the customers I had to leave behind."
good,"Overall, I think being a cashier at Panera is a good job for a high school student or for someone who it is their first job but it's not very exciting or fun."
good,My breaks are really the time i get to relax and take time to revitalize and energize for the next shift. I loved the extra time they gave me on the clock
good,Panera Bread is a great place to eat and the atmosphere is good. Working there is a lot and its takes a toll on a person. Sometimes we as associates don't even get lunch breaks because we have little to no staff right now
good,"At Panera Bread, I enjoyed working with the people I did. I would come in and be greeted by my friendly coworkers and managers, then begin my 8-9 hour work day. It is a very fast paced environment, which you can expect with any kind of food service. I did have many good managers as well as a few that were not so good. The hardest part of the job would be the fact that I work as hard as I can during all my scheduled shifts and still not make enough money."
good,"Overall I do not regret my time with Panera, but it's a job where you have to be 100% commited to it, and there is very little time to have a life outside of work. I was also underpaid for the amount of work that I did, other restaurant jobs pay better, and the amount of work is better split between the management staff. I was good at what I did, but there was no sense of satisfaction in the job."
good,"The general atmosphere is typically great in terms of a minimum stress environment and helpful co-workers and shift managers. The general manager is who I had difficulties with. She is inexperienced and lacks good leadership of the whole restaurant. While I enjoyed the customer interactions and the work I did, I often felt like I was having to do the job of three people. If one of my co-workers wasn't doing their job, it wasn't usually directly addressed by management as it should be. The shift managers may have wanted to do something about it, but the GM had the attitude of not wanting to ""offend"" anyone. "
good,"Management has been good throughout my time at Panera Bread, but I feel like it is constantly changing. When I first started I liked the people I worked with, but now it feels like no one wants to be there. Very slow to get a raise. I've been there for 2 years and I've only gotten 1 raise. Plus the max raise you can get at a time is 25 cents."
good,They just need to do a lot of things differently. the management need to all be on one page and the communication needs to get better. the wage is too low for the amount of work that has to be put in. Raises need to be better.
good,"It was a fun and enjoyable place to work at before we had gotten a knew General Manager. It is a fast paced and stressful environment but once you began to get the hang of things, it was not too bad to work there."
good,"A typical day as a Panera Bread employee strongly depends on your location. Some stores are extremely busy and some are not. Your typical day in a busier store is spending your morning (open until about 10:30) preparing for lunch rush. This includes getting all food prepped, stocked and everything organized and in reach for the rush. Depending on the day this can be more challenging if you have a busier morning. Afternoon is a recovery from lunch rather is baking things you ran out of, cleaning and restocking, this will also prepare you for dinner rush which can be a hit or miss. You learn a great deal of customer service and how to interact with different people. The overall environment is very relaxing and calm for the customers. Management at my location is awesome and it took a while to finally get to the place we're in now but the current management team is the entire reason for the stores turn around. The hardest part is learning how to manage customers, this location I've heard many times has some of the most moodiest and rude customers and that's something you have to learn to work with you cant be rude you have to handle it professionally and always smile even in the worst situations. The most enjoyable part for me was the experience and all the things I learned and the growth I developed within myself. Starting my job in 2013 I was afraid of communicating with customers and people and now I basically can run the place."
good,"I love most of the people that I work with, we have become a very close knit family. I work very hard at my job, but im not getting paid enough for it."
good,"I learned how to manage my time efficiently while handling several tasks. The most enjoyable part of my job was the relationships I built with my coworkers, but also regular customers that came into the store. Overall Panera was a friendly work environment, but management struggled with turnover ratio of employees. There was little to no consistency in that regard. As soon as a new general manager took over the store, many employees were either transferred or quit, leaving little stability for whom was working each shift."
good,Good for a first job and getting experience. Pay is terrible and benefits lacking. Low hours and no overtime. Schedule almost always benefits you if you're in school. If you're not in school you have to pick up the slack.
good,"Everyone is extremely snobby. You try to talk to someone, they glare at you. Managers give you attitude. Managers only seem to care about the older people that work there, not the younger ones. You have to prove that you have been sick, even if you can't afford to go to the doctor or have no insurance, or they'll write you up."
good,And I love the discount. I also love helping customers but there are so many people working there its hard to get close to everyone since its a short stop before moving on to other opportunities. The management is good though I never know what's up and down anymore. Since the death of the Store Manager things have turned upside down. They keep changing things way too fast and they need to have a better break system.
good,A good environment and lovely associates. The managers could be difficult and the pay was not always what you wanted. A normal day would include a few rushes and a fast paced work ethic.
good,If you go in with a positive attitude and smile a lot and make the customers smile it makes the experience and time spent working go so much more smoothly.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"I say if you are looking for work this is a good place to start but not a place to stay. If you are looking for a place to further into a career here, I would not recommend it."
good,"This company will help to build up your skill in certain areas, such as speed, quality, and professionalism. They will train you to be more of an asset to the company in multiple of positions."
good,"I kept the job for so long because it was an okay pay for someone with no responsibilities who also went to school. The workload was not always easy, but was always efficient and coordinated. What the job lacked in pay and advancement, was made up for by consistent scheduling and hours"
good,"A typical day at work was very fast paced. As a cashier Id have to make sure I had the order correct, gave the right amount of change and still keep a fast pace."
good,Decent environment for high school/college aged kids. Easy to advance if you're friends with management (maybe this depends on the store). Indecent pay per longevity. Appreciate their efforts for health insurance but it's so bad you might as well save your money up. Fast paced environment will definitely keep you fit and busy.
good,"It was a competitive work environment, many opportunities for young workers, specifically teenagers and those enrolled in school. There is opportunity for advancement and pay raise."
good,"The new management is great, and the people are sweet and welcoming. HOWEVER, you can never work your way up in the company and most people will only get about 15 hours a week. As great as the people are though, I will NEVER work here again with the stress lunch puts everyone though."
good,"Very fast paced during lunch hours or dinner time. The schedules change a lot, not much room for overtime. Management was great, they always wanted us to learn, the discounts on the food was also great."
good,"typical work day was start getting ready for the lunch run, after lunch run would be getting ready for the dinner rush then It would be cleaning the store and helping every one else do there jobs."
good,"With the new management, the restaurant started to fall apart. They are not sanitary or focus so much on food safety. I have't seen them really use thermometer to temp the food to see if it was in the danger zone."
good,"I started at Panera Bread in order to pay my way through college. After working their for 4 years, my cafe has cycled through many managers who were mostly terrible and didn't like hard work. This job is mostly for young people, not a professional environment at all, and it always took 6+ months to get a pay raise. It was a very stressful environment."
good,"I prepared the food such as salads, soups, and sandwiches. Worked as a dishwasher and was a trainer occasionally. I learned to work in a quick paced environment and learned the ways of how a restaurant is run."
good,"It was a fast paced environment that taught me a lot about the food industry and serving people. Flexible schedules, but management should be nicer to the associates and stop favoring certain people. give associates a chance to get more hours if they ask."
good,"The associates are great and the hours are good as long as you make your availability open.  The only problem is that if you expect the management to listen to you and expect to have any benefits/compensation, one should look elsewhere.  The managers tend to work around your questions and not give direct answers, or are rude.  Forget also about trying to move up the tree and get promoted because there is a good chance that you will not be promoted no matter how much leadership traits you show or how overqualified you are for a position."
good,"Corporate Panera and Show Me Bread franchise are two entirely different things. The training was by corporate standards and organized. The benefits were decent. Manager's used to joke that raises and year end bonus were like unicorns,,you hear about them but you never see one. A lot of good people left because of this."
good,"I usually worked the 3-10 pm shift.  As I would walk in the place would be messy, unstocked, and unprepared.  Management did not hold people to standards."
good,It was an alright job I enjoyed my time there it was a fast paced job at some points. Other than than that a friendly work co workers are friendly and its a nice environment
good,"Panera is always changing and staying ahead of the market. The implementation and routine change can e overwhelming at times, however in the ling run will always improve the business. "
good,"The job is ok, everywhere had good customers & bad customers. The management could have been much better with exception of 1 out of 5 managers. The pastries are good sometimes."
good,"Panera is a fast paced restaurant that is all about clean eating. They have a quick turnover of employees since most are students. To work there you need to be friendly, quick and hard working."
good,"Always have to be on your A game, it is always busy. You always have to clean. Closing is the worst, managers will literally have you on your knees cleaning floors. Not a job i would recommend unless you like that type of work environment."
good,"Isn't bad of a job, I just wasn't getting the hours I needed. The professionalism and kind attitude is something I learned from panera bread. I just don't want to continue working there because I need more hours."
good,"other than not being given enough hours, nothing negative to report. liked most of the people that I worked with. Really liked my manager, Brent. Loved all of my customers. Wasn't really too  fond of the late night shift, but I never complained though. Most of the people there were very helpful if you needed help."
good,It was ok to work there the only problem was that is was more like a side job if you are an adult it's more a kids job . I had to watch over everybody on my shift which was 4-close
good,"A typical day at work can either be in your favor or not, depending on who's the manager and who you're working with. A lot of the employees have never been properly trained. The hardest part is the fast pace environment or when we are short of staff. The pay is very good and Panera has many benefits. Overall good job, but has a lot of flaws and bad management."
good,It is a great place to work and has a good community. I have worked her ford  about a year now and it has  going well. The customers are so friendly and  you get  know them welll.
good,"Expect longs days; 10+ hours"
good,"I gained experience necessary to perform the day to day duties of the job. Panera Bread was a fun place to work at times. I learned a lot while there,"
good,I learned so much about food and equipment that I had never known. The most I took from this job was the friendships that I made there . The best thing has to me the food . It's just amazing
good,"The only thing keeping me there was raises! The hours were too much for me to handle after a while. I was miserable working nights, never again! Other than that it was okay, the managers need to greatly improve their communication skills."
good,"Very fast-paced environment, frequent gossiping/high school culture. Most workers show little motivation. Low compensation for expected duties, little support from district and market level management."
good,You can get pretty busy at certain times and dealing with customers is sometimes very stressful. Good conworkers that would help you out for the most part.
good,they dont really know how to manage a team. I feel really uncomfortable working there now after almost two years of working there. the hardest part of the job was having to work in a place you dont feel wanted or uncomfortable.
good,"Management is all over the place. It's not a cohesive machine, and some shifts are better run with one MOD! In my time at this job, you will not find a more helpful staff and associates. Every team member tries to help each other out and supports one another on shift. The employees make it great."
good,"Store highly depends on one person to do all closing duties, while other managers can refuse to close, simply because they'd rather not. Advancement in the workplace is easy to get, but depending on how high in the company you get, you can be told you will get the position, and then find out the next week they went in another direction."
good,"As an associate I loved the job. I worked well over 40 hours weekly so I got overtime. The base rate pay was nice as well. When I made my way to manager, I was still working 50+ hours weekly but was not paid OT as I was salary. The salary was under 35k annually which was not worth the work."
good,"A typical day at work would be me showing up and hopping on the cash register on most days where I would take peoples' orders until I got off. The management was decent, there were some managers who I liked more than others. The coworkers were nice enough as well; I've never had an issue with anyone's character or work ethic. The hardest part of the job was starting it, because they trained me on three different jobs in the first two weeks.The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with guests, I enjoyed that part very much."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"A typical day as a cashier at Panera starts off with clocking in and immediately starting on serving the next available customer. The people who are te most successful at this company are out going and amicable. There is a good balance of fun and work at this company. The most difficult part about being a cashier is interacting with the customers. One must be good at communicating with people and being persuasive at times. Customer service is also a daily part of the job as customers will come up to the register first if they have an issue. "
good,"Fast paced work environment that is entirely spent on your feet. Depending on your managers and the customers you can have anything from an awful, stressful day to a fun, exciting environment. Customer service jobs can be very tough, but also rewarding if you are looking to get into the food industry."
good,"Great team members at every Panera Bread cafe. Poor leadership skills from managers. Wish I could say that it's a fun working enviorement, but its not."
good,Management needs extreme attention and training. Dysfunctional. Team work is non existent. Location needs attention. Associate turn over is worse. Many think about relocation.
good,"You learn to work as a team and cooperate with each other."
good,"Everything was fine when I was starting off, but as the years went by and new people came in, it kind of started to fall apart because of repeated call-outs and employees half doing what is expected of them."
good,A typical work day is when I can come in to work with a smile. I want to be happy about my day. Also I would want to be moving around at work involving myself in different activities.
good,"great coworkers. they work really well with your school schedule, the pay rate isnt that good but you can advance easily if you work hard and they like you."
good,Fast pace yet very unorganized place to work. Not much room to grow in the company. I dont thik they care as much about their employees as they should.
good,"I didn't mesh well with many of my co-workers. They were friendly, but it never advanced past that, so the experience wasn't very enjoyable. I worked for only two days a week, but I still dreaded going in."
good,"Working at Panera will introduce you to a stressful work environment (in a good way) and will teach you how to work with customers and coworkers to ensure that the needs of the customer are met. I learned how to maintain my character in movements of high stress and I got really close with some of my coworkers. The shifts are long, and if you're a student I would highly suggest expressing you do not wish to close (unless you do) because you will sometimes be there until midnight, maybe even later. The managers are not afraid to ask the most of you, so if you are easily pushed around, don't apply. They will take advantage of your willingness to work and inability to say no."
good,"good people, fast paced, i enjoyed it there, but need something a little bit more slow paced so i can enjoy time with my family. not that panera doesnt offer this, i just prefer weekends off or at least every other weekend"
good,I enjoyed the company of the other employees they created a good atmosphere. The work was easy but repetitive management staff made things harder than need be
good,"As a overnight baker all it consists of is prepping, panning up, and baking food nonstop for 8 hours so that the restaurant can use it all for the next day"
good,The food is wonderful here in the workers were pretty cool too but I had got to a point where I was tired of smelling like bread when I came home From work.
good,"worked at panera bread in orlando fl for 3 years and it was the most exhausting job ive ever held. i would work 10 hours a day 5 days a week and come home exhausted every day to the point i didn't want to do anything else. Panera takes over your life. If you want any kind of advancement opportunity its easy to come by but also easy to get demoted. The covelli franchise group in particular is bad about letting go of managers like hot cakes. I never felt like i was paid enough for the work i did. Panera does well as a business and it always felt horrible to see the regional managers rolling up in their 100k cars next to my old used beat up car. If panera treated their employees like they advertise treating their guests, theyd have a lot easier time holding on to workers."
good,Be prepared to work in a stressful work environment. Not a job you can really slack on. Panera has very high standards that they are very prideful of!
good,In the beginning it was a change of a food experience for me as far as work experience yet as time went on I took rush that overall the store needed and I was also looked at for other positions due to the fact that I like helping people and I go the extra mile that most don't add long as I am appreciated for it. My daily job was not hard unless I had employees on shift not following directions yet I still maintained my integrity until management stop appreciating my hard work.
good,"good food, clustered environment, way too high of volume during peak rush, not enough compensation, management takes all the tips and doesn't split them well enough."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"I clock in, and I start to organize the bakery and package all the deserts that were selling for that day. I take care of customers and clean in between down time.I learned how to multitask and to work quickly and efficiently in a faced paced environment.The Management is usually ok. Most of the time my team at work is cooperative. We all work together and very hard to get what needs to be done. The hardest part of the job is when things to go as planned and we have to think on our feet to find a solution for our customers. The best part of my job is that I get to meet some amazing people everyday."
good,"the job is as slow or fast as the day is going... customers are surprising, you never knw who you attend... bakery and cashier is best job for anyone 5'5 and below, the line (where the food is made) are better for tall people. the wages are alright. not surprising since it is fast food, no breaks if you're over 18. half an hour break for those who are not over 18 yet."
good,"Fun workplace for younger individuals looking to get into a field in food services. Flexible with scheduling and time off. However, no paid time off as an entry level associate"
good,"They were, for the most part, very understanding and flexible with hours. This was my first ""real"" job, so I did not understand what I was walking into."
good,"Its a nice place to work for a student, but I wouldn't recommend making a career out it. Panera's standards are really high, they do everything by the book. The faced paced environment can become very frustrating. You definitely need patience. I don't like the uniforms you had to wear either. Good management made my job very easy!! Easton Panera had really good management when I was employed there."
good,"My days were extremely busy, but I enjoyed them. For the most party upper management gives GM's the ability to run and operate their own cafe with minimal involvement unless you as for it."
good,"Panera was good for many things but it was always a stepping stone for something more career oriented, too much relying on teenagers to show up. Bottom line when I left I didn't miss any of it"
good,"I learned quite a bit about prepping food, unloading trucks, and cooking various foods here. It was a decent environment to work in. I just wish that the promise of promotion was delivered to everyone not just favorites."
good,"I feel like Panera could've been a better job if the employees weren't so childish. Panera was my first job,and my worst job I've experienced so far. If things were different,then maybe I would've stayed longer,but management wasn't on it, so I had to leave."
good,"managers made work environment stressful, poor management skills. location good. good food. made some tips. co workers were fun to be around. good for entry level."
good,Panera is a very respectable company that is flexible with schedules and works with you and helps you advance in the workplace.
good,"It was a a good jo at the time, great environment. Not very challenging work, hours were good. It wasn't a career environment or someplace I would like to stay for long"
good,If you need certain hours this company is great to accommodate your needs. Most restaurant jobs do not take this into consideration
good,"I enjoy most of the people that I work with, but the particular clientele of our location make going to work one of the hardest things I do each week. The work is straightforward, repetitive, and enjoyable during the normal flow hours. Rush hours get crazy, but as I said, co-workers make the day flow past as best as possible."
good,"Loved working at the Stoughton location simply because my coworkers were awesome! Some had even become family overtime; it was like working thru the comfort of your own home. However, management is a mess. Nobody decides to take the initiative and do what needs to be done. Managers telling associates that its Their job to do when in reality, its really the managers job. Put too much responsibility on those who are actually capable of fulfilling their duties."
good,A typical day usually started in the morning between 6-8am and ended around 2:30-4pm. Most of the time I worked on the line or in the drive thru. Most of my co-workers were pretty young between 16-25. The hardest part of the job was maintaining fast speeds along with accurate and quality work during lunch rushes. The most enjoyable part of the job was the overall environment of the restaurant itself.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Learned lots about new foods, but the benefits seemed very lackluster. The breaks were very short, and when it got busy our area seemed very crowded."
good,"If you are on the good end with management you will love this job. Hours aren't all that great due to the amount of employees. There is room for advancement but very little, you need to work here a while to expect any advancement or raise."
good,I enjoyed the night staff but the GM would not listen to my requests when they would overwork me during school causing me to struggle in school that semester.
good,"Where most managers are understanding and flexible with scheduling, there are others that aren't. Most managers are young, and play the favoritism and drama game within the work business, to which is not acceptable. You should always separate work and outside life, but not everyone follows those rules. Most steal food and take advantage of the discounts that are given to employees. Other than that, everyone is caring and on the ball about most things."
good,"Things have changed dramatically at my cafe. Some of the managers do not get along with any of the associates, and they talk badly about them. I feel as if there is not any fair treatment at the cafe either. Some people no called no showed on holidays in which it was specifically stated that if they did not show up for their shift, they would be fired. That has happened multiple times with no repercussions of what was told would happen."
good,"The good days were good, but the bad days were worse. Most of the people there are cool. Management needs an overhaul, but there are a few good eggs. Have to be willing to do more than your fair share of work at a rapid pace."
good,"I enjoy very much the people I get to work with everyday, however over time the management (certain managers) have not been treating the employees with the respect that I feel we deserve."
good,"it was cool there, learned to work hard no matter what management wasn't all that good. My co-workers teased me about my name. The hardest part was closing and the most enjoyable was the food there."
good,"Favoritism among employees, rumors were passed along one another. Nobody ever wanted to clean, very few were obligated to clean oven and proof box because it would've interfered with the appearance of the products and the entire shift."
good,"I wouldn't say there's anything special about working here, it's just typical fast food service. Panera does have a better ambiance than other similar restaurants, but it's pricey and does tend to attract some snooty customers because of that. Management was hit or miss, there were some I loved and some who weren't so great. There's no benefits if you're part-time but the pay is okay, more than minimum wage at least. "
good,Has been very flexible accommodating my school schedule. Productivity suffers because of poor management causing exodus of experienced staff.
good,"wipe tables, ring up customers orders, make drinks. learned a lot about how we get our food and how easy it is to be contaminated. panera does a great job of not having that happen but others I know don't."
good,You learn how to work at a fast pace. Very diverse environment. Keeps you busy. Really good summer job. Good food and benefits.
good,"A typical day at the Woodcliff Lake Panera Bread includes hours of handling orders on register, making coffee, heating up bread in the oven, cleaning, taking over-the-phone orders, and maintaining the stock and inventory."
good,"Great coworkers"
good,"It is a great place to work at for your first job or as an 'in between' job. Depending on the location, management and employees of the Panera it can be very demanding or very easy. A typical day is like any other fast food chain with some days being busier than others. The hardest part of the job is being in competition for receiving more hours. Panera Bread is a career to many and to some just a part time job which leaves little room for shift flexibility in sharing hours with everyone."
good,Simple. Nothing very hard about the job. Management is going to vary with each store. This particular store has a manager that seemed to irritate their workers more than motivate them.
good,"Work at Panera is not so bad, it's easy, i can easily change my schedule and request time off and i love that. The thing about the business is that they hire too many people so they cut down a lot of others hours, even the ones that are loyal and have been with them for a while. Also when i get sick, i either have to get it covered or i get written up. if i get written up 2 times i cant call in anymore or else i get fired. So yes, the job is easy, and it can be fun, the coworkers are fun to be around, and i've worked for almost 2 years already so i know my around, but i really would like to find myself something that has more hours, better pay."
good,"Some supervisers are fine and know how to manage, while others do not care about the customers or the staff. They do not have benefits."
good,"A typical day at work would be coming in around 4-6am in the morning, sometimes earlier depending on our sales, then making all the food. Which was, depending on the day, around 100-150 sandwiches/ salads. Then delivering the food according to the time. Afterwards when all the delivering was finished, I would go to the office and do our end of the day paperwork, also email our customers with any questions, or concerns about their order. I learned a lot about being on time and to be punctual. I learned to take care of customers what were not satisfied with their order. My co workers were very nice and friendly. The only down fall of my job was that management was very bad, disorganized, and bad cooperation."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Fresh food served from a bag microwaved for pleasure  fresh soup heated up in a bag at 180 degrees   nothing fresh about it"
good,Fast paced environment free from fryolaters and late nights. Great opportunities for mobile young ambitious restaurant managers.
good,"Bad management. Work quality was not was I expected to be. Unprofessional and lack of work ethics. Some days were fine and other days was just down right horrible. I learned how to multitask a little more. My co-workers was fine, it was just the environment that I was in that really bothered me."
good,"Advancement is difficult but the overall environment is good if you have a solid crew behind you.  Upper Management is very non involved and feedback is far and few in between, but solid when it is given."
good,I like the challenges work brought me. My coworkers were friendly and management was as well. I was able to accomplish multitasking different tasks.
good,"Fun environment with co-workers, management is very kind and understanding. Making sure customers have a great experience is the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Work consisted of prepping food and working at a fast pace to meet customer needs. Took trash out when needed, help out managers to keep the store clean"
good,panera was okay to work at but they switched managers like every three months. you get to meet new people and have a relationship like a family but people come and people go.
good,"setting up meals for service"
good,"A typical day consist of a 250-300 sales per hour."
good,"Every work day is the same. You do the same tasks each day such as cleaning, cashing, making food. Most employees are helpful and friendly. You will interact with customers very often and must not let the bad customers get under your skin."
good,"It's a decent place to work. Exactally what you would expect from Panera. The pay wasn't exactly competitive and the management had it's ups and downs. The coworkers were cool for the most part, but like management, they had their ups and downs."
good,"A typical day at work was hectic. I balanced a lot of activities on top of being cashier. I juggled the pace and all the activities well. I rang up customers, took complaints, prepared orders, made drinks and cleaned whatever I used. The management was excellent. No manager was hiding in the office during the rush. Every manager pitched in at where ever they could on top of their regular duties. My co-workers were the best part of the job and I made friends there. "
good,"Very busy locations, employees are often young and lack passion and care for the business. Management usually focused on themselves and not the employees. Little room for employee improvement and promotions."
good,"I expected this to be an easy job and was surprised to find that this particular location, required nothing but dedication and hard work in order to assist each and every customer"
good,It was a great fast food experience. BUT FULL OF SOOOO MUCH DRAMA! watch out for those people. customers were very cool. management was ok. could be a little bit better.
good,"Co-workers never got along, there was always drama. One of the managers would tell us all about her personal life and her financial situations. Otherwise, it was a fun job. It was just too much of a slow pace for me. I like to stay busy."
good,Management were nice and managed the store well employees were  joy to be around. the most enjoyable part of a work day would have been interacting with the customers and being able to provide the with 100 percent  customer service.
good,"a typical working day at panera is very slow and easy in the morning, but as soon as lunch rolls in it starts getting hectic and depending on who's around to help, you might not get much of it. meaning, you might not catch a break. sometimes it would be all up to you to get the customers orders out. i learned that you have to be very patient because things can get overwhelming. i loved all of my co workers, everyone was friendly and i met a lot of new friends. the hardest part of the job is preparing food and getting the customers orders right because sometimes the cafe associates take down wrong orders, the long hours are hard on you too, and also how a ""part-time"" job there feels like a full time job. but the most enjoyable part of the job is helping the customers."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,The management and co-workers are great. I have learned how to work in a fast paced customer oriented work place. The food is great quality. You need to be able to multi-task and be fast.
good,"where always running out of some product . management is not on the same page but there all cool and worth working for, great place to work under the right conditions . customers are very nice"
good,As a manager you have to work as a manager and two associates.  The company keeps adding more and more items to the menu and more and more things to prep but will not give us more service hours or labor hours in general
good,My managers were always knowledgeable they knew what they were doing and they know how to keeps someone with their team. i had a good experience there and i would go back if accepted.
good,I love working at Panera Bread because it gives me a chance to do a lot of different things in one day. I like that they place responsibility on me. A typical day is fast paced and if you don't enjoy people this isn't the job for you. Most enjoyable part of my day would have to be hearing a customer tell me what I recommended them was great and they will be coming back. I like to build relationships with my customers. The only draw back of this job is the pay of course.
good,I learn how to deal with all kinds of customers. How to patiently listen and take care of needs or problems.I work with lively bunch of people it never gets that boring. My bosses are friendly and helpful with most tasks around the cafe.
good,"Typical work day is pretty much the same as the night before. Easy. Although if you are not good at time managemnt and multi-tasking, then this is not the job for you. I have pretty much worked with good co-workers. Have not come across any bad ones. Most enjoyable part of my job is the people I work with."
good,"Management is awful, they don't care about employees at all. Sometimes the will schedule you to work til 10 at night and be back at 5 the next morning. The managers gossip about associates with other managers and associates. Nobody ever gets punished for not doing their job or making mistakes."
good,"This was a great place for me to have my first job. At first, I really enjoyed it. However, as management took drastic changes and our employees were almost all new, it was difficult to get things done. I also felt very under appreciated, since I knew what I was doing and it went without notice,"
good,"cool place to work. usually will be filled with hipster-esque people that are down to hang out and chill. management, at my specific panera, was awful. they picked favorites, couldn't schedule to save their lives (I'm talking associates being left alone for 2+ hours on line, only 2 closing associates after 6pm most nights). the management was horrid. stop picking favorites like this is a clique in high school and treat all of your employees with the same level of respect."
good,fast pace enviroment with a lively atmosphere. average quality food.
good,My typical day at Panera Bread consists of making sure customers receive a wonderful fast-food/dine-in experience. Management makes sure that both the customers and the coworkers are satisfied. The coworkers were great to work with and that is one thing I absolutely miss about this job. My job was very easy and I do not recall a difficult time I had throughout the three years that I did work at this job.
good,A typical day At work busy and everyone enjoying each other company
good,"arrive to work grab ingredients for products. cook multi task repeat. "
good,"Very fast paced, friendly employees. Enjoy customers. Will work with you if you need to make schedule changes."
good,"arrive at 7pm start ovens,proofers,ext.. proof and preb all food to be made then bake it all put toppings where needed then prep for the next dayafter all that you clean up."
good,"Very busy environment. Schedule isnt flexible. You work very long hours, including holidays."
good,"Living in a tourist town such as Coronado, a store such as Panera Bread gets very busy during the summer months. A typical work day starts and ends the same way: busy. There is no rest at this work. The demand for food by all of the guests that come in simply overwhelm the store, and considering that the store is often understaffed or doesn't have enough product, many guests become angry with our store. "
good,Our bakery café fosters a positive environment which fosters growth for employees.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,had a great time working there. helped me gain a lot of experience.
good,As a cashier I was very interactive with the customers daily.  Got to know most of them by name.  The team I worked with was great.
good,"Management isn't good, people skip out on their responsibilities, no help. don't like it at all, other locations are better but a transfer requires a lot of time and a lot of patience"
good,"I enjoyed Panera a lot at first but started disliking it after awhile. I had one manager in particular that picked on me and was very nasty, she was sent to a different location not long after. The general manager is cold and mean. The company in general though is a fun one to work for. It was my favorite food chain to work for."
good,"Management was a bit lacking, a lot of the time no one knew which manager was on the clock v. off the clock. Customers were always in a good mood upon entry/exit of the store."
good,"I love this place but hate it at the same time.  A typical day consist of cleaning up messes made by previous employees, to clean up the same mess by current employees.  The hardest part of my job is dealing with the lack of motivation from everyone else."
good,"I really like morning shifts because people are really nice and their sleepy morning voices are funny. Even though I've learned to handle things under stress long before this job, the high volume of customers definitely increases your senses and how to interact with customers who aren't thrilled with the wait in line or any other reason they could be mad. The managers 2 of 4 actually enjoy their job and interacting with the customers the other two do the bare minimum and have been mention in reviews online as ""uninviting"" they also aren't respectful towards their employees and make coming to work with them extremely hard and dreadful. My co-workers are extremely nice people and we constantly interact with one another and sometimes when it isn't busy we can assist any one of us on product knowledge they may not know. The managers and their attitudes towards customers/employees is really hard to bare.. They also never take into account your personal time and told me that my schedule conflicts ""are not my problem"" and continue to schedule me on a day I cannot work. My co-workers, they are some of the most hardworking people I have ever met. They're caring towards me and everyone in the cafe. We all work together and love the time we spend together."
good,"I come into work at 430 am and leave at 10am. I opened up the bakery by putting everything on display. Then I package all of the cookies and put them on display. Afterwards I slice all of the bread for the line and slice them all in half. Then I do the croutons by hand and bake them. And, while I am doing all of this i am also ringing up people constantly and baking souffles."
good,"Depending on your location, the people are great. Some coworkers can be a little rude, but that's to be expected anywhere. Customers tend to be friendly and most managers are willing to go the extra mile to help. Work can be a little tedious and excessive at times, but more times than not you are given plenty of time to accomplish your tasks. My duties include keeping the dining room neat, tidy and stocked, keeping barista clean and stocked, providing excellent customer service and really just tending to the basic needs of the restaurant and it's patrons. It can be a little stressful when you're busy, but that's most jobs."
good,I do love what I do.  Baking is fun and easy for me.  Working by yourself for 10 hours a day is lonely.  It is tough physical work.  Management is unresponsive to requests and questions.  The benefits package is terrific.  Raises are non-existent.
good,"good working enviorment, great coworkers, can be hectic at time but with the team effort we have we get it done"
good,"A typical day at work would be going into work, and clocking in, and greeting the smiling faces who I meet at the register, taking peoples orders, and assisting with the food in the bakery, and the drink making as a barista. The most enjoyable part of my job was the people I was around, it is a very friendly atmosphere. I learned responsibility, to be on time always and do the tasks that were needed to be done. It was my first real job so it taught me a lot."
good,"A typical day for me involves coordinating with other managers on operational aspects such as safe counts and deposits, where to position the scheduled employees that day, and above all else, creating a great dining experience for our patrons.  The daily operations are split into three time periods.  In each time period, one manager is solely responsible for managing the entire cafe, we call it ""running the shift"".  The hardest part of the job has been the lack of opportunity to move up within the company despite my years and my good record with them.  The most enjoyable part is working with an interesting and diverse group of nice people, and serving our patrons well."
good,"go into work at 10pm work all night till 6am, bake and prep all of the product for the store to open. some store managers are not very pleasant. big lack of communication"
good,"lots of work, constant motion, prepping foods and filling costumer orders"
good,"Every day at work is always a new adventure. I enjoy the customers at Panera, as they are always enthusiastic about our food. We have regulars that come in and either try something new every time, or order the same thing every time. My coworkers are for the most part very productive and always look for more to do. I typically assign them duties to be finished by the time their shift ends. The management at Panera has a lot of potential, however, it is not up to full standard compared to another company I have worked for. The most enjoyable part of the job is that I am passionate about a positive atmosphere with a goal that I love. Serving our customers great and healthy food."
good,my typical day at panera is come in at 4:30 am and cut breads and set up the store. then take orders and make drinks and food. i learn that your day is what you make it. the management could use some inprovement. my coworkers are always fun to be around. but the hardest part of my job would have to be having our times where they need to be. the most enjoyable part of my job is my coworkers couse we always have a good time while getting the job done
good,"I have been at Panera Bread for almost 5 years and would honestly say its a good job to have for someone between the age of 17-25. I learned a lot about working on a register, how to make drinks, and what most restaurants strive to have in their company. The management there is not so great anymore after witnessing it after years, my co-workers are also the same. The newer co-workers are pretty lazy and are not trained properly because all of our new trainers are either terrible or we just don't have enough workers with experience to train."
good,"I worked as a cashier, so it was just typically taking orders for customers, filling drinks, and occasionally I was able to work in the bakery portion or make sandwiches eventually. The managers assured me they'd allow me to become a Trainer, and I'd be able to train new associates which would give me a pay increase and more benefits, but they never followed through. They actually had me train employees without letting me become a trainer, basically getting what they wanted without giving up more money. My co-workers ranged from a nuisance to generally nice to be around. The work wasn't too taxing, and I made employee of the month once. I did enjoy the food, but it became steadily worse for me as I gained weight."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"If you dont take things very seriously, this is a fun place to work.  It is not an end career choice, but it pays the little bills"
good,"Cashier while serving. Customer service, answering phones"
good,"High volume, fast paced restaurant with a loyal customer base."
good,A typical day at work was usually busy with customers. I learned you had to work together to get things done. Management was okay but there was always new management coming and going not stable. I like most my co-workers they were easy to work with. The hardest part of the job is closing. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing a happy customer.
good,"I had the opportunity to work with some of the best people I've ever met in this company.  I loved being able to work with people in their development and my supervisors (most of them) were very involved in my development as well.  I do feel as if the amount of responsibility was not spread out enough, as we were constantly understaffed in management.  Bonus potential was good, however, again, almost impossible to hit all cogs when you are running three managers, and need five for the sales your store does.  I feel we were not able to pay our associates what they are worth either, as we were constantly trying to maintain our labor budget."
good,Excellent menu for fast food. Great benefits. Multiple locations.
good,it is a great company and has benefits for it's hourly workers. I have learned about how a bakery operates. the management has opportunities as they fail to keep equality. my co workers get along with me as they know I am a hard worker. hardest part of the job is lack of hours. after the grand opening hype slowed down it became a part time job which wasn't what I was hired for. the best part is to make people smile and be told that was an awesome sandwich/salad I made.
good,I would go in when the café closed. I would bake all the product that is going to be sold for the next day. I normally worked alone. Occasionally I had an assistant to help with larger bakes. I rarely saw the Bakery Market Manager. The hardest part of the job was the night time hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers.
good,worked closely with several other employees to complete a common goal task and making sure the customer is happy and enthralled
good,"Every day is different. You never know if its going to be busy or slow that day, weather or not you're going to have a little or a lot of cleaning duties and if you don't catch on relatively quickly to the tasks you're responsible for then you're going to have a hard time fitting in with the employees already there. Other then that its a quality company with great values, food, and a warm and inviting atmosphere."
good,I had a good experience and needed to get a job related to my education
good,"good job for college students looking to pay rent/loans, no benefits to PT workers, pay starts out low but can be upped after about six months, work sometimes hectic, some managers are helpful/some managers simply aren't good at their job, customers can be very rude, breaks must be at least 30 minutes, depending on your GM work can be laid back or strict"
good,* Good teamwork
good,"Training process is grueling. Attention to quality control is impressive. Utilizes useless tools (Mindshare) to ascertain quality of service in cafes, which demoralizes associates. Company shows impressive, steady growth. Good marketing strategies.Products are delicious and high quality, special emphasis on freshness and healthy selections"
good,"panera bread was a fun place to work, i enjoyed working there. certain management skills needed some improvement"
good,Unfair pay between other managers and very masculine driven work atmosphere.
good,"Customer service main priority,Learned the different positions for advancement,Long hours.Most enjoyable for me was meeting new people on a daily basis."
good,I enjoy co-workers but the hours are not good and the pay is not good
good,Fun place to work but can be extremely boring at times. The management system was not the most organized one.
good,"All upper staff are very unprofessional and, unkind. The Co- workers were awesome."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"A typical day at work is very fast paced, and you always have to be on your toes. Customers range from friendly to overly proud. The management is decent but there is a lot of room for improvement due to lack of communication when it comes to scheduling and tasks that need to be completed on a day to day basis. the work load is not evenly distributed and can be unfair due to the longevity of shifts for some employees. I have worked there for about a year averaging 20 hours a week and still get paid around minimum wage. I would not recommend to work here if you do not like working 8-10 hours at a time with little time to sit or breathe."
good,Good job if your looking for a career in culinary arts like a pastry chef etc...
good,"A typical day involved safe food prep, down-stacking inventory, unloading or bi-weekly trucks, building food for customers, and keeping all food safety measures."
good,They really have the best intentions for their customers but with that their intentions for their own staff falls astray leading the employees to dread certain days with this particular place
good,The work load is waayy too much for only $8/hr. They offer plenty of opportunities to move up in the company but I honestly think it’s not worth it. People talk a lot of junk about each other behind their backs (especially management) and people don’t respect each other. I’ve also seen A LOT of favoritism.
good,"I hustled all the time and came to find out that one of my Buddys was getting paid $16 dollars an hour but I never got offered anything more that $9, I mean I was a deliver driver so I was also getting tips but its just seemed like management was relying on a few good associates too much"
good,"As a delivery driver you are paid 13.75 per hour and depending on how many deliveries you made in one day you could take home 13 to over 50 dollars. Tips are also added into your check and every other week you can see just how much you made. However even if you go the speed limit and pick the quickest way to your next customer, management still complains about how slow you are. Oddly enough I was told this would happen by my hiring manager. If you are ok with management telling you to hurry up and fallow the speed limit's ""but hurry up"" than this place is for you."
good,"it was a good place to work at, it was fast pasted which made the day go by pretty quickly and it was easy work. They were really good with making it feel like a team."
good,"Panera does a fantastic job of catering to families and children in terms of guest hospitality. However the culture of the company needs some fine-tuning. In my four years with the company there have been four different presidents of Panera and each time something different or radical is changed and all the cafés, including me, have to quickly adapt and change our standard operating Procedures in order to accommodate the changes. Additionally the culture of Panera, specifically our franchise, needs to do a better job at praising and uplifting its employees as that is a big area of opportunity."
good,"i loved the experience i got working for this company but the environment was not the right fit for me. overall, it is a good first job and the pay was well."
good,ok place to get tons of hours. not your forever job. I wouldn't go back. as a corporation they didnt disappoint 🤷‍♀️ the usual employees are dispensableattitude. .
good,The work environment was friendly and exciting each day. Customers brought a lot of happiness and fulfillment when solving issues for them. Co-workers were always a joy to be around
good,"NOt many benefits at all, management was rude not very professional. I enjoyed the employees I was working with but didn't enjoy the workplace. It was fairly busy most of the time."
good,"There are days when it can be good and everyone is in a good mood, but there are some days where everyone can be in a bad mood if one person is. "
good,"Good experience work there. Most coworkers are very friendly and help you if you have any questions! "
good,"For a first job, it was good and I learned about customer service. The training was hands on and it was not always the same routine everyday. The work environment was friendly."
good,My experience at Panera Bread was just alright. Managers at my location picked favorites and it was not fare. defiantly a great starting job. paid okay
good,it felt like a family. they gave my good hours they were very respectful. they accommodated my sick hours and my school hours. it was a clean environment to work in and the employees were very nice to each other.
good,Very happy environment. Too many people to actually schedule people hours that they want/need. Very friendly staff and always help when needed. Could use more useful people and less people to higher for one day during the week.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Other than that it wasn't worth it, the stress that is. There doesn't appear to be any room for advancements, unless hired as a manager. Like I said, minimum wage with NO TIPS. AND VERY LITTLE BENEFITS."
good,Panera bread isn't  at most times but like any job you have your good and bad days but everyone pushes each other through it and that's what counts the most!
good,"A typical day at work had lots of stress, and a lot of others slacking on theyre jobs so yoi have to pick up the slack. You get a lot of work pushed off on you depending on where your positioned and also only a select few actually do their job right."
good,I wouldn’t look at making a career there! They never kept the same management team as well as too many chiefs and not enough Indians!! The pay wasn’t worth it
good,With any place some managers are great and some should not have made it as far as they did. most of the time you're treated like a human being but sometimes they go a little too far.
good,"Panera Bread encourages employees to put the customer first regardless of the wrong doing. The way employees are treated and talked to/about by management is neither professional nor encouraging. Employees often bring matters that are personal and do not pertain to the work environment to work. i.e what they have seen or heard on social media, what was being done by boyfriends, private phone calls. The environment is much like that of a high school."
good,"It's ok, your average fast casual dining. Not much room for advancement, pretty political when it comes to promotions in the company. Benefits included, decent hours, not working over overnights/late nights. Work on the floor a ton, lots of extra paper work, above and beyond food safety standards. Like I said, your usual fast casual dining."
good,good hours and has a very ositive envirorment. they dont pay very well so i wouldnt look at as a career but as a little after school job it would be nicw
good,"My entire 11 months with this company was an interesting ride as I didn't have much experience in the food preparing industry, but like any other job I have worked at I adjust to my environment rapidly. It can do better when better management is involved."
good,just worked here for an extra income while i was in highschool so the pay was alright i think it was $8.50 so to get that every 2 weeks was good cause youre in school.
good,Besides management who dont understand a thing about the associates the store itself was a very fun and very busy environment to keep me on my toes and to help me enjoy work.
good,"Cozy, classy, and peaceful. An interesting café experience."
good,Employees were not always the easiest to work with and the managerial staff was sufficient at best. Not a very flexible schedule and very hard to climb in the company.
good,"I learned to follow directions, while working on multiple tasks with different deadlines. The hardest part of the job is the changing needs of customers and their attitude and the most enjoyable part is the engaging work culture."
good,At Panera you have to know what you are doing. They push you to exceed. The manager is a wonderful manager and I would certainly work for him again. I have learned much from working at Panera.
good,It is a great job however the pay is low for the amount of work I was required to do. Unfortunately it is not a job where I saw any advancement possible.
good,It was a struggle sometimes because of certain management but overall the other employees were great and they were good about taking time off and balancing with school.
good,It’s a great place to work just need more money because of new family. Small plant with very friendly environment. Work is not hard but very demanding when it comes to accuracy and precision
good,This jobs alright don't come here expecting a good career at the end of the day it's a fast food job that comes that pays at or slightly above minimum wage.
good,"I worked at Panera about three years ago, and it was my first job back when I was in high school. Looking back on it I think it was a good first job where I gained good skills that continue I utilize today at my job."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,awful management  overwork employees  do not take care of staff do not replace staff when people quit do not give raises do not appreciate their managers
good,"Once you start working there often, you get close to the people and it becomes a fun environment. Daily work was making sure all the ingredients were stocked and fresh. You could prepare food or take orders and money. The positions usually are rotated every day unless you are very good in a particular position."
good,The food is way overly priced. It's a cute environment and more of a modern style store. The workers are slow. The store isn't the cleanest. Orders are common to be incorrect.
good,"easy to learn the requirements of the job, good rules for the environment, friendly coworkers, good management, has rushes in the morning and around lunch and dinner"
good,"Great employee's and managers, family fun environment. Quiet, quick and respectful to everyone who comes into the restaurant to eat as well as to work there."
good,the work culture will vary dramatically from store to store its an entry level food service job so its not going to be great but compared to other food service jobs its not to bad
good,Learned a lot of new things to help me in future jobs. Management always worked with my schedule and were flexible. They don't have that hard of tasks and they make sure you understand your job and your position.
good,"A typical day at work they would start off nice then lead into being very mean, I didn't really learn much other than how to make a salad, the hardest part of the job was I believe the pre ordered food cause if you go in a job not knowing how to make something and they don't have a chart up how to make it then you're lost and standing there being clueless."
good,Panera is an okay place to work. Mangers are flexible with your schedule . Fast paced. You also earn tips on top of your hourly pay witch is a plus ! .
good,"Not as bad as a fast food environment, but it is just as hectic. Very typical minimum wage environment, although the values that encompass their business practices around clean eating and responsible food sourcing are great."
good,Working at Panera was a good experience it was my first job and it taught me a lot within the working community. I interacted with the community a lot witch was good because I am a good people person and can strike up a conversation in a heart beat
good,"When i first started working at Panera there were two really good managers who knew exactly how to teach and run the place well, then when they were transferred we got three new managers who were horrible. I first started working on drive through line then when they fired a dish washer they moved to that spot and that is where I stayed, I asked them if I could go back to line and they said once they find a replacement, they never did. When school started back up I told them I cant work during the weekdays but they still scheduled me during the week and when i would be ready to leave after closing they would make me stay to clean up more stuff making me end up going home at 1 am. When i gave my 2 weeks notice the General manger said ""You'll never work at another Panera location again"""
good,"Panera is very fast paced and requires constantly multitasking. Regardless of your position you will go home exhausted. Pay is for the most part terrible, any kind of meaningful raise requires becoming an extremely squeaky wheel and even then it's unsustainable in this economy. The employees and managers are great and very understanding about how demanding the job is. But even with them doing everything they can your workload can be unsustainable. Employee retention was terrible with the vast majority of new hires leaving within a month due to the pay and workload. This is not an easy job in any respect and I cannot recommend working here unless you plan on advancing in position to the point the payment is worth it."
good,It a very new and innovative way of working. It wasn't really what I expected at the moment when I first started working there but I really didn't have any money
good,There are many good people you can meet here. The fellow employees are really nice and friendly. They are always willing to help you out if you need any help.
good,"I worked there for about three months, it was very stressful because there is a lot of internal drama that goes on behind the store, also everyone there smokes pot including the managers"
good,I learned the difference between working for a corporation as opposed to working for a private or local business. The demands and typical day to day tasks are incomparable.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Great job for the most part . If you like to work with min. Requirements  but very eash to do come here. Love the guest  very friendly  environment  especially  mornings.
good,I like the management team and environment. Fun and upbeat place to work. It was a nice place to eat and enjoy the staff which were really good about customer service
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was probably my coworkers. They were always fun and supportive and helpful throughout my time there. They were always willing to help and help me learn different position token throughout the job.
good,"Panera bread was terrible, to much work at get paid $7.25 per hour. The management was horrible. He was fairly new so he didn't know what to do sometime and it was very stressful at times"
good,The work was fast paced at times. Could have been easier if there were more employees working together but they cut back on shifts when I was working there making it slightly more challenging to stay on top of things. I still enjoyed my experience because my coworkers were like family to me.
good,I liked working there but the managers were really annyoing becuase i felt like they would never listen to me. Except of one of them. I always felt like i was being ignored.
good,"I enjoyed learning about barista, and doing the bakery. I liked customer service, and my coworkers. Management was great. I didn’t work here long, but bread bash, which was learning about new products was always fun. It was nice to be part of a team."
good,This once proud company tried to handle delivery on their own.  I will say that they spent a huge amount of resources and had a fair plan to get it going.  They just didn't look into the costs and failed when looking into all markets and ability to attract talent.
good,"I did learn about customer service and how to meet customer satisfaction. However, hours were not very flexible and this is the main reason I chose to leave Panera."
good,"the workplace culture was okay, I learned & remembered most of their menu to this day. Half discount on food which is good. A typical day of work would be clocking and getting ready to stock on food supplies before getting on the line"
good,Prepped the food for the day. Easy fast/slow pace environment. Learned how to cut foods the correct way.Everyone is so helpful and kind.Hardest part was making sure the food was prepped and served the correct way.
good,I learned a lot from working here.  I enjoyed meeting new people.  Everyday was a busy day.  Good place to work.  Good management.  Would have like to learn more about the other work stations.
good,"They always had a plentiful staff that worked together well. I feel like employees can get lost in the amount of staff, but your station is fun, easy work! When it gets busy, it wasn't ever stressful because we always worked together."
good,Loved working the cash register and interacting with the customer and getting to know little about each customer. The job is pretty easy and ideal if you like working a fast paced environment!
good,Panera Bread was a fast paced environment that I did well in. I made lots of friends and life long connections. Direct management was good for the most part. I didn't agree with many of our corporate decisions however.
good,"A typical day working at Panera is having a lot of customers around making orders, With everyone trying to working properly. The hardest thing about the job is trying to make all the customers satisfied. I've learned that Panera can be a wonderful place to work if you can have a great social interaction with the people that is around you."
good,"Early 3 am start time, work weekends and holidays to accommodate customers, positive work environment, some small perks, this position in the office of the FDF while it was okay working there, it did not allow for much of a social life due to the early morning hours. Before taking a position in the office of the FDF be sure you can handle it, I could handle it for only one year and I felt like I fell into a black hole as I was missing holidays, family gatherings, special events, games, etc. due to being tired constantly."
good,"Panera Bread is a great place to work if you would like to work at a fast pace. They change the menus every 3 months, so you are always learning new foods and ways to make the foods. You're always learning so you are never bored."
good,Fun and productive work place. And Duane we environment you can go as far as your drive will let you if you have great customer service leader ship skills willing to learn you will do great
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Management moved up in the company and lacks experience. They will work you hard and then cut days. All routes are midnight runs and you work weekends
good,Working at Panera Bread was ok. I worked overnight which was a plus but it dragged some nights. The work environment was good on some nights depending on who I worked with.
good,How was your driver so it was a very slow day enjoy the free time but too much free time . Good customer service and I clean establishments. But I rather took a cashier position.
good,Panera as a whole always makes you feel comfortable and like family the minute you walk through the doors. The customers are familiar and warming. I've learned a lot about myself in this company. Moving to management put me on a stand still lifestyle i'm not satisfied with. The culture of the business is outstanding one of the best i've seen. The hardest part is dealing with the lack of management when it comes to associates walking all over them. The most enjoyable part is making the customers happy.
good,Great for a young adult/Student who needs some income while studying for their degree/diploma. If interested in management be sure to talk to your General Manager about possibly moving up.
good,Glad I worked at Panera bread however I’m ready for a different approach to the workforce! I need something that will challenge me to work harder and be a better person.
good,"Company is more difficult as a manager to work for now. Labor schedulers with less allowable hours, but adding more online ordering and delivery to mix creates an environment of having to much more during the day with less people on creates frustration. Overworked. The pressure to get it all done in a timely manner and serve the guest is driving all managers away."
good,"Its a mediocre job that pays decent. The managers are alright, but the GM doesn't really know what he is doing. They don't really listen to what you have to say either."
good,"Working at panera you would have to have patience, good memory, and a good attitude. I enjoyed working in the bakery because of the smell and the environment."
good,Panera bread is a good place to start as a high school student or college student but over all it’s not a good place to work if you’re looking to cover the cost of living. It’s very fast pace depending on location and some of the customers are really rude but if you can get past that I think you’ll like it
good,"It was a good place to work but I’m just not a fan of the food business. The management was alright, I didn’t like the shifts, I don’t like having to close"
good,Panera bread wasn’t the best work Inviorment they continuously broke the child’s labor laws and let minor work more that 80 hrs for two Weeks and it wasn’t a good impending
good,"It's easy work, just making sandwiches and serving them to customers. Nothing to hard about it. Day to day is super simple as well. Culture is okay. The job is fine"
good,Stressful place to work. Management is good. Not a whole lot of leadership. No matter the title everyone is treated the same. Plenty room for improvement
good,The workplace culture was unfair because the managers did not care about you or the team. A typical day at work was very busy and very tiring bussing tables and serving people.
good,"Really good food. Competitive workplace. Be ready for very long rushes and difficult rushes with complicated orders. There are a lot of combinations when it comes to orders here. 8 different soups, tons of sandwiches, tons of different salads, and a lot of sides. Be ready for the lunch rush."
good,they made me buy a phone charge while making deliveries because i had to use my phone for a job... meanwhile they had a phone charger in the office i could have used for ten mins... this was an unexpected cost to me and made me late on my insurance payment which they then told me i couldn't drive for a day and a half costing me even more money out of my pocket. cool....... not.
good,"Panera bread really is not that good, and on top of that, all their soup is frozen. Those french rolls are not freshly made from scratch. If you love working there, then you have forgotten about your dreams."
good,I really don’t have much to say about Panera. It’s a good business to work for and also can be fun to work there when you have the right people there.
good,"Easy work duties, hard to see a career path though. Out of the two years I worked there they mostly promoted females because they’re a better “face of the company”"
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Customer service oriented. Great food. Good place to start in food service. Great job for student schedules but must be willing to work hard and stay on task. Panera promotes from within so if you are looking to move up be willing to learn as many positions as you can.
good,"I had this job in high school. It was an okay job, but you're definitely always busy. I probably wouldn't work there again but it wasn't bad for a first job."
good,"The job I was given was dishwasher and it wasn't too bad. Then I became the truck unload guy and that was tough, primarily because there was no room in the freezer so I had to dig soups out of there and make room, which turned out to take me a long time!"
good,"I would definitely recommend this job to someone as their first or second job since everything is really simple to learn and it's a good introduction to the food industry. However, after a while, you are expected to pick up after everyone's slack, and that's when I felt it was time for me to leave. On a daily basis, I was juggling several roles in a busy environment where the line would often go out the door. So, if multi-tasking is an issue for you, I wouldn't recommend working here. "
good,"Wasn’t the best job I’ve ever had but wasn’t the worst. Benefits were lackluster, pay was marginally better. The one benefit was a clear progression pathway for associates who were interested in moving up. This is really cafe specific, but I was fortunate to work for good managers who maintained an open door policy with associates. It was refreshing to work with managers who care about people  They were also always willing to accommodate any time Off I might have needed"
good,Panera Bread was a great place to work and the people there were very nice but some of the managers were not the best fit for there job but I learned to deal with it and accept it.
good,Made more friends than anything here really. The management was always arguing with one another. Call outs were constant. Nobody actually had an idea of what was going on except the lunch rush crew
good,It was one of the best places to work. I ran the drive thru and trained new employees. I knew all aspects of the job and was promoted for my great work.
good,The managers and other coworkers were really helpful. Being a fast food establishment it was very fast paced and stressful. The work environment was very clean and nice.
good,"busy lunch rush and generally chill in between periods, managers are a hit or miss, daily routines are not too labor intensive, fairly easy job to manage."
good,i liked working there if you're able to be independent and just do things you know how to do and have a good work ethic. Always be on time and ready to work.
good,easy going work place find a task to work on or you'll be given a task. most of my time working was spent in the comfort of my own car as i was a delivery driver.
good,"The thing I enjoyed most about working at Panera Bread was at the end of the night, all of the food got donated to charity. I think that was really beautiful"
good,"This was my first job ever, I believe it was decent and a good job to start off at if you have no experience in work. It was always busy, you were always making sandwiches. I believe for a first job it’s great but unless you are trying to become some kind of store manager or regional manager then there is no need to stay at this job for too long before finding another one."
good,The place is very friendly and it is very easy to make friends here. Also the place is under new and better management. Panera was like a second family.
good,Panera Bread is an great alternative to your traditional fast food restaurants. Food is made fresh and to order. All breads and bakery items are baked fresh every Morning with a lot of attention to detail. we also have a drive through which is very convenient.
good,"Great for people in school, very fast paced, customers can be rude, provides great customer service experience. Most of the co workers were around 17-25 years old"
good,If you're a dishwasher or back of the house then its great but working on lime making food is stressful and working in dinner is easy your basically awaiter with like more responsibility and less at certain times.
good,"Working at Panera is fun and enjoyable. The boss are pretty laid back and it is a friendly work environment. "
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Easy, usually only busy on weekends. Management is agitated during busy hours. No work experience necessary. Decent pay which includes divided tip per shift."
good,Management is constantly changing - Front line food prep workers change almost weekly - Delivery orders many times inaccurate do to food prep lack of order checking before being delivered. This results in lose of customers and return trips to deliver missing or incorrect items.
good,"Usually the days pretty routine, clock in, make food,  do your other duties. such as clean, stock, or cover other parts of the cafe for breaks. alot of moving parts. not always executed smoothly"
good,Panera Bread is a great company to work for.They have great discounts and team members. They gave great customer support and service for all. Definitely would work for them again.
good,"Meh, it could've been better. the managers were hit or miss, though some were cool, its nothing to complain about. getting overtime isn't that difficult, it's not like a gladiator fight (thankfully) so if that's something you're worried abt it should be fine."
good,"● Lead a team of employees to ensure customers receive exceptional service"
good,"Not a bad place to work at first, but when I ended up not coming in on my day off to cover someone, and then was sick the following day, they still made me get a doctor's note even though I only missed one scheduled day. Then after I gave them notice that I would be moving, they started scheduling me one day a week even though it was more than a month before I was leaving."
good,"At first I loved working for Panera Bread, I was given a new barista position 2 months after I started and I had 40 hours a week, then slowly my hours changed and I started to get less hours and atfer 2 yrs. I decided I wanted to be somewhere else. Especially learning that the cap on pay was 13.00 an hour."
good,"The people who work their, make it worth it, some of the time. The customers are entitled. Its gets very fustrating, but overall it is pretty chill and doesn't completely suck"
good,Everyone works hard and this company looks for you to do more than one thing and fill more than one position at all times. It is definitely a working manager concept.
good,"I worked at a franchise Panera Bread and am speaking from experience. Pay was minimum wage (12.50). Unfortunately no benefits whatsoever, just meal discount 50% off. Management wasn’t good and felt like I did a lot for such little pay considering other Jobs I had in the past. Food was good though."
good,It was a good time to work with my schedule.and please help me out with that being said I am not sure how to get away from the house and the gas station
good,Panera is a good job for people not looking for that big of a work commitment. It is an easy job with normally a fun work environment. The hardest part about the job is dealing with difficult customers.
good,Good first job to gain work experience and grow within a company. Low salary and hard work but nothing you can’t work through and accomplish. Great management
good,"Working as a delivery driver was good but management was not great. They struggled to have work schedules done on time, and were very laid back when it came to enforcing rules. Coworkers were nice and friendly which is good."
good,"Good place to work and flexible hours, job is relatively simple and there are alot of people there to help and guide you to do the job properly. Send an application there"
good,It was fine while I was working there. There were not enough hours to go around but it was a part-time job over the summer. There were slow days and very high pace days nothing in between. The job served the purpose of getting me through the summer.
good,Working at Panera Bread was fun and everyone on the team was polite and worked together. The managers made sure that me and my fellow co workers were happy so that we can make the customers happy.
good,"The most hours you can work in a day in this position is 9, however you will almost never be scheduled that often. Usual shift time is about 4 and a half hours a day. People in the area the store delivers to often leave no tip for drivers."
good,Panera is a genuine good company to work for who try to look out for their employees. They need to pay the employees more including the managers but over all a good company
good,"It was a good first job, I enjoyed working for my manager in Tallahassee she taught me a lot and so did the management in Murfreesboro. I want to work in my major now."
good,It was a nice place to work but as  the company went from public to private it make a big change as how the day to day operations flowed through. good luck
good,"Let me say I came here based off word of mouth! This was my first time here and we were dining in. This visit was everything you could ask for during a newcomer visit. We came here around 1130 am on a Wed. Luckily for us it wasn't…"""
good,Panera bread was a waste of my time in my opinion I only worked there for about two months when I could of been somewhere else permanent. If you’re a minor you get less hours than everyone else
good,Good temporary job while in school in search of a better opportunity. They worked well with my schedule and understood my limited availability due to schooling at the time.
good,"My first job didn’t plan on being there forever so that’s why I left also the management was in transition and make things very confusing and the woman who was getting promoted wasn’t my cup"
good,I enjoyed my time working at panerabread. I was cross trained while working at panerabread which gave me opportunities to learn new things. Learning new things is always an excitement .
good,"The job itself was alright I guess, but the majority of the managers at the cafe where I was hired were subpar at best. They were rude to associates and didn’t quite give off the leadership vibes. But the others were pretty cool."
good,"Once you've been trained, it's a simple enough job that can usually be done by one person (and that you will regularly do solo). You prepare the bread and pastries for the next business day, with all that varies being the amounts and the occasional new/seasonal items. There's no official breaks or lunches, but there is generally time to take a seat at various slow points during your shift (ex. while things are in the oven). The simplicity is nice, as is not having to deal with anyone besides your fellow baker (unless you're solo baking)."
good,"As far as food service goes, there are better minimum wage jobs out there than those that Panera bread offers. "
good,"Panera Bread is a great company. I believe in their core values and have no problem working in a fast paced environment. However, they don't support you in having a work life balance."
good,A typical day at Panera Bread would be busy with customers and constant demand but with hard work and a team that helps each other and function as a unit we would smoothly cruise through the rush of customers each day.
good,"As a Night Baker in my region it is stressful, exhausting and downright hazardous. I and countless others have suffered from physical and mental exhaustion to the point of actual breakdown.  There is an unrealistic expectation to have one individual do the work of three in less than ten hours five to seven days a week."
good,I worked at Panera for about a month and everything was going smooth. But not even a couple of weeks before i let i came across managers talk about me but i had a feeling it wasnt something good because they quickly stopped speaking as they saw me approaching. I also was starting to magically appear on a imaginary schedule. They wiuld always call on random days saying i was on the schedule when i knew for a fact i wasnt.
good,"This was my first job in the Food Industry. I couldn't really complain for the most part other than my last manager. She was apathetic, crude and careless for others' considerations. I primarily was a food runner and a food prep making salads and sandwiches."
good,Loved working there just had some personal issues at home that started affecting my job causing me to quit to fix the personal problems I would go back but it took a lot of money for me to get back and forth to work.
good,"Working at Panera Bread provides the opportunity to build team building and leadership skills. Advancement at Panera is slow though and will require a couple years of learning and gathering information, however because it takes that long our managers have a good hold and understand what they are required to do and how to do it."
good,Everyone that I worked around was friendly but the management was not the best by any means. The managers would just go into the office and sit down and play on their phones until we called them up because the line is struggling.
good,"I wasn't given very good hours, not enough to live off of unless you were a manager or overnight baker. It's a good environment, but very messy & sometimes stressful."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"When I first started I was in training for about 4 months. Since I was new to baking in general and at the time they had. A major change to the menu I decided to stay in training until I was ready."
good,If you can  up things fast and work super fast you will do well at the job. My co-workers were amazing and nice and I was trained by people who knew what they were doing. The managers are nice and take care of business but they need to communicate with each other more.
good,"each store is different, experiences"
good,"you can only use your half off employee discount once a day and it has to be used on a day you're working. can't always take free stuff home, depends on the manager. they were flexible with my hours though. came home smelling like broccoli cheddar all the time"
good,"Panera when I first started was focused on guest and staff alike. "
good,"You choose what days you want to work, but the hours are fixed on 10AM-4PM & 4PM-10PM which doesn't really work well if you focus heavily on school..."
good,"Let me start off by saying that I would give Panera (the company & products) a 5/5 Star rating. They have good beliefs and values, even a program to donate unused breads to needy people. A job you can feel good about having, which is a great thing."
good,"Lack of HR department you have to ask for things , one person overseeing everything most of the time they don't get back to you when you have issue , of course they side with each other , they do whatever they benefit them not the employees, and they work you like dog ,if you get sick they look  for reason to get rid of you.No manoerty in upper management positions,and if you white you get treat very different"
good,"Good place to work for, just dont get your personal life involved with your job. Low pay, but it all works out in the end I guess. FREE MY MAN COVELLI"
good,"Overall, an alright place. There were issues with management and scheduling. Many coworkers did not like the environment with most of the managers. With my experience I do not believe i was treated fairly, i was never giving the same amount of hours as others, would be denied my doctor note as excuses, and would never have the opportunity to grow."
good,for the most part Panera was an ok place to work. I believe the pay could have been better and hey could have been a little more organized. I believe they could have been a little cleaner as far as keeping it clean during their shift and not leaving everything for one person
good,"It was a decent job, nothing too exciting but it's not miserable. I made a few good friends and loved my regular customers that came in daily. Not a career, but a good job."
good,"I did not work for Panera Corporate so I can only comment on the franchise at which I worked. With that being said, its exactly the same as any other retail establishment run by high school kids and college students."
good,Challenging and a fun place to work. Lead a team of associates each day to provide customers with the best experience possible when they visited the cafe.
good,"productive workplace, but myself and several female employees were sexually harassed by shift supervisor."
good,"The GM is easy to talk to, answers all my questions. Co-workers are fun to be around. I feel good about the food that we served to customers while I worked there."
good,Love interacting with the customers ive grown a friendship with. Love the employees i work with. Its fast paced especially during breakfast and lunch rush.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Panera is a good place to consider working if you're in high school, or just graduated high school and are looking for a basic job to start at. Hours are flexible, and the work is mostly reasonable. All-in-all, it's a good place for young people to gain basic work, and social, experience."
good,It seems like higher-ups tend to only care about sales and how the cafe is doing. They never care necessarily about the actual people making things happen and running the cafe.
good,"Good place to work most of the time, the training was poor though. They were down a manager so I was only trained for one week and then thrown into the mix."
good,"Panera can be a decent enough workplace given that the management tries to ensure the cafe runs smoothly. If the GM doesn't put in as much effort as the rest of management, the dynamic is toxic and can ruin the workplace flow."
good,"great and fun place to work, very uppy and energetic, but management was very lacking in professionalism and it showed. the employees had no respect for higher ups"
good,"Although my coworkers are very nice people my job responsibilities as a usual closer are very tedious and gross. I would find that other employees leave the store in a mess for the people who have to clean up after them during close, most mangers were nice people with a couple exceptions. 5/10 job"
good,"Panera was my first actually job and I loved it, but I am graduating with a bachelors and need better opportunities as well as pay. I need to be stability in my work"
good,Availability is key for getting hours during the time I got there I had to fight for two days of work however when I did go the customers were great and the pay was steady great coworkers all around
good,"If one is looking for a fast-paced food environment, then Panera would be a good fit. All staff are friendly and typically work together well. Management has usually been pretty good, but due to the level entry nature of the job, employees can be a toss up."
good,"The most annoying part I disliked about working at Panera was the inconsistency. I would show up on time to my shift and I never called out, while other employees called out or just didn't show up. leaving me with majority of the work and it became to be unfair because no one ever wanted to cover shifts."
good,Good first job but little room for pay increase or advancement. I did learn a lot of important restaurant information and the food is great. However management struggles and customers tend to complain a ton about prices and the various consequences of being under staffed.
good,Working at Panera was alright.  Managers did not have realistic expectations for workers to do their daily tasks. I enjoyed working there because I like to cook.
good,"Worked at a busy location that had a high turn-over rate. Worked on a college campus, which consisted of busy breakfast, lunch, and dinner hours. Stress was a common occurrence."
good,"Honestly, there aren't that many things I can say about this company. I work for one here in the Miami area and the entire time I have been with the company I have felt like I am at their mercy. From being talked down to, to being bossed around by everyone and I am not talking about management."
good,I actually enjoyed working there i just feel like efforts get overlooked and unnoticed. Many task and assignments are issued to each i individual employee but your performance could be effected by a co-worker with less work ethic.
good,The people who work on the ground floor are great. Everyone is ready to help their co-workers. Management is generally happy to help outside of the store manager. Assistant managers are much more effective.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"I liked working at Panera, but I just didn’t get paid enough, and the management expected a lot from their employees, I enjoyed working with everybody there and everybody was so friendly and nice and caring."
good,"It's good if you need something temporary. Tips are a hit or miss. You don't only drive, you also wash dishes, prepare coffee, take out the trash, etc..."
good,"Fast paced environment, flexible with schedule if in or going to school. Management is very understanding as long as you give them a decent heads up if medical or family emergencies occur."
good,"Would be a good first job and is easy to get a job here, but very stressful and fast paced. Constantly revolving managers because they keep quitting. I've had some amazing managers and some bad ones. In my 8 months of working here I've only received a .50$ raise. Started at minimum and now make 8.75. As a line worker they stress the time limit too much and being QC during lunch rush made me so stressed. Some managers don't care at all about associates. My wallet was stolen here and the cameras they had didn't even point to the lockers where it was taken, such a hassle to replace everything. The best part about this job was the people I worked with on line, very fun and made the shift worth it, but still making the food was not fun. Everyone wanted to be the person making salads because it was the easiest."
good,"The work was okay, but the rushes could be a bit stressful if you were new to the job. mostly part time work, with lots of sandwiches and salads being made."
good,"Never really got good hours, you had to be a managers favorite. They’re thorough with their training, but there’s not much room for advancement. All of the co-workers get along and that’s great."
good,The job isn't something worth being attached to. Lunch rushes are a strain on everyone - and it doesn't help that the managers will take it out on you
good,There were a lot of employees that didn't work there long and so there were constantly new people having to be trained which brought down the efficiency of our work. I felt that I was under paid for working there for 3 years being one of the only employees that lasted more than a few months.
good,"It was a fun place to work as a starter job but I wanted to gain more job experience in the restaurant business. I would typically take peoples orders, make specialty coffee drinks and fill pastry case."
good,"At both locations I worked at, I was very happy with management and employees. However, I'd recommend looking at the amount of traffic coming into the stores, as a high amount of traffic can stress you out, no matter how well you can manage it."
good,"It was a nice environment to work in.  I was recognized often for a job well done, my ambition, and was even given free meals as rewards.  The clients are pretty nice, and management was pretty good as well.  The restaurants are very pretty, and it always smells great."
good,"Fun. Great training. The cafes were owned by a great guy. "
good,It was fine as a first job but just know what you are getting into for restaurant business.  Also management was okay and the people I worked with were very sweet but the too fast paced and slamming just ruined the vibe for me
good,It was a good company to work for except for the corporate support team was not supportive and made the job harder. Work life balance was good. Pay was not pay. They do a lot for the community.
good,in panera i learned patience but the associates should work on attitudes that includes managers.the most enjoyable part about working at panera was the nice customers
good,"In my Panera its full of people trying to claw their way above the rest. And yes I get it a promotion means a higher pay but that doesn't mean you make others purposely look bad. Once I had a girl cover for my break and I came back to her destroying and messing up my assigned area and I got put the blame for it just because she was on line to get a promotion. As well as Panera tend to hire teenagers as they can get away with employing so many people while having them each work about 4 hours a day. So this is not a job for you to make a living out of. The only perk is that there are some incredibly nice people and, in my case, got to work morning shifts instead of nights. The food is half off and you only get it once while you are working which sucks because it also only applies to about one meal (No more than 10 dollars before the discount and their food is already expensive). "
good,"very productive work place to work, it is a night job and the shifts varies from 6-10 hours depending how much there is to do. You work 4 and have a 3 day weekend"
good,Busy.  Not much room for growth.  Great first job if you have never worked before.  Flexible hours with school.  It was a good job if you like the food industry
good,"My day includes prepping,and portioning the food.the skills i have obtained are organization,speed,and quality.The management at Panera has improved over the past 2 to 3 years.At Panera Bread everyone gets along,and works really well with one another.The hardest part of the job is not making enough money.The most enjoyment i get is the people i work with,they are very helpful,and friendly."
good,"Panera was a great place to work. You work at a very moderate pace (unless it’s rush hour) and the environment is very calm, cool and collective. It is a great place to be."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"I had a good time working at Panera Bread. I was able to meet new people and build relationships. However, management left much to be desired. Their style was unproductive and abrasive at times."
good,"Be Active"
good,"For me, my Panera experience has been average. It’s not the worst job in the world. I just happen to work at a location where it’s always stressful and some employees don’t do their work. If you apply there and they offer you a job, take it. Just don’t stay there for more than 6-8 months."
good,It took me 6 years to become a shift supervisor even though it was offered to me several times. They kept making me train new hire for the same pay. New hires made more than the trainer. After becoming supervisor pay was still pretty bad. Management sometimes were sexually inappropriate.
good,"Working at Panera could be fun sometimes, but often it felt very stressful because even if there was one guest in the store or pulling through the drive through managers would be pushing and yelling at everyone to move faster even if the guest's order was made on time."
good,"I have worked at this job for 4 to 5 years, I have had worked with about 3 or 4 general managers but I will say that I really enjoyed the job at first, sadly as the years went on the last GM I had there wasn't giving breaks when needed, wasn't letting people go at the times they had to, but all around very rude to good workers."
good,"I love everyone I work with, but it is almost impossible to get a raise. The employees that have been working at Panera for over a year/2 years like myself get paid less than new coming employees. Very unfair. Work hours can range from 30-50 hours a week. I have gotten extremely good at multitasking because of lack of employment at my Panera. I have great customer service skills because of this job. The only benefit the company provides is a 50% discount on one meal, only on the days you're working. Not great. On the plus side, they are very flexible with scheduling, and very friendly."
good,Good job for starting with a delivery job. Fairly simple and easy to get used to. Great managers at my local store and the cash payout that panera does is very nice.
good,"The work is not challenging on any level, unless it is your first job.  The hours are either very early or very late, which does not lend to having much family interaction."
good,Working at Panera bread was a great opportunity for me to gain experience such as cashier work and dealing  with customer service. I also learned a sense of responsibility and being on time and being dedicated to my job function.
good,"A great first job while in school, I learned a lot and even relocated from Kansas City, Mo. to Cedar Hill Tx with the company. Production was busy and I enjoyed the time that I worked there. Hard to move up within the company."
good,it was a good first job if your in high school. a good place to start saving some money up. managers were fair but I haven't worked there in a while..
good,"Parana was a place to work part time, while my kids were in school.  They were very flexible with my hours. and I enjoyed all of the employees.  Management was so-so  Very young"
good,Panera Bread is a fast work place environment with rush hours everyday of the week. Management is ok but needs to be more considerate of employees. Most enjoyable part of the job is making the customers happy.
good,"Not a bad entry level job, I got plenty of hours so my pay wasn't that bad. However, I feel that there was favoritism as there were employees that worked less hours than me and haven't been working as long as I have and received more raise opportunities. My co-workers were cool, though."
good,"The people were OK. The envirnment was good enough. The one manager couldn't get my name right for the first month or so, which was kind of annoying, but he eventually figured it out."
good,"For a part time job, they really give you the hours you need so you don't have to worry about not having enough hours in. Although, I enjoyed the time I had working at Panera, I felt that there was not much opportunity to get a raise (I asked one of my coworkers and she told me that she had been working there for a year now and she hasn't gotten a raise yet). Overall, great for people who are trying to find a job and are in need of cash quickly since they can employ you within two weeks of application."
good,"Working for Panera Bread was an experience. This place of work taught me many things about management. Mostly the necessary skills needed to be a supervisor. The most enjoyable part of my job was the interactions between the customers, my fellow staff members, and myself would have."
good,Work here was stressful and fast-paced due to the new location having a drive-thru. The turnover rate is very high and we were often understaffed. It wasn't a horrible job. Recommended job for high school or college students due to flexible hours.
good,"Depending on how the market is laid out you can have very good job security. Have one store about 30 mins+ from where majority of employees are and one baker for that store? that baker for that store will have very good job security. Bad news? There's only one baker for that one store no one wants to bake at so consistently being asked for 6 days in a row in common. There is a big lack of pay in my opinion. Getting paid under average for above average work doesn't go over very well. When that happens the question that pops up a lot is, ""Why bother going above and beyond when my managers don't care to appreciate me and pay better?"" Most enjoyable part of the job is baking quality product every night. But at the same time the managers don't want you staying past a certain time and racking up overtime. Most bakers are forced to sacrifice quality for speed. That isn't fair to the bakers because when it comes down to it who's buying the stuff we make? The customers. What looks better, a flaky golden brown pastry or a semi yellow flat pastry? That's one of the differences between a quality baker vs. a speed baker."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"A typical day at Panera Bread is fast-paced there are a lot of customers and a lot of orders you have to get out. I learned how to successfully make food, stock products, team player, and communicate with customers; The general manager is very understanding and an amazing woman she was an amazing manager for my first job some of the other managers aren't as nice. The hardest part of my job was being tasked for a new position and not being trained for it and being lectured about not doing my job correctly was very frustrating but the most enjoyable part was learning from my general manager in a very professional way and conversing with customers"
good,I was too young to actually understand the work environment. I barley worked  I was in highschool at the time. I think you should just try it out if you need a job.
good,I learn a lot of new thing the work culture could’ve been been but  at the end of the day working there was very nice and I enjoyed. In the customer is very appreciative over the customer service satisfaction
good,At times work was stressful but overall it wasn't hard to get through the day. Normally I worked in the dish pit but I occasionally would work the salad/sandwich line. I also replaced coffee pots and cleaned bathrooms and the main dining area.
good,"The job at Panera bread is decent, what you do is pretty easy but it can get very fast paced and stressful. The amount of work does not equal out to compensation, the management inside the stores is very good and well organized but the corporate people are very greedy and will hold off any raises for as long as possible(or until you quit)."
good,typical day is very fast and non stop. Ive grown as a person and a leader in my time there.  ive learned how to make decisions based on problems before they happen
good,"It was an excellent job to have as your first one. It provided many skills like cashier, dinning room experience, and a fast-paced environment. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with many orders when it was busy. Over time, I learned to work well with my team, and we accomplished our tasks."
good,"Good place to work, easy going people and helped build my communication skills in a work place. Learned how to use a cash register as it was my first job"
good,Enjoyable place to work with friendly people.  Easy positions. Great environment. friendly customers. Great food.  Management is knowable and helpful.
good,I need a job where I get hours. Get told how to get better not told only what I’m doing wrong then sent home because I would like to get better at what I’m doing not be put off then never get the chance to get better & not be able to provide for myself. Because I have bills to pay. I was just starting to work there so being slow must be understandable but they made me leave early due to it but I thought I was on pace.
good,It was easy but very fast paced. I thought during lunch rush it got really hectic and out of hand sometimes. But break fast was easy and calm. Dinner depended on the day.
good,Over all good environment for a part-time job. Not many chances to move up in the company. Workers are treated fairly well and they make sure to not skip breaks.
good,"Gained good experience as a first time baker, learned time management, and gained good customer service experience. Got to enjoy lots of delicious sweets."
good,"overall good place to work. Good management and team work is key. Its the food industry so its always busy but always a good atmosphere. Employees get there at 5 am to set up store including caterers. I worked as an associate, a manager, and as a caterer. So i got to see all aspects of the business. Panera sets high standards as far as appearance, keeping the place cozy and comfortable. Making customers happy is the best part of the job you never know if you were the reason someones day got better after being served by you with a smile on your face."
good,My bosses were really good to all the empoleys. It was super funtil and fast pasted. I loved getting to know my clients. I loved driving for them. All around a wonderful place to work.
good,typical restaurant setting. many different areas to be trained in. team growth dependent on good management and guidance. no off time discount--only while working.
good,"It was ok. Mangers were unprofessional at time, hours were not abundant, drama for the most part. Clean and organized. not much else to say except that it was an ok experience."
good,I enjoyed my co-workers and some of the manages. They were always very flexible with my schedule and for the most part my hours were consistent. anytime i needed to take off i received it. It was a very fast paces environment. I left because i was seeking higher pay.
good,"This job is very cut throat. My training there was horrible. I was on the floor within 3 days of training and I was not ready to be on my own. Since it was fast paced, I had to work even harder even though I didn't know the recipes."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Customer service.  Always working. Learn about health food. And how tp prep.  Meet interesting customer.  How to bake items.  Enjoy make people’s day when you help.
good,"Panera is great place for people to meet. I enjoy the no jerks policy they follow and how the place is suppose to be like home for its customers. I love working around all different types of food, sometimes it is a lot to take in. This being my second food service job I have learned a lot about Panera and the industry in just a years time."
good,I think Panera is an alright jobs for teenagers unless you plan on being in the corporate part it is a fast paced environment and at times very slow but a good job for starters.
good,"-interviewed, hired, trained and managed 50 plus people and various cafes in the St. Louis region."
good,I loved working there and the people I worked with. My manager wasn't understanding when it came to me needing a day or two off so I could complete my schoolwork. So I unfortunately had to leave because I was working nearly 7 days a week from 5am to 2 or 3 in the afternoon
good,"This is a decent, clean environment to work with moderately friendly coworkers and good management. Seasonal staff meetings keep team members up to date about new menu items and goals within the company."
good,"I've been with the company a little over 2 years now, and well, the company has changed since I first started. I use to look forward coming to work but now, I dread it. Our General Manager is amazing but the way they let their management team control everything, really is ungodly. It's literally a zoo. Managers to don't get along and can never agree on anything. It's just a miserable and stressful environment."
good,Great company taught me many things. Flexible in allowing you to develop. Care about their staff free food rewarding job nice to deal with customers and get to know them
good,Was a good stepping stone heading into full service. It's a really good job if you are a morning person as well. I just wasn't a fan of the operations aspect of the franchise I worked for.
good,"I worked at Panera when I was in high school so I closed almost every night, the tasks were overall pretty easy in the beginning. The hardest part was honestly dealing with rude customers, which for a 16-year-old can be pretty scary. Overall I never had any problems but I had to quit because of school."
good,"Panera is extremely busy and fast paced. I had to be at work at 5 am every morning and go to school until 9 pm, so it wasn't an ideal position for me."
good,"With the fast-paced environment, Panera is a great place to learn how to think on your feet. Sometimes the challenges felt impossible to overcome, but the other workers are encouraging and positive."
good,"i miss the people i used to work with. even the managers, no, especially the managers. they were good people. customers sucked a lot but what do you expect from a tourist trap?"
good,Panera bread is a good place to work good people good company and a stress free good customers great customer experience cash handling sales Great management good environment depends on area of work place
good,If they had more training then it would be a better work environment. I wasn't trained on two of the positions that they stuck me on. The atmosphere of the job was good.
good,"This job has it's pros and cons like any other job. I will say the people you work with are the most enjoyable aspect of the job in my opinion. My coworkers have kept me mostly sane. The pay is pretty good for the industry and Panera does offer a great benefit package if your eligible for it. Management however has not been that good. I've met some of the laziest, rude and most unprofessional managers ever at least at my store. They do not help you out when your in need of help and are not willing to be flexible with you but expect you to have a flexible schedule at all times. Definitely need a better training program for prospective managers!! Your coworkers are your lifeline! They will help you out and keep you laughing to work through the misery. I think Panera is a good company to work for but management definitely needs improvement!"
good,It was fun working there but there comes a time where you want to be a little more serious and that’s not the place for that. I advanced pretty quickly but that’s because I’m a hard worker.
good,Thanks for the opportunity to work there. Most of the staff was willing to help everyone and work together. Most of them were friendly and easy to work with.
good,"-cleaned tables, floors, bathrooms, and appliances"
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Great workplace ,Clean and also fast passed very enjoyable ENVIROMENT , Friendly , management was cool , I learn to be very organized and was able to expand my customer service skills"
good,"Managers were all very unprofessional, felt like I was the only one working most of the time, got paid little to nothing for the work I was doing compared to others, etc. Don't suggest working here"
good,Decent job for people new to the market. Early and late hours available. Good food but a very fast pace environment similar to a Mcdonald's etc. Wasn't my type of work place.
good,This was a great place to work. The management team was amazing and it was a family originated place to work. I was highly recommend this work place to anyone.
good,There could be times where it was hectic at times but everyone worked together and were team players. The staff there were very friendly and we all helped out wherever we could.
good,"I like Panera because they take on young people with zero experience, while most other retailers would not. They taught me the ropes and helped me when I needed it. I was typically the dishwasher because I was very fast. I was often done before everyone else at closing, which is highly unusual. They gave me the tools I needed in order to move forward with a different retail path. I learned how to work with people in a fast-paced environment. I would highly recommend working at Panera to an unexperienced young person looking for work!"
good,I am looking to utilize my AA degree.  They offer advancement and the ability to work more hours if applicable. They open at 6am where most hours are full time.
good,"Hardest part of the job is learning everything there is to know about your job, and for me that's what makes the job enjoyable. The most enjoyable part for me was some of the positive interactions with the customers when you give them their food or as they are waiting for the food."
good,"A typical day at work would be me opening the line or front of store as a cashier. In the morning it is stressful and you're mostly by yourself besides for an opening manager that sits in the office until opening the store. I usually don't take a break until the next person working comes in, and I am not offered any ten minute breaks by managers after working 8+ hours. The rush hours are usually the hardest part of the day."
good,"A typical day at Panera bread consisted of working your assigned role of the day (example: Cashier, making sandwiches) until your break or end of shift.  The guidelines and training are a good help to new hires and is set up to ease new hire into the swing of things. The pay was not anything special, and sometimes it felt like the work was not worth the pay. The environment of each cafe depends on store to store, but the busier cafes can often be a stressful place to work. Overall, it is not a bad job and something i would recommend ti high school and college students"
good,"Co workers werent really that friendly with one another, managers expected a lot out of someones first job. it helped me a alot with communication skills and customer service"
good,I loved working there. They had good people there nice managers just had to relocate. I love to work need money more than ever now. Having a baby soon
good,"Lead Cashier during breakfast rush and lunch rush"
good,overall my experience working for panera bread was generally good. I made great connections and friendships overtime. Management was always fun to work with.
good,"Overall the culture is good. But the company takes care of it's hourly associates more than its managers and also keeps changing the labor model so that each cafe gets less and less hours to spend to take care of customers, making managers into line cooks and labor savers"
good,Day shift is ok but night shift gets a little rough. They did teach me how to order product and how to run the store. The day shift was very fast paced so time went by fast
good,"hope they have gotten better. if company wants to grow mgr. need to communicate better with the empolyees. Panera was a good company, but the pay need to go up in charlotte, NC ."
good,"I love working at Panera Bread; it's a great company to work for with moderate promotions to the next level of the job. I learn how to communicate with individuals in a work force, and people understand me when communicating with different orders that come on the screen. The hardest part of the job is dealing with management, although they seem like they are diligent and communicative to the associates, they can still be strict and give lack of respect to associates in the work force area."
good,"For the most part working here was pretty good. Management was for the most part good although sometimes they weren't all that great, they would befriend employees and give them more hours. The job itself was fairly simple and easy it could get quite stressful during rushes, especially the Sunday lunch rush. Overall, working here was pretty enjoyable."
good,"I enjoyed my short time at Panera Bread, but I had applied, for the front counter position, where I would be serving customers. The assistant managers that wrote up the schedule would only allow me to work in the prep area, and in the kitchen.  I was having difficulty with my back and arms, and couldn't carry the heavy dishes, and bus pans."
good,I loved working here but the managers got too petty and childish. I will not stand for a company that condones childish behavior coming from somebody who is supposed to be your leader.
good,"worked here part time, it was a great place to work at. i mainly greeted customers brewed coffe and prepared salads and sandwiches. the highlight of my day was greeting customers"
good,Busy no matter what store you are at. Out of the four stores I have worked at across the country only one manager was worth staying for. Every store I worked at I felt like I was micro managed and had a constant running list of things to do. It kept me busy and I was never board. The co-workers are what really makes this place a good place to work. If I had my only good manager back I would have stayed all the way through college.
good,Panera bread was stressful and uninviting. I worked there for over a year and was never offered a raise or any recognition. I picked up the slack of the managers and the system was run horribly.
good,"panera bread itself is a good place to work. however management is not always the best, we’ve had some really good assistant managers over the 2 year with me working but its hard when the general manager doesnt help out the way the assistant managers do, i feel like at the end of the day every place is capable of being a really good place as long as management helps EVERYONE out. Not just the people that they choose to help along with not helping out with giving raises to people who need/ deserve it or promote people where the credit is due other than the same ONE person being promoted within 4 months which leads to favoritism and why people dont want to work at the store anymore"
good,This is a great first job to allow you to expose yourself to the work force. You are given a great deal of responsibility that you are able to handle with the proper support.
good,"basic soup, salad, and sandwich deli.  Promotes clean food busy lunches and catering.  management has high turn over and overall bad attitudes towards employees"
good,is a good starting job for anyone. college students mostly. if you are someone who has a family this job might now work for you unless you are management.
good,Too fast-paced and busy at times which is not worth the money. I was not given adequate instructions when given an order and there are too many tasks to keep up with.
good,Management is cool and understanding. A typical day at work can be stressful or easy going depending on who your coworkers are.  Everyone there is super friendly.
good,"good place to work for high school or part time college students."
good,Overall this was a good place to work. Challenges are the hours kept and keeping a full staff of employees ready to perform when asked. Great place to work to hone your skill as a restaurant manager.
good,"Basic foodservice position. Generally has a drive-through role, front-register, food prep, overnight cook positions. Decent job that goes up a corporate management ladder."
good,it is definitely fast paced. to work the line takes memory and repetition to build up speed and skill. BUT it is also fun and has slow times too. It was a fun job.
good,"With the exception of meal-time rushes, Panera Bread is relatively easy going and professional. Might depend on actual location of restaurant, though."
good,"I've worked with a friend, and have been in touch with employees from other cafes who all had a lot of problems with the management and poor scheduling. It takes the ability to be flexible and be ready to constantly take on new tasks. I enjoyed the work itself, but the management and the system need to be improved."
good,Panera Bread is good for a temporary job to get on your feet while still looking for other employment opportunities. Management is not exactly professional.
good,"a nice relaxed environment, free of stress and friendly guests and management, if youre looking for a jumpstart into your career panera bread is a great place to start"
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,The only problems with panera are the customers and the prices. The people that work there are mostly nice and cool to work with. As for company wise it is ran in a way that i can only call... dysfunctional
good,Decent place to work managers seem to get replace often and some times things are a bit crazy but it wasn't a bad job. Only wish that they had a bit more care for their employees at times
good,This job was adequate. It fit my needs and gave me cash when I needed it. Another job that I would recommend to high school kids and young college students.
good,"Working at the Panera in Pooler, Ga was great. The employees all the way up to management was great. The work can be tedious at times, but at the end of the day, it was all worth while."
good,"Working here is pretty relaxed, except during the lunch or dinner rush. Co workers are easy to get along with. Not too bad for a first job, money and hours are decent."
good,the job was as explained during the interview. the hours were tough (night) and it was brutal. if you are willing to sleep during the day then it will be fine
good,very good company management was great and friendly and flexible very willing to work with your schedule and i liked what because this was my second job in high school
good,"Nice first job to work at instead of somewhere like McDonalds, i enjoyed my time spent there, they were very flexible with my scheduled including that i was a senior in highschool and needed days off"
good,My jobe at Panera was a good one. I like the atmosphere and the people who both go to and work at Panera. My starting Salary is minimum wage. My hours got cut so now I only work three days a week at most.
good,It was okay. Best part about the job is the food you get to eat on your lunch break and the 50% discount they give you. They have coffee so I guess that's also a plus.
good,"Working at Panera is a good job for college students. It has flexible hours and the employees are friendly. The customers there can sometimes be a hassle, but managers are good at making sure you as an employee are taken care of."
good,"It was a good place to start out, but not something I could stand much longer. The demand was always higher than the supply of product we had, which caused us to get bad rep and angry customers fairly often. Corporate wouldn't listen to our input on things that needed changed, and the communication was poor. Hard workers were never praised, and underpaid which ultimately made me leave this company."
good,I loved working at Panera! You constantly had something to do and the people I worked with were great! Though I left because the store manager was awful. She treated her employees like they weren't important. I have to say we as the employees loved treating people with care.
good,"I was not at this location for a long time, but I did enjoy my time there. As long as you do your job properly, there are no bumps along the way. Management was awesome while I was there."
good,Panera was a really relaxed pace but I think some people should of got paid more  and I really liked the food there and it also a good place to have a interview at
good,"Working there was fun, but they were always strict and didnt know how to run a store keeping employees there for hours trying to figure out how to cash out the register"
good,"Pay was to little for all the work that is done, managers were slightly lazy. Directions were always unclear and not everyone knew them. Not equipped with enough staff."
good,Panera is a quick paced job that if you are not moving 100% all of the time your opportunity for advancement will be gone. Pay is low and jobs are for mainly for kids out of high school.
good,"Just don’t stand around, always look busy, always in fake mode, super cheery, outgoing, friendly, if u can’t manage to do these things stay away from Panera."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Working during the breakfast rush and lunch rush can become extremely stressful as the cafe gets extremely busy. It is never boring and there is always something to do.
good,Usually a rush during lunch time.  Any day it can range from being very slow to very fast paced. I learned to have patience for customers and be optimistic about the work day. Hardest part of the job is staying motivated throughout the day.
good,Overall this was a good starter job for people who didnt have any experience. But as i tried to transfer to another Panera. They failed to communicate
good,NEE MANAGER at the Rensselaer Location is a pervert( has young girls sitting on his lap in the office) and lies about employees so he doesn't get in trouble for firing them illegally and also so he doesnt have to pay for unemployment. The only thing that saved me so I could still receive my unemployment benefits was the numerous Emails and text messages I had from management.
good,"I don't have a lot of trust in the management, especially when it comes to payroll. Payroll deductions haven't been fully explained and the policies regarding correct uniform standards are not always applied."
good,If you were second shift like me then you would come back to dishes piled up and eveything left a mess from the previous shift. So you'd start off behind as dishes would keep coming back as you worked.
good,"Although the job was not miserable, it wasn't great either. There was great employee culture but the job itself was not the best. It was constantly under-staffed so the employees were extremely busy all day, managers didn't really care about employees, most of the employees were very lazy."
good,"This is a good place to work if you are just getting into the work force. It allows you to do the job that no one else really wants to do, but in the end it makes you a stronger individual"
good,Panera Bread was my first job. My starting pay was $9 and my final pay rate was $9.40. I was working there for a year and half. I really enjoyed the atmosphere of Panera. My coworkers were great and I got along with my managers. I eventually left because my pay rate. I was told over and over that I would be evaluated for raise but they always pushed it back. There were new employees that were getting paid more than me and it was unfair when I was certified on numerous things.
good,"I learned a lot about the company and the business. It taught me a lot of customer service skills and how to work on a team. Although we were hired for certain roles, they really encourage cross training so that you know more than one area of the business."
good,"I was not told the truth during my hiring interview, but I like almost all the people who work there, and if before you hired me, you wanted to check with the current general manager, or even the district manager, or even the franchise owner, I think the would tell you that I am well liked and amazing with customers (which is why they put me in my current position)."
good,"The hours can be rough, cut into life a lot. There is a lack of management involvement, which though is nice in some respects, also means that abdication of responsibility is practically nil. The high need for bakers means that workers who would otherwise be let go or never hired, remain on staff or are given jobs."
good,The job was fine for a college student looking to make some extra cash on the side as a summer gig. It is a fast paced work environment as all restaurant chains are
good,Panera is a great place to work it's just that the management there is not the best. They want things their way and not the way the store is supposed to run. They do not pay enough for the amount of work people do. They are biased for who works and who doesn't work.
good,I learned cleaning techniques and social skills on how to talk promptly and fast with our guest. THE COOLEST MANAGERS. Helped me understand business more.
good,Take customers orders to them in a timely fashion. You also bring people's foods to their tables after they order their food if they decide to sit in the store.
good,I love the people I work with but the hours they give are either too little or not enough and written up for small little things that shouldn't matter but overall the customers are to the most part great even though some can be quite childish and impatient it's a place everyone can go to study and relax and pay lots of money for some good healthy over priced food
good,panera was okay. there's room for growth here and there but only if the upper management likes you. the only issue was the amount of responsibilites and tasks they tried to push on us for minimun wage.
good,"At Panera Bread, my schedule was a little all over the place, and I personally switched positions very frequently, but not to a jarring degree. Most associates worked their one position with relatively consistent schedules. Most of the time, things ran smoothly, but some inconsistencies with management and corporate made things confusing. I would say there was a work-family environment, mostly. I became close with most of my coworkers within professional limits. I didn't have much problem with most things aside from the occasional miscommunication between manager and associate. I most enjoyed the people I worked with, and the flexibility of the shifts system."
good,"Overall, my experience could of been better.  I should of had prior experience before working at Panera. Coworkers weren't the greatest. I liked the benefits of 50% off food."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"The job wasn't hard but it was repetitive and boring. If that's what you are looking for I say go ahead and apply. But if you want a social life, I wouldn't recommend it."
good,"You let premade dough rise then bake it off while prepping other premade doughs for the night baker.  Occasionaly baking off cookies or pastries as needed."
good,"Panera is a great first job that teaches you a lot about customer service. Every Panera is different, it is a very fast paced environment  that will teach you to have patience."
good,"This was my first job so I don't have much to say since I was inexperienced, but the time I was there it was pretty laid back, and I enjoyed it. My only issue were the hours I was receiving."
good,"not a bad job, just wasnt the job for me"
good,"Good company, bad location"
good,"Serving and greeting guests, and traveling as the caterer was a great fast paced life. But the hours were not family oriented. And the distance I traveled, made the step out of catering and into management a serious financial strain. It was a fun job though. Had I livid in Tyler, I may not have left."
good,"Promises of advancement that never come, changes never made, etc. A lot of responsibility is put on the people that put their head down and run the store. They are told they will get a raise for doing their job better than those around them, helping customers, going to positions they aren't scheduled to be in, really going above and beyond. After working here, I do love it, but now I am skeptical of everything I am told, especially in the work place. I don't know; I expected to move up in the company eventually to corporate, but in the years I have been there, the store and overall culture has really changed. The company went from value-based to keeping-our-stockholders-rich-based. Maybe it's the buyout that changed the store... maybe it's just the store I work at. Who knows. I like the company overall and think the management means best, but a lot can change."
good,"I do not get paid what I am worth. Its a great job for teenagers who need a first job, but not for adults with real bills. the wages isn't worth the stress most times"
good,"The job is not so bad as long as you have a partner to work with. Unfortunately, it is hard to keep employees long term due to the overnight hours, physical stress on the body and the low pay. A lot of times you will be working alone which means a longer shift for you."
good,"You definitely deal with a lot of crazy rude customers. You do a lot during the shift. During rush hours the line is nearly out the door and you are stuck behind the register ringing orders for a solid 2 hours. It can get intense, but working with the right people can make it fun. If you close, you'll always leave late. Opening is fun because it's more relaxed and easy."
good,very fast paced. time management is a need here. almost all the day time managers and associates are amazing people to work with. If you like fast working and by yourself the overnight position would be perfect for you
good,Most shifts are around 9 hours long. The job is stressful during breakfast and lunch rushes.The most enjoyable part of the job was making friends with my fellow employees.
good,"Everyone has a job to do, with multiple responsibilities. its a busy atmosphere where working together is key, making proper call outs can lead to food and dishes being dropped or spilled, and we make our own baked goods and beverages so you have to be mindful of timing."
good,Not a bad job just need something more challenging for me. Just following recipes and what ever the line people need made. Can be a bit slow and repetitive
good,I havent work at this company in so long i dont even remember why i left. Probably pay related or another job offer or something. But the fact of the matter is i cant even give a review of this place if i wanted to because i dont know how the place operates npw from the time ive felt till now. Last time i stopped in for something to eat i didnt see a single face i knew.
good,"This is a great part-time job. It helped me to pay for things I needed/ wanted while in high school. The management when I started was not the best but right before I left they hired someone new, who cared for the employees more."
good,"A typical day includes cleaning the bakery before the production of the day begins, taking count of pastries and breads out on the floor, panning, proofing and baking various doughs, and cleaning equipment and bakery after the day of production."
good,"In my time, a lot of managers have left, and I’ve heard a lot of people plan to do the same. None of the employees are super happy to work there there is a lot of butting heads, but if you just focus on yourself it’s a good job."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"typical restaurant job, good management, staff is sometimes hard to get along with, washing dishes is one of the downfalls but if you like dishes you'll be fine"
good,"I worked in two different Paneras. The first was horribly managed. The teenager crew essentially ran it and I was not trained in my job properly. There were several issues with gossip and rumors. When I switched to a different Panera, I was retrained when they realized I was not doing things according to policy. The overall environment was better, but several of the managers were very stressed and took it out on the crew. Outside of the people, I greatly enjoyed the work and had no issues with the job."
good,"Very Fast paced; they offer benefits; must have a lot of knowledge about the food industry; team meetings, and online classes to complete; they offer bonuses as well as raises after years"
good,"I think that this is a very tedious job, and you have to be ready to work hard and at a fast pace. The associates are overall very nice and they are very helpful."
good,"Panera does not treat their employees well. It was a good first job, but it is definitely not a place I want to work at forever. I worked there starting at age 16 as a sophomore in high school."
good,"Panera is a great place to learn customer service, teamwork, and evolve your communication skills. As their an essential part to everyone in the cafe regardless of your position."
good,"i worked there for a week. "
good,I worked there seven years ago right out of high school and it was my first job. The people I worked with aren't there anymore but they were nice to work with.
good,"A wonderful location with great coworkers, a fast-paced work environment with poor management, a wonderful company to work for with amazing co-workers, great training programs and amazing family-like atmosphere between the workers."
good,"The other staff was respectful and were really nice and helped me get started there, it's was an interesting experience and will help me through other jobs."
good,"A typical day as a trainer would be entering the facility and begin working at the barista, getting everything ready I need for the day. This includes restocking anything that wasn't stocked the previous night. Because I am cross-trained in every position, they have me float to where I am needed. Like today, they asked me to do one task, and a few minutes later, I multi-tasked between that and breakfast sandwiches. I continued to float wherever needed, including the cash register, delivering food to tables, and anything in the back of the house."
good,"typical day"
good,I really enjoyed working here when I first started and learning how to bake and make new things but as soon as you are done with training (3-4mobths) they throw you out in the water with no life jacket. It doesn’t matter how much I SOS it seems as if there was no avail. Most times I worked by myself even if the bake load is double what you are used to. If you do ever have someone come and help you they all normally do different things because each site is different so no one is on the same page. Most times the equipment did not work properly or was completely broken so it makes the job harder. You definitely have to have the right shoes and get your rest or you will be sore because you are on your feet ALL night. And the times where you work alone you have to time your bathroom breaks with the oven so you don’t burn anything LOL! And if anything is ever not  “perfect” when your boss checks they will dump it in the garbage in your face and tell you to redo all over again.
good,"Be prepared to not be trained but still disciplined for doing your job incorrectly. Fast turnover, you don't get to learn names half the time before they disappear. Management is never on the same page about anything and the GM is unapproachable."
good,Stressful and disorganized. Management was never very helpful. Women were usually paid less then men. Chaotic atmosphere. They had a large amount of turnover. Staff was treated poorly
good,Pays decent a lot of work and pettiness but I had a good boss and so it wasn't too bad. Flexible and reasonable. Overnight isn't too bad your mainly by yourself for better or worse.
good,"Interacted with customers to ensure satisfaction with food and service. Guided patrons through menus while demonstrating thorough knowledge of food, beverages and ingredients.  Trained new associates on procedures, customer service, sales techniques, proper use of equipment, food handling and portion sizing."
good,I had a great time working in Panera Bread. My hours were good and also my pay. What I enjoyed the most about working there was getting the chance to meet new people everyday and working in the field that i love.
good,Low base pay and little room for advancement. Kiosks are taking away the cashier's MAIN job leaving them to be kicked to the curb. I would not recommend any of my peers to work here.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"The people were great and the atmosphere was amazing and the guests, were for the most part great.  It gets pretty busy around 11-2 depending on the day and what event is going on that week."
good,"I worked in the drive thru for over a year. I worked in the morning when it was really busy. This position was fast paced and challenging but with the right co workers, it can be fun."
good,"Honestly, its an okay place to work when you're not constantly understaffed and your gm lets you change your availability. that didnt happen for me though."
good,"At Panera Bread I found that the work place was often understaffed. It left me to do most of the work. In addition to the lack of staff, the employees hired were often young high school kids that often called out. The job is easy when everyone does their jobs, but it was rare when that occurred."
good,"While I was working here, I worked as a dining room attendant. I would clean the front dining area and bus dishes in the back. For a short period of time they trained me how to make sandwiches, but I was often left on my own. I believe that sometimes that helps you learn, but in this situation it wasn't very professional and I shouldn't have been left on my own when I was just starting out. When I told them I didn't want to do production anymore they said it was no hassle and they would train me for another position, so they're very flexible with that. The hardest part of the job was being on production line because you have a certain amount of time to make the food and if you mess up you have to do it all over again and it costs you time. But the most enjoyable part for me personally was being in the back by myself washing dishes because I could listen to my own music and just focus on one thing."
good,"Generally, the atmosphere at Panera was relaxed until it became lunch or dinner time. My coworkers were all nice people and easy to get along with. The main issue was the work schedule. Hours were not consistent and the breaks I received were too long to be considered lunch breaks. Even though notice was given beforehand concerning events that conflicted with work, I was still scheduled. It was also difficult to find someone willing to take your shift. There is a good employee discount and one can expect things to be easy-going."
good,"was up for promotion, then less than a month later I was informed that the company had sold our facility and I would need to relocate or find a new job. After that everything went to the crapper. People stopped showing up, stopped caring about their job, and management didn't seem to mind."
good,The fact I left Starbucks for Panera Bread says a lot. Panera Bread and the workers within has became more of a family to me and unfortunately I have to leave for better pay.
good,"It was managed poorly, needed more staff, not paid enough, wasn't trained properly at the job, managers were lazy, not all the staff worked at their full potential,"
good,"the management is unprofessional. creepy coworkers, managers do nothing about coworker disputes, low pay for hours, inconsistent hours and management."
good,Panera bread was very fast paced and was truly a team effort to effectively complete the day.  you bounce around multiple different jobs to help out and make the day flow.
good,a sandwhich cafe that shows you a slideshow of bread baking while classical music plays and then you get hired and go to work and serve the bread to people
good,"The only reason that I worked here so long was because I loved my coworkers and managers/supervisors. Other than, the days were long and boring and fast-paced."
good,"I liked working there, just never given enough hours. They hire large amount of people to fill one spot, when they could hire one great employee to take the hours. companies fault not stores."
good,I enjoyed my experience at Panera Bread because my dream job at the time was to own my own bakery where I specialized in pastries. The downside however is that I usually was scheduled to work solo or with one other person. I enjoy interacting with others.
good,"Good place to work in high school as a first job, would not recommend if you are looking for full time employment. Few benefits, low pay, but some opportunity for advancement."
good,a fast food place that is tring not to be a fast food resturant. good food but poor quilty. needs much approvment in all mangement. lack of care of employee benfits
good,"Rather liked my job there. However, the managers always participated and passively encouraged gossip, which destroyed any attempts at creating a cooperative atmosphere. I'd recommend some leadership classes. The managers rarely helped out during rushes, which was what they were supposed to do. They would hire constantly, even while current employees were fighting to get more hours. The night crew were the best to work with."
good,Working at Panera Bread was very stressful and tiring. Some co workers were very nasty and rude. Not many breaks available during a shift. Although I had received the job through an old friend who worked there I honestly regret working there.
good,well structured well organized business with a clear way of doing everything. treats employees well and works with people who want to better themselves.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Upper Management should adhere to company policies, as well as back your mangers with decision making. Don't undermine mangers with with great work ethic because you feel threatened by their strengths. This company has great core values just lacks Leadership to follow it to the next level in sales volume. I enjoyed working with my staff and guest on a day to day basis. Just lacked the support from the General Manger. Long work hours make work life balance a major struggle. Drug testing should be required by all managers."
good,"I am a people person and I have a lot of experience working as a sales associate.  I have worked on a cash register for 8 years or more and can multi task by answering the phone, selling items, talking to customers and working at a fast pace.  I enjoy working with team members and the public.  I am strong, lift heavy objects, stand for long periods at a time. I can work under pressure and very dependable on a daily basis."
good,"Decent pay and good training opportunities, but don't make the mistake of saying you're available ""all of the time"".  You'll get stuck on closing shifts every night, usually cleaning line by yourself until 1-2 hours past your scheduled shift."
good,"Once you have moved up within the cafe - there is little to no room to move up with in the company.  Panera is a great company - just no room to move up at the moment. "
good,"Take orders, take payments, clean dining room, clean restrooms, dishes. Most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with up front, most were helpful and friendly."
good,"I would say panera is a great starter job for anyone fresh out of high school or anyone still in school. It's not a job that's really meant for older more experienced workers. The pay is okay but not as accurate as it should be, however the job is a fun place to work and a great way to build customer/worker relationships."
good,I wish I could grow my hair out but they make you cut it and also shave and no bug tattoos or piercings and such. But other than that the company is fine.
good,walk in and sign in then do the cashier and stuff then make sandwiches for people who are ungrateful in this very fast paced environment this is an okay first job.
good,"Low Pay, but at least you get to see and learn new things about your city. Though the wearing out of your car is an absolute minus. Just doesn't lend it self to be a long term thing."
good,"the management i had was very good, they listen to you and would help you in anything that you needed if you didnt understand something. they worked with you side by side."
good,"Productive and fun place to work, really quite and a steady work flow. I have work at this place for over year and the work load can vary depending on the group you are working with.."
good,"Panera Bread is good workplace to start at."
good,"Panera Bread is a great first job, staff was very friendly and great to be around. My priority at the time was the dining room area my duty was to take care of dishes, brew coffee every hour, fill the ice machine and sweep."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job are the customers, the day starts with clocking into the driving program and checking in with management to find out what your delivery that day (catering or retail). when finishing driving cash out and when driving do jobs of trash, dishes, prep or anything else to prepare for the next shift to come into a good environment."
good,"Workplace culture was good, more of a younger staff compared to my other jobs. Most enjoyable part of the job was getting a discount at the baakery. Thats the best"
good,I enjoyed working at Panera but the hours were very inconsistent. I was constantly given opening shift which required getting up at 3:30am all week long. I asked for a couple later shifts a week and was not given them. It just was not working out.
good,"Takes a while for you to move up or get a pay raise."
good,I'm am currently an associate at Panera bread and my experience has been alright. The management needs some work! ALOT OF WORK. Too many call outs too
good,It was okay work environment fast pace food was good people were all right management was poor advancement were poor money was okay ours was okay just wish the management was different
good,"A typical day at work was pretty busy for the most part. I learned how to work in a very fast-paced environment. Management was okay, but not what I wanted to work for. Most of my co workers were good to work with, but some of them weren't as focused as they should have been. The hardest part of this job was having to work in a fast paced environment when I was first introduced to it, and not used to it. I did enjoy learning how to deal with a workplace that is fast-paced."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"I worked as a cashier, so I had to work with customers mostly. This could be really great sometimes, but it could also end up being really terrible if rude customers come to the restaurant. The coworkers were great to work with. At my location there was a family type environment that grew between workers. The schedule was often an issue with it not being available on time, or poor scheduling of hours. I learned a lot from this job, especially as it being my first proper job. It's a pretty good place to work if you are looking for a part-time job."
good,Panera bread is a fun place to work with a lot of staff. There is a lot going on and you learn how to do a lot of different things. It is a good first time job.
good,Working at Panera Bread is horrible the management doesn't really care about the workers. When its busy the managers get stressed out an it makes the job hard.
good,"A lot of tasks to do throughout the day, busy, hard-working, quick-paced environment. Always someone watching, trainer or manager. All workers are on top of their case, there is always something to do."
good,"Honestly I enjoyed the job,until my managers screwed up my scheduling. The company is lovely, with healthy food,and a wonderful bi-lingual crew. It was sad when I had to quit."
good,"Personal experience will vary based on individual management and team members. I have worked at multiple locations and all cafes have had their pros and cons. It is a great place to work for a first job or as a teenager, but too many hours and too little compensation for management positions."
good,"nice place to work while you are in HS, very fast paced place. pay is not that well if you are looking for a long term career. I haven't worked there since 2014, i'm sure much has changed"
good,"I was working at NC, I learned how to work with a great team. The job was pretty nice sometimes a little stressful. The managers there were always nice to us."
good,"Was not the environment I preferred, but the hours were consistent and the pay was decent. They are willing to cross train in different areas of the restaurant."
good,"A day on the line requires patience, I went above and beyond at Panera. Hardest part of the job was coming in when someone called out. I love the food"
good,"Panera has such a good product -- 100% clean!  Unfortunately, the hourly pay is so low that the only people who apply are high school students.  And, high school student just are not mature enough to fit the Panera 'reputation'."
good,"The only thing I truly love about my job is probably how well I get along with my coworkers and the discount that the company provides us with food. But other than that, the job is highly stressful and forced to be quick paced. Panera has extremely high standards for its stores and some of these standards are not realistic for the goals they are trying to achieve. Especially since we are under new management, I cannot stand the way that my coworkers and I have been treated. All our DM and new GM can seem to do is point all of the negatives instead of praising us for the positive things done."
good,"Okay environment for high schoolers, if you are needing part time work this is the place, or if youre on a strict budget this is a good place to work and get fed."
good,"While the environment and culture was friendly and accommodative, daily operations of my department could be very inconsistent where unexpected incidences could lead to four of five hours of overtime."
good,You must stay alert and work quickly preparing food and taking care of the dining room area. Mostly high school and college kids working there so the atmosphere is younger but energetic and willing to learn. Turnover is average as it is a part-time job for may while they are in school. Food is delicious and discounts are nice. Management tends to be helpful and knowledgable.
good,Every day I worked was always a good one. The atmosphere was great and welcoming. I would work here again in a heart beat if the pay was increased. Being a manager was fun
good,"I did a lot there but it went unnoticed, i had one manager who was my favorite and i miss working with him. he was like my second father..I met so many new people and learned a lot from them"
good,"Panera was a fine place to work during school, they provided good training hours and an easy work place. The work environment can be crazy but a good place to work."
good,"As a third shift position was good started out as five 8 hour shifts per week and changed to four 10's the job was enjoyable. Only worked with one other person at night and saw the rest of the staff for an hour or two at the end of my shift. I enjoy baking so it was interesting to learn all the different breads and cookies pastries etc and at the end of every shift you get $10 worth of food to try so as to know what everything should taste like and breakfast. The company has great benefits health, dental, vision, 401k, etc and i liked the job a lot but the direct manager I had was very poor at his job and treated both me the other night baker and the molder poorly."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"It may just be that Dallas market, but working as a night baker hard work with very little support, for too little pay. They are very understaffed at the moment and that is the primary reasons for the current working conditions."
good,this is a cutthroat company. Beware. The managers do not work well with employess and the communication level is poor. One of the worst companies I have ever worked for. Beware!
good,I enjoyed my time working at Panera Bread. Its a great company very flexible with your schedule if your in school. Easy Job. Great Company to work for.
good,"long nights till the morning its good if your a night person and enjoy these type of shifts. basically you bake all type of pastries such as cookies brownies, bear claws, scones, bread and etc."
good,CO workers are the only good thing about working here. The discount they give is not very good and you have to be working that day to get it. It is very fast paced (a whole order in 3 minutes or less). Long hours.
good,"Very easy in regards to work day, simple as far as learning what to do and how to do it. Cons include pay, which is why paneras always lose people including managers, and the customers are full of themselves, complain about everything imaginable."
good,manager didnt belive that i was always sick because of my health issues and i had cancer so that wasnt cool. besides that it was a pretty normal job. everyone genuinely did every title.
good,"opening bakery and line, communicating with others, making new friends, good benefits once you work a year or more. fast paced, usually busy, building relationships with customers"
good,"The summer I resigned my managers hired 7 new employees. Our branch was super slow during the summer because all the students leave. So there were no hours. My friend and I would get scheduled for 3 and 4-hour shifts and I felt it was pointless for me to continue working there. It wasn't smart what management did but that may have just been my store. Other than that co workers are always so much fun, the hardest part is probably closing because it's so much to do."
good,"If you work well and don't complain, they give you plenty of hours as well as your choice of job. You can be promoted to trainer as well if you work well."
good,The work isn't extremely hard there I just feel as though if many other know fast food companies such as McDonald's White Castle and Chipotle can pay there workers. Panera Bread is definitely able to pay there workers the right amount we should receive.
good,Nice people to work with who were very professional. The staff were eager to help and eager to train. The positions offered benefits to full time employees.
good,It was okay. The management was a little disorganized and hard to keep good employees. Scheduling was good. They were flexible and hire felons. Overall I liked it.
good,Food is fresh. The associates are quite the team players. We work our butts off to make our guests happy and pleased. And we always let the guests leave happy.
good,"Panera Bread was a very good first job because it taught me a lot of things that I currently used for my current jobs such as responsibility, hard work, and costumer service."
good,"I enjoyed working with certain managers and fellow cashiers in the front but overall I couldn't wait to leave. It was a hectic place and some of my coworkers and managers would take it out on you as a fellow employee. The clientele was also not my cup of tea, I felt talked down to at times when I'm just trying to work. I had good times but the bad outweighed the good so I had to quit."
good,"It is a fast pace environment. Management can either be great or they are very bad, some even work while on the influence of illegal substances. the hardest part of the job was lack of advancement and dealing with poor management."
good,I think it is good to have a first job at a strict corporate establishment because it gives you the discipline necessary for all future jobs and i have valued this experience
good,"assembling different food orders, preparing all types of salads, sandwiches, panini sandwiches. this job was fun for me I was able to jump right in and make customers day by preparing their food with tender love and care. I took a lot of pride into making sure customers were satisfied."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Overall not a very good company to work for if you want benefits. No paid vacation or sick days even for shift leaders. Highly physical environment and can be stressful at times.
good,"Great for first jobs to learn how to gain work ethics and have good opportunities. flexiable  hours, good for high school kids looking for a part time job."
good,very good work environment. customers were stressful but overall good. My days were very long. Management wasn't very put together. I loved the reduced food price and my co workers were very nice.
good,During lunch hours this place is really busy.  The management likes to combine a lot of positions instead of giving each section its own person. They are really strict on hours.
good,It's good. The place in Grand Blanc is relaxed and homey. The staff is nice and accommodating. They go out of their way to make sure you have a good time.
good,Well... think panera bread is a good places to start off at if you haven't worked before. All of the coworkers are nice and you will get along with them fine.
good,It was a fun time to work with coworkers although it could be stressful due to it being understaffed. Closing could also be stressful because it took several hours causing people to not go home until after 11.
good,"People are nice but its hard, high-pressure work. There is potential for growth. If you can work early hours then they would like you. The staff are nice and makes working there worth it."
good,The only thing going for the Keizer station Panera Bread is the people. If it weren't for the people there I'm sure many other would have jumped ship a long time ago.
good,Panera had fun people to work with and sweet customers. It was very interactive and cool. I loved getting to know the people I worked with and the customers.
good,"Overall, my general review would be higher if I hadn't encountered situations where I saw discrimination on the basis of myself being a trans woman. "
good,I am a cashier at Panera and my job is relatively easy. As a cashier you are in charge of taking the customers orders and keeping your workspace organized.
good,"A typical day at work was okay depending on who worked shifts that day. I learned how to manage money, greet others with a great attitude no matter how I felt that day and to put work first in the working environment.The most enjoyable part of the job was having work relationships with returning customers to make them feel more comfortable."
good,A typical day at Panera can vary depending on how you can deal with the customers. Panera bread is not a bad place to work because you can relate with the other workers there because they are mostly teenagers if you are in their age group.
good,It was okay. The management was terrible and cheated me on pay check. food and customers were great and had  good time working there with my co workers
good,worked there for a year and moved up quickly to team lead. Its cool that they allow you to try all the food. They make it hard to move past that. As in any food service the lunch and dinner rushes were brutal. But that is to be expected. management was not too terrible. It was good for a part-time job while i was in college
good,"I enjoy working at Panera Bread mostly because of the other employees that I work with.  My co-workers are all friendly and easy to get along with.  The main issue I have working here is the way the schedule is made.  The schedule is not put up until the day before so you do not know if you have to work Wednesday until Tuesday afternoon.  Also, if you do not work Tuesday you have to get someone who is working to send you the schedule or call up there to ask when you work and hope they answer the phone."
good,"Great job for Teenager or semi-retired can be a fantastic opportunity for those interested in management advancement "
good,A typical day at Panera Bread involves ensuring cleanliness of the restaurant and making sure everything is up to standards. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know the customers and them getting to know you.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"This was my first job ever, I liked that the customers that came in were very nice to me and would have some conversations with me. Unless the boss likes you, the job is going to be difficult."
good,Enjoy working with the public and getting to know my regular customers. Training different associate and always learning everyday. Management needs some work.
good,"Panera is a great place to work at when you are a student. The are wiling to work with your schedule and can be very flexible, they pay is good for someone in high school."
good,Panera is the worst place to ever work. They take advantage of the workers and we get paid little to nothing for all of our hard work!! I would suggest not to work here!
good,"Busy environment with NO help from shift leaders. We are always understaffed. Supervisors do what they want.(sit in the office doing ""work""). One time the supervisor was on facetime instead of helping send people to break."
good,"Typically a very stressful environment, tensions are high. attitudes are high. being patient is a must. Always a family feeling but higher ups tend to not understand."
good,In the end I met some good people and learned a lot in the food/restraunt buisness but scheduling made it one of the most uncomfortable and frustrating place to work.
good,"It was an extremely busy location and very hard to keep up with the demand of the product at times, also the equipment was lacking to get the job done correctly and in a timely fashion. Management was poor."
good,I typically enjoyed working there and getting to know the people I came across. It was a friendly enviornment and I learned the leadership role from them and taking things into my own hands rather then asking another manager for help. The hardest part was remembering all of the admin stuff and I second guessed myself due to making sure I got it right on the computer because I could not undo it once it was put in. Overall it was a good setting to work in but it definitely was stressfull at times.
good,"I worked there for a long period of time and they seem to work there managers a lot harder than what is in their job description which causes a turn around rate. Also, the overtime granted to the managers there are strenuous and exhausting, very hard to maintain stress levels in an environment like Panera Bread."
good,Excelente ambiente de trabajo con gente propositiva y joven
good,I liked working at the store in Ohio. People were friendly and the people that worked there were too. We didn't have enough people to do what was needed so we all were doing double time then we started making mistakes.  It is very hard to get the store ready and keep the customers happy. It would take some extra time to run properly. I learned how to set up the bakery. I also learned how to prep for the line for the next day. I learned how to do cashieering and keep up with changing the coffees every hour.
good,"I've worked at several fast food places, and Panera is one of the best to work at. They pay well, and the discount on the food is great. The quality of the job depends on how much you put into it, and the management at the restaurant you're applying to."
good,"My typical day was washing off tables, picking up dishes, and spending the rest of the night doing dishes and heating up soups, I was there for three months and never got register training or training on soups and salads after I expressed interest."
good,"The best days are for when there is inclement weather. You tend to get paid $8 an hour in the cafe, $5 on the road plus $.30-ish a mile and you don't share tips. On good days you could walk away with around $50 or more if you aren't there all day. On bad days, you'll be lucky to get $20 and you'll ask yourself why the managers called you in. Weekdays around noon are the best whereas weekends usually aren't great. In the cafe you learn about prep, keeping the dining area clean and running the food to customers."
good,"meeting new people was cool, the food was good, it got really stressful at times, the pay was really good as well. helping customers as well was nice."
good,its a very fast pace you stay busy everything that you learn you have to take a computer course for so you have to know a little about computers and doing that it show you how to prepare any item in the store befor you do it
good,Working here was great. Employees created a healthy environment but the general manager had a terrible attitude which in turn created some unhealthy struggles during a days work.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,This job for me was actually helpful because it was a faced paced workplace and it helps you to be on your feet and alert due to the fast work place that it requires.
good,At first the job was a really good job the pay was good and the work wasnt labor intesive and the culture was really good and over time thing became worse the work became way harder no benefits and you had to do multiple peoples jobs at once becasue some employees slacked off.
good,"Deliver 2-3 times an hour. Get a tip of $1 to $3 per delivery. You're netting around $12. Reimbursed for gas same day. that's good.But you are jumping at lunch for a 2-3 hour time frame and then the rest you're wiping tables."
good,It's your standard fast food environment.  Minimum wage pay.  Flexible hours to college students.  Discount on a meal when you work. You do gain a lot of restaurant experience and they train you on different aspects of the job.  Most of the staff is friendly.
good,"It was a good job to get experience in the food industry and customer service. The store I worked in (Cedar Hill) has bad management however which made it difficult to work there after a while. Overall, very fast paced job and kind of hard because you really have to give your 110% in order to have good ticket times in this really, busy area."
good,"Great starter job but that's it. If you're not looking for a career in the food service industry not recommended to stay long term. Has its up and downs just like any other job, no matter the profession."
good,Panera bread is a fun experiment to work in. The good thing is they are very flexible with the schedule...  The downside is the pay is low. It is good to have as a highschool / part-time job!
good,I can't handle the drama and I didn't appreciate the way things were handled when it came to immature situations. It was healthier for me to move on to another job while taking the things that I have learned from Panera to better myself somewhere else.
good,"The environment is more like a roller coaster, one minute it's very friendly and then the next you want to just walk out and never look back. At times management is understanding and other times you feel used and mistreated."
good,This was years ago when I worked here and worked at a panera in two different states.  In NY the staff was awesome and the management was even better.  However in PA the managers were lazy and mean and treated the employees like garbage and could never keep someone longer than a month
good,Panera was my starter job.  I was 17 and ready to make some money.  Panera taught me alot of basic skills that I now can take with me onto other jobs in life.
good,"There were usually good hours, however, the way that we made the food wasn't efficient and we always brought it out late or messed up. The management was nice but there are also some that are rude. Pay isn't enough for what you do."
good,I would say that it is over all a good place to work. There was a great team to work with. The only downfall was that they had to let some people go due to one of the original managers stealing money.
good,"Panera Bread was  always fast moving and I was always interacting with people. I liked working with food but felt myself overwhelmed on a daily basis because there wasn't great teamwork.  Whether you were cooking food or cleaning or taking orders, a lot of what you had to do was on your own even though it should be a group involvement."
good,"The day was mainly decided on who was working at that day. It could be a very good day while working with some of the better employees, or it could be a terrible day with some of the worse ones."
good,Working here was fun but at the same time the workers took it seriously.  We had to work at a fast pace while under pressure to get the food to the table in a certain time frame.
good,"Overall, I had a good experience working at Panera Bread for my first job. My coworkers were for the most part helpful and supportive. Recent management often had the evening shifts understaffed and as a result, I would feel compelled to stay hours after my scheduled shift in order to help close. Management was a little unorganized and I felt that my year of hard work deserved more than $8.05 an hour."
good,Would be willing to work again for the great company. Willing to help and coach through all situations thick and thin is what make this company a great .
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Don't get me wrong, I personally loved working their on my own... The other associates didn't seem to like working their very much, they always argued and bickered, jumping down each others throats and making the work experience bad in the end for me!!!!"
good,"The people that work there are great, but the management is awful and the customers are hard to deal with. They are hesitant to give raises, and work you hard for minimal pay."
good,Panera is a fast-paced work environment.  The skills Panera helps you acquire are very helpful if wanting to go into the food industry as a line cook.  It is a great place to start out as a line cook and does give opportunities for job advancement.
good,"Can be very fast paced, not very difficult but closing was a hassle due to the amount of ingredients that would run out. Hard to sell products when the proper ingredients were missing - many frustrated customers resulted. Management shifted a lot during my time there - maybe three different managers."
good,"you deal with customers, unlikely expectations from upper management, and long hours. Panera bread Panera bread Panera bread Panera bread, I have a one hundred fifty work minimum"
good,The franchise I worked for had continuous problems retaining managers because of the district manager that oversaw the stores in the region.  There was a tendency to transfer managers constantly and she seemed out of touch with day to day operations.
good,"fast paced, great team. great benefits, manger made me feel more at home instead a ""typical day at work"". Great food. bakery items are also Delicious."
good,"When I get there I sign on to the register. Start taking customers orders, and fill order's as they come. Restock product and assist customers and co workers when needed."
good,Great place to work and great people. Gets very busy and time consuming. Management is great depending on who it is. Hardest part is standing in Bakery all day.
good,"It's a fast food restaurant, if you've ever worked in one, you know what it's like. Customers suck, management wishes they didn't end up there, and the turnover rate is so high, half your co-workers at any given time have no clue what they're doing. That being said, if you're going to work in this industry, Panera is probably where you want to be. They pay higher and have better benefits than most of their competitors, and the best thing, no fried food. You don't have to worry about grease traps or boiling oil here, or the acne that comes with it!"
good,panera is fine. the clientele is kinda old people and older people are rude a lot of times. that made me frustrated. the work is not that hard. the people were nice
good,Panera bread is a great job. The atomshpere is very friendly and the customers are very nice. The location I was workng at was just at great distance which  made it really hard to get work
good,I wish I could conjure up some more hours. Panera is a great family restaurant but the staff is treated poorly. Panera has taught me a lot of skills including barista and cashier.
good,"Personally, I think they could be more professional and be more flexible with full time students. They should also try to work on the scheduling better."
good,I hated working there for everything but the people. I made amazing friends with my coworkers that I will keep for the rest of my life. Otherwise it sucked working there.
good,"Panera is super flexible with college students. Great management, I got a raise within 4 months of starting with the company. There is room for advancement."
good,"Nice people, understanding managment. Fast-paced but can also get a little boring sometimes. Great job overall but certain people in the company can be very judgemental."
good,"Easy job, you get to learn a lot. But their crazy hours and their environment are not the best. They expect you to do more than your position requires but they're not willing to pay you more."
good,You can work at a lot of hours for a decent wage. Working there is high stress due to a large number of people coming in and wanting to eat there. The people are nice though.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,the group of workers that I was with made it feel like a good environment. if I wasn't taking deliveries it was difficult to make good money off of 8 dollars an hour.
good,Was please with work environment at first until I building unhealthy relationships with other co workers I encourage this place to be a healthy environment but I could only do so much as one person this place is in my past and that's where I plan to keep this in my past jobs worked.
good,"Working for Panera proved to be tasking more often then not at the particular location I worked. the management team failed to come together to build on consistency to ensure the staff was properly trained, policies and procedures were adhered to by all team members, including management team. This proved to be quite challenging at times and created dislike for going to work at this location When I voiced my concerns to the Area Development Manager, I felt as though my concerns had not been fully addressed and in fact dismissed because no positive results came of it. Although I really do like the company and if the opportunity were to present itself I would gladly consider employment with Panera Bread again, this particular management team at this location did not make me feel as though I was a part of the team."
good,Panera was a nice entry level place to start working when coming back to a normal routine. It will be great for college students and high school student looking forward to help paying for there own education
good,"Here you can expect to handle customers, prepare food, clean, and you must be accurate with handling dated food items. This was my first and only food service career, and I definitely learned a lot from this position including there is always something else to stay occupied with at work. The most enjoyable part of this position was my coworkers, while the hardest part of any customer service job is sometimes difficult customers."
good,A great environment with a lot of nice people. Also a very home like environment.  I learned how to better serve people in the food industry.
good,You can do a lot of over time. As well as good health benefits. Discount on your food . Different menu every four months. Great online university training programs.
good,Panera was a nice facility and enjoyable place to work.  While cooking is one of my favorite hobbies Panera bread made baking another. My co workers were great team players and always helped out when needed.
good,The work is not bad. The employees are great to work with. Management is adequate. Opening is fun. The menu is good. The regular customers are always pleasant.
good,I loved working here as a first job. You get to take home free food and you get a really good discount on the clock. They work you like a dog though. Especially if you are on dining room/dishes. I loved all my managers but it just got tiring after not getting promoted after 3 years and getting very small raises.
good,"Typical day was very busy. We hand breakfast, lunch and dinner rushes every day. "
good,I have work here for almost 5 years. I am looking for second job to support my family.  I loves my boss here. Just not enough benefits and money wages to support myself and my family.
good,"A typical day had two rushes of people coming through and management barely helped us out with making food or phones ringing. "
good,A typical day at work would be to clock in and stand at your position and make yourself look busy. I learned how to make food from Panera and take orders really fast. The management need to be improved. Hardest part of the job was getting used to the routines. The most enjoyable part was taking orders.
good,It is an okay company to work for. Pay is not the best and is more of a high school work place. Great co-workers and flexible schedule; good work environment
good,"I worked there more than a year, it was more than a year a wasted where i could have worked somewhere else. they hire people that are still in high school most often and they dont care that they dont work hard. i lost my patient with it and had to jump ship."
good,"A typical day at Panera included many job shifts from each station in a very fast paced restaurant. I learned so much at Panera from arduous chores to organizational office skills. Management was as to be expected, stern but effective. The workplace culture was quick and always changing, always room for improvement just a little slow on getting in reviews as they should be. Also training to move up was slower than it should have been. The hardest part of the job was the difficult, time consuming jobs that had to be completed while still making sure the line is never more than one person long. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting learn something new everyday and getting to build relationships with the regular customers."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"4am welcome overnight crew(bakers), begin prep, opening of ""lines"" opening of bakery, counting out the til for cashiers, brewing coffee, and other beverages."
good,"working at Panera was okay, the managers were not friendly, the pay sucked. the only good thing about working at Panera was the friendly customers and other associates."
good,"Tough job depending on your role and where you work in the company. Has great employee benefits and good initiatives with positive impact in local communities. Advancement oppertunities are rare and really hard workers will be taken advantage of. High volume cafes are intense and require a fast pace, efficient worker."
good,"	Delivered excellent customer service including knowledge of menu offerings and food ingredients"
good,Great place to work family oriented environment. They will take care of you. Just wish they had higher paying  positions for other people. But overall 8/10
good,"This job clings onto any GOOD employees they have and quickly burns them out by making them make up for the slack of other workers. "
good,"I waited on tables, food service/prep and cashier.. I enjoyed my co-workers & the costumers..It was a friendly work enviroment"
good,"I worked at Panera for a year and two months, it's always evolving for the most part. Be prepared to work in a very busy environment with needy/rude customers. Regular customers are very kind for the most part."
good,Pay was reduced without notification. The managment might not be that great but to work there and be apart of it you really bond with everyone.
good,"I endured my two year tenure there in high school, but it was not very enjoyable. There were so many pointless rules and policies set forth by the franchisee that it made it a difficult place to work."
good,"The Management at Panera Bread Was Terrible, There Was No Communication from Management. But Besides Communication i Would Say Panera Made Me Who i Am"
good,working at panera bread was fun. when we had to make all the food in a fast paced i really didnt like that because i some times would mess up on what im working on.
good,"This was a good starting job. I loved the customer service part of this job. I enjoyed going into work and making food. It was hard work, but I loved it."
good,"Worked here in college and although I wouldn't say it is a bad company, it is a very stressful work environment with a lot of employee turn over. If you like a hectic and fast pace environment i would definitely recommend."
good,"For the most part, working at Panera is fun and challenging, but that's provided that you are lucky enough to work with a good manager, and there are few that I've met. A lot of the time you get stuck with a manager who barely works and really only cares about stepping on backs and sucking up to get to a bigger pay check."
good,"A typical day at work is enjoying yourself and the customers, doing what you have to do, and getting all your tasks done before the work day is over. I learned how to work with customers in the correct and professional way and how to work with others in a group. The management was great to work with, always explained what to do, when to get it done by, and how to do it the correct way. The co-workers were always there when help was needed. They were more like family then co-workers. Everything was very well explained so nothing was hard. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be seeing the customers leave with a smile on their faces."
good,"got there early, stocked, set up, ran through lunch, restocked, went home, sometimes would close. was supposed to become a trained but never happened"
good,"Every Job has its ups and down (pros and cons). Work here is amazing. You have the potential to get many hours and even overtime, however things do get extremely hectic around lunch between 11am and 2pm. The hours between 3pm and 5pm are usually dead but that doesn't mean there wont be the occasional family of eight to walk through the door. Hardest part of the job is working everything in the store. You'll be cross trained to do absolutely everything in the store from toilets to trash cashier to making the food yourself and serving it. Co-workers are all like a family so expect to be a big family."
good,great learning experience but the location i worked for was a bit too much like high school with all the drama and excessive bossy management and young crew
good,"At panera there would be many times when there was a line out the door for two hours straight, and you also learned how to deal with and cater to complaining costumers. This taught me a lot of patience and how to keep a smile on my face even when being yelled at by costumers for things out of my control."
good,"This place has very rude people and not very good managers, however the costumers were amazing and I hope to work with better people and feel at home."
good,Good company to work for. Management opportunities given for employees to work up. Good and healthy menu items. Flexible work attire.
good,"Just a whole lot of nope."
good,If position is learned quick opportunities for advancement will present itself. Provides great teamwork skills with co workers
good,"The typical work day would be busy and non-stop fast pace food serving and cleaning. "
good,Enjoying prepping food and the team is very close.  Everyone is there for each other which makes it feel secure for me there.
good,Panera Bread in Allen Park is one of the busiest stores around. Very fast paced lifestyle. If you want to work you will be given the hours. They are very flexible when it comes to your availability.
good,"The environment is somewhat inviting, however, the management (besides the general manager) was unorganized and often lazy. I was given the responsibility of a manager but the pay and respect of an average employee."
good,The job changed so often that it was hard to keep up with all if the changes that it got very discouraging to most of the crew and it was often times that the staff would quit because there was so many changes
good,"If you're looking for a company with a lot of discipline this is the place. It had horrible hours, I would sometimes open meaning I had to be there at 5am and then when you close you had to be there until 11:30pm. It's not a good job for people in school. I loved my. Coworkers and the managers though."
good,"Fun place to work, enjoyable coworkers. Was able to learn more about being a barista and how to interact with customers."
good,"Typical day would bve assigning task, running the floor, assigning stations, giving people their 10/30 ,minute break, Doing food orders for the store and opening and closing tyhe store."
good,while working here after high school i gained a lot of knowledge about what it meant to actually hold a full time job. i also gained a lot of knowledge about customer service.
good,The team has shown me a lot in which developed me as a person. I am thankful for the people i've met and the lessons i've learned.
good,"This work experience has taught me a lot.  I refined my customer service skills, learned how to be more efficient with my time, and became a reliable member of the Panera team.  The hardest part of this job was commuting for 30+ minutes per day to arrive at location.  The reason I left this place of employment is due to its location."
good,I love the company and the food they serve. Most customers are very friendly however the management is horrible. In one case I ran to the back and was sitting on the floor close to passing out and one of the shift leads told me to get back to work without looking at me. There are many other cases like this. The Panera Bread that I worked at had no regard for their employees and were often left short handed due to all of their teenage employees calling in (most of the staff were teenagers)
good,Panera is a place that will work with your schedule and pay you a fair amount. There is also a fair amount of room for advancement. The only complaint I would have is that they can be super strict on the dumbest stuff. The managers were positional leaders but no one wanted to follow them. There is no room for good culture because no one enjoyed being there.
good,"On a typical day, I usually work at night. I have learned more about having great customer service, barista, money handling, and cooking. I have been working here for a year, and within that time, the management has not been consistent. Yet, the management is great. The staff is good to work with. Overall, I have enjoyed my time working here."
good,"Always busy. I worked as morning drive thru, this meant I was there from 5 am to 2 pm. Most days I would clock out past 3:30. I would work a 10 hour shift and I wouldn't be given a break not to eat or even to use the restroom. I didn't mind working early but the hours were extremely long and difficult to do when the manager are not doing their job. Wouldn't recommend working at Panera bread."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Honest work, must be ready to work in a fast environment. Customers service is everything. Flexible work scheduled. Good job if you are also going to school."
good,"The company is enjoyable to work for, but the scheduling lacks flexibility, scheduling is limited to what they place you in and hard to make leeway into other scheduling."
good,I was younger when i was first given the opportunity to become assistant manager of this store. It was an awesome expierence that allowed me to gain life-long lessons in management.
good,Seemed to be a much younger staff with little experience in the knowledge of the restaurant business.  Most have been promoted within the company so there was no full service restaurant experience.
good,had the perks of great customers who actually love coming to Panera and multiple locations that make it hard not to find one that's in your area. the atmosphere is close knit and team work is key.
good,Entry level in store is not a very lucrative job. The hours are not worth it and the work and expectations are ridiculous.
good,The job is in a fast paced environment in which you work to bring satisfaction to the customers.  A typical day lasts for about 5 hours.
good,The associates are an absolute delight and there are times it doesn't even feel like work.  The management teams has little sympathies for the associates there.
good,"Although the pay is decent, the amount of work you have to do might have you question why you aren't getting paid more. The best part of the job is chatting to the customers."
good,Working for Panera Bread in the past was a very fast paste kind of job especially considering the fact I was trained to do almost every type of position there. Very focused on company satisfaction.
good,"Most non management employees were young high school students and young adults (low 20's) which meant turnaround was quite high. The actual job duties were very easy, they provide very good training for new employees. Management was always friendly and helpful. The location I worked in had a big problem with internal theft (employees stealing money from other employees bags/purses)."
good,Panera is a fun and fast place to work. Everybody from managers to associates are happy and outgoing. Everything is a team effort to make everything gets done and that the customer is satisfied.
good,Be a hard worker and get things done. Customers are always right and always smile cause it shows effort
good,"A typical day at work consisted training any new employees in one of several different positions. When i was training i was working on the production line, making orders, or cleaning up the surrounding area which included sweeping, mopping, dusting, and sanitizing. The hardest part about this job was  accurately producing orders while on a strict time limit, but the most enjoyable part was being apart of an amazing team."
good,"The culture of Panera Bread is amazing. The Make-A-Wish donations, the friendly faces, and Panera warmth all come together to make you feel like you're in a good place. The management, at least at my store, needed a lot of work. There was very little communication between managers and they all showed clear favoritism. The relationship between co-workers was fun and active and very easy. Overall it was a great first job, but I'm very glad i moved on."
good,"I've worked at different locations and each were different than the others. Due to its nature most of the staff are younger kids either still in or fresh out of high school. It can be difficult working with them sometimes because they sometimes haven't developed much of a work ethic. The days are very monotonous so this is a good job for somebody that feels comfortable doing the same thing ad nauseam. The biggest drawback about the job is probably the overwhelming amount of company policies in place that can sometimes feel impossible to satisfy. As someone that has been behind the scenes I can tell you that a lot of the staff cheat to make specific data look better than it actually is due to the difficulty of meeting certain goals the honest way. Overall, the most important things I learned from this job were developing a sense of urgency and how to interact with customers to either build a rapport or solve any issues."
good,"While the opportunity for advancement is often difficult, the requirements of the job are that of your general fast food restaurants."
good,"It's a fun and fast paced job where you get to interact with customers and make sure you're giving out good food. I've learned quite a bit working here, including how to prepare food, what it's like to have a constantly changing menu and learned how to quickly adapt to an ever changing environment."
good,Panera bread is a good company to work for. I have been with them for over 2 years. I learned to become more social and interact with a lot of people on a daily. I enjoy meeting new people the most and making a connection with them. Making them want to come back because of the service that I give them. The hardest part of working is the busy rushes we have. A lot of flaws happen but are fixed right away. Management is okay. A typical day of work for me is clocking in and talking to my coworker of what has been done and what is needed to be done of me. I will begin those tasks if I have no customers or I will ring customers up with their order.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"A typical work day consist of serving customers at the register, taking orders, making drinks, and making sure the dining room is clean. It can be pretty strenuous work for what your getting paid. The co-workers were overall good people to work with, so they made the job better."
good,Panera Bread was my first and most fast paced job.  Customers would line up out the door on lunch hours and it seems like there was a demand for everything.
good,"perfect for the cheerleader in you. Awesome for high school or college aged person. Over 25 need not apply, you will not fit in unless you are very young looking."
good,This job allows you to meet multiple people throughout the community. The environment is a family environment. The guests are the most important people in the building.
good,My first job it was an interesting experience. I learned much about customer service and met great people. The work is fast paced the pay is weak especially since raises are rare or non existent but scheduling is flexible
good,"First real job, taught me about money handling, cashier, customer service, and to be independent. The work was simple."
good,Were willing to work with my schedule so that I could attend school. Fast paced work environment. Expected to multi-task and go above and beyond for customers. I've met some quality people(co-workers) while working here.
good,"Worked as a team player"
good,"this is a great place to work while you are going to school, whether its high school or college. The pay is minimum wage but it works if you live at home."
good,I wish they cared more about the people that worked for them.  People are always getting transferred for business needs but they don't seem to care where the people actually live and  how long it will take them to get to work.
good,"cleaning, setting up store, dish washing, food prep, greeting. Managers are rude and hawk you down while you make the food. You are constantly being timed and they do not want to give you a raise even if you work the hardest and have been there for a while. Not worth it, they don't wanna see you succeed."
good,Opened and set up a restaurant club house for a prolific business owner with high standards and expectations. Worked with and trained over thirty employees
good,Overall I enjoyed working for the company while I was there. I learned how to communicate better with employees as well as customers. I've noticed a lot of growth in many different areas after working for Panera Bread and I am ready to assess the new skills.
good,Good but not a career type of job i would peruse in anyway . productive team work and positive vibes. Very bad management . Trustworthy co workers .
good,"fleible hours morning noon or night, wouldnt recommend if not a people person. Food isnt as fresh as advertised so dont go in expecting anything more than a slightly more expensive Mcdonalds"
good,"Working at Panera has helped me grow as a person, but the environment is very stressful. I honestly wouldn't have stayed as long as I have if it weren't for the people that work there. The management needs a lot of work."
good,Although I was not planning on staying with Panera Bread for my career I expected at least a small raise for all the areas in which I was trained along with the time period in which I worked there. In the time I spent at Panera my pay only increased when minimum wage went up and when I confronted management about receiving a small raise they said they would talk with each other and get back to me. The meeting between management about my pay increase never occurred.
good,Things never stay the same here. There is constantly new products for us to roll out which is nice and challenging. There is a time line that MUST be followed other wise you will get all kinds of behind.
good,This was a good job to have but could be very stressful at times. Customers can be very rude at times. The management was friendly and very open with scheduling.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Panera Bread is a fast-paced environment which requires good judgment and excellent customer service on a daily basis.
good,A typical day at work is just completing your every day task. Making sure the Customers are happy. The managers have their mood swings but it does get quite fasted so its understandable. Sometimes my co workers get too personal but we all try to stay working as a unit! Overall I enjoy putting a smile on peoples faces everyday!
good,My day starts off with going in and finish helping to set up lines before lunch hour. Make food and take customers orders. Clean area and stock product each day.
good,"I learned how to manage a group of 10-20 associates, while training for six months as a customer service supervisor at Walmart. Although, in life I enjoy my space I like working part of a team with good communicating skills to provide the best customer service. I pretty much got along with everyone at work. I like to work hard. I enjoy helping people financially. Taking the steps to an accounting course in school."
good,Making sure customers have everything they need. Make sure that everything is stocked up and everything is together. Set up the bakery every morning.
good,"- good co-workers "
good,Panera was my first job to learn barista.It was okay. Managers were understanding.My co-workers good. It is good for young people to start their career.
good,"I learned a lot about inventory, and filing. inputing car parts and vehicle work history into the computer. costumer interactions and updating car window stickers"
good,"The Panera Bread in which I worked at, was full of good hearted people and there was a friendly atmosphere about the place, which reminded me of my high school days. Although the place seemed nice, and all-round well run, the inner workings of the business were falling apart. The GM that hired me got fired within my second year of employment, due to complaints by employees and managers alike. Without an acting GM the management team fell into disarray. Everyone was too scared to do anything, (ie. write people up, talk to employees who were exhibiting improper behavior, etc.). Once a new GM was hired though, I and my coworkers were promised change for the better, but that wasn't the way things went. Nonstop verbal abuse, and disrespect from my fellow coworkers caused me to take action and request a change in my schedule. The new GM did not like this, and said it was stupid and absurd for me to want to change my schedule because I was uncomfortable and hurt, that I basically had to suck it up, because he wasn't going to allow my wanting to change my schedule. Because of this, added along to prior events, I forcibly quit my job on the spot. I could not handle the stress, and the abuse/harassment any longer, nor could I stand for the lack of action against such behavior. I loved my job at Panera Bread, I just couldn't handle the shortcomings any longer."
good,"This job is a fast paced environment. there is always something to do. The customers are great, the area is great. The management and the employees are great."
good,"a well balanced company overall for younger individuals who are looking for work experience. Too many ""training managers"" (this causes confusion as to who should be delegating shift duties."
good,"Very busy at work: time goes by quickly.  Learned how to make foods, and barista drinks/ smoothies.  Co-workers are enjoyable."
good,"They demand the best, yet pay some of the smallest salaries and offer some of the most limited training in the industry.  This leaves both hourly and management staff feeling unappreciated and undervalued."
good,basic food service job. Management is hit or mess depending on the location and the district manager. Fun work family. Discounts on food is always a plus. And good regular scheduling.
good,"Typical 8 hours shift"
good,"I enjoyed working at panera bread. I just wasnt offered many hours as a high school student. Even on the weekends I would get taken off the schedule first. The pay was very low as well, so i made a job change."
good,Panera is a great company with alot of hands in the community around them. With that being said they dont put an emphasis on there employee's.So the comapny at its highest levels is very good morally.At the lower levels of the company they tend to play favorites with there employees.
good,I really enjoyed my time at Kohl's. I learned alot from my wonderful managers and amazing co-workers. I worked during the holiday season and all my managers kept the happy and friendly atmosphere for everyone on the team. We are really worked together to make our customers have a great shopping experience and made it part of their holiday season. The hardest thing about the job is having so much to do in so little time. We really pushed ourselves to pull through at the end. The most enjoyable was the happiness we all had being at work together.
good,"Opened the store each morning (4:30 AM). Learned time management and how to order produce and take inventory orders. Learned how to manage a staff larger than 5. The hardest part of this job was answering to the demands of corporate. The most enjoyable part of this job was being in charge, so I did not have to answer to a boss each day."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"It's pretty good, the people I work with are hard workers, the staff is great, most of the managers are willing to help. It get hectic but the day ends and things run as smoothly as possible."
good,"As an opener of my cafe, I have learned to be prompt.  A typical day starts a little before 5:00 AM for me, where I set up and organize bakery product for the day, slice breads for sandwich production, and make sure customers come in to a clean, warm, welcoming environment.  On weekdays things tend to run smoother than on weekends mainly because the General Manager isn't in on the weekends.  People take advantage of this and slack off more than they usually would.  As a hardworking individual, I continue to do my work as I would any other day.  This includes cleaning duties, delegating tasks, and working many different positions throughout the day (dining room, cashier, and barista mainly).  Per cashier duties, I am able to create a connection with customers that I see every day."
good,Developed more customer service experience from this job. Also connected well with my team to make sure everything ran smoothly.
good,"My Job at a Panera Bread Cafe is very simple. I am responsible for ALL of the bakery goods you see. The Breads, Sweets, Pastries, and Bagels. My night starts at 8pm, and I begin prepping product for baking. I am trained to work alone and process up to $2,500 worth of product alone in about 11 hours. "
good,"The job includes free parking, free meals and medical benefits."
good,I learned that employees should be respected as much as the customer is respected. It's a full-circle scenario. Always fast-paced and never a dull/boring moment.
good,Typical work days consist of preparing food for the day before open and setting up the store for the day. Cashiers help customers order food and associates make sandwiches/salads to order. Dishwashers clean the dining room and wash dishes. The work environment is fairly strict to the cooperate policies and can make the atmosphere among coworkers more tense.
good,"Pretty good first job, really cool people to work with. You learn a lot of skills needed for the future and always have someone there for you when you need it."
good,"My responsibilities were providing a sanitized, organized and safe work area, under OSHA regulation. My job was to make food quickly but in a presentable fashion. In addition to making and prepping food, other days my assignments included cleaning and stocking the dining room, as well as the bathroom. There areas also needed to be sanitized and made satisfactory for customer use. At Panera, I was also a dishwasher. Aside from washing dishes, this job left me in charge of organizing and keeping the “back-of-house” clean and free of hazards and prepared for the following shift to use right away. "
good,"The atmosphere would be better and more productive if managers held more employees accountable. Many employees come in late or neglect customers with little or no consequences, which makes it more stressful for those employees that are punctual and attentive. The managers are very appreciative towards responsible employees, however, and offer ample opportunities for promotions within the company."
good,"Provide overall support to the General Manager of the bakery/cafe. Determine how much food to be prepped for each day based on historical store data. Manage store associates to maintain quality control, timely delivery of order and customer satisfaction. Responsible for counting register drawers, breaking large customers’ bills and daily cash deposits to store safe.  Responsible for opening and closing the bakery/café. Unload the bi-weekly truck and put into inventory, making sure to properly rotate stock. Train new shift supervisors/managers/associates from other locations.  Manage the overall look of the bakery/café. Solve customer service issues. Greet customers. Take customer orders and ring up on the cash register.  Prepare customer orders.  Prepare food prep for the day. Wash dishes."
good,Hard work for very little compensation. Typical food service environment. Good for students and young adults starting out.
good,The company was ok to work for. Many workers come and go. Busy during season. I wanted to broaden my experiences. Good job for students
good,not much of a place for advancement or pay but still a good and fun job to have and try to keep. the average day at work would consist of lots of cooking cleaning and customer service.
good,"You count your drawer, take orders, stock cups, napkins, flatware, etc. and perform basic fast food cleaning duties."
good,Panera is a pretty easy job yet very demanding and stressful. Fast paced environment and not a job for someone who can't handle that. Most of the time we were understaffed and people consistently calling out or quitting. Management definitely needs improvement.
good,"Great summer job for a college student. Learned to work a register, take orders and even cook a little bit. Best part of the job was taking home left over bread."
good,A typical day at panera was it stay busy in the cafe. What i learned on the job was how to make smoothies. The management was was nice and willing to help you out. The co-workers were nice and fun to work with. The hardest part of the job trying to make the different sandwiches in a reasonable time. The most enjoyable part of the job was having discounts.
good,Too many initiatives going at the same time. Joint Venture program is very difficult to attain. Manager turn over is real high. Quality of the food is excellent. Communication is very poor for how large this company is. IT department is terrible. Can not get intouch with anyone at the corporate office.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Great first job and got a lot of experience in the workplace worked with some hilarious people and had a good time. yade yade yada
good,"Variety of tasks given daily"
good,When properly ran it is a great place to work. It is fast paste and high stress. Half hour breaks are regularly given with a 60% discount on your meal. Flexible with schedules.
good,"Working here was an okay experience. I felt that I should have been paid more for how much work was I was doing. Overall, if I got the opportunity I would work there again."
good,"Very morning and afternoons, loud fast paced, many managers available, lots of co-workers young and fun, hardest part of job was the pace, most enjoyable was food."
good,It was very structured and could be a very exciting place to work at times. The food was delicious and the employees very knowledgeable. It got to be very boring when I got transferred to a slow location.
good,If you mess up (which any human does) you are hollered at and sent home instead of provided with constructive feedback. In any restaurant everyone wants to be entirely too personal so it makes for an awkward environment when things don't work out between those who have shifts together. Often ran out of what was needed and of course a lot of the customers you had were rude. The coworkers did make coming to work interesting and everyone had their own quirk which made it worth going everyday.
good,"Panera is a fun place to work but doesn't have much room for growth, they don't like to cross train or push crew to be better or want to be leaders."
good,The management team is run on the good ol buddy system and not on corporate style.  Knowledge about the job just doesnt seem to matter as much as are you buddies with the right people.  I think this management style has put this location 30 to 40 years bbehind the industry.
good,way to much stress involved clock in clock out when you can or let you  deal with people clean cook rap food and plate orders
good,I worked dishwasher for 8 months asking everyday for additional training.  Never received any additional training despite my very effiecent and training on cash registers.
good,"a typical day at work would be getting the bakery set up for the day, I learned a lot of customer service there interacting with all of our guests that would come in on a regular basis. The management at Panera lacked some authority in my opinion but overall everything ran smoothly and all of my co-workers and i got along great. I didn't really have difficulties with any of the tasks asked of me to do, i enjoyed every minute that i worked there, it was a fun and fast paced environment."
good,"Challenging with teaching new employees, great way to learn leadership. the company was great, great people working, a very good team environment.  great food discounts!"
good,Great work life balance. Management changes frequently so it is hard to have a clear path for advancement. Benefits are ok. Similar to any restaurant in town.
good,"arrive at 6am and stock bakery "
good,I had my moments where I did enjoy myself. At times I felt I was being treated as I was not equal to some of my peers. I really gained a lot of experience within the facility I just feel management needs to adjust some minor things.
good,"Coworkers are fun and interactive. Management can be very political, however, they relate well with associates and try to help them personally grow and develop."
good,"A very busy place but rewarding, good food and guest use to love hearing us laugh. worked as  a team for the most part. wonderful surrounding for evening meeting ect.."
good,"Getting to work early and preparing my station. Preparing things to be baked off . I worked alone so sometimes it was difficult. The hardest part of the job was making sure everything was proofed on time and never over proofed because everything had different proof time, but the best part was seeing the set up and how everything looked after it was set up in the display case."
good,"Its good to see a company work so hard to put out a great product to customers, and to also see the atmosphere that is Panera when you step in."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,I enjoy working here. it is very fast paced and am always on my toes. The co-workers are very friendly along with the managers. The hardest part of my job is cleaning the messy dining room. The most enjoyable part is talking and meeting new people everyday
good,"I come into work and It is usually a chaotic situation. I am usually immediately giving out breaks, stocking out items, taking orders on phones and at the register. I fill out all of my daily paperwork and check off the Bakers area before they leave for the day. I balance the safe and do deposits and jump around to different areas of the café as needed. I do my end of day reports and send a nightly email to our district manager regarding our sales and transaction counts for the day and do our cash deposits."
good,"My normal day consisted of an eight hour shift, my position was typically on the line. This was where I would receive orders and prepare them for the guest. I learned to move fast paced, team work and how to train others. My management was very short tempered with those who didn't do what they were suppose to; but liked to enjoy the calm parts of the day in friendly atmosphere. My co-workers tended to be a bit impatient and stubborn headed, but understood when and if they made a mistake and were polite to guest and myself. At night shifts I was usually on the line by myself and a few times have had nights when I couldn't keep up the rushes I received. I enjoyed interacting with the guest, and happy to make their day better."
good,"I started working for Panera around the age of 16.  It was my first job."
good,the job is cool the staff and mangers. Atypical day at work is busy and heatic but the team is able to still laugh and smile. I enjoy talking with customers and making them smile.
good,Panera Bread was such a great way to start off for your first job. I was actually excited that I got the job. The managers were real cool and nice.
good,"•	Received and processed orders from the customers and completed closing procedures."
good,"When I first arrive and clock in, I make sure all the dishes are clean and my sinks empty. I help the production line with any orders they may have throughout the shift. I keep up with both production line and my own dishes, all while starting to clean the floors in the back of house. After close, I sanitize all utensils and dishes that are brought back and organize my area. Once I am done, I help my coworkers finish their tasks before I clock out."
good,"At the beginning of my day I start off with whichever position i am assigned to that day. If I am a cashier for the day I help out getting things out the way to sell merchandise and help employees on the other side of the store to give out or prepare food. Thats basically the routine the whole day and keeping the store clean. I learned to be friendly and not be shy to customers because they can't harm you. I learned to be more sociable. The management in Panera Bread is okay they are helpful when you need something. My co-workers when I started off were so helpful and until this day still are and were good friends. The hardest part of the jobs to start off and learn to be a cashier, once I got the gist of it everything was okay. The most enjoyable part is when I get to make drinks for the barista section, keeps me occupied."
good,"Panera Bread was a good job. I liked it, but it was my first job, and I did not have much work experience so I let a good position go. Panera Bread is a good starter job if you want to get into the food work."
good,Take orders from the customers as well as bringing them there food. When customers are finished would clean off tables and floors.
good,"•	Responsible for balanced cash draw at close of shift."
good,"Great place to work as a high school student. Very fast paced environment, pay is not the best could be better especially for all the work they require you to do."
good,Typically my job included training new employees and helping the customers. On a daily basis I would prep food and prepare for the lunch rush and assist my manager with anything they needed help with.
good,"Very busy environment, but everyone works hard and keeps the atmosphere upbeat. Your co-workers definitely help get you through the long and busy days."
good,"very busy and fast paced"
good,Panera is a great place to work with a wonderful mission.  It's nice to know that what we bake in the morning goes to help so many people at the end of the day.
good,"Panera Bread's a very fast pace and friendly environment to work in. I was a cashier which gave me the opportunity to build relationships everyday with customers. My co-workers were like family,  loved them all. There wasn't a hard day while working at Panera. And the most enjoyable part was seeing the smile on customers faces when they walked in and seen there order waiting on them."
good,"Overall average"
good,Please was okay and located in decent area downtown of Princeton so it was always busy. The management there though is not reliable and unappreciative.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Like every food establishment, you're going to deal with great managers and not-so great managers. But compared to other restaurants, Panera is not bad. I had the pleasure of working with a really great team."
good,just a fun place to work a good experience on learning new food items. meet ne people been a customer service represenative
good,"Coworkers are great, the managers need come to a common ground on a few issues and business could improvement. Otherwise a good place of employment."
good,I work on the cashier all day and I have learned how to deal with all types of personalities. My co workers are awesome and friendly. My managers are flexible and understanding.
good,"Work alone to prepare and bake the product for sale the next morning. Third shift alone in a store."
good,"Panera's operations managers are ""working managers"" Expect to move and shake all day and go home both physically exhausted and mentally from all of the numbers that they are constantly crunching."
good,"The morning shift consisted of prepping bake goods, filling the bagel racks, and being available for any customers that came in. Had to make coffee that had to be replaced every two hours throughout the shift. Taking people's orders and providing answers to any questions she or he has. I learned how to work a cash register, how to handle frustrated customers, and how to provide a friendly and welcoming environment to customers. The management was hard working. the co-workers were nice and fun to work with. The hardest part were all the side jobs which made the job a little tiring. The most enjoyable was the friendly atmosphere to work in."
good,"company needs to do work with the management team. "
good,Work days are very fast pace. I've achieved great communication skills. The management and co workers are great people to work with. There is nothing that cant be accomplished. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to see a smile on a customers face.
good,Working here was one of the best and VERY worst experiences of my life! I really enjoyed the work itself but the restaurant business can be a tough one. The awful management and lack of professionalism lead me to leave this company. I refuse to even go into a Panera to order food. It's really too bad.
good,"Workers were not very friendly along with managers. The scheduling was always hectic, never got out of work on time, getting time off was complicated even with notice, etc."
good,Very simple job. there should be no surprise here. working in the food industry can be a lot of work for very little pay. this place is no exception. the hours can be as early as 5am. but the staff is very easy to work with and make it a great environment.
good,"The customer flow was busy, but the turn-over rate was bad. Being a new store there was a lot for people to learn and a small amount of time to do it in. Managing to train the employees while maintaining a fun, yet calm atmosphere is difficult. I truely appreciate how well the staff would work together to ensure the proper work get done, but in the end the poor treatment of the employees and lack of reward resulted in a unsettling turn-over."
good,Great place to work as a part-time job. Employees are friendly and helpful. Employers can be difficult and not supporting sometimes.
good,"Naturally a job in food service is a great first job. It doesn't require too much experience and is a great way to learn about the working world. However the managers at this particular Panera seemed to not take responsibility for all of their actions. I had put my availability as unavailable for Saturdays as I was teaching dance classes that day. If I was ever scheduled that day and told the manager I couldn't work on a Saturday they told me to find coverage or I would be written up for not coming to work. If I had stated my availability, why is it my responsibility to fix their mistake? And why is it my fault if I had told them that I couldn't be there from the beginning? Managers aside, the job was good. Fast paced and never boring. There is always something to do which makes the day go faster."
good,Not everyday is the same. We serve many guests that walk in the doors and some regulars that have become a family to Panera.  It is a very fast paced work environment that serves safe food with accuracy.
good,I'd like to keep his personal. I will say that my typical workday depended on what my job title was at the time. All my different duties are included in my resume.
good,"Panera Bread is a very good high school job, a job that will give you experience for your next job. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting all the people and building relationship."
good,"A typical day at Panera would have to be fast paced. Most of the associates  I work with are arrogant, and make work even more stressful. Hardest part of the job is having to both impress customers and meet their qualifications with orders, when we run out of items 70% of the time. The most enjoyable would have to be the rewards, we associates are offered, which are discounts and at  times generous people."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"I got thrown into a pretty dicey situation when a GM got fired and all of the assistants were competing for the same job.  not good, after a year i had to leave, restaurant management was not the life for me"
good,"Great place for college students to gain extensive experience in a real business setting. Good place to start if you would like to go into management one day. The pay is not great, however the company values and structure is well implemented and thought out."
good,"I rarely worked when there wasn't a line of customers to the door, it may not seem like it, being located in Wyomissing PA, but I worked for one of the highest customer volume Panera Bread's in the entire country, so most nights I wouldn't get a break. Which made the job hard work."
good,"I was an Associate Trainer at Panera Bread, I trained all new employees all the guidelines and all necessary information needed to be successful at Panera Bread. Did this for about 3 and half years, there was not much room for advancement in the workplace."
good,"1.Perform baking responsibilities in a safe and quality manner while following systems in place. "
good,"Responsible and hardworking employees have room to advance with this company.  Typical responsibilities include all day to day operations.  Food Cost Management, Hiring and Training, Customer Service is a must, P/L management, and lots of multi-tasking."
good,"I only kept this job so long because of their amazing flexibility with scheduling. They have a planner that you can write any days you need off and you will 99% of the time get that day off. You can work as many (up to 40) or as little hours as you want. "
good,I did not have any complaints about working at this company.  I enjoyed my work.  The hardest part of the job for me was the hours.  I worked very early hours which can be common in a bakery setting
good,"When I worked at this panera they fed me bread all the time and seemed to engrain it in my head that their bread is our passion, it is quite like a cult. Too much so for me."
good,"enjoyed helping other employees and attending and helping guests,"
good,Panera was a very good job. I had amazing coworkers and managers. I really have no complaints with this company. There is room for advancement and raises.
good,"We prepare all the product for the next day's sales. The business cannot run without the baker, however we (Bakers) feel under appreciated by the management staff."
good,I really enjoyed the customer service aspect of this position. Delivering the absolute best service and training my staff to be friendly and accurate as well as outgoing and kind. I learned many aspects of management through this experience.
good,A typical work day involves me washing dishes until it is closing time.
good,its a pretty hard job to get used to you have to make the orders that are sometimes complicated in 4 min or less. Management was good. my co-workers were also welcoming. the hardest part was memorizing all the sandwiches and salads.
good,A typical day at work for me consists of 8 or more hours. I am typically on the register or making drinks at the barista counter.
good,"Very fast pace. You meet a lot of people, your are able to build relationships with your customers that are regulars and buy your product knowledge."
good,"A very fast paced job that entitles a lot of work, but provides a perfect amount of experience."
good,I never stopped going at Bread Company and I loved that part of it. The pay was not very good and you were lucky if you were given a raise that matched the amount of work you were expected to do.
good,"working on the line with food prep"
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Worked there happily for around three years. Most of the staff that I worked with were liquidated when management changed hands.
good,"I am in charge of running successful shifts on a daily basis for Panera Bread. I am in charge of over $4000 worth of money in the store at all times. I handle customer complaints and also solve daily problems in the work place. I order food and equipment in order to run a successful business. I interview potential employees, hire, and give orientations to new employees. I am a certified trainer and also train new employees. "
good,"I loved working for this company, as an overall experience it was a lot of fun to work there. But they weren't always up to cross-training on all areas or picked favorites among the staff."
good,"Greets customer, takes orders, fills orders, helps customers with questions. learned how to manage school life, working, and being a mom. management is not consistent."
good,"This job allowed me to learn the importance of teamwork. When a co-worker called out it was up to everyone to work together to take care of all responsibilities. I leaned in the service industry attitude is what people see first, and maintaing a positive environment produces successful work days."
good,Can be a nice place to work.  Typical day includes running numbers and being out on the floor with your associates and customers.  The co-workers can sometimes be young but most are willing to learn.  The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with customers.
good,A typical day at St. Louis Bread Co. will be quick because I only work a 3 to 4 hour shift and my only job duties are wash dishes and maintain a clean dinning room. I also prepare food when needed. I learned how to provide excellent customer service. Two of my Managers are rude some times in the way they speak to employees. The other two are very kind and helpful to all employees.  All my co-workers are great to work with. The hardest part of my job is being able to work more hours. The most enjoyable part of my job will be speaking with customers in putting a smile on there face as they do the same for me.
good,Its a good place to work for starting out. You get a good employee discount on food and the work environment is pleasant.
good,"very nice customers and employees."
good,"Management is openly gossipy with coworkers. Coworkers are always starting drama. You may be singled out and get in trouble for things you shouldn't be -- or EVERYONE should be, but aren't, especially when the management doesn't like you. I have worked at two Panera Bread stores, and although the company has amazing standards and guidelines, I have been disappointed with both of my jobs. My availability was never followed, I was under appreciated, and certainly underpaid. "
good,"I believe that this company could improve in there management staff, as I feel they are not trained well. my coworkers were amazing and fun to be around."
good,Great place to work . Just not for me. GM is very childish and do not do thing by SOP's. Even thou it a corporate cafe it runs like a franchise.
good,I really enjoyed working there during high school. I made a lot of friends while working at Panera and learned a lot about working hard.
good,"It's fast food. The atmosphere is clean and you don't go home smelling like grease, which is a plus. Management really depends on the store, I've had some great managers and some not so great. I went through the shift supervisor training and the pay for the amount of things you do (pretty much the same as assistant managers) is pretty lousy. No benefits either. Coworkers are usually decent, but as they're mostly teenagers it can sometimes feel like babysitting."
good,I worked very hard for very low pay. I learned a lot about the customers that came in and out everyday. I also learned a lot about the different products they sell
good,The co workers are great people and i feel bad that its so terrible there. The management is fighting itself due to lack of communication. The worst part are the customers and their lack of knowledge in the restaurant. Because the concept of the place is new and unknown to most I have to explain the whole menu about 40 times a day. This makes them frustrated and they take it out on me and my co workers.
good,Clientele was great. Co-workers were great. Management was pretty awful.
good,"Ring in customers, make sandwiches and beverages, and clean restaurant. I learned about all the different ingredients in each sandwich. My coworkers are all nice and most of them are helpful. The management is not too bad, but they need to pay attention more. The hardest part of the job is probably getting everything done in a timely manner because there are never enough employees scheduled."
good,"Involved in preparation and baking of daily goods from start to finish.  Following product specifications and attention to detail are key to successful completion of responsibilities.  "
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Panera was a good place to work, especially for students because they work around your school schedule. It was a fun place to work and the management made sure the employees were well trained"
good,This was a job to have income till I got into Human Service. It were many changes going on while I was there. So hard to give feed back when they were in limbo.
good,I worked in the diner area and cleaned up after the customers
good,"Day typically longer than scheduled and weeks very rarely within 45 hours that they tout.  Environment can be very fun at times as long as you handle stress well.  Insurance plans decent, but bonus program very difficult to hit.  Hourly associates' raise system could be better."
good,"I typically clock in and look to see where in the store I am working that shift. I usually am either making food or cleaning the dining room and/or dishes. The management is decent in most ways, but a lack of communication has been a problem."
good,i learned a lot about multi-tasking the customers were usually nice most of the managers were ok and the co workers were easy to get along with
good,"•	Interview/ train new employees on all stations required for restaurant operations"
good,Demanding and poductive company. learned to work as a team everyone worked hard and were helpfull multitasking was a challenge knowing that I could a hard days work with time to relaxes.
good,"Came in the morning to prep meat, and vegetables for the line. Help prepare customer sandwich, salad orders. Deliver customer orders to their tables. Make coffee and iced tea."
good,Fast pace work and flexible schedules. Different positions you can fill and new tasks you can learn.
good,Fast paced order fulfillment. Maintained cleanliness of dining area and work area. Also worked back of house operations.
good,"A typical day at work would be fast-paced with many assignments to get done.  I learned how to multitask very well, make use of the fact that I can adapt easily, become more independent, and how to take initiative.  The managers were competent and were willing to help out when needed.  My co-workers and I get along very well, we are able to work as a team and they are friendly.  The hardest part of the job was on my first few days.  I have never worked in that particular environment so it took some time during those few days to fully learn  what was expected of me.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping in various ways to my co-workers and the customers to make their job or dining experience more pleasant."
good,"Panera Bread was like working at any other fast food restaurant.  Not too much to say other than it was fun for a while, great first job.  Emphasizes on being a bit more fancy than your typical restaurant."
good,"A typical day at Panera is usually very busy. There is always something to do and I was always on my feet. I did things such as cashier, food prep, cleaning, and dishes. I also am a trainer at Panera so I had to train the new associates that were hired. I have learned a lot about dedication to my job and hard work. The management has had its difficulties in the two years I have worked their. We have had 4 different general managers and each one has a different management style. I am close to a lot of my co-workers but some of them do not like to fully do their job and want to use the easy way out. The hardest part is the long hours and working on holidays and the most enjoyable is my co-workers."
good,"I learned a lot about customer service and how to think on my feet. it's a very easy job, everyone I work with is great."
good,"the pay is decent for the requirments, a little above minimum wage. The coworkers are really friendly but the management could use some work, they are always really stressed out and make small things into big deals. The food is good and a healthier choice but the're really picky about the discount."
good,"Working at Panera Bread, was a breeze. I loved it. I got to train others and get them to the level they needed to be at as a great employee."
good,"My day at Panera would be hectic!"
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Repetitive job, couldn't get many hours.  It became more of a boring routine, but it got you a paycheck."
good,"opener and closer "
good,"Basic duties of a refilling and working the line. Training new associates on Line work, Barista and other different positions. Also associates were crossed trained to different positions throughout the store."
good,This waas my first job and it was a great experience. I learned how to deal with customers and employees. Made friendships with people that were great workers that helped me out alot.
good,Great Company just keeps growing worked with them since 2008 I liked Franchise better them corp.
good,Its a decent work environment. They cross train you so you learn a lot of new skills.
good,"A busy environment, lots to learn with room to grow and move up the ladder."
good,I enjoyed working here but this place is just like Krystals. You honestly can not trust the people you work with
good,"I was trained in every aspect of the store from register to dish, as well as performing several training tasks. However after being promised advancement in wage, after two years, I never received a raise despite my full time schedule and experience."
good,"A typical day at Saint Louis Bread was a good day I love working with customer  making drinks smoothies hot chocolate etc, walk around the restaurant to make sure the restaurant is clean, and the condiments is stock and ask the customer is everything ok. "
good,"Loved the hours and the workload was more than the pay, other than that, the people were amazing."
good,"I spend all shift washing dishes and maintaining a clean kitchen.  On weekends, I'd work 12-13 hour shifts.  I didn't get to learn anything.  The people are nice to work with."
good,"A typical day a work can be good or bad depending on the manager i am working with. I learned how to deal with certain cutomers also i familarized myself with the regulars and they became to know me as if they saw me everyday. Management sucks at this store, everyonr wants to be in control and cannot focus on one task. I got along with my co-workers they were very nice and hard working. The hardest of the job was dealing with that manager that you didnt like working with, who consistently picked on you for no reason just because they were having a bad day. The most enjoyable part of this jib was working nights with this one mamager she was a amazing manager.She got along with everyone without bodsiing them aaround like the other managers. She knows how to separate the two manager/friend. But she always got the job done. When i knew i was working with her i was going to have a good day."
good,"Management is horrible. Other than that, okay place to work."
good,I opened the store 5 days a week. I was in charge of handling money and managing employees during the morning shift. I ordered produce when needed and also did deposits. The hardest part of the day was employees that didn't take their job seriously and others( my self mostly) picked up the slack. Most enjoyable part was the interesting customers that came in. I loved to interact and make their visit great.
good,When I started at Panera everyone liked they're job then as  time went on people started complaining about certain or random things and the management would act as if no one was saying anything. I enjoyed the company of the coworkers and frequent guests. But the managers would push off responsibilities to those who were not ready for the responsibility.
good,if you train hard and work hard you'll do great with the company
good,wasn't too bad easy work management was not that bad hardest part for me was making the drinks
good,wasn't very challenging but it was fast pace. my payment got messed up for a while. Also the barely gave me hours. Overall it wasn't a horrible workplace.
good,Working here was awesome. All my co workers and management were very upbeat most of the time. However there was days that management would take their anger out on all of us. Most days were pretty easy and we kept busy.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,This is a good place to work. They do have benefits for employees and some advancement opportunities.
good,Made food at a fast and efficient pace.  I learned how to work in a fast manor and make a profound product.  I enjoyed my time here
good,"Come in, clean, make new coffee's, maintain a clean work place, take orders. I learned how to make espresso drinks. Management was nice, but didn't provide a lot of formal training. I got along great with my coworkers, most in my age group. The hardest part was keeping up with the huge crowds but I did fine. The most enjoyable part of the job was working around such good food."
good,Overall I enjoy my job with the company. I have learned quite a bit about time management. The hardest part of the job was working overnights. Meeting new people was probably the best part.
good,A great opportunity to start your career. Learned how to be a true professional.
good,"up and down an fast an slow.."
good,"Depending on where you stand within the company, you primarily focus on customer needs whether you are ringing in their order, speaking with them out in the dining room, or simply making their food."
good,"My ""day"" at Panera began at 10 pm (or earlier if I was travelling to fill in at another store) with beginning my assigned duties for the day as either baker or prep.  As the baker, my job was to take the prepped goods from my co-worker(s) and finish them while juggling prepping and baking bread.  As the prepper, my job was to assemble the sweets and prep the bagels and some of the breads and assist the baker as needed.  The work is very fast paced (especially around the holidays) and sometimes I had difficulty fitting in bathroom breaks but that is the nature of working in a kitchen.  The day ends around 6 am or earlier if your work is finished."
good,"Typical early morning day was preparing the line for the lunch rush. Very nice environment, free coffee, free wi-fi and very clean environment."
good,"Very fast paced, lots of product to prep/stock. Managers are friendly but somewhat unorganized. Customers are friendly. They want meals ready in under 3 minutes, which is sometimes unattainable."
good,Fast pace work enviorment. I enjoy going to work and everyone is upbeat and outgoing as well as managment and customers. 
good,"At first, it was a fun change from full service management.  The hours are shorter, and there is no alcohol.  However, severe micromanagement from above created a very difficult environment to actually manage at all.  Most of the shift is comprised of running around, saving labor hours, trying to hit impossible goals set by people who have never worked inside a restaurant."
good,"It is a decent place to work, it's little base pay especially if it is your first job. Panera Bread is always making new rules and procedures which has made working there a little more difficult and for your what your getting paid it seems to not be worth it. Management is ok overall. The best thing for me was meeting really cool co-workers."
good,"I was a food prep, dish washer, and also a line cook. customer service as well."
good,you have to work really hard in busy stores. ok work environment.
good,Panera bread is a great work place for someone who is young and needs a part time job. You deal with a lot of people all at once and must be prepared for that.
good,"Management is strict and medical benefits do not exist."
good,"Very early days."
good,Working at Panera has been very eye opening. I have gained insight into the kind of boss I would like to have. Management there for me is unfair and unjust. I am a hard worker and I take pride in the work that I do. At panera I feel very underappreciated and for that reason I feel the need to move on.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,maken coffeo cleaning preping  costormer assting greeting A good work environemnt to work in 
good,"Company makes fresh food everyday, but the management needs work seems like they hire anyone to manage."
good,Panera Bread is a fun fast pace place to work. However you can advance but there is no real benifits to advancing in your career.As you must be general manager to have medical etc. 
good,"it was a while ago that i worked here so i dont remember much, but the training procedures werent followed through with an a lot of accidents happened that couldve been easily prevented. "
good,Work was very demanding. It was very hard to schedule around sports or other events. I often worked in my section alone and closing on my own was very difficult. 
good,"I did not like working at Old Navy very much, the customers were not very friendly."
good,"Fun at first, 3rd shift tough when you have a family, BMM position required too many hours"
good,Everyday is different but it's a blast working there. Co-workers were funny and friendly.
good,great place to work if you are looking to enter the food service.
good,"I was the opening manager three days a week, which had me counting drawers for the cashiers, and supervising the staff. It was a long time ago, I don't really remember much about it. I enjoyed the people that I worked with and the management team, including myself was flexible and outgoing."
good,Not a lot of room for advancing. Great place to work during school.
good,"Usually the fast paced environment of Panera is enjoyable and the employees are good natured. Though I'm only part time, I'm a hard worker and tend to be a very reliable associate, however I've never been given an opportunity for advancement, even though I've requested it multiple times."
good,I worked under good management with a lot of good people. It was my first job and I learned how to interact with customers and co-workers.
good,Fast-paced /Ever changing Enviroment
good,Every customer is valued as an individual.
good,"I love to eat at Panera,. As far as working there, I never really got any hours and was paid $6.50/ hour, that was not enough to pay the bills. The management team was laid back and nice people to work with . The job was easy & fun."
good,Always a high volume of customers; Many regulars. Hard job to keep up with because there are many responsiblities to be accomplished at once. Low pay for such a labor intensive job.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,I would cash out the customers once they order their food. I would make sure they got refunds and other money back if they weren't happy. I would also make their coffee or brista drinks or work the drive thru on cashing the customer.
good,Team Orientation company. A great place to bring the family.
good,"The job is very easy and fast paced. Management are very good at doing their job. Customers start to recognize you more,and feels very good,"
good,Schedules were often changed mid week and supervisors were very unorganized
good,It was a very nice place to work at. It was my first job. Had alot of Learning experiences there.
good,"It is an okay environment. The amount of work is a bit too much compare to the salary. The employs have good understanding but the management team is not polite. The hardest part of the job is cleaning, when there is only one person to clean a large amount of space."
good,Nice relaxed place to work in high school. If you are serious about a career there i would suggest getting a diploma because therwise you will be stuck at entry level positions or just above entry level positions.
good,"The location I was at had a high turn over rate and that included managers. The type of people they hired were unreliable, and always called out right before their shifts. The are quick to tell you what you are doing wrong, but not so much with praise or compliments. I did gain a lot of customer service skills. They do have difficult customers at time, who make you feel beneath them. I started out a 8.75 and after a year was making 9.25. Which is more than most companies are willing to pay. I was in college full time and they still made me open at 5 am. I felt unappreciated for the amount of time and energy I was putting in. When they needed me to come in on my days off, I was always willing to help them out, and they weren't willing to do the same. I don't think it is all Panera Breads, though. You get 65% off your meals."
good,"A typical workday includes coming in dressed in polo, khaki's, apron, hat, and nametag. If on register, I would count in my drawer and begin to help customers. If on line, I would make sandwiches/salads. Both positions I would stock and clean. With this being my first job, I learned a lot about business, food, safety, and customers. It was my first experience with working a cash register, and talking with customers. I worked at two different stores within the three years of me working there and management at both stores were not great. There was never any communication between them and made it hard to ""do the right thing"" when each manager says something different. For the most part I enjoyed working with my co-workers, many of which I became close friends with. I enjoyed all parts of my job, from cashier, to production, barista, and training. I only wish that after three years with the company and knowing all area's, that there would be an opporotunity to move up."
good,"A typical work was being on my feet dealing with the public. I learned how to multitask using a cash register. The management was okay, and sometimes a little too demanding. I got along with my co-workers well. The hardest part of the job was doing the work as fast as possible. The most enjoyable was always staying and never being a dull moment."
good,"Everyday was different, lunch rush was 2 hours long and was very busy. I loved the hours and I like the people I worked with."
good,"The place is a great place to eat, but it was very hectic to work at. No one really cared about anyone else, it was just a go in there, do your job and leave type of place."
good,The coworkers I worked with were very friendly. The leadership roles however were not.
good,"The days were not very long but the work that was required at times was. people frequently visited Panera Bread because it was nearby and healthy. I was the one usually doing the lifting and taking out garbage, sweeping, and some other tasks along the way. I learned a couple of things like making some drinks how to interchange the syrups for the soda, stocking, restroom rules, and mainly how to properly handle myself around patrons and how to act when conversing with them."
good,Prepared Sandwiches for customers.Help make salads. Helped give out food.
good,"Over the years I have been able to demonstrate clear effective communication with both customers and employees. Setting strategic plans for how each employee can improve their performance was a big goal for me. In addition, since out store made an average of $60,000 per week, customer service was crucial. Creating a customer connection was my biggest priority. Our biggest goal was to retain as much customers as possible by providing a warm and inviting atmosphere. Managers have praised my work ethic there, and have recognized me as one of the hardest working, sympathetic, and customer-centric employee out of more than 50 associates. We had a ""work-hard, play-hard attitude"" and our sales proved that. The hardest part of the job was how busy it was a majority of the time. Usually I would work 30-35 hours per week while taking 18 credits a semester and when I came in I would be running around quite a bit."
good,Very nice restaurant and amazing food! Customers always come first !
good,"Panera was an okay place to work for. Some of the boss' were nice but some played favoritism which is so unfair. They also make you work even if you are throwing up,"
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,overall great employees working for establishment. no room for advancement. family dominated business
good,Was a great company in all the people were supportive and very helpful.
good,"Very fast pasted, clean and has great food. coworkers are hlpful, but management likes to pick favorites"
good,"The overall company policy includes ""no jerks"". That's a great mission statement, in my opinion."
good,"Panera is a warm environment, inviting for all ages. The employees and managers are friendly, the workplace is clean"
good,"Prepared the food, took customers orders, maintained the cleanliness of the store, opened the store, change outs, take money in form of cash or credit."
good,"A typical day would depend on if there was anyone for me to train or not. If there was a new employee to train my day would consist of the first half of the shift getting the trainee setup on the training software so they could learn the company values, see what the station they were about to be trained in was,and get a baseline of knowledge for the station. The second half of the shift would be the trainee shadowing me and learning what they needed to do exactly and to pass on all the tricks and best practices I've learned along the way. Additional shifts would consist of me and the trainee working ""hip to hip"" building their skill and confidence on the station until both the trainee and I were comfortable letting them work without any aid and they then would need to pass the certification test. If there was no one to train my day would be spent doing what ever station I was assigned to that day. A few things I learned where how to better interact with folks who have a different learning style then me, how to handle customers, the importance of developing a rapport with customers, and that even the hardest workers will eventually get swamped with work and need a hand from time to time. The hardest part of the job I think is also the best part of the job, the customers. I believe that in any service industry there will be good and bad customers and while I really enjoy the good and even the not so good customers, it's the bad ones that just wanted to vent their anger and frustration at someone when either another employee or I happened to be passing by that were the hardest"
good,The management seems a bit lackluster. They do not necessarily punish wrong-doers or have much leadership. They give people who do wrong a warning but never more.
good,"Panera provides flexible hours while attending school, but management is not always professional and mature. I have heard many inappropriate comments from managers and co-workers and have decided to move on."
good,Management is the worst I’ve seen in all my years of working. They do not care about their associates and would rather lose them over  toxic manager. It’s comical.
good,"Panera Bread is very tiring but a fun experience. It taught me so much on how to be responsible, deal with customers, greeting customers, making food, and so much more..."
good,"The job itself was okay, there were good days and there were really bad days. Some customers can be really picky and terrible, we were really busy every day, managers aren’t always as qualified as they need to be, and the hardest workers pick up the slack for the rest. However, you make tips ($1-$2 per hour, which is nice) on top on minimum wage, and the Panera staff is like a giant family. With that however, comes a fair amount of drama"
good,"Job overall has great personalities to work with and has great energy, but when it comes to being fair and having commitment, this job lacks a lot. Great experience, but not a great place to try and grow."
good,It’s a good job til they start running out of business. I worked here for a long time and it’s not good pay after a while . You have a lot to do and it’s hard to get done just for a small pay . They don’t even know how to communicate.
good,"When I worked at bread co, it started off very great at first. Even though the night shift was under staffed, I still worked with a smile on my face. Management is not the best. They always talk down on you and don’t really set a great example. But honestly, I loved the connections and friendships I made with my coworkers. The location I worked at, you work long hours with no break and when you ask for a break the managers get an attitude and sigh since we are so under staffed to the point where it’s hard to even get a break."
good,They get desperate for ANY employees in fall and winter. There is a lot of dirty language and griping. Associates work hard and are paid $9.10/hr. It's a great summer job for high school and college students who often have a contagious good attitude and great teamwork. I miss the customers.
good,"Some of the best food in the fast casual dining industry. Many other fast food/ casual companies tend to copy Panera Breads menu and ideas, but usually Panera Bread comes out on top with best taste and dishes."
good,Overall good management and decent work for a line cook job. Well planned days as far as routines and expectations. Also company has employee funded emergency help for unexpected problemms like rent and bills called hero fund which is nice to help people in need.
good,"Working at Panera can be fun at times, but the real priority is consistency in the workplace. Also while prioritizing customer happiness. Rides the line between classic food service and fast food environment."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,I learned different areas on the cafe in short amount of time people are really into cross training for more teamwork and work development. I learned how to handle customers orders and fix mistakes quick during the day
good,"I started working at Panera Bread right after I graduated high school and I was able to learn and develop skills I didn't have before. This company provides opportunities for growth if you are well-rounded in every position. It was a great company to receive my first job in because of it's simplicity and stability. Most employees working here are balancing school life and work, and it is a great temporary Job. My experience at Panera lead me to gain a better understanding of work, discipline and skill that eventually benefit me for my future prospects."
good,"I loved working for Panera Bread! The management team was always so nice and genuinely friendly, they didn't focus solely on the customer experience but also the employees experiences. Training is a breeze and very easy, scheduling is flexible, but the pay was bad. They started me out with 8.75 and that was terrible. I would work extremely long hours and it would interfere with other things I wanted/needed to do. Having a life outside of work was very difficult because they demanded so much time. "
good,"-We typically had one person working in every department except for line, which could get overwhelming"
good,"Too many high schoolers on the clock. Always in play mode, acting stupid. Slow days are terrible. Look busy and you won't have to worry about much when you're not on the road. Busy days are great as long as customers are tipping , which they don't half the time due to all of the drop offs to the local college students. Delivery fee is way to high, which takes away from your tip money."
good,"Learned how to interact with different customers and how to manage difficult situations in a positive manner. Management was poor, and was usually understaffed causing delays in service."
good,"A typical day at work is very stressful from the time you open the doors until the time it closes. I learned that you have to be very patient and humble. As part of the management team, you must be very flexible and ready to lead the business. The hardest part of my job is working short-handed.  And the most enjoyable is meeting new people every single day."
good,Working at Panera Bread was a good experience. Majority of managers were nice and understanding when and issue came up. Always made sure everything was taken care of. They hired me on the spot and gave me my work experience.
good,"They say all the right things but rarely follow through, people that have been there a long time are not open to new ideas and treat 'outsiders' with a certain animosity. They are heading in the right direction, but this market is struggling due to some poor leadership and the difficulty in hiring entry-level people."
good,"Decent place to work, the customers are mostly entitled and awful, especially the seniors that come in every single day, food is as clean as the commercials say it is"
good,"Working here was a good experience, and I was able to learn about working in the food industry. I was trained well and effectively to be a delivery driver and managers were always helpful when needed. The pay was good at times but on slow days it was frustrating walking out with little to no cash."
good,"it not subtle and nuanced his first DLC pack, called ‘DLC Pack 1 - Marvel Knights: Curse of the Vampire’, adds Punisher, Blade, Moon Knight and Morbius as playable characters. There’s also a brand new Gauntlet Mode, where up to four players take on a frenzied series of co-op challenges in rapid succession to earn rewards. Once you've cleared a Gauntlet, you’ll unlock a survival-style version of it with continuous waves of challenges."
good,The management and staff working there is fantastic but during your typical day you're often understaffed and juggling a lot of work so it can get very stressful especially during the rushes.
good,"At the beginning i did enjoy working there, however things changed and it seemed like the effort was not there anymore regarding certain team member and i felt like the environment was becoming toxic."
good,Overall its a very stressful job if your cafe is busy. Training at first feels a bit overwhelming but you get used to the flow of things. My cafe was so bad and poorly managed that i left.
good,"Its okay, just all night work and weekends. Its hard to have much quality time with family the way everything is set up. Got a lot to do for one person to complete on the routes. Very physical and very easy to get into a bad situation because of the transports."
good,"Okay at times - customers and management can cause unnecessary stress & if you do your best but do not set boundaries, you can easily get worn out quickly!"
good,"Most of my days were spent delivery driving and being the expediter for the line."
good,This company is very good to its employees. Its prefect for part time job people and those who are going to college or still in school. Very flexible hours and has a good pay rate.
good,"It’s tiring we don’t have a lot of cashiers plus only one does everything, like barista cashier and bagging bakeries stock some days if I’m lucky i get help"
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,I have nothing really super bad to say about Panera just somethings need to be updated like we needed a new fridge that freeze the yogurt overnight and toaster that was less likely to have a bagel get stuck in it
good,During my time at Panera I had a great time but I only really knew 2 - 3 people in my time there since you rarely see any of the kitchen staff. Closing is a hassle since I did not receive help to get things done faster. (Keep in mind that this was my experience and not reflective of the company as a whole.)
good,Working at any of these locations you see a common trend of being understaffed and having to deal with management that may or may not do their job. Some of the managers are nice and helpful while others sit around and have others do their job for them.
good,"I started working at Panera bread during the holidays. I made a decent amount of money. I only worked on the weekends so I didn’t get as much as I planned. The managers were all across the board. I had 5 managers and out those 5, 3 of them were fun and nice. The other 2 were impatient and rude. The company started losing money from the snow birds leaving so they started cutting people"
good,"I work the hours i am supposed to work in a clean, friendly environment.  I am paid a typical management salary, but we dont seem to do raises,  even for cost of living.  Benefits are good. "
good,Panera can be a great place for High school and College students as Panera offers flexible hours. Most of the time people would be promoted within a store but not always guaranteed. There are not many benefits as a Shift Manager. You get free meals and 401k with matching up to 6% (for Covelli stores).
good,"Worked at Panera as a manager for four years. It wasn't an easy position, but it gave me a plethora of work experience and taught me how to manage effectively. I've had a position in management every place I've worked since then, and also have been given the ability to handle all kinds of customers. The pay is too low, in my opinion, but that's because of the hierarchy present in my own store, likely not a company-wide issue. The most difficult aspect of the job is the Panera culture- it's very corporate and that mentality has trickled down to the customers. Oftentimes, they can be impossible to please. Still, I wouldn't change my experience. It taught me a lot of necessary and difficult skills to acquire."
good,"Lunch rushes last typically from 11-2 and are super busy and stressful. Management was good, i liked all my managers and it was mostly a friendly environment."
good,"Very organized, ship-shape establishment, becomes very busy very often, there is always work to be done, however the workplace chemistry can be tense."
good,Panera bread is a very chill yet productive place to work at. You will be constantly on your feet working . Very home feeling but management needs some fixing to do as a team.
good,"Challenging job to work overnight alone. Increases in salary were very hard to get. Upper management was very different in different areas, there was no 1 way to do things."
good,Panera Bread has a strong management training program which provides you with the tools to succeed. They invest time and resources in their people and there is room for growth within the company.
good,"I worked at Panera Bread for a few months and for the most part enjoyed the job. I liked my co-workers, the food was great and so was the pay. The issue was the management. Many of the managers there were either unreliable or unbearable. I felt as a simple crew worker I shouldered most of the burden of keeping the restaurant functioning. Other than the management though I enjoyed the job, I would've stayed if not for the awful management of the store."
good,Panera Bread is a great place to work. The environment is friendly and calm. Everyone works well together and gets alone. The biggest challenge is meeting the 3 mins or less ticket times.
good,"This is a really good starting job for teen. You can even build a career here if you work hard. They work with your school schedule most of the time but hours are not guaranteed. The only thing I would say I have a problem with is the constant change in associate and  management and some management period. It all depends on the store. Some managers are great and really cool, but some are lazy and jerks. Also depending on the manager the let certain associate get ways with certain things. Like I said though. Decent job but make sure you pick the right store."
good,"My first job was Panera while in high school. I started off $8/hr and wasn't too difficult. But raises were yearly and it went to $8.20/hr. And the following year I didn't receive a raise. But when i transferred to another, I started at $9.25.  Managers can hover and have high demands and expectations and blame employees for managerial issues. Managers will actually yell and fuss at employees during lunch rushes, and will treat new hires the same as veteran employees. Also breaks can be short because you have to clock out BEFORE ordering food. And they'll make you wait in line like a customer, cutting your break down to 10-15 minutes if there's a line."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"As any other food type job, you're kind of thrown there to sink or swim but if you can get past that you'll definitely grow as a person and be just fine. It was a good job, the best part about it was my coworkers and favorite customers. Will always think of this place fondly."
good,"Good basic food work, lots of hours available. Panera tries to take care of their employees, and many managers do the same.Only problem is they are typically short-staffed--be sure you're available to pick up those extra shifts!"
good,It was good I just felt like it didn’t fit me. Some of the managers were poor others were good. And some of the people I worked wit were kind of slackers.
good,"Great first job. Pay is low, however, and there is little opportunity for advancement so it is destined to be temporary. Raises are very rarely given and difficult to come by. Management is great at helping, yet plays favorites and drama will always occur."
good,"Very relaxed working environment. Friendly managers and employees. Flexible hours. Fair wages. Simple, comfortable uniforms. Taught cooperation skills."
good,"The people are great, and so is the managing team they help whenever you need it. They make sure you are OK. The hardest part of the job is that you can't sit down unless you take a 30 minute break. We are constantly learning how to make the customers experience better."
good,"Works well with schedule for people lifestyle. Not opened too late, good for teens. Good for single moms. Competitive pay rate. Overall ok place to work, co workers are good."
good,"Once Panera was bought by a new company, it has become harder to work at due to unrealistic expectations and harder chance to advance within the company."
good,Low-staffing has provided problems with manager scheduling and new GM does not pull his weight and help with the low staffing problems like others in the cafe.
good,The hardest part of the job is the Quota you have to hit when you are working. Usually by yourself or with one other person The days are never the same it can be more stuff you have to bake then the day before or there could be a event where you would have to come in 2-3 hours before your shift and try to get done before the days over
good,A very goal defined company with clear defined roles for associates and management. Multiple sub-positions for management to encourage goal making and completion.
good,"Panera was my first job and while there were things I didn't care for, working here gave me a nice feel for what and what not to expect at a job.  My biggest problem came from a lack of consistency as I spent 4 out of four out of my seven months employed training at various stations due to managers shuffling me around, most likely because I was part-time in high school.  While I don't particularly care for the job and would not recommend it to anyone at this point, I do believe it is a good starting point as it keeps you alert and prepares you well for your next job, wherever it may be."
good,"I’ve worked here for about 6 years so I’ve seen a lot of people come and go. The majority of the management team and the rest of the staff have been friendly and hard working. The pay however is nowhere near ideal. In my area the minimum wage is $12 an hour and I stand at $13.80 an hour, after 6 years of working with this company."
good,"Many employees are underpaid for the work they will do. It is a great place to work, given you have a helpful team of coworkers and managers. You can usually tell by the first few days. This job taught me a lot of great skills, and I have been with the company for about 5 years. It has undergone a lot of recent changes from corporate, and this workload has been trickling down to employees and management causing increased stress and a negative work environment. Always know your worth and negotiate your pay, they're a large corporation and can afford to pay their employees more than they say. If you are compensated properly, the increased workload may not be as bad. Generous food and drink policy and flexible schedule are the biggest perks."
good,I enjoyed my time so far. I learned much about the foundational experience in baking. I Really enjoyed the artisan style. the ambiance. Very community-based. I wouldn't say much about the cafe staff no understanding whatsoever. However baking management team is really awesome.
good,"I have worked at 2 separate cafes as of writing this. One I opened in Mississippi and then my current one in Austin. One thing is the same: management will not reward those who deserve to be promoted, given a raise or the ones who always work their hardest. At both of my cafes, I was the call-in slave where at any second they called me, I would come in and work as if I was scheduled. I worked constantly, consistently and was always overshadowed by someone for a silly reason or for no given reason at all. I dedicated myself to this company and both of my cafes because I was good at my job and loved helping people out and offering a comforting environment for my customers but the lack of respect and allowance to move up in the company made me so so frustrated at everything. It almost ruins the entire experience. I would still recommend this job to anyone who wants to start working as its very friendly as a first job or for someone working during school because most scheduling managers will work really closely with your schedule and be as flexible as they can manage for you. I met a lot of wonderful, wonderful, WONDERFUL people both as coworkers and customers while working for Panera Bread and its a treat to say that I've met such an eclectic group of people in my time. I will always love my customers, even if a few of them are the entitled type, most of them are regulars and will love to strike up a conversation with you at any chance they can. "
good,"Panera was a reasonably easy job to hold; once you learn all your stations, you will be coasting. The closing shift can be a pain, but once you learn your way around getting it done as fast as possible you can settle into a rhythm."
good,It’s a very crafty work field I like it and The benefits are pretty good as well. It’s healthy food I like n enjoy Panera breads food . They give good discounts to their employees.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,I've been getting less and less hours and there's been issues about that. I learned a sense of responsibility and gained some experience in the work force.
good,"I loved this place the bakery trainers managers culture etc.Something happened,  i no longer felt safe.Bakers are crazy, some more than others.The screening process is too lack.Will never work there again."
good,Great benefits. Over worked and no work life balance as GM. They churn and burn mgmt. I worked for the company 5 years and seen a lot of people come and go. Pay is good but stress is high.
good,"It was an alright job, not the best but pretty okay. There were no real benefits and my coworkers tend to be slacking off. The management there was pretty good though."
good,"I think some companies are far worse than Panera Bread, but at the end of the day it is a cooperate operation. I don't think the staff above my position at my store were trained to be their positions for long enough, as many struggled to either maintain professionalism. Everyone else in my same position were wonderful to work with."
good,I worked with some of the best people who i still call my friends today. As well as a few managers i worked with. I like working in a fast past environment and working under pressure. Thats what this job is. It was fun working here.
good,"It was a fun place to work overall and I did make a lot of friends and learn new things. But the general manager there made things not so easy at times, which is one of the reasons i decided to leave. Although, I would definitely work for the company again."
good,Great first job for those who are in high school still. Not much room for advancement to management beyond certified trainer. The best part of the job was the discount on the food!
good,"It was a nice job overall , just some of the management team was unprofessional.I would love to work for Panera again just not the store i was at. They will teach you each area as long as you’re dedicated"
good,It's a good place to start when you have little experience and need to work around a school schedule. It can be stressful but there's a good team environment.
good,"A typical day in Panera Bread starts around 5:30 a.m. The moring cree is setting up for another day of serving out customers. From making sure coffees are completly stocked, to the line preparing for lunch . We strive to make sure we follow all our rule and regulations of No Jerks. Sometimes it can get frustrating when we dont communicate. This will be when management step in to mediate. I love when you see the regular customer and you know them by name. We are all like a big family."
good,you will learn every aspect of food prep for customers ordering extensive computer based training before postion in the cafe is determined. abiltiy to transfer throughout cafe is possible.
good,I did not work at Panera Bread for a long time to have an honest review on the overall work experience. The management at Panera was not too friendly and did a lot of favoritism.
good,"Early mornings, late nights, long hours.  If you work at a low volume store, Panera is a great place to work.  Higher volume stores, not so much.  Non-stop, drive-thru, delivery, online ordering, catering...not for weak employees, hard to learn.  Hard to find time to get things done at higher volume stores, but you are expected to get it done, no excuses.  If you need help and ask for it, you might get an answer or a figure it out.  Handyman skills are a must."
good,"Most of the time work was a relaxing place. But when it starts to get busy and you are the person working line, the well-relaxed environment turns to a negative one. Because the employees and the managers will give attitudes and don't take the time to make sure everything is right. They never repeat themselves, when I was working line my general manager told me not to add frizzled onions on the flatbread, but I didn't hear because on the screen one of the flatbread had frizzled onions and the other didn't. So I add the frizzled onion on one of them and she yelled at me and that's when it started to go downhill."
good,I would recommended this job a student looking for a part time job. This job is only good for those who are looking for short a part time job before you find a better job.
good,I use to love my job but now with a new store another shift supervisor and I are just burned out because we’re the only two in management that does anything. It’s been like that for a while and we both agree with the pay we get it’s not worth it and she makes more than I do.
good,"Turnover rate is high, as can be expected. Therefore consistently understaffed, leaving shifts without enough personnel to run it well. It made hiring people desperate therefore all inclusive. Hired many without any work ethic, or with bad attitudes. Then had to work with that."
good,"prepare sandwiches, paninis, serve soups, serve the customer, prepare them in salads, pasta and soups and often serve desserts, drinks, prepare the sauces to take away, or prepare the orders they order by phone"
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"While working for the Panera Bread in Clemmons I gained not only new strengths in my specific position as a cashier, but broadened my grasp of proficiency when focusing on customer service and satisfaction. An average day consisted of cleaning my assigned area, which was typically around the registers, the bakery, the barista counter, and the dining room. I learned how to manage my time to complete these many cleaning tasks while also making sure the customers felt welcomed and received exactly what they ordered. My coworkers always made this job more enjoyable, as I established many stable and professional relationships during my approximate nine months of work for this corporation. At times however, the management lacked in terms of coordinating the schedule to properly meet a majority of the associates' availability. Being a full-time high school student at the time, it was somewhat overwhelming to balance the late hours of work along with several hours of homework to do after the fact. They worked with my schedule as much as possible, but in the process of hiring more employees, the company lowered all of our hours excessively. With this being said however, the managers were still very professional with their overall communication. My coworkers were also very supportive, as I was to them, if there was ever a need to cover or pick up any shifts. Panera Bread was an exceptional company to work for and regardless of any issues that ever occurred, which were very few, I feel that I personally gained a great amount of experience when understanding the ethical and congenial way"
good,"If you’re looking for a good environment and just for experience, have at this place. The people are very friendly and the managers make time go by very fast but the benefits are horrible and so is the pay compared to other fast food areas."
good,"Working at Panera was good. Minus the irritating customers and managers who most of the time wouldn't want to help employees when it got busy. They are big on Panera's history and culture. It's pretty much easy when you get the hang of it, but the pay kind of sucks if you're not applying to become a manager. They do ask you what you would like to be paid, so shoot big."
good,"Panera Bread is a wonderful job for people who are looking to gain more experience working in fast paced environments; most of the time, the associates themselves is what makes the job more fullfilling. But for those who are trying to find a permanent career in which to live stably off of, Panera is not the place. Though they give a very fair discount on food for associates, the pay itself does not reflect how much work is actually put forward. To conclude, Panera, in my opinion, is a wonderful first job, but as for a long term career I would suggest not."
good,They don't keep their word! They tell you on thing and they do a compete different thing! 
good,"Panera Bread is a great work environment. I worked there for about 4.5 years. 1.5 years as a shift manager. But upper management is not so good. There were times when it was overly stressful and could be fixed, but it was ignored. The environment is fantastic depending on who is working. I felt like the hard workers were taken advantage of and upper management gave people a lot of empty promises of more money and/or promotion. Overall Panera is a decent job but it doesn't hold much to a career."
good,"I got this job as a second to my dishwasher job in hopes to live independently. It was very easy til the last month of my 3 month probation. They changed a lot of rules and work conditions including when to be done by the end of shift. I failed to meet those requirements and therefore, I resigned."
good,Panera bread is a place that holds your hand with relative ease before throwing you into more fast paced circumstances. The management was quite kind and relatively skilled.
good,"Fun people to work with"
good,It's a great place to start a career. Panera bread offers job security for college students. They cater to the elderly crowd helping them as much as possible. Panera has more healthy food options than most fast food operations.
good,"despit the GM whom is no longer there, whom was racist, it was a good place to work. very stressful but managable. met a lot of cool people. defintley didnt get paid enough."
good,"Could have been better, could have been worse. The hours did not fit my personal schedule at the time so I wasnt able to stay with the job. Its not bad, easy enough work for the decent pay."
good,"Panera Bread is a work place fairly fun to work but it is very productive. The only thing is that with a lack of experienced management it is not as productive, as far as staff scheduling and  customer care, as it could be."
good,"IT was a fast paced job but I felt as if I wasn't appreciated at all at the job and the coworkers didn't train me well enough so I had made many mistakes , also the management was very rude."
good,"In my experience at Panera, I did enjoy some of it. They are very flexible with scheduling, it is a great job for a high-school student that wants to work part time."
good,The coworkers were the best part of the job. The work wasn't too bad once you learned everything you needed for closing. But the pay wasn't the best and there was a lot of drama among managers but that also made some things interesting in work.
good,I worked at Panera for a couple hours. I did meet a lot of cool people but the environment felt almost clique like. I felt as if people were speaking poorly of me. The fast pace was a bit too stressful for me.
good,Job was normal job for a restaurant. It was stressful and effected the quality of life. Training was pushed thru and staff was not full train to become effective part of the team
good,good place to work as a driver. work place culture is ok . the most enjoyable part of the job is going home. the work is at night which gets old after a while.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Clock in find where you work that day (depending on how many areas you are trained on). Joke with your coworkers and bosses, stay busy stocking and doing your job"
good,"Panera Bread offered a flexible schedule and fairly casual working environment, but also had multiple flaws. First, they offer no compensation during maternity leave for associates and bakers, because that privilege is reserved only for management. Also, there is an issue wherein managerial employees with issues in previous stores are simply relocated instead of disciplined. This has made some managers perceive themselves as ""untouchable"", because their word runs supreme over associates and discipline for management is basically nonexistent unless it is regarding an inspection."
good,"A typical day at Panera would consist of lots of hungry customers. The location that I was at was always busy, which I enjoyed as it made time pass quicker. I have learned how to talk to customers no matter what case it may be, the hardest part for me was dealing with the rude customers, it would make me sad. Eventually I learned to just keep it moving, the most enjoyable part would be making connections with the customers and having awesome coworkers."
good,"while being a semi strenuous and exerting job, it is fun and welcoming. i learned a lot about how to deal with the restaurant business and it definitely helped me with multiple skills for future careers."
good,"Working for this company has really been fun to me. I enjoy working alone overnight because there is no one in my way while I mass produce for the entire cafe. The associates are very friendly and sometimes helpful, however,the management has become very poor in some aspects. Managers do not execute some communication well with the bakers. There are some managers that enjoy the status to a point that they feel they can talk to you however they please. When it comes to being professional at the right times, I sometimes see a downfall. Baking is the mostly enjoyable part of the job because that is what I love to do. I have learned how to manage on my own with minimum assistance and I enjoy learning something new every day. Its the perfect job for a ""night owl"" or someone who likes to work alone."
good,"You gotta give a lot to the job, especially if you’re at a high volume location, and want to move up in ranks. My store has had a bit of turn over due to hiring too many teens who aren’t familiar with “work ethic” yet (it’s since calmed down). And it’s great to have an area you’re “in charge” of , with no worry about having to bounce around all week. If you prove to be good at that particular job, that can also provide a stable schedule; mine hasn’t changed in months!"
good,"Shifts were 8 hours long, with a 30 minute break. You are on your feet most/all of the time. When working on the line, the pace alternated between blindingly fast, while being swamped with orders, to having almost no orders to take care of. The dishwasher/cleaner position felt much the same."
good,"no benefits, not really not something I want to build a career around. It was something to step back into the work field to take care of my children. They do have great food and great service."
good,"It was okay. Flexible with scheduling and they always need people because so many go in and out. A lot of stupid rules sometimes and lots of picking favorites. \"
good,"Challenging place to work, but can be satisfying. The company has grown very large and some of the systems can't keep up. The increased workload with addition of delivery and other systems has not resulted in any more monetary compensation."
good,"The Olympia Panera was NOT a good place to work. The management didn't really know how to control the employees, creating a lot of stressful situations. They hired people who shouldn't have been hired, and do not upkeep with health protocols. I liked working at the first Panera I was in, and transferred for my college, which was a bad idea. They may or may not be better now, but in the year I worked there no one liked it."
good,Depending on you location this job could be really chill. The location I worked at the managers were rude and so were the customers. They gave me long hours without much pay.
good,"It started out as a great company to work for in training but when I moved to my store, long story short, the store is on its 3rd GM within 4 months. I'm ready to move on."
good,"Fast-paced environment. Management is really relaxed. As long as you do your job & stay on task, the day goes smooth, but if 1 person slacks it makes it hard on the whole team."
good,"I enjoyed working with Panera only because I enjoyed my coworkers and my managers. The Panera at my location only hired someone if they thought they would get along well with the rest of the crew. Unfortunately, that's about all I enjoyed about the job. The customers tend to be more on the pushy side, you are almost constantly on your feet, you don't always get a 15 minute break during your shirt, and the pay is not enough to live on. There is also next to no upward mobility. Once you're hired as something, you are going to stay there. You might get a slight pay increase, but your job title will not change."
good,"Working at Panera Bread gave me a good understanding of how much work goes into keeping a restaurant running smoothly, and how much effort it takes from each employee to make sure everything stays in order."
good,I loved it at first. After about five years it gets stressful and you feel as though you are going nowhere. Certain managers are not as helpful or polite as others
good,Willing to work with you for your hours.Not willing to up your pay. Management is decent. Could be better. Care about the employees. Benefits are good. Have PTO
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,good people fast paced. management very involved in the success of Panera. Def room for advancement. great benefits. pay is ok could be more. free food up to 15 dollars per shift
good,"It's a good place for a temporary job, but I wouldn't want to make a career out of it. The healthcare is a joke, even though they say you'll get it. They are flexible about scheduling though."
good,"A typical day at Panera bread consists of  arriving to work after washing our hands we make sure our work station is stocked up with the food to make sandwiches, salads, and soup. paying close attention to detail. calling out the food orders when completed. When i closed the store we would wash both work stations, cover all the left over food and placed it in the cooler, according to company's guidelines, dishes, swept and mopped."
good,"Each Panera I have worked at in the last few years, both corporate and franchise have been vastly different. But my most current store in Northridge has the closest feeling of a family. We all work together and work hard, the store can be very busy and everyone can get stressed out fast, but we always pull through with near no problems! It's a great place to work!"
good,"it was good. i worked 5 days a week at a busy loction. i worked on the line, counter, cash, expo, barista, prep and dish washer. basically i did everything. i was a trainer at the location."
good,"This job can be fun at times if you are at the right store with the right people. "
good,The jobs was okay for being a fast food job. Yes the food was better for you then other fast food but working there was like any other. The pay was decent some better then most other places. Although it could have been better. I would not work at the same locations agean but i would at ones I have not worked before mabey different states.
good,"I think things could be a little better organized, particular stores need updating, need to shift the focus on what’s important sometimes. Good customer service."
good,"I enjoyed the customers, and the job in itself. But I did not enjoy working with my GM. She was not a good boss, and nit-picked all of us. In the short time I worked there I was very frustrated and put down."
good,"I have almost been there for a year. I love the job at times and I don't care for it some days, that's with most jobs and most people. I love working with food and great people. Sadly some people do make working there stressful. Manly customers who are hangrey or just there for a quick bit to eat, they can be hard to handle. Over all I love my managers and the people I work with you just have to keep up with the pace."
good,"Easy to get hired, all associates are friendly, and not a difficult job. They’re very flexible and understanding when it comes to work hours and you can make up to 9-11 an hour"
good,I chose to go with another job was because the managers & coworkers take their personal problems to work and don’t know how to separate that from work. They always had issues and talking about drama.
good,"Big company , management puts a lot of pressure on employees. Work solo a lot. Rarly get help even when promised. Employee turn over. Some managers are good. No breaks."
good,"Typically every day is a routine. You come in, prepare the next set of workers coming in for there close, or if youre closing you prepare the morning to the best of your ability of the stores expectations and likewise for opening. Management was amazing until a new manager came in after the store failed an audit however I loved the rest of the staff as family."
good,"Panera Bread was a great place to work, it was a fun and friendly environment. Management was always on top of helping us and getting the job done. I loved having the freedom of handling myself without being told what to say. I learned how to be patient and put a customer first, all the time. Although it was hard continuously being quick paced, everyone was there to help."
good,"Good management, but lazy, young coworkers who were not reliable to show up for shifts. "
good,"Panera bread has a very good environment to work,I learnt how to relate to customers well.The hardest part of the job is insufficient people to work with."
good,"Panera is flexible with your school schedules, they target young kids who want to work minimum hours. 8 hour shifts are discouraged because the do not want you to burn out. "
good,"I enjoyed working at St. Louis Bread Co as a high school student. Only thing I did not like was that I was constantly scheduled short shifts. Otherwise, the food and atmosphere was nice."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Working at Panera has been an overall good experience. The hardest part of the job is the long lines out the door sometimes and having the stress of getting peoples orders out in time. The people and environment is very good and the people are very nice. The managers are pretty good.
good,"It was great to work with the staff, but the customers are very busy business people in a rush for lunch. It can be a little weary messing with people with no patience. If you have a hot head, don't work here"
good,"A lot of early mornings are involved in this job. The business opens at 6am, meaning you have to be there at 5 if you are opening that day. The staff and management are greaf"
good,Just because it sounds good in theory... doesn't mean it works in execution. If you want the results you're looking for why not offer a little support?
good,"My experience has been pretty good these past few years. Most of my enjoyment came from my coworkers, not the job itself."
good,"When I started working here, the store was under franchise. As time passed it turned into a corporate owned store. When it was a franchise, it was a fun place to work. I enjoyed everyone I worked with from entry level to the management, but when the corporation took over, it turned into a poor environment. By the time I decided to leave, I was training in people who made nearly two times my salary."
good,"Managers are very rude and the GM is very lazy in terms of helping. Rarely would see her while working as she would always be in the office, even if there was a line to the door and only one cashier and one line associate. She did seem to care for the employees personally but would not help when needed. The job was difficult and stressful, especially in the dining room. Too much for one person to effectively handle during peak hours as dishes would pile up, tables would forever be dirty and teas would run out very quickly and customers were very rude and demanding. Management would not help but rather would scold you for not being quick enough."
good,"A typical day is very busy, but great managers and coworkers make it an easy job. The discount is pretty nice as well, but many customers have high expectation that sometimes can't be met, and it gets frustrating when they get mad at something out of your control. Overall a great job."
good,Panera is one of the companies that truly care and place an emphasis on food safety and high quality. The job of assistant manager requires you to wear multiple hats at all times of the day. The hours can be long and varied which make your work/life balance very unbalanced. The culture from the company and the community feeling of working at the store do make it feel like home.
good,"pretty slow sometimes but good tips on constant days. could offer more money and higher pay. management was cool, just needed a higher pay because it was basically less than minimum wage."
good,"Overall my experience was good at Panera Bread. I chose to leave due to poor management and it was not convenient for me at all. The starting pay was good but i was driving from Waukegan to Libertyville, opening and closing while trying to manage my junior year, and they believed I was not in a position to be payed more."
good,"Typical workweek 40-50 with opportunity for lots of overtime. High stress, lots of opportunities for females looking to advance in restaurant industry. Management is flexible with days off"
good,"It was a fun job, my coworkers were always fun to be around and very helpful if you were slammed with things to do morning customers were mostly nice and sweet. The evening shift was another story."
good,I learned lots of patience and customer care for the guests that would come in. And that pace was really important. They give you opportunity to move up but the pay wasn't that great.
good,Stuck up snotty manager cliquish employees very ghetto at times high school kids are the worst hated it stay away if at all possible my supervisor was sweet
good,"Great if you work over night as a baker or if you are some sort of manager.  If u are an associate, due to the type of business they do not pay well.  It was time for a change.  I have no regrets."
good,I think this is a good temporary first-time kind of job. Best type of job for high school students. I thought our managers were extremely flexible and very laid back but always enforced the rules. Nice people to work with. Made me more responsible.
good,"Panera is not a horrible place to work, but it can get in the way of a lot. The hardest part is the management basically ignoring your concerns and requests and just doing what corporate asks of them. I understand that is the norm, but they show no compassion. Little to no flexibility. For those people that are students like myself, you will often find yourself scheduled on school days even though you voiced your availability, and then being told by management to find someone to cover for you because they do not want to worry about it themselves, even though it was their mistake originally. Demanding hours, and no real growth. Raises at yearly reviews are less than satisfactory, often resulting in a few extra cents added to your already meager wage. However, I have met a lot of good people there, so i would have to say coworkers make the job enjoyable. You can have your fun as long as you continue to work."
good,"The delivery service here in AZ still needs some work."
good,"Overall, Panera is not a bad place to work. You have to be there for a year at least to get benefits. I had bad luck with my timing though. I started at a popular location that had recently moved and lost a bunch of employees, so training was nil. We all pretty much just got thrown into rush, so there were always mistakes due to someone being trained. Several of the managers were great; two of them were terrible. We were pretty strict with health safety, which I thought was great. They made it easy to trade shifts or take more/fewer hours if you needed. "
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"A very high stress high paced environment. Staff and management make the job tolerable. If you preform well you can get plenty of hours, however on that same token if you perform poorly they will make sure a harder worker gets those hours."
good,I enjoyed the people who worked at panera bread. There seemed to be a lot of opportunities to move up in the work place. I did not mind the place it was just a temporary job for me.
good,"When being a line worker at Panera Bread, I learned a lot of new things and gained some experience as well with it. The team is amazing. Worked there for a couple of months and met great people."
good,"Never having worked ""fast food"" it is somewhat stressful and i dont believe we are paid accordingly. Do way too much work for such little, how do people even live on minimum wage? There is definitely room for growth and you get half off your shift meal."
good,"Panera bread does not have enough employees to match the amount of customer they receive.some manangers need to be retrained. Lack of composion or their part, make employees quit and look for work elsewhere"
good,The typical workday began for me at around 5:15 Am and ended around 2:00 pm. I worked in food production and customer service as well as handling the responsibility of training eligible new hires and making sure everything ran smooth.
good,This job js a great first job for many high school teenagers. There are many opportunities to grow with Panera. Panera is a very busy place and requires a good amount of work ethic.
good,I loved my coworkers but the job itself was stressful and tiring. It paid well over the minimum wage though. Don't do drive-through unless you have a lot of patience and can multi-task like a boss.
good,"The job is more than minimum wage, but still isn't very livable. I was considered full time even though I was never scheduled more than 32 hours. Management was very smug, complained no matter what, and continuously told employees how much better of a baker they are. This job is laid back, yet very physical in small increments. If you get a jump start on your shift, there is a lot of downtime to sit/ do homework/ play on phone."
good,"While working here, I loved the culture because you build a familial relationship with your coworkers. "
good,"I started working for panera my senior year of high school, and still here 6 years later. It was a great first job and I made many meaningful friends through it.  "
good,"it is good job for part time or a first time starting out job. i worked there for about 7 yrs almost or close to and i liked working there even with all the tons amount of changes to the place and employees and managers from good ones to ok ones bec of them changing district manager to one that didnt care bout anyone but i dealt with it all and it paid my bills and was close by. i was working pt thrn to ft and i wouldnt mind going back but for pt and do another pt job. i had few issues with them and got it solved sorta in a way. "
good,"this is a good first time job, the work is very very easy. just takes times to learn the entire stores duties but most jobs are basic. management is decent but not the best. i met some of my favorite people here but dont get along with others."
good,Had its ups and downs like any job. Got along w customers and coworkers. Being a cashier was quite easy. I would reccomend this job to a close friend.
good,"While Panera has it's ups and downs (great coworkers and managers to rude customers and rush hours), it is one of the better places I've worked at. The managers make sure your taken care of and offer you free meals if they ask you to work on a day you weren't scheduled or if you worked later than you were supposed to. It's a nice beginner's work experience and would recommend to those in high school."
good,"Good first job. Amazing management experience if you work hard. Great benefits, and they promote really fast. Hard work. Stressful work. Tough management."
good,"Usually fast paced day everyday except late at night. Cool people to work around, great food and atmosphere. Hardest part about the job is closing at the end of the day."
good,"Panera bread is a place for time-management skills and multi-tasking. At the very beginning of the day, I take orders, cash customers, restock and clean the area. Throughout the day, the cycle pretty much repeats itself, until closing. Closing as a cashier/ drive though has duties, such as: Washing dishes, Cleaning soup station, Barista station, mop and clean floors, restocking items for next day opening. I ensure that all these are completed before I leave. The job is easy, it is just a lot to do and the managers are friendly. Most enjoyable part of the job is, most definitely, interacting with the customers."
good,"the job has many ups and downs, but generally the staff is over worked, and breaks are forced even though they don't schedule time in during the shift for it, making it so you have to stay after an extra 30 minutes when youre done working. the work also involves a lot of risk of burn and a lot of risk to ehalth."
good,"Working at Panera was a pretty easy job nice working environment I made sandwiches I clean stocked baked i did cashier, prep, I got my hours liked the pay the managers where jus unprofessional"
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Experience working for Panera Bread will vary from cafe to cafe. The cafe I worked at was extremely high volume for most of the day (6 am-3 pm) and is chronically understaffed. High volume and inadequate staff led to very stressful work conditions. However, not all cafes face these same problems."
good,"I have only been there a month and a 1/2 and 3 days of that was on the videos computer. I am part time so they have only given me 2 days a week for 3 or 4 hours. I was pulled into the office and told I wasn't fast enough. I said I needed more hours to train as a cashier. I have been standing by an employee whose a training mgr. She's super nice but all the people are also super fast. I was told I didn't know the menu and to study it which is ok. I asked to be put on the evening shift (which was what I really wanted) since it is slower . I have been working on a training "" job cashier"" but it also overwhelms me .I eventually learn and am very fast but at the beginning its rough."
good,The people in there are nice they explain everithing and how to make it done right but is not good if your seeking a fulltime job is no worth it. For a kid starting to learn how to work is perfect but for a family man is not.
good,Training is decent. Management is hit-or-miss. Lack of organization and communication. Culture is not great but not terrible. Most enjoyable position is food prep.
good,Never a dull day at Panera bread. Excellent training staff off-site. High food standards with excellent food quality. Competent seasonal workers who are good company.
good,"Very good environment to work in as well as wonderful staff and managers. The hours were okay, about 20 hours or less sometimes per week. A lot of work for closing though."
good,I worked as a dishwasher for 1 full year and was never upgraded to a higher position. Jobs included busing dishes and managing coffee and soups. The management at the store was very poor and often were biased.
good,"Had a successful restaurant, up in YOY sales and profitability.  Was let go like several other tenured General Managers just before sale of the company was finalized."
good,"This job was very easy going and I enjoyed working there, it was a quite smooth and relaxing environment. The coworkers are all so sweet and kind, and the food is great."
good,"A typical day at Panera was a busy one where there was one rush after another. I really enjoyed the busy and fast paced rushes during breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I constantly enjoyed being occupied where time flew by and moving around. As for me, standing around is not part of my work ethic and being on the line there was always something to do. I acquired much professional patience and how to work well under pressure which are only a few of many skills acquired there. In all honesty management is rough there but now a days it seems hard to find good management. The hardest part of my job was the stress, coming in to find responsibilities incomplete and slack to pick up after. The most enjoyable part of my job was the laughs shared with a good crew in the midst of chaos."
good,It is very fast paced and there are multiple factors involved if you're making the food. Management was nice for the most part. There were many younger people that worked there like high schoolers.
good,Tough to move up in the company because of the distinct outlines the company has on raises and growth. The time needed to go up in the company does not reflect the level of pay granted in beginning of employment. Still a good company with good culture
good,"I worked here for about 6 years. A good place to work. If you are willing to to put in a lot of sweat and time, they will have your back. They are also good about promoting within. Biggest problem I noticed over and over, not matter what city or store I was in, was that they expect way more work than willing to pay for the associate level employees. This always caused a very high turn over. The stores are usually 90% short staffed, which causes a lot of stress for the people who still work there. On the flip side, most of the time they refused to fire any of the bad associates.  I mean these people could get away with unbelievable things, before getting fired. The combination of these two things usually resulted in multiple spurts of the good associates leaving due to bad moral and not getting due raises, and the bad associates staying because they could get away with murder. I only ever worked for franchises, so the corporate  stores could be different. However, that being said and out of the way, I still had a very good 6 years, and made some life long friends in the process."
good,"Enjoyed working with some of the employees not involved in hanging out with the upper management after work. The culture is great though, and it's always great working for a restaurant that serves great food."
good,"Panera bread was a faced-paced work environment that required you to stay on your toes and attentive to customers needs at all times. The company has great, strong beliefs of what food should be and had strict guidelines for food handling. There were always multiple managers to deal with in a single day but all were pleasant and helpful. It is a great job to keep you busy and earn you money, however it is not a long term career."
good,It seemed as if the company began focusing more on production and profit and less on quality of service. They wanted orders out so fast that the presentation of the meal suffered.
good,"I have had a fairly good experience in my time at Panera, things just haven't really worked out and it's time for me to find something a little bit different."
good,"A typical day of work consisted of taking back to back orders and trying to leave the costumers with a smile. I learned that not everyone will be satisfied with your best efforts. The management was terrible, they would talk badly about the employees and belittle us. On the other hand the associates were very close. But the most enjoyable part was seeing the customers with a smile."
good,"Pretty okay job, besides the management. Seems like the communication is just the worst and nothing is confidential. Everyone knows everything,"
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,The job pays fairly competitively and the breaks tend to be longer enough to at least eat. It is not however a company that I have found to be the best regarding advancement or even pay increases.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the sense of family that you get with the other associates. They are what make the job all the more fun.
good,"I worked at the franchise in Springfield, I am from STL. The franchise stores have a lot of work to do. The management I dealt with were rude. Didn't care. I wasn't used to that because the St. Louis bread co. Staff was like a close family, super awesome clean and friendly. At this certain location it was the complete opposite."
good,"My experience with STL Bread Co. is positive but I am always finding so much flaw and neglect in terms of management. No matter what cafe you go to, the management is always condescending but for the most part, the company is great. They give free food and insurance benefits to their employees and you can earn module raises for everything you learn. But it could be better in terms of staffing management."
good,Great place to work until Panera acquired them and removed the founding management.  Each cafe is run like a mini business of its own.  They care about the customers and provide great service.
good,there is always something to do working in food. you definitely learn to work clean. pastries are one of the best part of working there and trying new food. there is plenty to learn and push for and the company is always adding and trying new things.
good,"I loved all my coworkers when I worked at Panera. The food was good, but it was overpriced. Our discount wasn't very good, especially considering we could only use it at the Panera where we worked. Maybe it was because this was a franchised location, and not a corporate one."
good,"Work Wise Panera Bread us a great place. Customers are nice, and you learn a lot. Management is mediocre because there are so many managers you never know who to go to."
good,"It's stressful to work here but you meet great people. Very fast paced and customers are sometimes rude. The managers are 50/50, sometimes they care about you and other times they just care about if their cafe looks good."
good,"Very fast pace environment. Although sometimes fun, strict guidelines and long overtime hours. Good discount and wholesome concepts of the company. Gives back to the community."
good,"I would begin an 8 hour shift and they would put me on break within the first two hours of me being there so they could cross it off the list of things they needed to do before the people from the first shift were done. I learned how to take customer's orders, cash handling, serving food, and inventory/stocking. My co-workers were good, but this usually ranges between different locations. The managers were not flexible when it came to scheduling and dcalling in sick."
good,I love working as a certified trainer at panera bread! I love working with the warm caring people also. I am hoping to find a position with better pay and benefits to better my future.
good,Management could improve. I wish there were hours to get like I was originally promised. I do like that you can advance in the company and make it to a hire position and make this a career.
good,At the time management was a mess. People were stealing money and calling out which made staff short. Definitely busy all day. A lunch rush was from 10am - 3pm. I didn't receive enough hours for my schedule because of management and their favorite workers had all the hours. I wouldn't work at that Panera Bread again.
good,the particular panera i worked at wasnt run the best and was going through a really rough patch. i worked constantly with little breaks.
good,"A typical day at work is taxing and repetitive. My coworkers and managers are phenomenal. Everyone is constantly productive and generally upbeat. However the culture of Panera demands too much of its workers and closing the store at night is hectic. You never really know what time you're going to leave, and taking a break is risking getting backed up on nightly duties and staying even later."
good,"•Typical days at work I would just jump into my work and clean and ring up customers and restock also I would waitress"
good,Worked for a total of thee stores. All were different. I had lots of great costumers. The 65 percent discount was amazing. The food is healthy and the sweets are good.
good,its not the best place to work a lot of new hires end up quitting shorty after being hired most of the workers that were there for a long time are no longer there
good,A typical day at work is coming in at five in the morning and setting up the bakery. After this we open up at 6:30 am and I take care of the customers throughout the day while doing other side jobs. Ive learned how to communicate with customers better and how to run their cash registers.
good,Really enjoyed working there for the couple of months that I did. They worked with my school and sport schedule and was very understanding when I told them my availability.
good,They have some issues hiring good staff at times because most of them do not care.Nice management but very slow to make change that is needed.
good,"It gets very busy and customers can become irritated and mean. Some customers are rude and they treat you as a lesser person. The managers expect you to do so much work and stay after hours. The customers is always right even if the mistake was theirs, its a pretty demeaning job."
good,"Great people to work with, however, the money isn't enough to sustain yourself and a family. May need another job to supplement the irregular hours given. The job can have its hard days with the monotony of cleaning and routine tasks."
good,"Long Hours, learned a lot about manager roles. great people to work with.  upper manager not so much"
good,"If you're applying and you consider yourself cute, don't worry. You will be tasked with the easiest of responsibilities on register and dining room but do know they only hire register employees so hours may be on the low side. Now if you are on the not so cute side, get ready to be put under the most stress on food production. Now since they only hire people for register and dining room, you will have all the hours you can think of. Most of the food production hours averaged around 30 hours per week. Okay now don't think that you will be away from your mother's nagging at work because you can multiply that by 10 with the morning lady workers. So get ready to roll your eyes because they are relentless. Now there are few managers that you will get along with who are great so don't be too worried. If you are in the age group of 17-23 you will definitely have a great experience with coworkers as they usually make up for the stress."
good,"This company makes many promises they can't keep. They have amazing cultural values, but don't always practice what they preach. Management is not consistent. Team work often only works for those in the ""in"" crowd. Lots of drama. Not enough appreciation. They assume they have a right to everyone's personal information and personal time. NO work/life balance."
good,come in for three hours weighted all meat fruit and dairy products and then wash dishes until closing make sure all thrash was taking out and mop the floors
good,"Well diverse, better understanding. emphasizes on teamwork. during busy hours everybody is focus at the task to satisfy the customer. everybody gets along with each other. the hardest part of the job is helping the customers understanding when there is a mistake during busy hours."
good,the job would be a lot easier if the managers were all on the same page knew what they're job was and what they were supposed to do. Also it would help if the managers were fair and just when it came it to the rules
good,Although I am seeking for a new job I enjoyed working at Panera Bread. I love all the employees. The enviornment is great but I do not like the shortage of hours and horrible pay. I also did not like how you apply for a certain postion but put you in other postions that do not pertain to what you applied. The scheduling began to interfere with my school so that is why I am seeking a new job. I also discovered food is not for me
good,"Overall, Panera Bread is a great place for young adults who enjoy being involved and active. Panera Bread definitely tests your skills and abilities within the food service industry and customer service."
good,"I loved working at Panera.  Great pay, great people (mostly), great environment. Easily top 3 jobs I've ever had. Advancement is super quick if you can keep up and learn FAST. Worked a solid 35-40 hours a week(overtime if they needed it). The only downside I had was the management at my specific café. When you're forced to do your general managers job for her, it gets old quick. She'd use you up, and toss you out. Made all kinds of false allegations. So I left. Long story short, if you have a good management team, it's a wonderful place to work."
good,"customer service, food line, prep food. I've learned the safety through out the company and being aware of others and for your self. One of the best things for the job is interacting customers and trying new foods. Dealing with food is a hard job and trying to be safe dealing with allergies and diets and making the right ordering through out many different orders."
good,"its a friendly environment its a lot of team work,its not dirty its a clean place. everything is always in order. we all stick to the rules in there"
good,"Great work environment, Love the people I work with and all of the customer's are wonderful. But Managers do not discipline the people who are not doing what they are supposed to be doing and lack communication."
good,"I learned how to multitask and work in a very fast paced environment while keeping all products to company standards.  I worked with friendly, fun people.  Working during the day, I was able to meet several of the company's higher ups."
good,Panera Bread was good with caring about their customers also in their care for their clients. Panera Bread had good management also they were very organized.
good,Working at Panera Bread is a very fast pace work place. You always have to keep cleaning so it is not a gross environment or food violation. You have to keep the guest happy and ready to answer questions. Some employees do tend to be lazy and I have to pick up their slack. I have learned how to work a food line and how the restaurant business works. The hard part about the job is usually during the rushed and you have a lot of stuff to do and you have to do it in a short amount of time.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Great working environment"
good,Working at Panera Bread was a good experience and taught me a lot about customer service and food rules. Taught me how to work alone under pressure.
good,I would say I had great training at Panera Bread. I trained for a month as a Shift supervisor. I was long but very helping in my journey of my experience as a manager. Panera is a great company if you have the team and support from upper management.
good,Helps to learn customer service skills its a good first job. Company is getting better as a whole. Management could be a little stronger but overall you get treated well.
good,Panera was a exciting work place. On a daylily basis i would prepare the sandwiches pack them up and deliver them. It was a go go go company with lost of volume in the store. management was the best at helping the would stand back and watch for the most part.
good,Productive work place with a great management team. Strict rules and requirements but it is a decent job. Wonderful and understanding colleagues had great pleasure in learning from them.
good,"i enjoyed working with Bread co the staff and the customers are really nice, very fast paced, a typical day would be tending to customers making food and cleaning your work area. the hardest part is to make food at a high quality given the time expected."
good,Panera Bread is very sanitary and clean. Management is sometimes confusing. Not very much opportunity for promotions or raises. They do not offer benefits to part-time workers. They are good about giving breaks. Over all not a bad place to work.
good,"Great environment, Nice associates to work with, Great place to work, great food, nice customers to talk to. can be hectic sometimes at lunch and dinner time when you start running out of product and having to deal with phone ins and a long line."
good,most enjoyable part of the job is seeing customers leave with getting the best and rapid service  possible that they leave with great satisfaction
good,Managers are always on top of shifts and daily tasks. You know what they expect from you every day. Tasks are pretty consistent to what area you work in but work load varies quite a bit.
good,This was my first job and I worked my way up to a trainer. I taught myself on all of the positions and was never trained myself. I am eager to learn new skills and I want to grow and learn as much as possible.
good,"not a bad place to work, coworkers are cool, managers know what they are doing, most customers are nice, overall a good job"
good,"A typical day at work would be a busy day. Since the cafe is located in the South Loop of Chicago, there is always a high volume of customers from opening hours to closing hours. This position has allowed me to not only advance in my customer service, but also learn how to function when having to work at a fast-pace. The cafe's overall ambiance is always positive, for customers who come in are always welcomed with a calm and relaxing environment to work or to have lunch. The management is not always understanding of the hard-work that the employees give. Mainly all of the employees are stressed out due to how busy the cafe is."
good,Panera is a great job for managers or employees just stating out in the industry. They have amazing tools and systems and tools that help to make the staff and managers successful.
good,"Great place to work, Just to far for me to travel with only a few hours,"
good,"I enjoyed my work at Panera, I successfully cash handled, took orders, served food and beverages, and trained in new employees."
good,"I work a minimum of 50 hours a week with a inconsistent schedule .I enjoy the employees we have and they enjoy working for me. I have learned all aspects of the job and have worked my way up over the last 11 years. I have been a part of the interviewing and hiring process, have written schedules for up to 50 employees, and have currently been taking over the food cost inventory roll. I enjoy the fast pace environment and have become better at multitasking as well as my customer service skills,  but have a difficult time with the inconsistent schedule."
good,"It was a new location, so business was a bit slow."
good,Working with Panera bread was an eye opening experience.  You are expected to work in a fast paced environment and get everything done that you wish you had more time to make more eye appealing to the customer.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Panera Breads atmosphere speaks for its image of the warm and welcoming cafe its been brought up to be. The employees and management keep their attentive, sincere and friendly attitude no matter what situation they are put in. All co-workers give their customers that close welcoming vibe that allows each customer that regularly enters the reason to call the cafe ""My Panera"". For the most part all jobs have their ""pros and cons"", but to pin-point on each subject of the good and the bad are listed in the following:"
good,"The job is physically difficult with multiple tasks to focus on. I learned to keep my stress level under control in an environment where I had to stay focused, and on point, for myself and customers. Management was always available for questions and willing to help when needed. The co-workers were, mostly friendly, however, when tensions became high, professionalism, between co-workers, became a low priority. The job became difficult when I had my own responsibilities to attend to as well as the the issues of other co-workers. I really enjoyed being able to work with other people and handle multiple concerns and responsibilities."
good,"A typical day at work was excellent, I've learned to treat customers in satisfying way to make them return, managers was not helpful but was very rude and disrespectful, the hardest part was working a 10 hour shift with only 30 minutes breaks and the most enjoyable time is when you didnt have to deal with rude managers who did not want to help employees nor customers."
good,"Working for Panera Bread was fun, but the managers were never on the same page so it made it hard to get things done. Employees were great. I would walk in at five AM and open the store which consisted of putting pasties up, or doing coffees, counting the safe, setting drawers up. The hardest part was having one manager tell you to something then another tell you different. The best part was the regulars that came in everyday they were always kind."
good,"I enjoyed Panera because the staff/management were fun and pretty compassionate. Management was sincere and also fun to work with. "
good,It was safe and very social. My most enjoyment part of my job was talking to the customers.
good,My position at Panera Bread is fun and simple. I enjoy working with and assisting the bakers. The hardest part of the job is working third shift then being a stay at home mom during the day.
good,"Cutting, molding and baking goods overnight for morning, supervise other employees, workplace maintenance, inventory"
good,"I love being around my customers , just knowing their names and going above and beyond for them and achieve that end result is amazing. I have been in my current role for 7 years and have taken part in every aspect of the café at one time or another from understanding the P&L to the daily operations and the cleanliness of the café . The hardest  part of the job has to be the changes it is going through , and although change can be a good thing when the most important focus (our guests) is put on the back burner and not deemed so important for the time being then the change becomes an interruption."
good,For the most part is a great first job. The management is alright. Great atmosphere and the chance to meet nice people.
good,"Communicated clearly and positively with co-workers and management."
good,"I was absolutely miserable the entire year i work for the panera bread in voorhees,nj. All the managers were lazy except one. I was there for 14 months & not once did i get to move from dinning to cashier no matter how times i express interest that."
good,"I enjoyed the fast paced environment. I learned many great things like the use of a up to date cash register, Batista and great customer service. The hardest part was the lunch rush, and the high turn over rate."
good,"Prepared all items of the bakery working with fresh dough breads, pastries, cookies, muffin and brownies.  Training new bakers and taking ownership for decisions, without requiring guidance from upper management"
good,"I started off as an hourly associate and was to become the main prep cook combined with dishwashing afterwords. The first shift everyone takes is a dining room shift, you serve people their food, bus their tables for them, and hourly keep rotating four batches of hot coffee. Then I was asked after becoming a handy prepper to choose between cooking on the line or cashier, i chose cooking first"
good,"Clock in and start working right away. Setting up everything for the say; including stocking papergoods, food, baking, keeping in touch with other employees on what is out of stock or needs to be done."
good,Enjoyed the work but challenging to be in food service. Scheduling was great. Very high paced environment.
good,The job was pretty fun besides some unprofessionalism with 1 particular manager.
good,"It was a fun place to work and I met a lot of different people. However, the management was intense, overbearing and paid little attention to the scheduling needs of the employees."
good,It was my first and current job. They are a good company to work for and move up in if it is your desired career.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Very difficult to advance to manager position once pigeon-holed into a supervisor position.  They move you around to multiple locations in different districts (""as a favor"") where you don't get adequate written reviews regularly.  When it's time to have the promotion discussion, they move you again.  Raises are given once a year and are usually very low and range from a paltry .07 to a whopping .50.  "
good,Pay was ok if you got overtime.  Management was so-so.  The General Manager is great.  The Assistant needs to go.  Many people quit because of her. My co-workers were the best part of my job.
good,"The hardest part of the job was during lunch hours when we would go non-stop for 2hours, but it also made time fly by. The company is very Community-oriented so plenty of guests greeted us with pleasure and ddi not complain much. "
good,"You spend your time working with getting guests their needs as a priority. You are cleaning otherwise. Because they hold you to a higher standard with guest interaction, you learn to offer your best services. Managers are what make and break the place. There were some who lead exemplary crews and loved what they did. Others didn't make it that far. Co-workers were a reflection of the manager staff. The hardest part of the job is its fast unpredictable pace. The best part of the job is having the opportunity to work with great employees"
good,"I started working for Panera right after my big move from California to Quincy, MA. I was welcomed with open arms an made very comfortable, quickly. I advanced into the role of Associate Trainer quite quickly which allowed me to utilize my skill set I acquired working through the years as a facilitator of knowledge."
good,When leaving the company if you are promised a bonus make sure you stay employed until you receive the bonus.
good,"Nothing was bad, its literally an average work experience."
good,I enjoyed the coffee shop atmosphere but each night during closing we had to clean all the shelves and bag all the bread and carry to the back. Very hard labor. Management was not like the video training courses.
good,"Working at Panera bread enriched me with qualities a worker should have in the customer service field. At Panera our goal is to ""WOW"" every customer and make sure the customer leaves with the up-most satisfaction. The managers are very enthusiastic about their job and keep the employee's motivated to do a better job every day. At Panera we are complimented all the time about how fast we work and the great customer care we provide. In my personal opinion the hardest part working at Panera is the occasional customers that probably had a rough day at work or home, and trying to make their day ten times as better than when they first walk through those doors, but I try my best. The most enjoyable part working at Panera is our team-work. Everyone comes to work with the same goal and same motivation, and it makes working more enjoyable and easier!"
good,"It was enjoyable. I enjoyed my customers and emplers. I learned how to deal with money, cashier drawers and train others."
good,"I'm out of the store most of the day delivering orders to the customers, but I do work with the production team also. Ive learned what's its like to work in a fast past environment and still be sufficient. Our management and co workers haves instilled in us to be team players.the hardest part of the job is nothing.and the most enjoyable part of the job is just being in a enviroment where feel like everyone is family"
good,Fast-paced work environment with a great management team. Typical day is all manual labor.
good,"i learned to communicate better with my fellow employees by working as a team or helping other employees when im not busy, i like everyone i work with, which is one of the main reasons i enjoy working at Panera Bread, and the managers were nice, but they never gave me a raise or gave me advancement though."
good,"They offer flexible hours and good paid time off each year. However, a lot of the employees can be inconsistent resulting in call outs and late arrivals. Sometimes they aren't able to be fully staffed due to turnover which can be really stressful. Good work culture being built. They have an emphasis of customer relations and go far to make each customer happy."
good,very understaffed and it wasnt the most sanitary. The hours were decent. There were a bunch of minors so it was kind of poorly run. They do try their best to satisfy customers though.
good,"I only worked there for a short time. you were given many task, all my co-workers were friendly. i didnt like that we as employees had to divide the work amongst our selves not given specific jobs. but if you worked closing shifts you could take home the leftover pastries."
good,"for me salary started at $10. working at panera can be really fun sometimes but it can also be really overwhelming with rush hours and 1-3 people in each section of the store. customers can also be very rude and unaware of their actions and personally i end up feeling drained by the end of my shifts because i’ve dealt with so many people. customers are widely older, richer people, at least for my store there is a lot of entitlement. also there aren’t really any benefits. 65% off when you’re working and no discount when you’re not working. so there is never free food unless you take it with or without permission."
good,"I used to work at Panera Bread, customer service was so much better than how it is now, it was more clean and better ratings. But really needs to improve a bit more."
good,The location has had five general managers in just over three years. The staff changes constantly due to disagreements to the changes and lack of accurate evaluations and raises. The store has changes owners and things are looking better with new district managers and owners. The lack of competitive wages lends to hiring high school students which means constant need to develop new leadership  and associates values/work ethics
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Panera is a great company but lacks any sort of skill with, both, prepping and organization. "
good,its not a bad job pretty easy if your good at mulitiply casing. overnight can be tiring but the pay is good plus their benefits and 10 off a meal and drinks.
good,Panera bread is a fast pace working environment so you have to keep up. But the management isn’t up to par and also pay rate is too low for me for the amount of work I am putting into the job. Coworkers are cool. Developed some friendships. If the management was better than the job would be better.
good,"Panera is great place to work at. I made a lot of new friends and learned how to cook and bake bread/cookies. Panera Bread was very organized and I actually liked working there. Til one day we had new management and the new manager just happened to be a big racist biggot. He used to gloat about how much he loved Trump and he ""Jokingly"" gestured about lynching me. When I complained to HR about it, they said they could do nothing about it. Which led me to leave Panera Bread. Great job, but they need better employee training."
good,"Average to slightly above average job for entry level to experienced workers. Coworkers were great, management was alright. They stuck to my schedual but as I grew more experienced I was working more undesired times."
good,"Too much put off on others, no one cleans in the daytime, always short handed, no one really cares about the other guy, they make huge messes and dont clean up after themselves,  put it on closer which sucked"
good,I had multiple problems with management with my pay and how many hours I needed to work. They would cut hours without reason and when you were working you were short staffed. I was also promised a certain amount I would be paid when I was hired and they paid me $1 less than what was agreed and when I brought it up I was told there was nothing they could do.
good,"working at Panera you had to learn all positions and work them all in one shift. very stressful at times due to being short handed. Even though being short handed, the team worked together."
good,"My particular location struggled to treat associates fairly, pay them fairly, and respect their given availability and time outside of work. They were very good at trying to improve product quality constantly and making sure everyone knows about the products."
good,"I worked for them for just about a decade- enough time to watch the company do a 180 on its initial goals and aims. It’s not the worst job, but there are significantly better options. If you’ve been there for 15years plus, you have a decent deal. If you are newer than that, your pay is low, opportunities to advance are low, the benefits have been chipped away over the last 10 years. I’m glad I left, but I’m grateful for the management experience."
good,"I had to deck scrub the whole dining room by myself with no help. I would express how I didn’t like walking the back hallways by myself or going into the men’s restroom during my shift, and all my manager would say is that it’s apart of my job. This was my first job ever and I’m not used to everything and I felt like I had no help, especially during closing. I did everything and the manager was always “trying” to help me. But I still had a lot of work left to do."
good,I like Panera but I feel it would be better as a second job not the first. I have been with the company as a whole for almost 11 years and I feel it is not easy to hold on too when they prefer to promote outside of the company.
good,"Panera really cares about their customers, and is really hard working some managers wasn’t really worried on on task about the right things . But when they were it was a wonderful experience but I believe it’s time for more opportunities for me ."
good,"All in all, it was an okay experience I’ve learned from it and gained from it in numerous ways. Also it was my first job experience with food and working with a team."
good,"I mainly liked working at Panera because it was fast-paced and there was always something to do. Not only was there always a task for me, but I didn't do the same thing every time I was there; I worked in different areas. The only downside of working at Panera for me was that they would schedule me until 10:30 p.m. on school nights at 16, which was fine with me. Although, all employees who closed, including me, would almost every time leave around 12 p.m. only because there was so much to do while closing, and that affected my schooling by making me feel really tired the next day."
good,"I worked for this company for over 6 years. The compensation as a manager was great and so the benefits. It’s difficult to advance unless you have the right connections  The stressful part was dealing with other managers who didn’t care or don’t have the experience to get the job done and over loading others with incomplete tasks. For most locations the weekends are exhausting and not having good help can be a burden. The standards and policies are written, but no one follows. Employees leave and return whenever they feel like it."
good,This job is pretty simple to learn for the most part.  There's always something to do and the restaurant is almost constantly busy.  Employees who have worked here for a long while will often treat new people coldly and are quick to anger.  Many of them work by their own rules for how to do things rather than follow policy.
good,Panera is a good job for someone looking to work part time and is a fast learner. I feel it is a good first job for teens looking for employment. There is some room for growth and advancement in job opportunities
good,"I was paid and worked fair hours, but fellow employees were bitter with each other in front of customers as well as often bullied each other. Managers would join in or ignore it and told us not to complain."
good,"It is a very high-stress and fast pasted environment, that requires a lot of time and effort. It is also very competitive, but if you are willing to put in the work, you will be able to advance slowly. Connecting with customers and colleagues makes the experience worthwhile."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Panera bread was a temporary job for me but it was one of the most fun jobs I had. They co workers there made me feel like family and there was never a shift without laughs. It is a very quick paced job but does allow you time to learn and develop new skills. Plus their food is amaaazzing.
good,"I had great co workers , customers  were generally  nice , job wasn't  to hard but our new GM made everything  harder on purpose  , yelled and fired employees  on a wimp , treated other managers  like a child"
good,"A typical day begins by setting up for peak hours, multitasking is a major thing for the kind of work involved. Management makes sure everyone is in their position as well as remaining on the line to ensure readiness."
good,"The one thing that seems to keep employees at Panera amongst all the stress is the family atmosphere. That is important because you won't have time to see your own once you're there, especially as a manager."
good,"I would recommend Panera as a job to those who are looking to find their first job, and if they don’t mind dealing with irate customers and hit or miss managers."
good,"This is a company with great views when it comes to it's surrounding communities. They care a lot about their customers. The company will go out of it's way to make sure the customer's are happy. However, the work life balance and the amount of work on the associate/manager side, is not given the same amount of effort."
good,"Driving for Panera is good for a temporary job. If you plan on staying for longer that 2-4 years, you'll probably lose your mind. It's a good way to supplement your income, but I  wouldn't recommend doing it full time."
good,Overall a great work environment but not much opportunity for growth due to the inability to staff managers in the location I currently work in. This results in an extremely stressful work environment.
good,"Great college job! Even though I was in college full time, I was still able to balance working at Panera for 35-40 hours a week. They were respectful of my study schedule and worked with me if I had finals for which to study."
good,"The job was easy and pretty simple. Personally I found it boring, and the pay wasn't good enough for me to stay. The management was phenomenal though."
good,"A good place to work if you are just part time. Co workers are great and friendly but be prepare to pick up their slacks. Management is similar to others restaurant--good and bad. Most don't stick around for very long, especially the shift leads. They are very compromising on your schedule which is very good and also the benefits such as health insurance, vision, and dentist is affordable (which is a big plus). "
good,I've worked here for 3 years and was ALWAYS passed over for someone that I trained. other than that the pay was decent but the paid time off always comes in slow.
good,"Very bad pay rate, fast paced , and stressful, great management , the experience is great to have . I learned new customer service techniques, bad pay"
good,It taught me good customer service and being able to interact with customers in all types of scenarios. It was a fast pace learning environment also teaching you how to multitask. Hard parts of the job were being understaffed and stocking out a lot of items.
good,working at Panera was a lot of fun. the people  I worked with were the reason I stayed there for so long. the management was okay but there was this one that was so rude to me and he is the reason I left.
good,"The company is great and upper management as well. Just severely understaffed, which affects everybody. Other than that it’s a positive, rewarding environment."
good,"Its a good work environment, the thing i like most about the place if you work hard you will get rewarded.  Hardest part of the job would be the lunch rush and the most enjoyable part of the job would be preparing the food and challenging yourself."
good,"Panera is an excellent way to work up the chain. You could go from dishwasher to manager in one year, which is what I did. The pay is not the best, especially with everything getting more expensive and evaluations are set to happen, but never do. The environment is super fast paced (depending on which location you work at) so you’ll need to keep up. Panera does a lot more for their employees than most companies. These really push for safety by having tools and procedures in place as well as enforcing them. The atmosphere is great, but when not maintained and run by caring, energetic, and decent managers, it could be a really bad place to work. In addition, Panera has waaayy too many standards and expectations for the pay. Too much work is expected to be done for 0.15 more than minimum wage..."
good,"Management isn't as good as it could be but it isn't terrible. A typical day can be stressful because it seems as though most of the work ends up on the people who have been there longer rather than the new hires. The relationships made with my coworkers are the most enjoyable about my job, it makes going to work bearable. The hardest part would be dealing with the favoritism the managers all have because many get away with certain things they shouldn't get away with . Not saying all Panera's are like this but the particular one i work at is."
good,"While it was an easy job to learn, the people were not very pleasant to work around. There was constant drama as well as management being all over the place. This was years ago, so they could have changed their ways."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Panera Bread overall was a good company to work for, if they didn't like you they made things very difficult. I had a very good staff and management team so it made my job much easier."
good,"In catering it is a team of 2, we went in super early and worked non stop for 8 to 10 hours. We prefored everything for setting up the line to taking orders and setting up"
good,"Working at  Panera Bread was a fun experience, but it did not pay enough and i was always over worked. Panera Bread has taught me a lot of positive things and i am forever thankful."
good,"I worked at Panera for about four months. I really enjoyed the job at first, but after about a month of working there, I began to quickly dislike the job. First off, the managers never schedule enough people to handle the rushes at lunch and dinner hours. There have been countless times where I was the only cashier working while there was a line almost going out the door. The managers also started getting into a habit of not scheduling enough people on weekends, which sometimes led to people waiting more than 20 minutes for their food, and created a lot of stress on me and my coworkers. At Panera, you will also be expected to fulfill duties for a position you never signed up for. I applied to only be a cashier for the company, yet I also worked as a barista and they even put me into the dining room a couple of times without having any training for these positions.  The managers also got into a habit of scheduling me to hours that were out of my availability. Furthermore, there were many occurrences where I went almost six hours without receiving a break. This job honestly made me really stressed and I dreaded almost every shift I had. I know all cafes are probably not like this, but this location really needs to improve their management if they want long-term employees."
good,"Working at this specific Panera was difficult and physically straining. Management was failing at the time due to the fact that half of the workers had quit. We were always low on people and could not do our jobs properly. Workplace culture was really poor, a lot of swearing and gossip. Often workers would even sit down and do nothing when the restaurant is not busy, instead of cleaning or restocking. However, worker benefits were great - discounts off of our meal and work schedule was flexible...sometimes I argue that it was too flexible."
good,"We have catering, delivery, drive thru, and counter service. Add in fresh baked goods and that is a lot of things that need managing. We were busy but it wasnt as demanding as other jobs that i have held."
good,"I enjoyed my time there, although at times they made me do mundane cleaning tasks and no one else had to do them. We did receive a lot of free food however which was nice."
good,"When fellow employees walk in to work they do not come in to work for the sake of work. They come in to work for their paycheck. Each employee seemed to not enjoy their work. An example is that the employees' eyes are usually on the clock or their phone looking at the time, waiting for their shift to finish."
good,"i honestly love my experiences at Panera Bread. I met some amazing people here, and i also learned how to manage my time better. Especially with me being a  student."
good,"This is a fast past job and they do hire all ages. since I've been there I learned how to prepare the food, make drinks and stock. Panera bread hire all cultures and the staff is friendly."
good,Good atmosphere. I enjoyed my time with Panera Bread. They compensate their management team well and they offered really good benefits. Every location is different but would recommend Panera to anyone.
good,"Felt very ""everyone for themselves,"" environment in my personal location. Little if any chance for advancement, become responsible for everyone else on your shift. Must pick up slack where others lack. Was not a team effort at all. Management changed at least once a month."
good,I simply like the fact employees shows gratitude and help you out.  As well as things being in order and donate their breads . One thing i don't like about it is the lunch rush in the morning. Especially when the customers leave their plates and etc on the table .
good,At the Panera I was at I worked with the best people and honestly had the best managers. We all got along really well and all worked together really well. I only left because of the lack of job advancement even though to be real I was their best dishwasher. Not that that’s a huge accomplishment but I deserved to learn more.
good,"Work for Panera for 6 months as a delivery driver, too keep it short and sweet it wasn't too bad. A lot kids working there though, Mangement was pretty good, and they were flexible with schedule. I treated the job like a side chick"
good,your constantly doing something you never get to sit down or even just stand there. If your not making food then your restocking or cleaning. They always have you doing something.
good,"Job isn't bad, management is nice.  Lack of benefits and odd hours are kind of a problem for me though.  Staffing is low as well, causing a lot of stress on the employees that are there due to being short handed."
good,"It was delightful working for this company until bought out by the flynn company where they put caps on raises and hired in lower. Which resulted in a lower quality of employees. Also it, discouraged anyone who got capped from wanting to advance in the company as you'd have to take a pay decrease in order to take a higher position."
good,Management makes things easier for you if you talk to them about problems or things that can improve the work environment for you. flexible with ours when in school. Enjoyed being able to help out customers and make them smile. The job improved my people skills and customer service. hardest part on the job was coworkers not seeing eye to eye. the pay could be better. Overall a decent place to work
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"The reason I ended up quitting Panera bread was because when I had my thyroid removed, they told me my Dr. note was fake and I was to work the shifts I was required to on my schedule. I ended up sitting because I felt that was extremely unfair as an employee."
good,Panera Bread is definitely a great place to start as your first job. There is plenty of room to learn new things & advance. It is very fast pace & very much one of those jobs where you need to be a quick thinker & learn fast. There is always someone available to teach you anything you may not know or need more help on but overall it is expected that you adapt to the environment quickly.
good,"Panera is a very paced breakfast, lunch, and dinner bakery. Everything is made in house daily by bakers who are constantly at the bakery. They even have night shifts that are about from late night to early morning. Everything is for sure fresh there. It is very difficult to get every order perfect within 3 minutes or less."
good,"I love the people at Panera bread, I just strongly dislike working there. all my coworkers and I suffer together lol Its just super stressful and labor intensive, the food service is not for me."
good,"Panera was a job I took to supplement my earnings. I worked at 2 locations. The team was upbeat and young -- some showed responsibilities and some never lasted.--  i As with any job, one needs to make the best of it."
good,"great people to work with."
good,"I’ve been here 1 1/2 years and STILL have yet to receive a raise. I’m getting paid 8.25 and i’m 20. my younger sister works there too, she’s 17 and she’s getting paid 8.75. LOL this is ridiculous everyone has gotten their raise BUT me so thats why i’m looking for a new job.  they are also always hiring, but they’re also sending people home way too early because they don’t have enough hours to give."
good,It was a hard drive to work at because you had to keep doing that job while doing another task that you had at my location. Also when I was there I was asked and do a lot of things that my bosses couldn't do.
good,I think that working at panera made me see tht not all companies are the same and they really couldn’t control their employees and we’re unfortunately pretty unfair
good,"On a typical day of work, you will either be assigned register, line prep, dining room, barista, dishes or you may alternate between 2 positions based on how busy the cafe is. Based on prior experience in your resume they may put you where they think is the strongest or train you for a new position. No matter where you're at it's best to prep whatever you need early, help other people if your not busy or if the cafe is very slow, stay on top of tracking day dot times/refresh items. Management is good. Their nice and helpful especially when the cafe is busy with lunch hours + dinner. The workplace culture is steady. Quite a few people have worked there for some years, and people become friends. When the cafe is extremely busy, it can be hectic and people rushing to make sure everything is right or working very fast. In any workplace setting, there are people who you would rather avoid. The hardest part of the job was trying to complete everything(day dots, restocking, wiping down tables, starting dishwasher before dishes pile up) before a cafe rush, and during long periods the cafe was busy/crowded. The most enjoyable part was some of the staff and getting employee discounts on the food they days you worked."
good,"I've been with Panera Bread for about 3 years now, I enjoy the work but it can be stressful at times.  You're required to have experience in at least three different positions mine being Cashier, Dining Room and Dishwasher.  You're also required to switch between positions on demand during any of your shifts.  Always be fast, friendly, and on your game each and everyday.  Keep a smile on your face even if you're upset or sad always stay professional.  "
good,The customers are rude and ignorant. This wasn’t a team environment and they workers barely got along. When asked for a raise I was told to keep up the good work.
good,"Panera Bread has a welcoming presence but a stressful and hectic work environment. Breaks are short, and often scheduling can pile up, especially on young people. I recommend this job to people who are in need of a full-time work commitment."
good,"Overall, it was a great experience. I was able to learn to work in a fast paced environment and obtain great customer service. I met a lot  of great co-workers and participated in many work related events with them."
good,"It truly is a fun place to work, co-workers and staff are very welcoming to new faces which makes the transition easier. However, if you are scheduled for the mornings your day will start around 4 am, and if you are scheduled at night you most likely will not get of work until 11 or later."
good,I enjoyed my time at Panera despite my differences I had there. You learn new things and meet a lot of different people and ethnicity’s. I also enjoy a lot of they healthy meals they have.
good,There is always something to do and a task to complete. It gets very busy and you have to move fast to keep up with the high pace environment. Its important to do your job the best as possible so its not a harder day for everyone else.
good,"When there are breakfast, lunch, or dinner rushes, everything becomes chaotic and everyone becomes very stressed. Not the type of work environment for me, but maybe for someone who enjoys working under immense pressure."
good,"It was okay, run fairly unorganized. Fairly flexible when it came to scheduling around school. Poorly staffed and The good workers were sometimes held accountable for the actions of the poor workers without proper compensation. 65% discount 30 before or after shift or during break."
good,"There is a lot of favourtism, whether your a harder worker then the others or not, managers chose the ones they liked, such as, hung out with them on smoke breaks or small talked during breaks. I didn't do that, I was there to work through the day, go home and study (I was in school). But I began to noticed that, that the workers who were messy, and slacking, were getting more hours, and ""higher privilege"" than I. It wasn't right; though it didn't start out like that. It was fair at the start, and for some reason everything changed. Though I do believe that the reason changed was because one of the managers who had everything under control, left, and then everything went down hill."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Great company overall, my specific location had some issues with culture and lack of strong leadership. Our General Manager is ready for retirement and it seemedas though he had given up. Employee turnover was at an alarming rate and several good employees were getting burned out."
good,"I enjoyed my time working at panera It was only short lived because I need to advance in the work place and they didnt allow me to do so. The people were great, the food was great."
good,i love the service and the taste of the bread. but my staff was always at neck and neck when stuff is not done on their time. the job could really use a new way of moving product .
good,"Panera is a fast-paced work place and the job can get very stressful at times which is the reason I feel that those who dedicate themselves to their work should be paid fairly. If associates were paid what they deserved, Panera would be an amazing place to work."
good,Panera is a good environment but can really trying and stressful at times. The job is very flexible and they work with your schedule most of the time. management is good and the coworkers are good people.
good,"I love working at Panera, I want to advance quicker that they are able, That is the only reason I would leave. I love working with my fellow workers and Managers and I absolutely love the customers!"
good,Working for Panera was ok.  If you're an associate the pay is great and the work life balance exists. If you become management there is no work life balance.  No consistent schedule.  Its random and you end up tired all the time.
good,Panera bread is a exceent company which has the flexibility and work style of fast food work but is more upscale. It's a place with many different opportunitys.
good,"Although Panera bread was extremely quick paced and we were always busy and short staffed, the Management was very pleasant and nice to work with. For a very busy pastime job with good pay i would definitely work here."
good,"Panera Bread is a good place to work at but it has its drawbacks."
good,"Even though this place is still technically considered fast food, it is more upscale. The food is so much healthier and the menu items were constantly changing. It was always fast-paced, especially during rush hour. Every so often, we would hold a Bread Bash, which was like a staff meeting where we tried food that was newly being introduced to the menu or ones that were making a comeback. My manager at the time was a total sweetheart and did whatever he could to help me out, even if that meant correcting my hourly wage. Otherwise, some of the staff can be hit or miss. Some are friendly, while others couldn't care less. Any day you worked a shift, you were able to make a food/drink purchase with 65% off. Overall, this place was decent."
good,"Every location is really different, management changes often so procedures and standards are never consistent. The associates re really what makes working there bearable."
good,"Very busy, a lot of work for one person."
good,"Panera Bread could be fast paced, training is overwhelming, and management was not the best. Benefits were available and they encourage advancement within the company."
good,"Too many stressful situations and oversights that could have been avoided, severe lack of interest in creating solutions for said situations by management. lack of staffing caused workflow overload the majority of the time"
good,Panera is a good place to work at. You have great co workers you have your regulars that come in and you get to make a great connection with people. Management could use a little help.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,panera is a company that you would love to work for everybody has an uplifting spirit. their generous and always make sure that their employees are taking care of..
good,"had lots of fun with coworkers, although the management was lacking. I learned to work better in groups to get a better outcome. Customer service was my favorite part, just ensuring happiness."
good,"Basic restaurant job. There were good days and bad days, some people clashed with some other people, sometimes there were very busy stressful days and sometimes it was relatively slow and steady. Overall not terrible, but I never intended to stay with the company forever."
good,Panera was great when ran by original bread . When original bread sold then positions were cut and pay was cut and people were devalued by pay. For original bread you got great health care and great.pay and fringe benefits. The new company is a multibillion dollar company and the owner lives in San Francisco.
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with, but not the work that I did. It was a difficult job for not a lot of money, and I worked there longer than most, and wanted to advance, but no open advancement opportunities."
good,If you ever need money I would recommend going to work at Panera because it is a good brand and creates high quality food. Working at Panera was a great experience for me as a young person and it was beneficial for my future endeavors because it helps with your customer service skills and relationships with co-workers.
good,Panera was a great place to start in the food industry. There was a lot to learn and a lot of room for advancement. It was a quick-paced environment that kept you on your toes.
good,"Night crew (bakers, assistants, trainers, etc) were outstanding. The daytime members of Panera were horrible. "
good,"Panera Bread was a fast paced or very slow working enviornment. It varied basically as busy in the mornings and slow at nights. Management was up & down with great managers and sub par managers. Culture was fun and upbeat for the most part. Hardest part was finding people to cover your shift or always deviating from your duties to help someone else, especially when closing. The most enjoyable part was after shifts getting discounted food or free pastries."
good,"While I have enjoyed my experiences working at Panera Bread, it was simply a placeholder while I sear searched for a better opportunity. I would not return to work there again."
good,"Panera is all about speed of service. In catering you're in charge of making the food, doing paper, delivering the food, following up with clients and making sure everything is ready for the next day. COMMUNICATION IS KEY"
good,"While the Cally Panera's weren't up to the snuff of the ones in Tennessee and Florida, it wasn't horrid and was fairly good as a placeholder job, not to say you can't grow, but its hard to be noticed"
good,"Between the volume of customers and amount of work expected out of the employees it can be a stressful, fast-paced job. Even if it doesn't seem like it, every possible position here is a customer service position. There's a 99% chance you will talk to customers on every single one of your shifts."
good,typical day depends on your shift. line cook prepped salads/sandwiches and made sure soups/mac and cheese was thermalized to serve for customers. management was horrible all they care about is bonus pay and not being over hours so they can cash out at the end of the year. hardest part was having no upper level management to look up to. enjoyable part was being around hard working employees.
good,"They do try to make it a good place to work. they offer incentives for accident free time periods. The HR lady was the absolute best! She was always so kind, helpful, and sent me a card when I was on bereavement. She even offered me more time than was in the handbook."
good,"Positive work environment. All workers give their all, so you're not alone. Quick and easy learning. It offers a lot of benefits after working there for a while."
good,"It was a nice job, very balanced and well managed. Very amicable environment. All employees were clean and well cared toward Panera equipment and food products."
good,"Panera is a largely, customer driven restaurant in the sense that many of the drinks are self-served (soda, coffee, and teas) along with the condiments that compliment said beverages (sugar, creamers, napkins, lids for cups, etc...). The theme of the store is premium fast-food. I like to compare Panera to a fast-paced version of Olive Garden due to the organic pastas, bread, salads, and soups that are offered by the restaurant, but with an emphasis on very low customer waiting times (Ideally food is served to customers less than 5 minutes after they walk through the door). Smoothies and lemonade/green tea are prepared at the barista, pastries are served at the register, and all other food items for lunch/dinner are prepared on a sandwich line."
good,I liked working with the people. But management is something of a circus. Because different managers have different rules and ways they want things done. Also they don't really communicate with each other that will t.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"I greatly enjoy the people I work with, but I cannot afford an apartment or anything else even at 35 hours a week. The customers can be rude and intense. There's always something to do and I was given the opportunity to learn other jobs parts, i.e. line, expo, and dish. It has it's good moments, but overall, it's just exhausting."
good,"Bad management, rude customers, it was almost as if no one knew what was going on. A completely hectic working environment that I never wish to return to."
good,Customer Service Focused. Friendly Team Members. Great Benefits.  Enjoyable atmosphere with the opportunity to meet great people.  Work life balance is sometimes non-existent.
good,"A typical day is a non stop race from the time I walk in. We work as a team to accomplish goals and get past hurdles. Although I have been with the company for over 10 years, I still find something new to learn each and every day. We are a fast moving company, and consistently aiming to be on the top of the restaurant game. We have amazing teams, and everyone works incredibly hard every day to be the very best in the industry. I love getting to interact with my team, and share my knowledge of the industry and the company with them, as well as training our systems and procedures. Training is my passion, which is why I have loved being a General Manager, and a Training General Manager for the past three years. As a TGM, I have been responsible for training all new managers for south and east county cafes, along with some in north county. The job is fun, but demanding."
good,"Managers and employees are what made working at Panera fun!  Most of the times, it was stressful due to trying to serve many customers in a reasonable amount of time."
good,Panera Bread moves as a team. I learned how active food service can become. Work area can be hectic at times. The hardest part was lack of communication. The most I did enjoyed while working with Panera was the customers.
good,"I truly enjoyed working for the company. Management and staff made it fun to work there. Learn allot from being on the production line, and working as a cashier."
good,This job is constant fast paced and the co-workers aren't the friendly and the atmosphere of the work was just terrible and the co-workers were inappropriate
good,"It was hard to get the hours I needed, managers didn't adjust the schedule after several complaints and I had to constantly pick up shifts from coworkers. The job was moderately-paced and the pay was good for my first job."
good,"A normal day in Panera is fast paced, multiple problems and solutions, full of energy, and satisfying. I get to make my customers smile with great service and quality food. The employees are a great time unit working and laughing through their shift."
good,"Costumers mainly made the experience working there worst. Often had to mange the food line by myself, which was fine til closing time when I had to clean and close the line down which took a long time. I got little to no breaks, which isn't fair because all the employees who smoked got breaks. but overall its not a hard job."
good,Everyone is friendly and hard working. I learned food preparation and new customer service skills. It is a busy location. It's very clean and well oriented.
good,"Panera bread was my very first job, Working here taught me a lot the good and the bad.Panera was always a good company until they start laying off employees and managers .The job beccame more challenging being as though i had to do most of the work that others slack on or dont do at all."
good,Working with panera bread was a good first time job experience. I stayed with them for 2 years. They slowly promote you but it can be done. You can earn more hours by working really hard and showing that you care. The customers are friendly .
good,"When I was in school it was hard to work at the same time, but now that I'm out of school I have too much free time on my hands. I treat  customers nice and I work well with others."
good,"Panera being a restaurant always got busy, so it was very fast pace with customers and being able to accomplish everything on time. I loved the people I worked with, but at times the management got to be poor and they would schedule me when I was in class after giving them my schedule."
good,"I loved working at Panera Bread. The customers were amazing, the job itself was fun and easy. But when they were going to let me go because I took two days off for a family funeral, I decided to leave."
good,"Panera was fun at first, but quickly grew dull after I was made to work the same position day in day out, that the managers knew I did not enjoy. They had me work line (I.E make the food orders) when i would rather clean the dining room or wash dishes and other work that does not deal with food."
good,"Good company to work for. Promotes from within, which can be good for those looking for promotions to management, however it can also cause the management teams to be very inexperienced at times."
good,"As with any job, this one has it's downfalls; occasionally someone is cranky, customers can be rude, etc. But overall, my expirience working at Panera Bread was a positive one. I learned many strategies for engaging customers and gauging how they felt (how much or little I should interact with them) I met many friendly faces and gained friends in my coworkers."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"hard work, determination and always have to pay attention to detail because people buy with their eyes....learned to bake panera way...management was ok, most managers are there for the pay check and really didnt care about the employees...hardest part of the job was having to constantly clean up behind a co baker before you could start your own job...most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the customers happy when their product was on display"
good,"Despite the low pay, I got along with everyone there and enjoyed working with my coworkers.  I was always early and was one of the hardest workers there."
good,Super nice place to work! very easy going! Both the Employees and the Management are quite polite and easy going. I really enjoyed working there.
good,I learned a lot about customer service and learned a little bit more about teamwork and communication.  The most enjoyable part of the job was my coworkers who made the work experience incredibly fun.  The management that I worked for were great.  They were good to me from the moment I was there until the moment that I left.
good,"I have worked at Panera bread for 4 years. After all of the dedication, going home at 12am and going back into work at 4am was not appreciated. There is room for growth in the company but favoritism is alive and well in that company. If you're not pretty, kiss up or work an insane amount of hours, you'll be in the same position. Good for a first time job...but nothing more. They have people who have been grandfathered into the company so how far you grow depends on WHO you know..."
good,This job has very flexible hours.Everybody there is very friendly and very helpful.The hardest part of the job is when there is not enough employees.
good,"My co-workers were nice and some of the managers were nice as well.  A typical day depended on what I was placed on and on how busy the day was.  I would do whatever I was placed on and try to stay on top of things so when we closed we would be out before 10pm, but some times we would not get out until 11 pm.  Whenever I asked for a certain period of time off, I would always feel like I would be punished before going and after returning.  It is very hard to get a raise despite being there for a number of years.  It is a good job to start with, but it is not a good one to stay for a long period of time."
good,"Working in a fast paced company like this is a good chance to see what your made of. The give you chances to move up the ranks in the company and also give you options to transfer to other locations if a move is required. The work place is filled with a plethora of personalities and Characters, most that I will never forget. All in all It was a good experience and considered a stepping stone to lead me to a career for the future."
good,Did not work here for much but experience was good overall. Job was easy but were expected to move quickly. Good experience.
good,A typical day at Panera meant a busy day. You learn to work in a fast paced environment. I knew every part of the store I enjoyed being able to train new associates.
good,"Catering is great, less benefits are being offered than before so that's a down side and also if the store management is helpful then everything usually works out great."
good,It was a fun job to work at and kept me busy. Most managers were cool but one misunderstanding with one and you dramatically lose hours.
good,"Great work environment, the people are very nice with great customer service skills. I help train a lot of our new employees before I was official offered a trainer position. The management was kind of distracting, but overall they got things done. Overall this company was okay."
good,Very stressful it depends on the mood of each employee. I want out of this job because I'm  not happy here management is not helpful at all when you need help they never come to help and they are unprofessional. The managers talk to you like you are a child and the rush you to go on break. I will say the enjoyable part of my job is the customers every once in a blue moon our regulars come and make my day even when my day starts off horriable.
good,"The store management rocked.... they are in tune with the company integrity. however, the bakery side cuts corners and rewards you for being below average and scolds you for being excellent. They are not team players, and treats the day side as if they are the opposing team."
good,Panera is a good company to work for with good salary and advancement opportunities. Expectation of only 45 hours a week.
good,"You don't get paid nearly enough to work as hard (no lunch, no breaks, constant moving and lifting and baking) and the hours aren't set in stone, which is bad news if you're a student and were told not to worry about getting out on time. What apparently was 10-5 is now 12-8 (with a possible extra hour if the manager walks your bake insanely slow). You're almost guaranteed to be working extra if the day shift didn't do what they were supposed to and leave the product out to proof. If you're good at nonstop physical labor and already enjoy baking, I can't tell you not to apply. If you're expecting a job where the manager you need to contact hasn't disappeared somewhere for a week and you need a set schedule, don't apply."
good,I am thankful I was able to gain so much experience in management through this company. The only thing I did not like was how it seemed you absolutely had to kiss up to your boss to get ahead and that was more important than putting in hard work.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,I am just so tired. I work all the time and rarely ever have a day off. I love the company and my boss though. I also enjoy the job alot.
good,this is a great first job for a young person to have it will give you a job skill educate you on the varieties of foods available and the basics in customer service without being a full service restaurant.
good,A typical day at Panera is coming into work greeted by your coworkers early in the morning. Sometimes management acknowledges your presence. The hardest part was working different stations with lines out the door from 12pm-3pm non stop. I learned how to make a variety of salads and different breads I've never known. The best part working there was the trip to Dave & Busters for the hard work we did.
good,"Trained new hires in daily functions"
good,"Cashier Zone Leader"
good,"Enjoyed having the promotion of being a trainer and I would train fellow new employees,"
good,"Suitable for strong, independent thinkers who don't hesitate to make decisions"
good,"A typical day at work goes by pretty slow. My co-workers are very friendly and easy to get along with. It's a easy job also not very hard to adapt too. The work is worth the pay if you're given a great amount of hours. Otherwise it's not really worth being. What I like most about the job is my co-workers. They make me comfortable, they also all seem to have positive attitudes."
good,every day is a outstanding day with happenies laughters and plenty of jokes
good,"A typical day at work is always busy. Ive learned that you cannot trust everyone and that you have to work for you and no one else, some co-workers will help you out all the way but then again there are other that will not and want to see you fail. The hardest part of the job is learning all the different drinks and sandwiches considering they change it every 6 months. The most enjoyable would be the connection you make with some customers."
good,"Good place to work if you are in the food industry. Although, integrity could be improved upon within the company."
good,"Overall, it is a good company to work for. Compensation for associates, associate trainers and managers okay."
good,"Your typical day as an overnight baker at Panera will have you showing up an hour before the end of regular business hours, pulling dough out of walk in refrigerators to sit before baking, baking, receiving the next night's shipment of dough and other foods, baking, pulling more dough, baking, making pastries, baking, cleaning, baking, scoring bread, baking, more cleaning, last minute baking, and then cleaning again."
good,"Always busy. My hours were during lunch time and it was so busy. There were times where they would have to bump (delete) a ticket so others could come and see what to make next, then I would get frustrated since I was new and still didn't learn everything to the fullest. I learned many things throughout that time working with them. Making sandwiches with a style and not just plain. Making different kinds of salads and paninis. my co-workers were great and always helped me when I needed help.."
good,"If you are looking for a first job or need a part time job to bring in a little money it can be an okay place; a better demographic of clients the some of the places I have worked, and most of the locations offer some level of flexibility when setting up your schedule. "
good,"in the early morning there is a rush like mi have never seen before, then constant business to keep you on your feet all day!"
good,"I was a cashier, cook, janitor, stocker...etc. I mean you name it, I did it! It is very versatile and all employees and managers pitched in on everything so it was very team oriented. The area where i worked was very bust so it was never any downtime. I was always on go when I was at work. I learned how to deal with all kinds of customers of all ages and their needs."
good,"delegate, customer service, register, running the shift, make food, catering, prep, truck, bussing, clean, when associate are not follow the proper procedures or protocal"
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"There was no typical day at work. You either came in and it was really busy and they'd throw you on the line or it was really dead and you would stock or clean."
good,Never late. Always working. Stayed calm. Great worker. Dosen't argue with anyone.
good,"I have learned a lot at Panera Bread. Most of all about customer service, and teamwork. I was trained in all areas, front and back of the house. Unfortunately, this job was not challenging enough for me. I prefer to be challenged mentally, and was unable to advance my career here. I did learn exceptional amount about teamwork, and about working with others."
good,"Made the orders that came up on the screen. and on Wednesdays and Saturdays i would put away truck in the frozen section, dry section, and refrigerated section"
good,Bake off various items for following day selling. Hardest part of job is trying to keep a speedy pace all throughout the shift. Most enjoyable part of job is that it's quiet and have few distractions from my work.
good,"All about the shift routine. Pretty predictable, unless you are a high volume store. I have learned a tremendous amount about food and safety. Management is person to person. Everybody does things differently. Co-workers are pretty good normally, nice people. Hardest part would be balancing work/life. Long shifts happen if you get busy. The most enjoyable part for me would be the workplace camaraderie with the whole staff."
good,"➢	Responsible for handling transition of new hires to make on-boarding of new employees seamless"
good,"Fast pace work environment that kept you busy. From washing dishes, prepping for the day, taking orders, to make expresso drinks. Ran by great management."
good,"  I set up the bakery and took orders on the cash register."
good,"My specific store had management that didn't value personal life as a teenager. I was expected to cover my shifts when I was sick with doctor's notes, and either I had too many hours or not enough. If I had worked at a different store I'm sure I would have enjoyed it much more. I worked there for a little over a year and saw a continual decrease in fun and enjoyment."
good,"It was always so busy during the day and dinner time, ive learned a lot there like the many kinds of bread and teamwork. The managment there was a strong solid group i feel they needed more of a backbone. The co-workers were very friendly and fun to be with. The hardest part of the job was drive thru considering Panera works at a slower pace. The most enjoyable part of the job is pleasing the customers and making them satisfied."
good,I loved working for Panera despite being over worked and under paid. That is with any minimum wage job. I got my customer service start here. And i loved my co-workers and managers.
good,Co-workers were nice/kind so everyone got along easily. The job was not very difficult but the hardest part about it was scrubbing the floors and cleaning out the drains while the best part was learning/experiencing something new every day. Management was right on since they were not down your back but gave you space which help me work more efficiently.
good,"Great company and great people to work with. I cleaned dished, served food, food quality and cleaned store. I learned that you cant satisfy everyone. There was an incident where two different managers on site told me to do two different tasks in 2 different locations in the store. I did one of the tasks and got in trouble for not doing the other task, even though i explained that another manager told me to do something. I enjoyed co-workers. The hardest part of the job is keeping up. Most enjoyable part is the co-workers"
good,"Serving and preparing food, taking orders, cleaning tables, etc."
good,"Everything was sort of typical there in a sense, kind of like a herd of cattle. You get a job, they make you watch a video, and you have to do and act that way. The management was very open to making friendships & although fresh coffee is good, they changed it WAY too often."
good,"Even though it was a short experience, the job setting was fun and enjoyable. Though each associate had plenty of responsibility, my co workers and I managed to still keep it enjoyable each day."
good,"I have worked there for almost 8 years, Ive been through 4 GM's and 4 DM's. Its always changing except for the responsibilities. It seems the company doesn't really get the one person can not do more then 3 things and make it comfortable to work there. The expectations are unreasonable"
good,"Panera Bread is a place where it felt like every shift was a team sport, Management Vs. Associates. The day-to-day was fine, workload was decent and manageable, but feedback, information about advancement and interaction with management all seemed like daunting subjects while I was there. I learned much about what nits like to work in the service industry, and i wouldn't take back the time spent there. Its a god first job and the other associates were what made the job enjoyable."
good,"I take orders, fill orders, deliver orders, and set them up. I try to make sure all of my customers can get their orders on time and even if they are last minute I make sure that everyone is happy. My management team has really helped me by telling me its okay to ask for help when I feel like I just can't fit one more order in. I think the hardest part of my job is the high stress you get when you are on such a short time line. I love the challenge though. Every day is like a game to me. It a race, a race to make sure everything and everyone is happy."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"At Panera, the only thing I couldn't do was mix dough. This company will train you in any posistion you show an interest in. Some of the work was mundane and repetetive, but most associates try to enjoy what they do. I was trained to do production planning in the admin office, was the lead sanitor and truely enjoyed working for this company for over nine years."
good,"Learning was easy in the work place but not enough hours or advancements, co-workers were great to be around."
good,"Good theories about integrating the corporation into the community as well as in the minds of its customers. Definitely wants to be seen as a hybrid between fast food and nicer sit-down dining. The act of Catering for this company is great because they provide great marketing tools. As a self-starter with no problems going out into the community, catering coordinating was a great fit for me. The hardest part of the job is working against last year's sales, especially if you're working against someone else's numbers."
good,"It was a fun job to experienced . About team working , baking , preparing those amazingly delicious food ."
good,"I liked working at Panera on Neil St until I got on medical leave for a week or so and then it went down hill from there. I had been there for over 3 months and loved the job that I did. I was a delivery driver for them and only delivery driver. I had also been tellinf them that I wanted to be trained for cashier, but nothing happened there. "
good,Working there made me happy a lot and leaving them will break my heart but it has to be done. Maybe I will return if they can improve a little bit better.
good,everything is in order and they the have a very tight schedule. Breaks can be short and on time. Looks very clean and together. Panera is a very busy place during all the rushes through out the day; lines build up. Fast and easy!
good,It was a decent company to work for as any other company it had its up and downs but over all the people where nice and the managers treated you with the up ministry respect
good,"Only three out of the five managers are actually responsible for schedules being posted on time, and some employees just like to be right up on the managers to try and act like they are in charge. You always have to malamute you do something correctly, because if you use your own idea to help yourself make time go faster, they literally tell you your ide"
good,"Good entry level position with room to grow into higher level positions as time goes on. Work environment is good depending on which cafe you work at, but it’s really about the customers and the experiences they bring in every day."
good,Overall the work environment is a welcoming one. One that has people willing to work with your life outside of work. Get a chance to learn a skill set you can use in other fields.
good,"Overall, I had a good experience working for this company. Show up on time, do your work, give good customer service, pretty simple. I would only suggest teaching a better way of communicating between management and employees."
good,"I would highly recommend Panera as a first high-school job. Panera teaches how to balance annoying managers and cool coworkers and can be a very fun environment. It's also fast paced and teaches time-management. I would not suggest this if you're looking for a long-term job, as the drama and high-school sort of behavior of management and thus employees can get so tiring, but it can teach some valuable skills over the course of a year or two."
good,"Managers personalities differ, which is normal, but some of them are not very helpful to new staff members. We are not given enough time to do thorough cleaning. Food is good."
good,"Loved working with the workers, they were hard working and always very helpful. They have an amazing team. Fat workers and quick learners. Very sweet workers."
good,"I learned a lot working with Panera. They are very strong believers in creating a warm friendly inviting culture for their guests and employees."
good,the job wasn't the hardest thing once you got the hang of it but the management teams does a poor job at making sure that the job flows smoothly. it had a lot of room for improving ones self in giving a multitude positions to learn.
good,"My store was a lot of fun to work at. I wish managers wouldn't let the dishwashers text. Otherwise, the work was very easy and fun. When I worked there you got a good discount on your meal. I would highly recommend this company."
good,"Due to large amount of customers there was little time to relax. However, one can become adequately skilled at customer support in this line of work. While not competitive between employees unless one is looking for promotion, it is competitive between stores."
good,"As a delivery driver, you make $8 an hour when you're not delivering, and service wage (less than minimum, probably around $2.50-$5) while driving, and are compensated mileage at about 33 cents a mile. You get your tips and mileage money at the end of every shift. Tips are usually bad. Opportunities for raises every quarter, but they're only about 25 cents or less usually from what I've heard."
good,"Panera Bread is a good place to work if you're just starting to work. Unless you're seeking a management position, I do not recommend making a career out of this."
good,Very engaging company to work for. Met lots of a great people. Founding members are really fantastic. Can't wait to go back next year. They really care about their employees and service.
good,"At Panera bread I was a trainer and a shift leader. I work all positions in the cafe, including line cook, cashier, and food runner. I was made a  after two years of working there."
good,"Panera Bread is fast-paced catering order to fulfill customer's satisfaction. You learn to prep, make sandwiches, and salads, keep the soups hot. Management is solid, hardest part of the job is getting the orders done under 3 and a half minutes. Most enjoyable part is having a nice chat with co-employees. This job is alright for those that are new to work labor, but can get really boring after 3 months."
good,"A typical day working at Panera Bread consists of constantly pleasing the customer with their needs while keeping the back kitchen clean and tidy."
good,"All really depends on the management team that you have, if they are motivated then they will motivate you, if not than good luck learning anything without doing it wrong a lot of times before."
good,"Expect to work quickly and cooperatively with your teammates, especially during breakfast and lunch rushes. Management was down to earth. Employee body is a mix of ages and backgrounds. You will do a lot of light cleaning and sanitizing. They have an emphasis on training and management and coworkers give you the time to get comfortable as a new employee. Panera also offers a generous employee discount at your store. The most enjoyable part of the job was making a guest's day with a satisfying meal and quick service."
good,"Panera can be a great company to work for as long as you work for the right management.  Management is everything.  Corporate has the right intentions on everything, the execution from the chain of command isn't always there."
good,"Pros:"
good,High pass working place always busy must stay on top of your game never a dull moment in panera bread you must always be moving from place to place not enough hours given
good,"My view of Panera bread and the Management is that they do not care about there employees, the conditions they work in, or how they conduct business. Panera only cares about the customers and Management only care about themselves, Management is also friendly but only to your face and only if you can help them."
good,"I’ve woeked at panera for 7 months. At first it was fine since I’m in college and the hours were flexible. As time went by the flaws were exposed. There’s been two heart checks since I’ve been there (meeting with manager about pay) and both times I’ve been promised to get a raise the next time. Panera is pretty expensive so don’t expect new customers a lot. Most of the deliveries you get you rely on returning customers. Also we do not accept cash for deliveries and that slims down chances on tips and automatically you get less people ordering. Most of my shifts are 2-8 and on average I’ll make $30 with mileage. Also since you have a lot of free time, you can expect to do lots of dishes, clean, and if needed prep. Overall if you want to be a delivery driver there are many better options."
good,"The managers vary. Some are amazing, some are more of a burden. Co-workers are similar. Pace varies depending on your station, but it's usually a bit quick-paced."
good,My experience I had at Panera Bread was you learn pretty fast at your position. Team members there that help train are helpful and get you learning what you need to pretty fast.
good,Panera bread has been a great experience for me. I have learn so much in my time working here and have been developed over the course of 4 years. It has a great work environment different from many other places. The people that work here care for each person that walk through their doors and it shows within everything they do.
good,All of the managers were approachable and friendly. They make jokes and it feels like a family once you've worked there for a while. Other staff members are always helpful if you need a last minute shift change etc.
good,busy from open to close.  can be stressed during lunch and dinner.  customers can be little demanding but if you don't let it bother you you'll be fine
good,"ok experience, learned alot and greatful for every chance i was given to learn something new and meet new people who i shared experiences with on a daily basis"
good,"Overall it is a good place to work, but a lot of the time other managers call out/put down other managers or associates. It can be a not so great place to work sometimes. I don’t like being around a negative environment."
good,With panera it is set up as a fast food business with cleaner and better food. There is of course more than one manager and while 3 were extremely good the other one was horrible and has no sympathy for the workers.
good,"Working there was okay. The co-workers were friendly and helped if you needed it. The managers weren't always the best, but some of them were helpful."
good,i would struggle making salads when i had the lunch rush i would have to go to the back to get ingredients i would be running back and forth and it was very stressful and transportation was a struggle to get there
good,"I have met many of my friends at my panera bread location.  I have learned so much from the store.  I have learned patience and basic customer service skills.  The management at the store is very laid back and chill and as an associate you can pretty much get away with anything.  There is multiple cliques and friend groups and for the most part, the closing staff is not friends with the morning staff."
good,Would be a great first job if seeking a place to teach customer service and accountability. The workers are pleasant to work with and the customers are the highlight of the day.
good,When I was working at Panera Bread I found the management to be disorganized and the set-up of the restaurant didn't seem clean. I was getting paid a fairly decent wage and the work environment was very fast and quick so I had to challenge myself in a good way. It gave me the opportunity to adopt new skills. I also learned how to use a cash register while I was working here.
good,This is a fast paced job (unless there isn't a lot of traffic through your store) where customer demand is priority. Customer service skills are crucial as you are the face of the company and even one bad experience at Panera can keep a customer from ever going to another Panera Bakery again.
good,"It's hard to get fired from panera bread, but it's also hard to progress within the company. Getting a raise required me to do 3 hours worth of online training (on my own time) for a 50 cent raise. The management is understand of your personal schedule and work with you, but also value employees who do nothing more than those who put their all into their work.  It was a good place to start off but hardly a career worth having, even for management"
good,Comments were made under the breaths of alot of the mangers and sometimes the employees that were degrading and disrespectful the company offers alright benefits but its just they could really use a change of management
good,"Nice environment,  clean place to eat. Great service. Provides a nice variety of foods and beverages. It's a very fast pace place of employment. Managers can sometimes be rude and overbearing."
good,"My direct managers were nothing but awesome,  though the district manager is kind of making more issues by setting rules and not seeing the effects. The work was alright but repetitive and I felt trapped in my position.  Advancement was possible and offered, but managers seem tired and overworked. The people were nice and half off lunch was awesome. My availability seemed to be crossed once in awhile but it was usually corrected/covered by someone else."
good,"its not horrible to work here but as a manager its just a lot to deal with on a daily basis for the pay. They like to pay outside hires more and they don't do anything, then when they internally promote you, and see that your proficient they wanna make excuses not to give you a raise. The amount of work expected for you to complete does not match the pay that they are paying you, well for me.. maybe if you get what your expecting to be paid then this could be for you. unless you live with your parents, its going to be hard to make enough to be on your own."
good,"I had the most fun at this job and I’d do it again if I could. The only problem I had is really the companies issue with promoting. You basically get a .25 cent raise when you’ve been there to a year, not based on performance, not based on anything else, so you and 5 others will get the same title whether they deserved it or not. That money could’ve been invested in one person but that’s something they’d have to fix if I would return."
good,"For my 3-4 months of working there I’ve noticed that the job has gone to the worst version of itself, which is VERY bad, we barely have workers there and the scheduling manager is blatantly rude and disrespectful which I don’t like. The job is one of the jobs that anyone would want to have but once you actually start working there then you won’t like it as much."
good,Its a good first job I would recomend it to anyone with children or a family because its really not enough pay for all the work you have t do being  cashier having to clean up a bakery and having to clean a lobby.
good,A day in a life was about ordering all supplies needed for the restaurant. If short staffed had to work with staff to make sure productivity line was ready for peak rushes.  Somedays were frustrating as other managers in the same position as myself couldn't handle a shift or didn't follow through on their job responsibilities. I really enjoyed when new product came out as all the managers from other stores got together and we had the entire store come in on special days and celebrate with them.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,The DD job for Panera is not too terrible. You have plenty of on the job benefits such as cheaper food prices and free drinks. The only issue I have is when the deliveries are slow and I'm making less money and doing busy work in the café until a delivery shows up.
good,"For a high school job, Panera is a great place to start and advance, for some. I enjoyed working there in high school but wanted something more, personally."
good,"I did enjoy coming in to do my job either a a cashier or dishwasher. I've learned a lot working here, especially discovering what works best for me in the workplace. The management could be better, but overall, all the managers are friendly and encourage their workers. The staff are tight knit and can depend on eachother for help. The hardest part of the job was always having a bright attitude on the worst days; however, the best part was being able to interact with other people and getting to familiarize with working with food."
good,The hours were maintainable and they were very accepting of the time off requested. The managers were not as professional as I wish they would’ve been but we’re very nice.
good,"The management and staff were friendly and always willing to help. When it came to learning something new, the general and assistant managers wouldn't hesitate to help or offer advice. A typical day normally consisted of being busy a lot of the time and one of the hardest parts was definitely keeping up with the making of the food. However, you learn a lot and the staff are all really supportive (which was also the most enjoyable part of the job)."
good,Very fast and busy. I was cashier and food prep. Management wasn't as good as it could've been. They made promises for advancement and never went through with them.
good,"It's just the managers, that will make it very tense place to work. The workplace was very diverse, a few managers were very understanding. Hard to get trained in different areas."
good,"The new owners of company are changing things. It is getting hard to hire drivers, the new upper management do t what to listen to you. To make delivering 7 days a week takes to make it work."
good,Working at the company was an interesting experience. I wish that management was better but overall I liked my time at Panera. Work was easy and fair.
good,"Very dependent on which manager was in charge that day, the good ones were good but the bad ones made the day and staff feel terrible. Unfortunately, the store I worked at turned extremely cliquey, and favoritism was often shown, although not by managers that made important decisions such as promotions."
good,"When I was first hired here I was hired as a full-time employee. Even after training I never received full-time hours. Besides not getting the hours you're looking for this would be a pretty good place to work. There is a great management team that works here and support you very well. At times it can be very fast paced, but nothing that is too hard to get through."
good,"depends how the coworkers feel or customers act towards the workers. can be easy day or stressful, long day. can work around your schedule. most get trained well."
good,The hours aren't bad but unfortunately it is just another minimum wage food job. Expect the typical grief and immature coworkers that you would expect to find in such an environment.
good,"It was a great job, just not enough pay. Even after getting promoted to manager, I still made under $9.00. Overall, it was very enjoyable until I got promoted. Being a manager was not the best because the workers constantly called off on my shifts, and nothing was done about it."
good,"I've been working here for year and its been alright, even though it is my first job so I cant compare it to much, but some management is sometimes make us to unreasonable things not all the time. Overall it is a not a a hard job and its very diverse."
good,"If you're a teen looking for a good first job excellent place to start. Great scheduling. Half off meals.UNIFORM- always wear uniform and wear a name tag, hat, loose fitting JEANS, and apron (strings tucked away). Fast paced environment. CLEAN CLEAN CLEAN"
good,"most of the times i work at night, and most of the time the shift goes easy, however sometimes the shift will be very busy and stressful. sometimes i used to open the store at 5 or 6 am in the morning making sure everything is looking good for the costumers"
good,It's always a good day when everyone is on task but when rushes hit is when you have to think on your feet and control  I've always been out front talking to my guest and to make sure to stop any problems before they happen
good,"Apply and enjoy the job! I enjoy seeing the regulars each day when I work! The hardest part of the job is not getting hours that you can live on, and training."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Productive place for job , where can get excellent experience,good workplace culture and  improve  your skills,know  more interesting information  about food and bread."
good,a typical day at work is based off of your objective you been assigned for that day. for me it would be team member or dish washer. With being a team member you never know what you are going to do. I did not want to wash dishes but they didn't give me a choice.
good,"Working as a baker had pros and cons. Pros: You bake alone so u decide when to go on ur break, you get free meals as a baker, u decorate pastries. Cons: u have to rush to get everything finish to go on break on time and go home on time, ur responsible for a lot of detail cleaning that u wouldn't imagine, Some BMM's do what benefits them personally etc."
good,You should expect to be fast paced and never make excuses and try to get many hours. The staff is nice and sometimes understanding and it's a easy job
good,"If you aren't okay with a fast-paced and stressful job, panera is not for you. From technology issues, to angry customers - you will deal with it all every single day. The hours are crazy, and you have no set schedule. However, as a manager you will know your schedule for a month in advance. Panera is smart in the way they make their money, from online ordering to home delivery the volume is very high and only increasing. As most corporate stores, they have their issues that you have no control over. Whether those issues affect your guests or your associates, they are a bother. Panera pays well, is an overall nice place to work, and has many tools put in place to help make your job as a manager easier. It is definitely only for those who enjoy working their tails off, every day. "
good,panera bread is an okay place to work but i couldn't see that being a job for more than a few months. one of the managers is very rude and loud. the associate are all pretty cool.
good,"Every week there's a different manager, it depends on how their attitudes are when they come in. If its not good then no joking around and get too work or clean. What I learned at Panera Bread is that customers always comes first, whatever you are doing drop it and help the customer. The managers are okay I guess but not all of them like too have a nice conversation. The workplace over there is fine. It's not hard working at panera at all once you know how to do one thing you'll know how to do everything else. The most enjoyable part of the job is when we have a breadbash, with all the employees and managers eating food."
good,"Work was fast paced well managed. Kind of stressful some days but better than most, well sanitized, well maintained!"
good,"Very stressful job during meal rushes, but it is a good way to keep busy. Employees were amazing, friendly people, while most managers were very understanding and kind. Panera was inconsistent with management, some managers required different things while others did not and this caused confusion and conflict. I enjoyed interacting with customers, but hardest part of the job was staying on top of the work load. Closing the restaurant was insane, you are required to close down the restaurant alone in an hour. Oftentimes stayed overtime to clean up, very tight."
good,"great management and great team. had a routine so very easy to get the hang of it, flexible work scheduled so had a personal life as well, everyone was very nice"
good,"It was like my family, away from my family. We all had a good time, laughed, joked with one another while still managing getting everything done correctly. It was fun and comfortable to work there."
good,"A typical work day is busy with lots of customers, running out of items and  leaving as a team."
good,"Many of the Orlando staff at Panera Bread are friendly. The company does it's best to ensure that everyone in all of their location is following the culture and values set in place at Panera. However, management at my particular cafe is not 100% on board with the values and culture Panera has set and therefore, the turnover are high. There are a lot of minors and management does not treat them like adults. It is not a permanent place to work."
good,I would say Panera Bread is a great place for young people to advance in Customer Service/Hospitality. I only say this because I moved up pretty fast being with this company for nearly 4 years. I moved up just after being there for almost 8 months. After that point I just kept moving up further and I loved it. Its time for me to move up somewhere else and learn new skills and learn new options.
good,"Fast paced, hectic, never enough cashiers. Skeleton crew too often. Great people to work with and decent benefits. Management not given the tools to succeed. Made some great friends."
good,Working at Panera Bread I learn new things everyday some days it might be difficult but other days I appreciate everything that Panera Bread has done for me.
good,"My typicial day at work is slow paced on week days during certain times but, on the weekends its very fast paced. I learned how to have more patients and to help customes. Very calm. Lunch rush. Break."
good,Managers are friendly and very cooperative with me. co workers are friendly and hard workers. typical day is for me to come in and have plenty of dishes waiting to be cleaned. during this time i am to get clean dishes out to the other workstations and bring in any dirty dishes.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Kitchen  assistant  to support the. Daily. Operations of this,restaurant  , bake a variety  of breads at. The. Appropriate oven temperatures  and  bake time . At time prepare food order (sandwiches, with or without deserts . Clean serving trays and tables."
good,"The other employees were great to work with, the management needs to be improved upon, as the GM at the time would bring his attitude in from outside of work instead of being more professional."
good,"Panera has a decent work culture as far as rallying its employees around a cause. However, if you're looking for advancement, then Panera may not be the place for you."
good,"It is an okay company to work for, nothing too special but a great starter job or job when you are in school. Many different jobs there so many different people can work there."
good,This Panera is still new and working out some kinks so you cant judge it too harshly. Co-workers are fun but the job can become very fast paced and difficult to keep up with. My training was adequate but others to deal with less training and be put in at peak times.
good,"Every day, you can expect someone to not show up for their scheduled shift. What's worse is these employess do not get disciplined, so they see no wrong in not showing up. The DM has a habit of insulting employees in the stores that they work. Weird disasters seem to happen once a week, may it be a faulty drink fountain. We always seem to run out of everything in one shift."
good,Low pay but fun place to work. Manager if nice and friendly. Coworker r welcoming and friendly. Benefit r a pkuse but not enough it's hard to live off of 9.50 an hour
good,"I am happy to have been a part of the Panera Bread work family. During my time there, I truly felt like we were all on one team.  I am thankful to my managers and coworkers who happily taught me the proper methods."
good,It is a lot of work and not a known days off work so hard to plan things. It can be hard to learn the job at first if never worked with fresh dough. Takes time to adjust to over a time period.
good,"This was my first job, and it taught me so much. It had great people and was fun to work at.  The job itself got boring quick, but the people made up for it."
good,good working environment & great coworkers which made the bad (low pay & not enough hours per week) not existence at times. but overall decent place to start or if you're just simply looking to save some money for you're next move.
good,"I worked there for over a year, I'm trained in all the feilds and they didn't promote me to a trainer, to be a trainer you have to be trained in 3 or more fields . Which I am, mind you they promoted people that started months after me and not as trained as me."
good,"You come in, clock in, put on your apron and head directly into the kitchen. Your manager will tell you what station you need to be on and you immediately get to work. The kitchen has a foot and a half radius of walking room and only teamwork will allow you to maneuver quickly and efficiently all throughout the busy hours of the workday. Communicating loudly and effectively gave everyone the edge on production and kept orders at a two minute ticket time for the majority of the day."
good,The company has very high standards that are great. Always room for advancement. Can be flexible with hours. Main focus is always on customer satisfaction.
good,"A typical workday consisted of pulling out food for the next day's bake, assisting the night baker, and washing dishes. I learned to clean dishes and maintain my work space. The management wasn't the best. For the most part they seemed fairly new at their jobs or just extremely busy to the point, however, when I could get a hold of them, they where quite helpful and kind. The workplace culture is quite serious, most night bakers came straight from culinary school, honestly, a bit of dedication that I find inspiring. The hardest part of my job (as it was my first real job) was managing my work duties and the time. The most enjoyable part of my job was taking the baguettes out of the oven."
good,"My shifts here had me pretty much working everywhere in the store. My main responsibility was to serve customers directly at the sandwich and salad bar, but I was also responsible for early morning food prep, and stocking truck deliveries about 3-4 times a week. Throughout the day I could always expect to be working fast-paced which was not a problem to me, and I could be handling any area of the store such as maintaining the dining room floor, washing dishes, or serving customers at the sandwich bar. "
good,"I worked during a time where there was little stability in the management, the workers would rather socialize then actually do their job, and hard work would go so unnoticed that the people that actually cared got fired or quit from being basically harassed on the job."
good,"Panera Bread is a pretty easy company to work for. As long as you work hard, you're almost guaranteed hours, and it is very easy to move up in the company if you're trying to promote."
good,"I have learned a lot while working for Panera Bread. I learned about a bunch of new breads and pastries. They always introduced new products so the menu was always changing. The co-workers were always really friendly and welcoming to new employs. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I was working with. The hardest part of the job was time managment, and making sure you would get everything done on time."
good,"Steady days, great guests.  Lots of regulars who know you by name.  Overall very good staff to work with.  Lots of families to talk to.  Good service for the guests."
good,"I like the environment, but I wish I was treated way better than I am for the hard work and commitment I've put into that place for the past four years."
good,"6 years of working for panera saw 2 promotions and more offered, however food service is not the career I want."
good,Co-workers make working at Panera much more enjoyable. It can be a fast-paced job during lunch rushes and you learn a lot about dealing with various types of people. The management is the best I've dealt with.
good,"They paid me 2$ more than my last job, they had excellent training, their food quality is on point, they have wonderful customer service, but I personally had unreliable management. In addition to opening the bakery, I was also a cashier. The rule of being a cashier at Panera is that nobody uses your cash register. That way if your over or under management knows the mistake was you and no one else. Problem was cashiers are also in charge of bakery and drinks. When we got really busy, and I was off getting someone's drink or pastry, management would hop on my register or put someone on my register, and I'd be left standing there saying, ""Isn't that against the rules?"" then I'd be yelled at for questing management and keeping customers waiting. At the end of the day, my register was short twice and I couldn't say it wasn't me. It was my register after all. I had never been short at my previous job. I ended up quitting before my drawer was short a third time. Three strikes you're out."
good,"In general the management at most stores that I have worked at are helpful and great. In my experience it is very difficult to move up within the company. Its a fairly easy job and you have more then enough resources to answer any question you may have,"
good,"i liked my job at PaneraBread but i had childish co-workers that would always gossip and talk trash therefore made me quit, i,m too mature for the crowd that worked there at the time. plus pay wasn't enough for the work i did and then the new hires started with 8.50 and they never upped my pay.  other workers complained of this also."
good,"Panera has extremely flexible hours and pays $8-$9 an hr starting wage in my state. After starting out as an associate and working for at least three months, you can apply to become trainer, but after that you have to go into management (starting at shift supervisor). It's a good basic job job for someone not looking to be particularly challenged by their work, besides dealing with customers, and is not expecting to gain many skills after mastering the basic deployment chart: Cashier, Table Service, Dish, Line (sandwiches, soup, salad), and Barista."
good,"Prepped, baked, and prepared meals. Cleaning and maintained a clean and calm setting for the customer to enjoy their meals. Trained new members of staff to new positions."
good,"Not your typical restaurant. Many more facets are happening on a daily basis. From cafe management to daily bakery functions.  Panera, LLC. is a rewarding and leader in our food service industry. Always learning something new each day, makes this company a rewarding career."
good,i was a night baker so we baked alone or with one other person i enjoyed that. I do feel they should spend more time training their employees instead of overwhelming them.The night shift also allowed me to work full time which i appreciated.
good,"Throughout my training at another Cafe I absolutely enjoyed the work experience.....An extremely great atmosphere, family like from management all the way through to the associates and bakers.  Once I transferred to my home cafe it was a totally different feel.  The staff were all on point, but the GM made it such a horrible place to work (this GM had just transferred to the cafe shortly before I arrived).  The company policy of no smoking on the premises (unless in your own vehicle) is pushed upon employees, but the GM would run out every 30 minutes to smoke out the back door, it mattered not the business going on in the cafe.  If you spoke up about anything against the GM, it was made very clear by GM that she could make it so you didn't have a job--to both associates and Assistant Managers.  The JVDM had been notified and instead of addressing the situation just had other managers transferred to other cafes, as they were deemed the problem, not the GM (an existing friendship between said GM and JVDM exists).  Again, that is THIS particular cafe, other cafes I have worked at (while covering other managers vacations) fully embody the Cultural Values and Concept Essence that this brand endorses.  I LOVED my associates I had working for me it but it was very difficult to keep associates when they were constantly dogged by our GM.  The job itself is very rewarding, you get a lot of repeat guests that I enjoyed conversing with"
good,"I mostly worked at the Drive-thru window and I enjoyed the faced paced work. I learned how to make salads, sandwiches and drinks. My co-workers made the job fun but the management wasn't the best."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Panera Bread. I was fortunate enough to move around and work in many cafes other than my home cafes in Tualitin OR and Vacaville CA. I was given the opportunity to open brand new cafes and train employees in each of them and spread my knowledge and caring. You meet a lot of different people, from many cultures and places and create close bonds with customers and maintain regulars. The hardest part of it was maintain the same excellence everyday when you're not having the best of days. Other than that, I enjoyed my time with them very much."
good,I love Panera okay. But I am very observant and alot needs to be Worked on. I hear swearing while On Line in the area of customers. Some Workers say thats.your food dont bother to ENGAGE with the customer. I love interaction with customers. I greet them but some dont. Management- Great team hands down but some do play favorites and I was one minute late once And I felt so small cuz I was getting yelled at for being a minute late. The person was like hurry your really late and I cant help it if the car is all iced. Closing- Depends what workers close some do outstanding jobs and others do nothing and it looks like diddly squat.  I have many coconcerns but I just work there and I dont want to quit but Im looking for other Jobs. The hours and Shrewsbury just isnt the place for a Panera like york is great for it. Overall They are family and Ill do anything for them.
good,It was a productive day. It was always busy for lunch. There will sometimes be lines outside the door. I worked the cash register and prepare the pastries.
good,"It was an okay job, what I've learned from this job is better communication skills. The management was mediocre but my co-workers were great! The most enjoyable part of this job was making the food and interacting with the customers."
good,Managers are disorganized and often times blatantly ignore associates in need. More worried about having their morning latte or three (which they don't ring up or account for) than if their associates are under control and not overworked. They would rather delegate work and create unfair policies than get their hands dirty. I see many newer managers show a lot of spunk and enthusiasm for their jobs. If their stores are hiring I'd say go ahead.
good,Working at Panera requires a lot of patience and ability to work in an environment that requires fast pace and a great attitude.
good,"Most days I would arrive at 5am. I would assist the staff in the breakfast rush while doing inventory and the dough order. I would help where I was needed during the lunch rush, and then start counting down the cash registers to let the morning cashiers go. Everyday there was a different weekly task to be completed ,orders, schedule, interviews, etc.. After the admin work was completed I would help out where I was needed for the dinner rush. I would usually leave shortly after dinner around 8pm. The hardest part of my job was working 12-15 hour shifts. The most enjoyable part was watching the team that I hired and trained work so well together like a well oiled machine."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,I deal with all sorts of customer and deliver the best customer service I know how to do. I have learned how to run a store and teach others to do what I have done as an associate. My co-workers are a lot of fun to work with very down to earth like me but real go getters like me so we work well together. The hardest part o my job would be babysitting almost to my associates due to them still being in high school or just graduating. Most enjoyable part of my work day would be sitting down with my regulars that come in and catching up with them.
good,"Life at Panera bread consisted of various tasks including doing dishes and table service (for me at least). I would greet customers and service them by bringing their ordered food to their selected table. Before closing, I would sweep, mop, and vacuum the floors, bring dishes and utensils to their original spot (if I was assigned to dishes) and overall make sure the area I was assigned to is clean. Instructions are easy to follow but management (including shift supervisors) would present expectation on the spot and not beforehand which served as a problem due to the location being a food franchise. Customs and new rules not stated within the handbook would also be relayed as an excuse to get angry at the workers (from what I've seen). The co-workers are friendly but most do gossip and give each other tension. The only hard part of the job is during lunch hour because of the rush. Food needs to be brought to tables in less than five minutes and depending how well our Line Cooks finish, then that will determine if I make it to the table early or late. The most enjoyable part of the job is servicing the customers and working as a team with co-workers."
good,"Job duties included bakery backer, cashier, consolidator on line, and barista. This was a great work environment and the staff was treated with respect. This company is great with providing the opportunity for promotions for employees who work hard, however are difficult with working around busy schedules."
good,I've worked with this company on and off and know all the odd and ends. Great people work here and you learn so many techniques through out the day. The hardest part about this job is how busy it gets you rarely have time for a break.
good,"Get a full 40 hour week if wanted, management makes good decisions, but very low pay"
good,"I am a morning worker, so i have the 6am to 2pm shift. We get several breakfast rushes before our slow point before lunch. Thats when we take the opportunity to stock up and prep anything ahead of time. Our lunch rush lasts from about 12:00 to 2:30 and is out the door the whole time. We are busy! While taking Phone in orders and then dining in customers plus making sure everything stays stocked and all peoples needs are met can be quite a challenge."
good,"Typical day includes handling/managing a drawer and dealing with guests both in person and over the phone. We also prep all stations for the following day (if on a closing shift) And insure all materials are clean, fully stocked and presentable. Management is helpful, getting hands on to assist whenever business is booming and not simply staying in an office behind a desk. My fellow employees all seem to get along as friends at work. The hardest part of the job would have to be managing a constantly changing week to week schedule. The most enjoyable is dealing with guests (I'm a people person)"
good,"Arrive in uniform, put on the provided apron as required. Clock in, and report to job assignment. Not all employees were cross-trained as I was. The modules were: bakery cashier, barista, cafe line, dish and dinning, food prep, catering. I had a variable schedule, and would open for breakfast at 6am, or close the store, working as late as 11 pm. If scheduled four or more hours, a 30min unpaid break was scheduled. The hardest part of the job was lack of communication with-in the management, and their not enforcing company policy. Employees lacked respect for the product, consistently allowed to practice unsafe food prep, handling, and storage. Partly due to improper training or lack of. As a certified trainer, I tried to provide corrective action, but was disrespected by the employees, and ignored by management. After nearly five years with Panera, I saw the break down in many areas of the company, not just on the store level. At one time it was such a great place, I saw no end to my employment. I chose to end it. I am happy with my decision."
good,I helped open the store I learned how to do a lol maintenance it was always maintenance and makin sandwiches
good,people there are cool. especially the managers. some of the coworkers are not trustworthy but thats in every store.
good,"They specialize you to work in many different areas so you don't have to do the same thing every time you work, but it still gets mindless and repetitive. Mostly everyone who works there is friendly and helpful. The hardest part is moving fast enough to keep up with everything that needed to be done. I enjoy working line and talking to co workers."
good,"I love the company, but not always the way the day to day operations. I think things could be done much differently, but all in all it is a great place to work. Just want to spend more time with my family."
good,"Each day is the same, with a certain set of requirements to be made before you leave for the day. The requirements are not unbearable and they keep the store in check. I love all my co-workers, including managers and general managers. It is like a close nit little Panera family where I work. The hardest part is closing the store, and the worst part is when the people who work earlier shifts dont do anything to help make the job easier, like they're supposed to."
good,I have worked here for 8 months and have enjoyed the acquaintances I have made.
good,typical for me at work I would be like this I  clock in then after that  I take orders and help costumers and when there no costumers I usually just focus on keeping the dining room clean and keeping everything restocked.
good,"Pro: It is nice to work from home, and get paid hourly + commission. The work hours are good- business hours Mon-Fri. No weekends, most holidays off with pay, vacation and full benefit options."
good,"You have a lot of tasks every shift, I believe for the amount of work there should be better pay. Usually fast paced so if you like staying busy you will enjoy it. Employees were good and environment was up beat but management is messy."
good,I always tell people the Panera builds character. It’s a work environment that is so hard to leave but once you leave you never want to turn back. The customers are a different level of difficult. If you’re not strong minded or strong willed I don’t recommend.
good,Some coworkers don't carry their own weight putting a lot of pressure on me. I don't mind helping others who are struggling yet it becomes overwhelming when I'm always the one asked to help out since no one else is as experienced. The managers are easy going and very understanding. They work with your availability.
good,The situation I was in a needed something new. I needed certain days off and they would not let me take them off and it was for family events .  When I asked to change my availability they said that I wasn’t allowed
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"A typical day is basic opening business and all of the early birds. After which we are greeted with anywhere from a $900-$3000 lunch rush. We have to be prepared regardless. "
good,"During my cancer treatments, Panera worked with my hours and type of work I could do during that time and made the whole process easier to deal with. They were great to me."
good,I enjoyed working with my coworkers they were really nice and very helpful. I never enjoyed working whenever the general manager was there because he was always a very difficult person to work with. He always gives his best employees a hard time if they ask for too many days off even if in the previous months they didn't ask for days off.
good,Most of the workers are team players and helpful. All of the managers are very nice with some being more strict than others. Employees get a 65% discount during their shift.
good,Working here has its ups and downs but is a complete breeze and is really fun when you do your job quickly and efficiently. Customer service is a big one here so make sure you help out when you see someone in need
good,I worked for several years for the company. Flexible hours for associates and worked around my schooling schedule. Also great for minors to begin their work life. Left upon completion of college degree but would have continued to climb the ladder. Flexible positions as well laterally.
good,"The customers will stress you out and the overall atmosphere is very fast paced but the employees are the best and there is rarely any drama, if you aren’t a slack off and come to your shift you are automatically a favorite in the mangers book"
good,"I loved my staff and everyone there, but the DM and up could care less about what employees would like to do for changes. The place was a typical corporate fast food place."
good,"If you wanna work your butt off and have college students stand and watch you, then you'll be ok here. They hire way too many young kids that have no work ethic."
good,"I loved the atmosphere and the people that the company surrounded me with. Its a shame they are making me quit or get fired if i do not cut my hair, as the females can wear their hair however they want. Other than that, It was fast paced when the rush's would come and it was a lot of fun to stay under pressure and get the job done. My associates only make you better as another worker."
good,It was an okay job. I found that the culture was manageable and that the people that I worked with were kind. Training was not great but people would help.
good,You are held in constant competition with the other employees at your work the management their also isn't very strong and it reminds me almost like a high school with all the drama and stuff
good,"The best time of my life was working at Panera in the drive thru- it was amazing and very fast paced, i loved all my coworkers, overall a great experience as a high school student."
good,"A regular busy day, learn how to manage the cafe and associates, deal with customers, be an all around employee, manage to do store reports, deposits, and paid outs."
good,"The company stands for great things such as healthy food + clean food. I enjoyed working at this job, the managers were friendly and care about their employees."
good,"Panera has high ideals in terms of food sourcing, safety, and service.  The tools and programs are ever-evolving.  The extreme focus on labor savings makes reaching their goals fairly difficult most of the time."
good,I assisted the cashiers on how to greet the customers and make them feel welcomed. I also made trained the kitchen employees on the process of how to keep the kitchen organized. I counted the registered down every night and was responsible for counting inventory.
good,"As long as you can keep up a fast pace, you'll fit in at Panera. There are times where there is a lull but it mostly go go go. They give paid time off after a year and they have benefits."
good,very fast paced and intensive. many hours. Everyday you will go through impatient customers and happy customers. Fun workers and nice working uniforms
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Costumers could be very difficult and thick headed. If they are too trouble some you can get a manager to deal with it. Tips could be a bit inconsistent.
good,Panera Bread is a really cool place to work at. It was one of my first jobs and I want to go back! I actually wanted to relocate closer to my home so i am looking for hiring Panera Breads. The food discounts are awesome. The management is okay (in my particular workplace) they really didn't know how to flex my hours with school. Overall a really good first job. Hourly/$9.00 and we got paid Bi-weekly every Tuesday or with direct deposit every Fridays.
good,"Nice work environment, many regulars which I liked. Had decent coworkers and managers. Memorizing all the drinks can be tough but they leave a little book out for you! Not a tough place to work, keeps you on your toes."
good,Even though I have left this company a few years ago when I did it was just because it was time for me to move on. this company is great to work for and you will always have a good time
good,Panera is a great work environment but is fast paced and can be stressful at times. Throughout my career I've learned so much about the company by starting out as an associate and worked  my way up into management.
good,"The managers were very slow when closing, causing the entire staff to stay very late. Panera closes at 10 pm during the summer and we were kept until nearly midnight every night, despite finishing our work hours before. Managers could be very picky about some aspects of the job, while totally disregarding others, making it very confusing to prioritize during a shift."
good,"Great learning job. fun team to work with.  days started early being there at 5am, but then you're done by 2 or 3. only problem is there is rarely any room for advancement."
good,The people I would work with woul always be the best. The only probalem was coorperation and there impossible expectations of staff which often stressed and lead to many people quitting
good,"This is a great job to start out with. That being said it's straight customer service. And since you're working with a bunch of other entry level people, tempers flare and it's not always the best place to work."
good,"Most days, I would start work around noon and end around 5:30. Roughly once a week, I would be assigned the early morning or night shift. The hardest part of the job was the ""lunch rush"", as the workers called it, sometimes having to serve 5 different meals to customers at one time, however it was quickly to get used to when that's the main shift assigned. The most enjoyable part of the workplace would be the coworkers, due to the fact that we all got along."
good,I loved everything about working for Panera except the horrible pay. Panera serves well as a second job. although there are many opportunities to advance and obtain greater pay at Panera.
good,"A typical day at work would include doing just about everything from being a cashier, to making sandwiches. "
good,"Panera bread is a great place to work they have great customer service.cleaned work area,they handled food orders in a professional,timely manner.professional appearance"
good,I love working for Panera. Great way to build communication skills and relationships. The management was NO GOOD! They didn't communicate well. If they had better management the workplace would be PERFECT!
good,"Panera was my overall home, I would recommend anyone to this café, especially if they want to grow with the company, it was a very good job,and overall very good company"
good,"Not bad for a first job, but would prefer to work at a place that allows me to better use my abilities to my advantage and advance throughout the company. Was also very  lonely at times (I was the only cashier from the time I was there for my shift) and I felt it would have been beneficial to have another cashier to be up front with me. The rest is up to you to decide as I have more opinions, both positive and negative and do not want to persuade you for or against the Company and I wish my replacement the absolute best of luck and to be flexible and adaptable with the management."
good,It was  great learning experience. they provided good deeds with their donations. however the baker managers do not treat their employees very well. and in doing so make it very difficult to want to stay with the company
good,it was a nice company. the people are always nice. the food is good and I love the bagels and cream cheese. Panera bread is the place to go
good,"It's a fast paced environment, but a fun environment to work in and it's very flexible with scheduling.  Lot's of happy faces."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Great place to work for development and promotion. Definitely challenging with the popularity of Panera Bread in the area, which I enjoyed. Being in management keeps you alert and responsive as to there are several things that can easily not go as expected during rushes. Many procedures were in place to keep food safety up to par and it was part of my routine to make sure procedures were being followed. Most enjoyable part of working for the company was the people I met along the way, from co-workers to customers."
good,"Great employees, great management team with one exception and the one exception is intolerable and a bully with outside issues and mental issues that should have ended her career a long time ago. Panera has staffing issues and they will never be resolved until someone has the guts to get rid of the cancerous manager."
good,"Regularly followed shift routines that consist of managing sales, associates and a variety of reports. On a typical day, I assure associates are following daily routines, following company standards and health regulations as well. Our team consisted of our general manager, assistant manager and 3 supervisors. We have side duties along with running our shifts. My duty is training specialist. The training specialist was responsible for certifying associates in certain areas of the cafe. I am responsible for promoting associates into trainers and hold up our company standards."
good,good pay but long hours. Typical day is10 plus hours on your feet with no breaks..Great benefits package. Enjoyed the people there!
good,"The one I worked at was nice except for one person. "
good,"making food and washing dishes was not the best but i worked hard, the managers were nice and it was a nice place to work"
good,"*prepare meals (consolidation)"
good,"My two years of Panera were quite enjoyable. Your hours are very flexible and there is a large staff if there is a need to trade shifts. There are a lot of possible things to do while there(Dishwasher, cashier, Food Prep, catering ect.) Pay is just above minimum wage and raises are few and far between with little room for advancement. Loved the people I worked with, flaws and all."
good,"A typical day at work for me starts when I begin the day's set up at 5:00 am. I currently oversee the drive-thru set up for lunch, take and fill orders, as well as driving delivery orders. I enjoy the work I do but want to find more experience in other work environments."
good,I worked with nice people. It is a very fast paced place to work.
good,"Great place to work, coworkers are great people along with mangers except for a few. Waking up at 4am everyday is a drag. But the culture and values is something you can take with you for the rest of your life."
good,the typical day at panera bread i would come in every morning and clock in and get straight to my job. a normal everyday job really sometimes you have to pick up others slack. im a cook at panera and i normaly work 40 plus i love it but i need somethign more perfesional
good,"Loved the customers, saw them on a day to day basis"
good,.Panera bread isnt a bad company to work for. Management was two faced but the work was quick paced.
good,looking for a good position job that pays well and has a good schedule.
good,I enjoyed my time at Panera. There was nothing really wrong with working there. I just had an issue with some of the management
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"As a workaholic, this place was just what I needed because of their strict 40 hours a week maximum rule, I was able to leave on time and have a life outside of work. The customers are wonderful and usually know just what they want, most are regulars so it's nice to get to know people. The food is also delicious and made with fresh, high-quality ingredients."
good,"A typical day, starts with having all products ready to go . I learned that communication is communicated in a very different way .Management for the most part is okay,Culture at Panera ,depended as to what team you worked with decided how the culture would be. The hardest part of the job is working short staffed. Time went by fast."
good,"Working at Panera bread for about 2 years changed my life! Of course with every job there will be some sort of issue that everyone has however Panera does their absolute best to keep their customers & their employees happy, especially depending on who your managers are at your locations. Panera was an amazing first and second job that I had (I moved states). The environment wasn't always positive but you always have your work besties to help cheer you up on those days! The hardest part of the job was the management and the customers but it's also the best part."
good,"Working at Panera was fun at first, but all the stress builds up over time. You have to work work, there is no resting except for your break. The job was nice but I hated my co-workers. I seemed to always be doing everything and still be getting paid less"
good,"I open the the drive thru most of the time.. The employees make the job hard when they dont work as a team. But its a pretty easy job.. I pretty much learned everything on my own.I should be getting paid more than i do because i know how to do everything in the store. I love that a few of us have been there over 7 years, so we are like family."
good,Managing a Panera restaurant to be organized is extremely difficult as new products are introduced. I’ve worked at three Panera Breads. The first one I worked at was the only one that I’ve worked at that was organized solely due to two strong managers with all the skills at an advanced level required to manage the restaurant.
good,"Worked there for about 2 months, they send the schedule out on this app called crew and I didn’t receive the schedule because my app isn’t reliable. I got fired for not showing up the work the next morning because I didn’t receive they schedule. So I went in to work that same day and got the schedule and got fired."
good,I loved the  customers that came in and my coworkers and how we got free drinks and a big Discount on food I am a person with a special need and I was treated like everyone else
good,I left because of school and the bi weekly pay is not my favorite. It is a lot to learn if you are making food. The pay could have been a lot better since the food is so expensive.
good,"the team was great but the management wasn't, they ignore you every time you call for help and dont care about your personal life and problems. working there can go easy with a great team."
good,workday was 1st going over daily numbers with team.and learning new product or things changing.New DM so he started changing things to how he wants us to do things. to much management changes. hard parts was keeping up with all the employee learnings and all the paperwork they have added to there job.The staff made me love my job.
good,I liked this laid back baking position. It was lonely though because I was alone most of the time. I also really felt some kind of fulfillment because i baked all of the baked goods for people in the morning on their way to work.
good,"Typical day was very hectic,I learned to be more patient with people.Management was just okay could be better. Workplace culture was meh.Hardest part was trying to lower my anxiety while working."
good,It’s a fun and fast job and can get stressful at sometimes and teaches you about time management and staying focused on the task at hand. Working with the people and worker there also helped me with my social status and able to work with people I have never met before.
good,"Honestly, the people make the work place. There was never a dull moment. A typical day at work included, putting on an apron and a hat, made sure the areas were stocked."
good,Good place to work if your just starting out. I would recommend it while your going to college and making a transition into a professional career. Great way to meet people! Great way to make new friends.
good,Family type setting! Love working there though it was temporary. I would recommend working here. As long as you have an upbeat energy. Thank you for the time there.
good,"I didn't really have much of an issue with the people at Panera, more of the treatment that they gave toward their employees. They didn't care if you were new but truly stuck to the seniority sort of establishment."
good,I had a good time at Panera. I had some fun with the employees when we had free time. The managers were understanding and very respectful. If I ever ran into an emergency the managers would understand and help my situation as well as adjusting my schedule.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"The management team will take it personally when you decide to quit. Other than that, it was a fun place to work at. its easy to work there. If you don't know how to do the job right you will get looked down on. Too much drama at this location."
good,Working minimum wage for 40 hours a week you would still barely make $200. It was hard to work the hours they wanted and have a second job to support oneself. Management was wonderful and loved doing their jobs and helping out with the community.
good,"bad management, great co-workers, many dinner rushes, very demanding customers"
good,Cool job for a teenager. I enjoyed the flexiable hours right after school to the money
good,everyone on the team knew the importance of having fresh products with proper food safety procedures and knowledge.  The team worked together smoothly with a few hiccups that were easily addressed and resolved.  Overall the organization was fun to work for and promoted hiring and promoting from within.
good,was great and an easy job to keep. loved it and they worked around my school schedule
good,A typical day at work for me at Panera Bread would be taking orders from customers making sure the deli was presentable and hygienic for people.
good,"A typical day is hectic, especially Saturdays. My co-workers are incredible, very hardworking. The hardest part to the job is just remembering the little things, but you catch on quickly. I love the every day customers!"
good,"I greet customers, provide excellent customer service when taking their orders and even assembling their orders. I love communicating with the customers and connecting with them. I definately enjoy working with the all the associates, they are all different and I learn something new everyday. I definately have learned to maintain better time management. I had adapted to the work environment quite quickly, so now that I have been there for a year I would say that I grew within the company quite quickly since I got promoted with ease. The only thing I would admit is my dissatisfaction with the hourly wage that I am paid for my postion, but I still get the job done."
good,"Day starts slow but around lunch and dinner time the place gets a little out of hand. Their dining room system needs much work, it just seems like they are over seeing to many major details when assigning only two people to work the dining room. Other than that Panera Bread is a wonderful place to work."
good,Hardest part of the job was keeping ticket times below the required time. I learned how to focus on customer wants and needs. How to manage a staff. How to work with people that may learn differently. How to delegate tasks to co-workers.
good,"I liked the first Panera I worked for, they had a marine as the general manager, he ran the place well and had values for his employees and customers, the second one I worked for was run by a man whom had no idea what was happening in the work place positive or negative, he was 1/4 as affective in managemant as my previous manager."
good,Great place to work if you enjoy very fast pace  environments. At times it can be overwhelming and customers can be snobby. Management is great at times but at other times they can be a bit besides themselves.
good,You will definitely learn a lot working at Panera Bread. Cool place to work at for high school kids or if you don't any bills. If you are a regular associate. Management would be where the money is at. Only thing with me is the food industry is not my cup of tea. Maybe different for others who may enjoy it.
good,"People there were really supportive, but most times it was Really hard to keep up. People expected you to catch on immediately , but when you finally did you were respected."
good,You can definitely advance quickly within the company if that is a goal of yours. They would rather promote from within then outside.  What they pay workers are pretty on par with the industry may be a little more.
good,"Panera Bread has a very fast-passed working environment and requires a high ability to multitask. The culture is one of warmth and collaboration, but it can get pretty stressful."
good,I was an associate manager to start.  I was in charge of running the shift from start to finish.  My regional manager fast tracked me to GM.  When becoming GM I took over another store.  This worked out well because it was a smaller store and much more manageable for me as a new GM.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,It was a cool “while I look for something better job.” I felt like the pay wasn’t good or fair compared to the expectations they wanted from you. It was only a part time summer job.
good,"Panera is a great company to work for. although the store I was employed at had a large turnover in management, they never kept the same manager more then a year. I was the only manager that lasted over 10 years!"
good,Panera is a great restaurant that has really changed the fast food culture. The employees that I worked with were very enthusiastic and also very dedicated. Everything moved very efficiently even during lunch periods with the restaurant at full capacity. Hardest part of the job was making sure everything was moving above speed and everything was clean
good,"This job was fun in the beginning but overtime I just became a place to  receive financial stability. I needed more from the job, but they weren't willing to move me out of the same position. I want a job where I can climb up the business ladder and eventually make a career out of it."
good,"my job was to make sure all of the food was on the plate and in a fashionable order, then would serve customers food promptly. We pre bussed tables as well for a better environment to chat to our family and friends in."
good,"Very long hours, very nice co workers, Very nice starting job."
good,Management very helpful and caring.  Co-workers easy to get allow with helpful as well.  Customers are the hardest part ask dumbest question.
good,"The day moved fast, as Panera is a fast-paced environment. The head manager gave the employees a hard time. The atmosphere was tense when he was in the establishment. The other managers were very pleasant and made work a fun environment. Co-workers were pleasant as well, and trained me efficiently to do my job. The most enjoyable part of the job was the taking orders from the last wing of customers, right before closing. The hardest part of the job was trying to do one's job while the general manager criticized my every move. Without warning, I was fired. He never gave me an explanation, and I had never heard complaints or warnings about my work performance."
good,Not Pearland I transferred from cypress to Pearland and it was horrible all of my great training went out the window. It was horrible sewage smell in the store nice in the lobby wilted brown lettuce and vegetables under work stations I quit without 2weeks notice
good,Pretty great place. Good food. Good benefits. Good people. Had a recent change in management that made me quit. Managers had favorites and allowed unprofessional behavior continue.
good,The people you work with is very nice and easy to work with. The managers do care which makes it a lot easier to work with. The pay is pretty well and if you are a good worker it is easy to get a pay raise.
good,"It's a good first job to have but the customers can get very rude and if you're not emotionally stable, it can really affect you. My managers were great but they expected a lot from me, especially because I am bilingual and had open availability. I think the worst thing about working here was that the customer is always right. Even if they were completely wrong and super rude and unreasonable, we had to do everything in our power to make them happy, no matter what. Working here did teach me how to manage my time more efficiently, become a team player and leader, and become more patient and enthusiastic with customers. My only benefits from this job was the discount on food I got."
good,"Its an ""ok"" type of job to have. It's an average paying job with fairly easy duties. The coworkers I had were pretty nice and helpful in training me. I"
good,"I love my co-workers, I like my managers, and I love a lot of the customers who come in. But, we are short-staffed basically EVERY day, that can be extremely stressful sometimes, but with the help of the team, we get through the day."
good,Panera was a fun place to get store manager experience. Good people in a fast paced environment with a lot of room to advance in the company. And who doesn't love soup
good,I do a lot for my job but I don’t feel like I get the respect and recognition I deserve. The overall job is good and they listen about ur availability and are very flexible.
good,"Everyone works together, a very collaborative work environment. Management is professional and the store is well kept and clean. Provides a friendly environment for employees and customers."
good,"A typical day at work would be smiles, laughs, and satisfaction. I learned how to deliver a more positive and helpful way to customers. Management understood when I or other employees needed time off. All together it was a great place!"
good,"I would help new staff and train them in particular areas, as well as perform many functions and requirements in order to make the work say go smoothly"
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Panera, in three years I went from hourly associate, to certified trainer, to catering manager. On a typical day as the catering manager I would organize all orders, make the orders, deliver the orders and then I would close the orders, enter all information on the logs and balance my on accounts."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Great job with higher pay than minimum wage, gives minors a chance to receive and earn more at a young age.I would consider all shifts part time rather than any being full time shifts due to the hours given."
good,"Never honors what they promise"
good,its nice to work with people and seeing the customers happy makes me happy. i love helping other people. Customer service means eveything to me. I love making other peoples days better!
good,"Managers truly believe you have no other life out of Panera. In my experience, my co-workers were all very negative and no were supportive . I just wanted to go to school and work but they made me choose with some very unflexible hours."
good,They just don't take care of their employees. The managers don't care. The other employees don't care. The higher ups don't care. It's just an awful place to work.
good,Panera corporate is a great company to work for but be very careful when dealing with a franchise. This one has some of the same values but when it comes to manager work life balance and compensation there are major differences.
good,but the management act just as young as the 16 year old employees. the employee discount is only able to be used while on the clock. not anytime before or after.. then the person bringing your food to the table is also responsible for cleaning restrooms
good,fast paced environment
good,"Worked mainly on ""the line"" which meant i made the sandwiches and salads for customers when they would order. Whether in store, online etc. Overall was fairly easy. Left because management sucked and played favorites and the politics game when determining who got the most hours. I averaged 20-30 a week which meant struggling to pay bills."
good,"Current Plant Manager is invisible to operations and the people run the floor.  Structure and discipline are what is missing,  so in turn we the employees suffer with long hours and a stressful environment."
good,"It was very bust during the mornings and weekends, it would interfere with my school and social life. I did enjoy the interaction of the nice customers however, we would get mean customers. We were in constant training to give the best customer service there is"
good,"Work starts at 5am. Sometimes work will call with a message telling my that they just posted the schedule the day after I closed telling me they need me at 5am. I have no problem with being there at 5am, but the managers constantly over-staffed associates, and have associates work overtime by 6 hours. There was a time where I was the only one working in the morning at 7am and since no one would be coming in at the evening rush I closed at 10:30am. I really did not like this job due to the fact, that I did not have a voice."
good,"It is nice to work here, until there are issues of harassment that are not taken seriously. The general manager does not take action against harassment complaints."
good,"General managers do not respect personal boundaries.  Employees constantly threatened with termination when mistakes are made. Once employed, upper management will treat you like you owe them. Absolutely zero work/life balance."
good,"I enjoyed working for Panera Bread while I was there. The co-workers I had were pretty cool with the occasional ones who just needed to stay in their lanes. Otherwise it was decent. Management was bad/uncaring when I was still there, but since I've left they've gotten completely new management who seem really cool. Fast paced environment when the rushes happen, most down time spent restocking and making sure you're ready for the next. I was pretty much able to work every location in-store but cashier. Not bad for what it is, but wish I was paid more from the get-go or at least given more hours."
good,A typical day at work was very quick-paced. Constantly moving from one place to another constantly and must keep up with it or else others will fall behind. I learnt that communicating is critical and having a good work ethic is very important. The management is hands-on and fairly structured. The workplace culture varies depending on location. The hardest part of the job is taking quick AND correct orders during lunch time. The most enjoyable part of the job is the strong companions and their strong effort in group help.
good,My time at panera while quick paced it was horrible pay and not enough hours being given. To many responsibilities were not shared. Half the time i was doing someone else job
good,"This was my first job in food service, and received little to no help in learning. I was yelled at for not knowing things that I was never taught. I also cut my hand open during work and was encouraged to ""keep working through it"" because the management ""might not like"" me leaving."
good,"Panera help me with management skills mostly, and how to build my sales. management was great, just happen to go through a lot of them, not a very stable place to work."
good,Working at Panera was a great learning experience. But I was often left alone on line so I would have To do other people's work to keep customers satisfied.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Terrible management , great staff, nice environment , kind costumers "
good,"The work at Panera Bread was very fast paced. From taking orders to making drinks, prepping food on the line, and keeping the dining room clean. You don't have much down time."
good,"Everything about working at Panera was alright, made alot of friends. The management at my particular store was not great. A lot of us worked full time hours or overtime with absolutely no benefits. We were expected to give up our lives to honor the job. Panera claimed to be flexible but they were not. I'd work there again if I didn't have the same management team. I hear so many good things about the company but was disappointed that I didn't get the same expeirence."
good,"Very busy, customer service friendly, team players great co-workers pitiful general and district mangers, unorganized store at times."
good,"Franchise at it's finest."
good,"making food and drinks for people to consume"
good,I was in love with this company at first but the one I worked at was horribly managed. They didn’t schedule people correct and were very bad at communicating.
good,"Worked at my local Panera for about 9 months and it was a decent job as far as first jobs go. Once you get the hang of making food and get into the rhythm it gets a lot easier. Biggest qualm is with constantly changing management, lack of flexibility, and the scheduling."
good,"I was one of the first Delivery Drivers at this location. Since the program was new, no one truly knew what they were doing. The process was disorganized for a while as the company tried to workout the kinks in the new delivery system/app. When not on a delivery, I was instructed to clean up the dining rooms, wash dishes, prep food ingredients, work on the food line, and make drinks at the barista station."
good,"- Standing for long periods of time "
good,"I enjoyed working this job during the summer, it did not seem that bad. But once j started going to school and was working 12+ hours on Saturday and Sunday, it became very difficult for me to work. They never let me take time off either , if I was sick I wouldn't call out because they would be no one to cover my shifts. They were very understaffed which made it hard on the people closing and working nights."
good,It was pretty much a fast pace workplace with lots of oppurtunity. It was a good job for me at the time but i honestly needed to find something much more closer.
good,"Panera was a really good job with good hours and stay busy work. The management messed up on my paperwork my second time working for the company I wasn't paid correctly multiple times, I also couldn't clock in or out. The hours can be very long but its worth it I had a good salary but the environment was very hostile a lot of bullying happening from staff members with little to no interference from the management."
good,"set up the bakery, get the cash drawers into the tills"
good,"I was ready for my very first big boy job. And of course I was just looking for a decent wage and a lot of hours and panera bread shines on that. It does a well job at introducing you to how awful corperations and shifty marketing can do for your image. I have heard great things about some of the other locations, However my location was surprisingly NEVER looked into. We were busy, Crazy busy. But that didn't stop our GM from treating everyone god awfully, completely okay with letting troubled 16 year olds drop out of school so they can pick up 15 hour days without breaks sometimes. One girl got sick on a 11 hour shift they refused to take away from her, instead of sending her home they reprimanded her for looking at her phone once or twice on her shift, that was both my assistant manager AND my district manager. All in all pray you get good management."
good,Panera Bread has been a decent place to work however there are never enough advancement opportunities within the company. They regularly advance those who are undeserving of the opportunities given and leave no place for those who have paid their dues into the company for a number of years.
good,"I worked for Panera and it was great the first two weeks thereafter you no longer worked the 40 hours you were hired for. Panera is a good company to work for considering the benefits, the company involvement in the community, aiding struggling employees (giving them end of day breads and pastries), and how conscious they are. HOWEVER I dreaded going to work because I had to stress about how much money ai would make for the day if I would even work 8 hours at all. Ninety nine percent of the time I never made 40 hours to cover my bills, I'd essentially work to pay gas to get there and back home. Also considering that the pay was not the greatest every penny counted. When the manager on duty decided it was slow they sent people home; which was the most frustrating which is why I had to quit."
good,"If you don't mind working in a restaurant it's as good as any. Standing in one place too much was hard, especially during lunch hour rush. Again, never enough employees per shift."
good,"typically busy during the lunch hour and dinner"
good,"Fun family feeling work place. Every worker where close o each other. We would have fun joke around but also do our job. customers were very close with us as well it was a fun environment, but really fast paste stressful at times;"
good,my days would consist of me joining the food line during lunch time 12 to 2 oclock it was always busy and hecktic. after that it would calm down till around 6 so we would have time to refill the stations with food and prepare for the dinner rush. the dinner rush was worse we always had a shift manager who had no clue what he was doing and not give us on the line enough help so customers would have to wait to long for there food and we would run out of certian stock. after the dinner rush we would restock until closing time then we would breakdown the stations clean them  and clean the food line
good,"Panera Bread is a fast paced work environment. It provided me the experience of working in the bakery, dining room, barista station, and lead cashier. I gained excellent customer service from this job. The management was okay depending on the on duty manager."
good,"Every location is not the same but as for the 1 i was at, they care more about the customer than the employee. "
good,"You know, not all of the managers were idiots there.. just one.. she knew that i couldn't work tuesdays and she scheduled me for one and that's how i lost my job."
good,Its a very constant working atmosphere. You'll definitely appreciate your breaks. Good news is you can expected to be proud of your long hard work day. I didn't have many bad experiences. It was a great experience for me.
good,If it was my only option I would take it but crew was not very good. My husband and I both worked for them at the same time and he had got sick and needed to go to the hospital and I had to be his driver do to meds he was put on and we both had a doc. Excuse and they didn't except it and let us go.
good,"Panera Bread was a great place for a first job. You work 6-8 hours most shifts. Management has its pros and cons. You would have great managers and then you have your share of bad managers also. However, that's every job. You have your pick of early shifts and then in between, and closing shifts."
good,"a typical day at work is stocking food, tossing out expired food, cleaning the whole work area top from bottom, the hardest part is the closing shift, some co-workers are hard workers others you got to put up with their laziness and push them to work."
good,"Panera Bread was not exactly the greatest job out there either, but it worked for a 16 year old's first job ever, but not much better."
good,"A typcal day at Panera starts out with coming in clocking in and checkng the log book for any information about the upcoming bake. I will, then go and turn on all of the ovens and the proof box. I go to the walk-in for bakers nd pull two transporters of dough and press a two hour timer. I start panning up the different doughs into their perspctive pans. I pull the racks of yellow dough and cookies. The cookies are prepped, set aside and the yellow dough is then prepped. i then go into the freezer and pull the additional cookies, blank pastries and scones. this stuffis panned upand set aside to reach propper temp. The bake is started. Cookies and pastries are decorated after they are cooled, scones are iced while hot. Soufles are the last items to be panned up. The area and equipment is cleaned up and dough for next day is pulled, panned up and covered, it is placed into the walk-in. The FOH walks the baked products and discusses any items that may have an issue."
good,Panera has a no Jerk Policy that is great for its associates who feel their manager is being to hard on them.
good,"My job at Panera Bread is mediocre at best. Yes, I have acclimated well to the demands of customer service. I feel confident in my ability to deal with disgruntled patrons. However, as far as the managerial staff, there is a load of improvement to be done. Having been an employee of this company for longer than the average; most workers are in and out in a matter of months. I have been there for a year and half. That being said, I am not appreciated for my hard work and dedication to this company. The managers are either distracted and lazy or they fiercely micromanage and condescend on a grand scale. On top of that, employee concerns are not heard at all, really. Personally, I have been in the same position with minimal hours by no request of my own. I show enthusiasm in respects of moving up in the company and have consistently been ignored and mocked for my interest."
good,"I loved some of my customers. The job is pretty easy, and I love the relationships I've built with some fellow employees. In my personal experience, however, The management was very unprofessional. They stood around a lot and barely work. They seemed to believe their only job was to yell t us to work harder and fill out paperwork. I also believe that our time constraints were unrealistic. And that corporate made so many unrealistic changes without any real experience or without at least conferring with actual cafes to see if the expectations and protocols were feasible on such high volume lunch periods."
good,   A good job with great food and people that are Artisans. Different management styles that work perfectably one from the other. A good work environment with room to grow 
good,I will never go back to Panera bread because it is a real stressful environment when it is rush hour and everyone wants Lunch or dinner and i would not go back.
good,"The GM at the Panera Bread I worked at was my only issue. He caused all of the problems I had, and this wasn't a difference of opinion thing. He was a bad manager, a liar and a hypocrite."
good,"Panera Bread is stressful, mostly for people who are not minors. Once you turn 18, and it is a busy day, you will most likely not get a break. Managers do not often help during a rush orders as well. Most employees do not often get raises when they should, even if they have been working there for a year plus."
good,"Good place to work however the hours are all over the place and they are always short staffed. "
good,"I did enjoy working at Panera Bread.  I was really excited went talk of becoming a shift leader.  However, that didn't happen and someone less qualified and much young became the shift leader.  There was a few younger and less qualified team member that took the position.  That was the main reason for me to seek other employment.  it became very much to my awareness that management position will not happen for someone in my age range."
good,"The job was very eye opening at management and staff. "
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Every thing breaks and it takes them months to replace any equipment. the proofer in my current bakery has leaked for over 6 months and they have still not replaced this faulty equipment. the water leaks up into my shoes and the employees are force to dredge through it.
good,"I worked there when they first opened and they would over work us and not give us breaks, even after 9 hours of work - zero breaks and all the managers would just go hide in their office"
good,"Work environment was good, management lacked in caring about my need of more work hours and to be flexible with my school schedule. They chose to not schedule me rather then just working with my school schedule."
good,"I worked at two separate Paneras and while both served their purposes, I believe they need to make time off requests better, some places have them so far in advance that its booked solid for months! overall nice place to work pending the management."
good,"The company is great and I hold it in warm regard. However, management at my local cafe is atrocious. The schedule is often put together last minute, the general manager is a cheap skate and hardly does his job when he hasn’t taken three weekends off consecutively. The management, save for one good assistant manager, have no respect for the employees or each other. The majority of the staff is fed up at the point."
good,"The managers were great, and the people I worked with were great, but there is so much to do, sometimes You wouldn’t get all your breaks, because they were so busy, and always short staffed, and when you did get a break, you would feel guilty about it. It’s not worth the pay for how much you have to do."
good,"Great Brand, but has changed a lot since JAB took over Panera. It use to be about the people that make a great place to work. but the brand has lost a bit of caring for its people. they also are trying to do too much, and the managers are not being given the tools needed to succeed. Now they do pay good, and a great training team."
good,"Lots of drama at the panera bread i worked at, managers were innapropate at times and very hateful and judgemental, cut hours when they wanted, gave me few hours, made me stay later than originally scheduled couple hours, and workers were always fighting and arguing."
good,"The Main thing is the customer this and the customer that, always satisfy the customer. The work place isn't all that dandy. You got cashier acting like wannabe managers and managers well how did they become one. If they're not sitting in the office than what are they doing. Especially during the afternoon hours towards closing."
good,Panera was a fast paced environment. It was a fun  part time job. I got to work with a lot of younger people and students. Customer service was a big part of the job.
good,Baking and being creative and making appealing food is rewarding. I use to watch the customers look at all the pastries with pure anticipation in their eyes. And the Pastry case did look very appealing. I learned how to make so many different foods. I was fun and sometimes overwhelming . At the end of the night Panera donated all the left overs to the shelters in Owensboro. I really appreciated that. So many places wont allow their employees to have any of the left overs and would just throw them away in the dumpster. Not panera. Everything is donated.
good,"Lot's of running around, very repetitive work, working with a timeline or timed, constant evaluation through management. "
good,It a good place the people nice there and it good work environment and everyone their friendly and help each out as much as we can. It good doing for the customers.
good,"Prepared food daily, weighed meats and cheeses. Made prepared foods such as tuna mix etc. Washed dishes, kept back of house clean. Prepared meals for customers. Trained new employees and kept dining area clean"
good,"Work enviroment is fun and accepting, pay is okay for a nonfull time possition. perfect for highschoolers or college students looking for a job with a flexable scheadual."
good,"I worked at Panera for almost 2 years, and the experience was gun and loved the people there. However, management kept changing and it was hard to adapt to new mangers ever 6 months or so. The last manager I had fired me, because of medical reasons. I could work for a month, and I even told them, but since I couldn't replace my hours. I was let go. Overall I loved working for Panera, but the management was all over the place."
good,"The staff and the managers were good, the only problem is that it's a high stress work environment especially during lunch rushes and the pay is not adequate for the work you do."
good,"Do not become a Baker. Spent years working for this company. Took away our bonuses and higher raises. No appreciation or respect for Bakers at all. Really sad, considering the hours and labor we have to put into the job daily."
good,"I liked working here as my first job. It was a really good place to learn the basics of customer service and I made some friends there that I still talk to to this day. At the end of the day, I just saw it as something hard for me to stay at because my managers weren't willing to help me move forward in the company and the company didn't offer me anything great in benefits."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Upon my initial start, the job was OK. During my time up until I left, the managers, not all but most, were terrible. The first store manager was fired because he was running the store into the ground. The new manager just wants to fire everyone who actually works and replace them with people who don't know what they are doing."
good,"Panera Bread has a great atmosphere and management is willing to work with you on time off and such but other than that it is not a place to work if you are trying to move up from an associate to management."
good,I like the friendliness from customers and staff. I like the location as well. The hardest part of my job is balance and the most enjoyable is the production line.
good,I had to be there by 4 am to set up the bakery; there was no one else there that early so I could not call out if I had a emergency and could not come into work
good,"I enjoyed my coworkers and some of the regular customers made each day wonderful. I felt that I was respected for my long time there and was treated as a senior member of the staff, but not quite management."
good,"Fun place to work, no room for advancement bad pay bad benefits"
good,Working for Panera has its perks trying the different sandwhichs and soups were good its alot of work for a little pay so much different product to learn about.The equipment is always breaking down but the staff is cool to work with.
good,like working here because they keep you busy
good,Management
good,The hardest part of the job is lunch rush expecially on sundays. The good thing is you have amazing co-workers to help you through it. You will almost never get out on time. I learned how to work in a challenging position.
good,"The job itself isn't hard, it's a lot of brainless manual labor in-fact. Just the issue is that it's primarily staffed by a bunch of high-school students who do not get the idea of being professional in the sense of ""You shouldn't call out every other day and then when you do work, you work very little."""
good,Panera really takes care of there employees on the down side its hard to communicate with co workers.this job can be very hard and demanding but for the most part good place to work
good,"Work life varies from cafe to cafe, but at the end of the day, the tasks done at each are the same. For the most part, people will either work up front interacting with customers, in drive thru, or on the production line making food. "
good,Manager at my location was extremely rude to employees treated us awful but always was kind to customers work wasn’t hard at all they just require you do everything other than what you applied for
good,Es una buena empresa para laborar. Los salarios son muy bajos. Los horarios de trabajo son poco flexibles
good,"Serve customers in eating places that specialize in fast service and inexpensive carry-out food."
good,"limited time of delivery,others would take close by runs,that could be completed very fast,or multiple deliveries,and give the longer distance deliveries to me"
good,"Most likely the best coworkers you'll ever have, but probably the worst management. Most of the manager are young and inexperienced. The company runs mostly off young kids that are there for a max of six months."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Turn on try to do a driver position if you have a car payment at this job it will ruin your car and it won't allow you to survive with what you get paid
good,"Panera is a constantly changing, growing business. They have attempted to dip into all avenues of of the business, mostly with success. Over the last few years, especially with the change in CEO and public trading status, the focus has shifted from customer care, food quality, and training, to bottom line profit. The labor model is minimalist and makes is challenging to meet guest expectations. Overall there are good days and bad. This job definitely keeps you moving"
good,Fast paced job. learned how to multitask while taking orders in drive through and also making food. Management did not really help out as much as they should. They rather watch you sprint up and down the aisle in the office than help.
good,Panera is a fun place to work. But you got to be on your toes at all times. They teach you responsibility and time management. The workers  are very nice and accepting.
good,Warm homely setting. It a place to meet and eat. Great place to have breakfast on the go or delivered to your doorstep if your home is within the area of panerabread.
good,"everyday at work I tried my best to have a smile on my face, If i have a bad day, I leave it where it came from. I'll give the customer a chance to talk. I keep a very positive vibe towards the customers by  not saying or do anything insulting.  respect their taste and generally treat them the way that I would want to be treated."
good,"Great job for a teenager, but for someone who needs to live off a good amount an hour & not enough hours a week I don’t recommend. Great quality food, awesome cleaning standards, great place to learn about teamwork."
good,"Sometimes you have to be fast pace if you want to get things done on time, other than that it's a pretty easy going job, just a lot to do sometimes..."
good,I do way more work for them than I get paid for I'm worth so much more than they pay me. I struggle to get my hours. They send me home early or even  on 45 min breaks  .
good,"Knowing all the positions, they would put you anywhere at anytime. So you're just getting put all over the store throughout the day. Sometimes the work load was too much and very stressful. But overall it was nice working there."
good,"I was not only disappointed in my manager , I was also disappointed In myself for letting someone make me feel so low . I made sure i did my job correctly and on the time limits . I'm guessing my manager did not particularly like me because I wanted out of their asap. Not only did she mess up my hours , she made sure i would throw the towel in . I'm glad i did i believe their should be respect , Integrity , a sense of comfort and all over a manager should have better work ethics than their employees , and in the long run he or she should take the employee to the next step ."
good,enjoyable job. hard work is rewarded. i started out unsure of how it would be working for a corporation but realized its a great first job. not somewhere i would want to stay for a lifetime but definitely enjoyed my time here.
good,"requires alot of job training. "
good,"Panera is a great place to work l, as I job I got during high school I couldn’t have asked for anything better but as I am getting my older I would like to find my forever job."
good,I was here right out of high school. It was a good first job in showing me how hard and bad things can get. But it also taught me something very valuable: gotta work for the dollar. While this job definitely underpays it's also the food industry so you can't really expect a whole lot. The benefits when I worked here were AWFUL and practically robbed the employees which was very unfortunate. I had good growth here and it helped me push through my first years attempting college and work.
good,got good hours and a lot of money. Very busy so you’re never just doing nothing. Always restocking or helping out a coworker with an order. Coworkers are super friendly
good,"Panera Bread was no different than any other restaurant, it had it’s ups and it’s downs. No where you work will be actually what you want. So overal Panera Bread paid the bills"
good,Took orders and engage conversation with all the customers and clean dinning room and stock and did inventory and train new people and also help stock soup or prep food for the line
good,My coworkers were great. Some managers were awesome and respectful while others were not. Many coworkers were understanding and very helpful in stressful situations. There was always a lot of drama going on between some coworkers
good,"Panera is not an easy job. Very hard work in the dinning room to meet ceratin guide lines. Staff is diversified, but he customers for the most part are very pleasant and loving. I always got told I'm a hard worker and do a very good job on the dinning room area. They would be crazy to let a good worker like me to leave this comapny. "
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,working there was very intense and fast paced. It's like any fast food place people complain all the time but you just have to use good customer service skills to help them with what they need. I learned how to work collaborative with others and also how if you don't work together things don't work out which leads to conflict. The hardest part was people being in a bad mood which then made other people not happy and then people being stressed didn't help either. I made some great people working there so that is what was really great about working there.
good,"I enjoyed working with people of different cultures, The customers were wonderful and I became friendly with many of the Sunday regulars. I filled in a lot for others who called in sick and also did a lot of overtime. Hardest part of the job was not knowing when my days off may be. We did a schedule but no one followed it and so some times I would work 20 hours in a week and then 56 hours the next. I enjoyed the food prep responsibility to support the front store staff."
good,"A typical day at work varies according to however you are trained once you are in a cafe. There are different areas to work in, such as the production line or the barista station. Cross-training makes you a more knowledgeable and useful employee. It's a fun environment to work in, and there is generally room for growth and advancement. It can be chaotic at times, as with most food service jobs, but that can be an enjoyable part of the job in itself."
good,"Upbeat environment with a younger crowd. Management could use some work, and for the amount of time I worked there, I didn't really get any benefits out of it. Not really a place to work if you want advancement. It's a good place to be if you need to help pay your way through school though."
good,"Panera is a wonderful company to work for in the upper management group. The associates carry allot of stress for the management group. The associates performance has a direct affect on the income of the management team that seems to have a direct impact on the associates to produce more at a faster pace without reaping the benefits the management team receives."
good,The job is not terrible. I left the company and actually came back. Can be very stressful at times but with the right crew not so bad. Definitely not for everybody.
good,Employees are always fun to work with but management always depends on who gets assigned to work at your store or who your General Manager is. It was really fun working there most of the time but sometimes the money was worth the amount of work we had to do.
good,Panera Bread was also busy and fast paced. We were never short staffed but the volume was always high.  Managers were always stressed it took a toll out on employees. Enjoyed the food discount.
good,"fun ,fast paced,learning on the job is expected,I enjoyed working,management seemed a bit stressed."
good,I loved working there at one point. The past couple of months the management was really bad and i had to leave. My hours were cut short because we got a new manager and she didn’t want me to work a lot.
good,My job is okay but we are understaffed which causes stress on the managers and the workers. The work place is constantly moving and filled with positivity.
good,"I was in need of a job and Panera was the first to hire me. "
good,Not the best when it comes to scheduling and favoritism is show heavily. Great customers and coworkers create the environment which I like very much and campustown keeps it busy too during school months.
good,"At the time, it was different. Now management I’ve seen when I go to get food is way better and they listen to people concerns rather than before. Idk"
good,A typical day at Panera Bread for me was working 12 hours or more a day and continuously rotating job positions. The managers were constantly rude and on power trips and abused their power.
good,"Panera Bread is a good place to work. Typically, hours are limited, so it cannot be a full source of income. The management is okay, and the employees are mainly focused on work and themselves, making no attempts to be overly friendly."
good,Exactly what you imagine working at Panera is like. Quick paced and always busy. Lunch rush gets stressful. I didn't like that employees had to pay for their lunch.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"if you like a very relaxed atmosphere perfect work for you, very relaxed, slow, managers are ok, gm is awesome, low pay so don't expect to move up in the company unless you are buddys with the right people"
good,"It is honestly a great job for a high school student, but once adult life hits with bills to pay, it isn't really a realistic job. It teaches you a lot about time management, customer service, a fun work environment, but unfortunately the pay isn't the greatest for someone on their own."
good,"Overall, Great place for growth and advancement. Great staff team but unfortunately I lost my transportation to work so I was unable to continue working there."
good,"i liked these jobs very much.i was a good worker and fast and accurate at all these jobs. i learned patience, punctuality, customer service, and met a lot of good people. the hardest part of the work is to keep your cool when stuff goes ary. the best part was getting positive feedback from your customers and co-workers."
good,fast paced job that requires multitasking and cleanliness. The hardest part of job is making sure catering is done on time for orders to go out. No set schedules and possibility of moving back and forth between several cafes.
good,"Great start up job especially for high school students, not so great for adults. They expect a lot fro you, it is currently owned by MANA now and benefits aren't great."
good,It was an ok job but depended on who you worked with and who worked before you. Some days you would come in and nothing would be done   Then you would bust your butt to do their work and your own
good,"Working at Panera Bread taught me how to work hard, efficiently, as well as diligently. I learned how to make customers happy as well as how to have a happy attitude in front of everyone while working."
good,"cashier handled in store sales , put the customers proper order in a computerize cash register , also barista work made any type of drink upon customers request . great customer service."
good,"Management was very poor. You were never given the hours you asked for and if you tried to change your availability at any time, you were denied. Working conditions were not very good."
good,"Good for younger kids who are just starting to look for a job, teaches good work ethic, builds knowledge of how a company works, good training, good quality."
good,Ok place to work. I work at night typically by myself so I'm not around the daytime crew. High turnover rate for other night bakers makes it hard to get a normal work schedule sustained. Other than that the work is quite easy.
good,The people I work with are great. They offer plenty of training and encouragement. It's a family oriented business towards the employees and guests. Very peaceful atmosphere.
good,"I enjoyed working for the Panera Bread company. I respect and admire their ethics and willingness to give back to the community. However, the particular Panera Bread I worked at was atrociously managed."
good,"The most enjoyable part of this job were my coworkers and our interactions. I learned better social skills, and multi-tasking. Work was very fast paced."
good,"very demanding, time oriented, not very accepting of an outgoing personality. pretty fair job overall. co workers were pretty nice and accepting of personalities. Managers/ Pro Team Members didn't help around too much. seemed to be a stressful environment when co workers were bossed around. Coworkers were more of help than managers."
good,"My typical day at work required me coming to work an hour early to set up the products such as breads, foods, and drinks. After that I would have to check to make sure we have enough inventory to last us the whole day. From this job I have learned to be more social and connect more with customers since we had a lot of regular."
good,Early morning shift enjoyable but long nine hours are not very pleasant. Management can be very organized and helpful at times but most of the time they are very hands off.
good,"I show up for work 5 - 10 minute before my shift. Clock in and begin my shift investing what needs to be done. I enjoy talking with the customers and helping them out. I love that our product is good and that the company keeps trying to improve the quality and the experience at the restaurant. We have mostly hard working workers, but there are a few, managers included, who seem to be there just for the paycheck. I find myself enjoying the job more when the good people are there. The hardest part of the job is keeping my comments about things to improve to myself and just focusing on the customers. I problem I have is too low a wage and too few hours."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Good management; good benefits. They are very flexible with schedule. However, they pay low and too much workload. Good for students though."
good,i was able to try new or seasonal foods all the time before they were announced and i had a few friends working with me so it wasn't too bad of a place.
good,"Working at Panera bread gave a very homey feeling to me, I always felt good coming in to work."
good,"For the first 11 months of my employment I really enjoyed it. The hours were good, the people were great, the customers were amazing. After I got pregnant things got a lot harder, and the managers were not accepting of this."
good,"Starter job, no promotions available, compensation is minimum wage at best, work environment is good."
good,"This was a very great place to work. We had to work at very fast paces, and work together. It was all about the customers and making sure they were happy. i enjoyed the many things i learned, and the people I have met."
good,"Structured well balanced work place."
good,"okay place to work, everyone is nice to you and there is always the benefit of good food!"
good,none.
good,"You are either in, or out. If you aren't willing to play the game, then you won't survive in management with the KC franchise. It's not enough to simply do the job as best you can. You have to play their politics. There are plenty of rumors over whom is sleeping with whom to keep their jobs or to get promotions over more deserving candidates."
good,Panera is the place for you if you like change. Panera is constantly changing and experimenting with items on their menus to keep customers coming back. It's never boring and there is always something new to try.
good,"It was alright working there, the employees were all very friendly. The managers were biased and once they had favorites it was very hard to get on their good sides if we didn't get along with the favorites. They terminated me without warning."
good,Pay sucked for what an assistant manager had to deal with sometimes would be alone for hours on end would have to stop my manager duties to help the front end which was fine but then I didn’t have enough time to finish my duties short staffed and employees don’t care about their jobs
good,I have been with Panera for about 5 years. I've seen so many people come and go. They currently where bought out by Hamra Enterprise. Ever since then I feel it has gotten a lot better. Only reason I'm considering leaving is because I'm at a dead end. I keep getting told all these plans they have but nothing seems to ever happen.
good,"The company is an amazing company with a wonderful advancement allowance, able to work in different positions within the café... love the company but I had very bad experience at my old café within management team.... Would still recommend this company to anyone."
good,"No big issues other than management,  it can become really hard to move up in the company . Over all I enjoyed working along side friends and family , definitely would work for them again"
good,"A typical day for me starts with waking up at 4 am to be to work by 5 am. I am required to work by myself without any breaks for the first 3 or 4 hours of my shift. I am almost never able to clock out at my scheduled time because we are short staffed so I end up staying anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour after my scheduled shift. Panera is the first and only job I have ever had so in my 4 years there I have learned a lot; patience, time management, leadership, organization, attention to detail and so much more."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,I took this job in hopes to grow with the company but soon found out it was not stable enough to support cost of living in this area. Also the pay was very low for driving and tips were sporadic at best. Could not count on a good steady cash flow.
good,Moves fast and always challenging.  Tends to be reactionary instead of really thinking through the correct steps. Good work life balance in most cases.
good,Me personally I never like to bash anyone or anything so I’d just say in the beginning it was ok because I was working another part time job as well so I was getting two incomes until tat was stopped then my hours were cut short at Panera.
good,A typical day at work involves taking orders and running food. The management was good. The workplace culture was trusting and respectful. The most enjoyable part is working with all the delicious food.
good,It was great to have something stable and the pay was cool but there were times where I kinda didn’t want to be there but overall it was a good experience for a first time job
good,The nature of service at Panera is basically customer service. Dealing with people who are hungry can be very tasking to one’s patience and tolerance.
good,When i started at this job it was great management was fair and i actually enjoyed my job however once management shifted this job became a poor and unenjoyable enviornement.
good,The job is very intense and highpaced to say the least. The best thing about the job in my opinion was having the opportunity to meet dozens of amazing people that I still keep up to date with well after working with them. It's always good to know that when things get rough you can still have fun getting through it with the awesome people next to you.
good,"Fast paced at times and can be kind of stressful"
good,I've worked at Panera a year and a half I'm still at the same position I was in when I started after an old gm left advancement was changed drastically certain managers don't listen to your availability it seems that they don't even communicate with each other the work is easy but stressful you get a 30 minute break if you need a smoke break that's pretty easy to get but get a raise every 6 months I just haven't gotten mine yet management won't stay in top of what they need to work can be stressful during rushes but down time is so boring and at my store we're not allowed to transfer to another location and if you quit and reapply at a different store in the same district you'll most likely get denied
good,"My experience spanned the transfer of internal control through the sale to a huge conglomerate DAC.  The benefits of working for a home-grown company, such as being employee-centric that celebrated their accomplishments was lost when the new company took over. The best way to explain this is that each cafe and each employee transcended from having a name, to becoming a number."
good,"Panera is a great place to work for if your managers care about you and the business. I wanted to keep working here so badly because I love the atmosphere, and what they stand for. However, after working there for a year and a half, I got no raise. In fact, even with multiple regular customers constantly telling me how much they loved me and how they thought I was a great employee, I still was somehow looked down upon and treated as if I was annoying or not even doing the bare minimum, when however it was the managers themselves who had the issues."
good,"I believe this job is great for a college student just trying to make some money. Sometimes I do think we should get paid more, especially if you are promoted to a trainer. It is definitely a place I would not stay at for years."
good,"its a fun place to work at. good people and decent managers. fast paced and gets very busy all the time. food is good, and the discounts are decent. and the pay is fair."
good,"Panera bread is a fun environment but the management is not that great. Raises happen rarely, and are very small no one will listen and no one cares but is an alright  for a first job"
good,company is awesome depending on the district everywhere is different. I do not agree with some of the policy’s and and a lot of the time the pay is unfair for the amount of work and stress the employees have to go through
good,I loved working for Panera up until they transferred a GM over to my location who brought her own managers over and played favorites. Maybe the other two managers that were there originally that have worked for the company 10+ years quit without warning.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,We normally have about two or three rushes in one day and it all depends on whet department you work in. For example the production line always the most busy constantly and can be extremely stressful.
good,"I believe that Panera Bread is a great place to work at when under the right management. The manager there was okay, but he would give out unfair pay amongst employees even though we all did the same job. The schedule would be posted late most of the time, but management was very flexible when it came to requesting days off."
good,"I am always busy here and after a 10:30-8 shift (which I work usually) I could leave here with up $150 in milage and tips, but usually around $80-$100. But, this more likely because Panera is severely understaffed. I love the fact that I make a lot of extra money but, it can quickly become very unorganized, frantic, and stressful."
good,A day at Panera was very busy days lunch was always busy.  The hardest thing was learning how to make all the sandwiches.  It was a nice job I worked with two of my friends but we still worked very hard to get our work done.
good,"It can be a good place to work and a lot of fun. Management keeps moral up and they teach you a lot. The hours change weekly and that's the bad parts as you may be hired as full time, but you might not get it all the time very unpredictable."
good,"Overall a decent job but not enough pay and not enough hours. Co-workers were easy to get along with, positive attitudes. There wasn’t enough staff. Tons of people would come in late without letting a manager know."
good,"A typical day would be preparing food for customers such as salads, soups, and sandwiches, restocking out bar (where all out ingredients are), cleaning our work area, cleaning restaurant floor, restocking drinks, and refilling coffee every couple hours or so. I learn the basics of what I know now from Panera."
good,The employees were fantastic and made work fun. However management could be quite condescending and rude due to the stress of the job. Seemingly always hired out for managers and rarely helped people move up in positions.
good,"Nothing was ever managed how it was suppose to be. I had to learn things on my own, sometimes I even had to teach people things , who had been there longer than me, besides I spent about 4 hours washing dishes and cleaning every day, for 9$. That’s what the cashiers were getting paid to take orders n talk all day."
good,This place can be very stressful at time . not enough staff at times.management helps when can. If you can handle high pressure situations then this is not a bad job to have
good,Restaurants suck no matter where you go but Panera is not the worst I've ever worked at. I only left because the Catering Manager position I was hired for kept getting prolonged and I was basically in limbo at a training store. Another opportunity came around that I didn't want to pass up.
good,"Since working at Panera I have lost over 30 pounds.  I believe that is because of the healthy foods that are served at the café.  We recently moved to a new location with a drive through along with delivery services, kiosks where customers can place orders on their own, as well as rapid pick-ups which can be placed on line.  Most of the management team is great.  Other do the bare minimum.  The job is very stressful during peak hours of the food rush.  The store was short staffed, leaving the hardest workers to pick up the slack.  I enjoyed the 60% discount on meals during breaks, that IS when I was scheduled a shift long enough to Get a break!"
good,Mostly a wonderful place to work - the customers make it enjoyable except for a few - my first two  managers were a delight - the third manager was a nightmare - I got along well with my other associates
good,"Lots of rushes during the day. If you are not interested in high stress areas, this is not the job for you. Also, management is very lax about whether or not you take a break."
good,"Coming into work, typically I'd ask the manager in charge how the day has been, and if we are low on any product. If so I'd bake whats needed. After doing whats needs to be done I continually check labor and start sending associates on break if we are slow. Once its time to close I make sure to count all of our baked products for the nighty paper work, and pull the rest of the drawers to deposit the money. Once I'm done with all my nightly paper work I have to check and make sure all of my associates areas are clean, stocked, and ready to go for the next day."
good,"Great job for college students looking for a part time job. However, being with Panera for 3 years, there has been little to no pay increase or employee recognition. Each day is different."
good,Each shift required the completion of each stations hourly duties as well as interpersonal skills. This job taught me how to communicate effectively and work as a team.
good,"I was a cashier and I did prep at times and served when they needed me to. But my main job was a cashier, customer service handling money. Made my customers feel happy and satisfied."
good,"Easy work, some days cashiering, other says food running or line/dish washing. management became overbearing when they all wanted a promotion, can get very busy and fast-paced.  Overall a decent experience."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"The place itself is good, and the work is not difficult. I did enjoy getting to meet and interact personally with all of our customers. However, communication is lacking, and getting more hours is incredibly difficult. There is a chance you will be scheduled on holidays, even when you do not normally work those days. Unlikely to be cross trained. Promotions seem to run by manager's personal preference."
good,My typical day required very early mornings prepping the bread and pastry area. Cashing every guest out. Serving tables. Expediting Food for the servers. Running the drive thru window. Management was important in allowing me to take on more duties. The hardest part of the job was knowing I needed more than the job had to offer. The most enjoyable part was interacting with the people.
good,"I learned all about different types of breads, pastries, and food ingredients that I will always remember. Typical day is making food or taking orders, stocking stations, and making sure customers are taken care of. Easy and overall good for a first job."
good,"This job was very stressful, managers as well as coworkers weren't understanding and didn't work too well with others. Such as dealing with school or other jobs they didn't understand. Also managers can tend to be very rude"
good,"I actually really enjoyed working at Panera. I liked all of my coworkers, I enjoyed the job. The downside was the management. My coworkers and I would place bets on which of us would be asked to stay later by one of the managers. I got along with all of the managers but they were all overworked, underappreciated, and constantly stressed."
good,"I left due to poor management, and a lack of friendliness between co workers. It was not the right environment for me and i do not regret my decision to leave"
good,Panera is a good work environment if you enjoy working closely with others and as part of a team. The managers sometimes don't communicate with each other so things can be chaotic at times. But overall it's a friendly place to work with great food and good hours
good,"Not terrible. At the end of the day it is a part time, temporary job and you should not expect otherwise."
good,This company is a good starter job for teenagers in school Not a lot of pay but you can get a pretty decent amount of hours if the manager likes you and deems you worthy!
good,"The best part was the people you worked with, and that wasn't always great. They push people far to hard, expecting a lot of work in a little amount of time, then complain when it is to there standard."
good,"Panera bread is a nice place to work at. The managers there are cool some just need to fix how they manage the store, scheduling isn't the best if you're a nightshift person because the seem to over hire people of nightshift"
good,"Working at Panera Bread was your typical start up job out of high school, or if you were trying to earn some money while being a full time college student. The management was hectic, there was a new one each month. The pay was minimum wage and didn't match the time and effort put into your work. There was minimal training, but the job was easy enough not much was needed. It's competitive for hours, and there isn't much room for messing up. "
good,"The management could be improve you never know if someone can manage until they are put in a certain situation, and they switch managers here and there so it is a hit or miss that kind of sucks."
good,I come in I set up I check over all the product we got in I sort it out to better keep everyting in order as I work and start panning up all the product and pull all the pastries from the freezer and prep and bake off the flat breads
good,"I don't think this is typical of Panera Bread in general but my managers would give away a lot of free food and that was one of the only things that made working there worth it. Even in my position as a trainer, I got free meals. I don't even get free food now working at a nice restaurant, so thank you Panera."
good,Fun environment but little to no order. Managers are confused about what to do and there is no leadership skills shown. Managers are unmotivated and unmotivating
good,"College environment. Fast paced. Some workers were  never showed up, always late, on drugs and never got fired or dealt with. And I would have to do twice the work. Best part of the job were the customers."
good,"liked working at Panera, and love my co-workers. Lack of communication about work schedule or guarantee of it. Do not care to say anything else at this moment."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"At Panera Bread I learned a lot of things mainly how to work the line , barista, and prep. Although I think management didn't know how hard you really worked , sometimes it was stressful. Hardest part of my job was to work with no help sometimes . I really enjoyed nights were my friends worked with me ."
good,"I love the people I work with, I am just not too happy with the slow advancement. I just need a higher salary to make ends meet and they weren't complying to that"
good,"Managers do not follow through with what they tell you. Stressful environment, Kitchen is not big enough to deal with the amount of orders recieved, Fine."
good,"Depending on your co-workers, it can be a really fun place to work like any other food joint. Bad management on some occasions but that's anecdotal at best."
good,"Great first job. Teaches you what it's like to work in corporate America. Just the location i worked at specifically the two female manages were good for being envious of the females and pro-male. There was a high turn around but i didn't realize it until i was next up on the chopping board. The issue that lead to my resignation was almost unbelievable. I request off for my moms birthday, but instead of giving me my moms birthday off they took me off the schedule for everyday that week and schedule me for a double on my moms birthday."
good,Panera Bread was my first job I am thankful for laying a foundation with them. They taught me a lot of being responsible and having a consistent work life.
good,The managers really take the time to make sure you know what your doing and to help you if you don't. They were able to work with my son's school schedule so i was able to spend more time with him. Overall a good place to work.
good,good job for a college student just needing extra cash. Basically only make tips because you get deducted your tips from your salary. It is nice you get paid mileage but only making $6.00 while delivering.
good,Panera has good staff and they work as team most of time. most of the managers are nice and patient. I like to interact others and help them for fixing any issue
good,"typical days at work there can range from the place being packed to it being so slow. i didn't really learn anything new other than what the job entailed. management is alright, most of them there are nice and friendly but there's a couple who are super rude to the workers and don't even know what they're doing themselves. i like everyone who works there, they're all cool and nice. there really isn't anything hard about the job unless it gets busy and stressful. the most enjoyable part of the job is the food there."
good,"I learned a lot from working just under a year at my local Panera Bread. Although they were flexible with my schedule and my other commitments, they lacked the motivation to fix their employees concerns, and failed to address issues that would likely improve both costumer and employee experiences."
good,"I learned the importance of keeping food fresh and healthy and the work of preparing the food, stocking the food and rotating the foods. Now rotating the foods was probably the most difficult part working there because there was so much to remember where the food goes, why, how, keeping up with the expired dates, keeping food separated from other foods. Also that they like it when you make the sandwiches, salads which ever food you're making, has to be made in an exact order. Panera is all about making the food fresh, tasty and healthy."
good,"At the particular location I worked, there were unethical behaviors taking place within the work place. I made attempts to discuss these activities with several managers only to find out they already knew and did not care. I enjoyed staying busy in this workplace, though I felt uncomfortable at time with the extra curricular activities taking place. On the other hand, I excelled quickly in the performance of my duties, gaining two raises with the first four months of employment. Due to the behaviors I could not agree with, I left the job without notice. A decision I felt was necessary, though regrettable in retrospect."
good,"when I first stared my training was with a manager who had just put her 2 weeks in and she was not really in the mood to train. When I asked questions, she rolled her eyes and sighed. When my training was over i still was not comfortable with my tasks as the prep person every day. It was an important task and I was clueless each day. The GM did not come to ask if I was comfortable after training, and when i approached her with my concerns and questions she was furious. Also i worked between 8-11 hrs each shift and break is only 30 min, they managers on my shifts wouldn't allow me to go on break at a reasonable time because they did not want me to get behind. It caused me to be a very unhappy worker."
good,A typical day at the job would have to deal with a lot of homeless people and to fix the situations that are thrown at you forehand. I learned a lot from Panera bread and I really think it will benefit me a lot in the future. The management is somewhat great its just real had to communicate at times during rushes. The hardest part of the job would have to be dealing with not customers but your actual coworkers who really don't like to follow protocol.
good,There were a lot of managers that all told you pretty different things and were hardly ever on the same page. There weren't a lot of people who were close to my age so I felt a little isolated in that way and it was a lot of people entire lives. There's nothing wrong with that but people just had different points of focus in their lives and different aspirations than I did.
good,Panera is a great place to work as long as you have a good management team and a good crew. The GM and the DM were great people as well as the supervisors and associates.
good,its a okay job for someone who needs a temporary job to make money for college. Its a cool place for short term. i want to weld so i only see this temporary
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Its a really fun job when everyone is doing their part, including management. Corporate values and culture is agreeable. I do enjoy serving food without any hidden ingredients."
good,"In the world of fancy fast food, Panera is very good at being that.  Everything is frozen, it could be so much better.  As an employee you will find it tough to get a raise and they will take advantage of you if you let them.  As a cook, you should be used to it though..."
good,Panera Bread Taught me to multitask when i was a cashier and a barista. There was always a line out the door of the restaurant.
good,Very busy but friendly co-workers made it a great environment. Cleaning at the end of the night was the most difficult part about the job
good,A typical day at work was always stressful. I learned that even when you help someone out they may not return the favor. Some of the managers are awful! My co workers attitudes and helpfulness just depended on the day. The hardest part was dealing with rude customers and rude employees. The most enjoyable was getting to see the elderly people.
good,Many locations suitable to those who like to move around and need more hours if your current location is over-staffed. Corporate guidelines that you are required to adhere are somewhat overblown but it comes with the franchise.
good,"It was a fun place to work overall, and most of the staff is young and upbeat but it had it's ups and downs. We had our usual meal rushes and there are ALWAYS customers coming in and out. I was trained on cash and as a server. The management was changing constantly but most of the managers i met were very nice. My co-workers were pretty positive overall. A lot of the people who work there are in high school or college. The hardest part was managing your work hours with school and social life. And getting the schedule you want was hard too. What i liked most about it though were my co-workers. I made life long friendships with a lot of them and everyone makes you feel like you're at home."
good,Nice company if you work in the bakery. Good benefits & pay. Get to work independently as there'should only 1 baker at a time per cafe. 3-5 weeks of training inluded.
good,"Its been a long time since I have worked at Panera Bread, but I had a lot of fun. Its a very busy place during lunch hours but I worked with a lot of good people. I highly recommend Panera Bread as a place to work to young people looking for a job."
good,Working for Panera Bread is a good job for a first time job to get started. Management is very dependable and everyone including managers put in a effort to help out and try their best to understand and be engaged with their employees
good,"Over the couple years with this company, I learned a lot about food and safety along with management skills.  Co-workers were great but management struggled over the many years and is still struggling.  I enjoyed being able to experience many new things as I advanced up the ladder and appreciate all of the opportunities given."
good,"I currently have a complaint pending regarding s*exual harassment. I reported it four times to management and was told to ""deal with it outside work"". I was fired for complaining of a male employee who followed women around staring at their rears. Also managers refused to give breaks required by state law even when you asked for them. I know associates sometimes worked 10 hours with no break at all."
good,"Great company to work for"
good,Panera Bread is a small business that gives you a very home feeling. Everyone there pretty much treats you like family even the managers. It is a place you will like to go to and work on a daily basis.
good,"Co-workers were the best I have ever worked with very sweet and polite. Management is poor, all they care about is sports instead of doing their jobs and assisting customers. Management are all best friends/Room-mates so looking to grow with this company you better hope one or more leaves or gets fired. Not teachable, constantly getting yelled at for ""not doing something correctly"". Management will NOT give you a raise and keep you at minimum wage and hire employees with less knowledge and work performance and start them out at a higher wage then others. Management will make you open store alone so they can acquire an additional hour of sleep."
good,good place to work overall. It had its faults. it was a good place to work while i went to school full time but other than that the benefits werent all that great.
good,"i worked for panera for almost five years and the managers didnt ever really manage unless there was a problem. the employees and associate trainers were expected to handle the brunt of he load so all of the employess were a big team. I learned better problem solving skills and how to lead. the hardest part of the job had to be like any other customer service job, bad customers. the best part of the job is the repeat customers"
good,"Its an enjoyable place to work, interact with customers. Friendly staff and management."
good,"The bad:"
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Fun easy going work place. & modules to be trained on. Salads Sandwiches, Barista, Dining room, Cashier, Back of house and Baker. I became associate trainer in 3 months."
good,"This position was assigned to one manager with a part time lead, to run the entire department needed two managers to be as effective as possible. I worked well with the lead and was able to stabilize the department, running more efficient and cost effective with low turn over and no accidents. Progress in this position allowed for my Promotion to Plant Manager."
good,"Fresh, fun food in a fast paced professional environment."
good,"Working as a family,learning different positions starting the shift off saying hello to the crew members grabbing name badge apron and gloves clocking in and starting to serve delicious food to customers by hand it was very exciting.hardest part  of the job was the trash especially in the winter."
good,"I have worked for Panera for almost 6 years In Pa I enjoyed my job I now am working in NC "
good,Managers were unfair sometimes with the work schedule. They had more preference for other people.
good,"A typical night of work at Panera starts at 9pm and ends at 7am or later depending on the volume of orders. The most common work day involves multitasking 10-20 tasks, non-stop from the time you check in to the time you check out. The ovens are dangerous and hot and the compensation and benefits are not nearly enough to justify the large amounts of manual labor and pain-staking attention to detail that is required of you. On most nights I worked with a single assistant, of varying competence."
good,I enjoy my current employees. But I must admit there are a lot of issues with communication and respect.
good,"I have work with my companyfor over the past nine years, I love what I do and what the concept is, I am just looking for advancement. What I enjoy most about this job is the people and business side of it. I love manageing people and enjoy the finacial results."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with my coworkers and building new relationships with the customers
good,Always fun when you help bring a new company to the area. Myself and two assistant mgrs. hired and trained 60 employees to have a sucessful grand opening.
good,"I thought I was gonna work full-time hours But it turned out to be Part-Time,I was disapointed. They would send me home early.Maybe I got 30 hours a week. I thought i was gonna be there a long time. But i had to quite. Not enough hours for me."
good,"I wouldn’t say I loved it, but it could’ve been worse. Got a lot of overtime, there were always extra hours to pick up. Depending on the manager and time of day, your shift could be drug out an extra hour."
good,Good training - store to store management varies A LOT.  My store was not the greatest.  I did not feel like the leaders had a strong handle on managing the employees at my store location.
good,Very friendly staff who is willing to teach you everything. Understand customers and this job will be a breeze. The hardest part about this job was lunch and breakfast rush.
good,This job was only giving me 10 hrs a wk so i had to unfortunately put in my two weeks. The people were nice but i needed more money because i am trying to provide for myself. As well as it was a bit too far from my home unlike this job.
good,"They offer okay benefits , but communication is not very good and it's a very overwhelming job , the hoildays are the worst . Once in while u mite have to leave county for bakers meetings"
good,"Because I work at a somewhat smaller cafe, we get less business, I feel like leadership is a little more intense about foods costs than most. "
good,Clientele is probably the worst part. All seem very impatient for the quality of food they are receiving. Its fast food but it isnt and you get a very high quality clean product for ur money.
good,Almost everyday most people had attitudes because they couldn't be in certain positions. Managers also have attitudes and sided with the wrong person in confrontations.
good,"Panera bread is a wonderful place to work at, flexible hours and fun work environment. Lots of room for advancement, we work as a family and build great relationships."
good,"Was a floater for many stores, nice environment ."
good,"I love working here at Panera; however, it's been addressed by customers and higher-ups alike that our organization and communication is not adequate."
good,Fun place to work until you do the jobs of 5 people. Then they don't want to promote you or compensate you for your hard work. It was very political and frustrating.
good,"I had great satisfaction serving customers bread that I baked. "
good,My first day at panera bread I went and had two trainers train me and show me what to do and the place seemed really comfortable and relax the managers introduce me to every one and had me learn the food products and how to greet the costumers and to servce some of the costumers that needed it
good,you are responsible for making sure any and all baked goods are ready for the next day. as well as cleaning and prepping for the following night. Nothing was really learned. its a simple job. the direct management was wonderful. but just above them have no applicable job experience as a baker and do not actually know how to do the job. it can be a very stressful workplace at times. because if the store did not order the ingredients needed to make whats required you have to hope a store close by has what you need and can spare some. the hardest part of the job is that you don't really get a break. the best part is that most nights you can play music in the back ground and sort of get into your own groove.
good,prepare food for the customer at a certain pace you were always busy so time would fly. I learned how to make yummy food. Everyone worked as a team. The HArdest part was getting used to being on your feet for 6 or more hours.
good,"I only didn't like it necessarily because of the general manager at this time, but it is a fun experience starting out. it is fast paced, and you always have to be doing something like cleaning and such, just keep that in mind."
good,"Overall it was a decent place to work at, most of the time the managers and co workers were complacent and respectful but at others they weren’t really considerate and were sometimes disrespectful"
good,"I worked at one of the busiest Panera's in the company. The job is not hard at all, although it can get a little hectic. During the prime hours of the day it can be overwhelming to stay on top of everything, but that is only for about two and a half hours out of the ten hour work days."
good,"There’s a delivery fee, but the driver only gets $5 of that delivery fee whether it’s $15 or $25. Tips aren’t guaranteed. Also have to use your own vehicle, there’s no company vehicle/gas card."
good,coworkers are supportive and nice mangement was never really hands on when i was there customers were very rude kinda stressfull but what job isn't good for the summer
good,The managers that I had don't work their anymore. I made good friends at this job and usually had a good day at work. They are able to work around your schedule and it is easy to pick up shifts.
good,Working at Panera Bread was different that I had expected. At first I was on the computer and after a few days of that they put me on the register. I knew how to operate it but some things I had to ask my manager for.
good,"great first job, i really enjoyed the time i was employed here. during lunch hour it becomes fast paced. Most employee's are very friendly and fun to work wit."
good,A typical day would be short considering the few hours given. Most likely prep would be done and it would be non stop order taking and serving. Customers were pretty friendly which was the best part. Worst part would be management. I learned to deal with a friendly work place environment much better.
good,"It is good place to work with good benefits.  It is a fast paced environment, not meant for everyone.  The workplace culture is different at each location. I learned about time management."
good,Panera is a very productive work place and it provides a good work environment for people who may just be entering the work force and don't have a lot of experience. They give people the chances to build experience that they don't have.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"The food is good, pricey, but worth the money. I like working there because the staff is really nice and very flexible with your schedule. Taking off work was really easy and switching your schedule with someone was pretty cool."
good,The environment at Panera was well at the start; however the management majorly lacked communication skills with not only each other but the associates as well.
good,"I believe that Panera is a great place to eat and relaxing place to hang out but I don’t like working there, it’s very stressful. I learned how to work the register, work prep, do dish, and am learning line and I am thriving to learn more.  The most enjoyable part of my job are my coworkers because I’ve grown to have good relationships with some of them."
good,A lot of work and kinda stressful when it comes to getting the food out  5 mins or under. Management is a hit or miss. the culture values are good when used.
good,"Can be fast pace and a lot of fun. There is room for advancement  if you want to make this a career. To be honest working with the public can be stressful, but other times it can be very rewarding."
good,"I started to work at Panera bread towards the end of 2017, I always loved going to Panera with friends and family. I heard about a job opening through a friend and she raved about the work experience and the skills she got from working there. Fast-forward to October 2017 at Poughkeepsie north, I was hired immediately as a food line worker and a cashier as well. A normal day at Panera for me would be me preparing the dressing, crotons, avocadoes for the food line, other items included bacon and slicing the bread. While I was there the management was pretty good, it had its up and downs just like a regular jobs, but me being proactive I spoked to the manger on ways to improve production in the store. "
good,"I am currently on leave, looking for a new job. loved working there but upper management refused to promote me after 5 years of being with company. had to leave."
good,"Management has a wealth of knowledge and experience. They prefer to promote from within. Work life balance is preached but in reality the expectation is work and personal life is set to the side. Great benefits package. It’s still the restaurant industry and with that comes a certain caliber of employees, no difference from full service. They are one of the highest paying with the best benefits packages in the fast casual realm."
good,The co workers I worked with here were above excellent and 2 outa four managers I loved working as the barista at Panera bread  its a place of learning for sure  and developing skills of communication. I wish they raided more I would return back if I could.
good,"The opportunities for advancement and wage increases are not sufficient. Others got minimum wage increases, but folks above the minimum did not...…..."
good,"At first, it was a good upgrade from my last job. but over time I saw how sucky it is working in a place that is primarily teens and young college kids, a LOT of drama ...."
good,"You should always come to Panera ready to work. If you’re slow you will have something to do whether it’s making coffee or tea or wiping down tables in the dining room, there is always something to do. During lunch it will get very busy and can be stressful just remember to stay calm and just know that the day will go on."
good,I enjoy going to work at Panera everyday.  I have fun and everyday brings about new and interesting challenges. The management is pretty good and my team specifically is great. We trust each other to the the work done right the first time with mastery.
good,Bread Co. was a fast-paced workplace. Not many breaks and only got 30% off of food only when you were on the clock. Not many good benefits insurance wise.
good,Panera is a place with a really good working environment which seems quite like home but its not really a company where one could really seem to grow or climb. I worked for Panera bread for almost 4 years and my last year I got promoted to management and I felt like I truly worked hard but it seemed like my work wasn't valued at all.
good,"Was good to work there because it was with people the same age as you, very fast pace, coworkers didnt mind helping out if you messed up an order, understood that i had to leave the job because of my mental problems."
good,"Work was fun and productive, but since I frequently worked evenings it could be a little slow and boring. I did a lot of closing, which was kind of fun in that it was a challenge. The people were welcoming and relatable. It was exhausting to stand up for long hours, and sometimes the work was very stressful during a lunch rush. But that is part of working in food service."
good,"I was able to learn many things as to how to handle customers and stressful situations especially since the restaurant industry is very fast-paced and stressful. Although, at times it felts as though the managers would schedule the wrong people at the wrong times or always end up calling for someone to cover a shift and overall it became too stressful and we kept losing workers and getting new ones."
good,Panera is a professionally run business and managers take their position very seriously. For the most part all a dishwasher would have to do is clean dishes. It is very tedious and something I would not recommend to someone if they didn't like doing the same thing over and over.
good,"This is a food made fast type of restaurant like Five Guys, but kitchen staff is paid the same minimum wage as a cashier. Its nice that the whole staff gets tip money and that pushes us a little over minimum, but the stress between different positions doesn't evenly reflect their pay. "
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"When I worked at Panera I found that there was a large discrepancy between the day management and the night management. During the day I consistently saw managers on the floor helping and supporting associates to assist customers, because that is when they do the majority of their business. However, it is a lot more lax at night. I sometimes saw managers watching TV or doing homework in the back office while the associates were struggling to serve customers up front."
good,"I didn’t have a chance to work for Panera Bread for that long, but overall it was a good experience, job is fun and General Management at the store I was in was great although I haven’t heard the same experience  coming from people I met from nearby stores."
good,I worked here as a delivery driver.  I started in Garden City in March when they were first starting this program.  It was alright for a while but I quickly learned that driving my own car with personal insurance is not a good idea and not safe so I concluded I should no longer be a delivery driver.
good,if you are in catering the job is stressful with little help from management. Tips are just okay and you get paid for mileage. The hours are variable and can start overnight.
good,Panera was a fun environment the workers worked great together the only problem was the management leaves you without help.If you’re going on a rush they don’t help at all but I enjoyed it because I am a very fast learner.
good,Panera is a fun place to work with great people in the cafe! I was an overnight baker. I was alone most the night and it was nice! My job was very fast pase and stressful at times but over all was a good job!
good,"I loved working there while management was more functional than it was when I left. I had fun and got along with all of my coworkers. I had plenty of regulars and customers who liked me and the overall facility is nice! I had a lot of fun working there but my schedule became too stressed along with the management dropping in quality, I couldn't handle it. But highly recommended as a first job! Great place, good astmosphere, awesome people!"
good,"This may be for my own personal Panera but my workplace was the most unorganized and disfunctional place to ever work at. The hours were either too few or too many, worked like a dog no matter how long the shift, and management isn't afraid to pile on the responsibilities. Customers either come in with flocked emotions; to say they would all be rude or kind. Food was also unpredictable as some days it'd look fresher than from the farm and other days it's rotten and a host to creepy crawlies. Pay was never good, even when we got taken over. I still make less than everyone who started after the takeover, and I'd been there for 2 years prior. Constantly asked to be a Shift Supervisor, since I basically had that responsibility. Never moved up, never even thought of for raises, and I swear they thought they could keep doing it."
good,Still my favorite place to eat even after working there. They stand with their beliefs for providing clean and healthy food options. Low pay. The co-workers were helpful and fun to work with.
good,I worked at Panera Bread for almost 5 years and it is a very good company just not great managers. They have amazing courses to learn everything you need to know about your position and paid training for management. The only downfall is you need to have very good people skills to be a great manager and my boss didn't have those skills. Hardest part wold be keeping up with dining room during rush and dish because on campus it could get very busy when students get out of class. You also need t maintain good ticket times no matter how busy it is and that could be a challenge. Turnover rate is pretty high but that just means more hours for someone else.
good,"Work load stacked upon u with little to no concern about you, no one jumps in to help. Get your nightly phone call from the boss and thats it if u get that"
good,Panera Bread has great food and beverages. IT is a high paced environment where you are not only the manager but have to handle the jobs of hourly people as well though out the work day.
good,i learned a lot about food safety and handling. i took on some roles of managers like checking the temperatures of the food and managing the line to tell everyone to when to take breaks. typical days were very busy for lunch hours and dinner
good,"Very busy especially mornings, multiple managers on hand and were very friendly willing to work with employees. Customer on the other hand could be very rude and impatient."
good,"Panera bread has a great welcoming atmosphere not only for the customers, but also the employees. Their moto is that panera is an everyday oasis. This means that it is a place that people can come to everyday to relax and be in good company. Panera taught me excellent customer service skills, and great collaborative work with coworkers. Panera has a closer team of coworkers compared to anywhere I have worked before."
good,Its a really good company to work for. But you have to be able to move very fast. The way the business in ran is very organized. The fact that you can say you serve actually healthy would without additives is also a plus.
good,Panera is a great place to start at but I wouldn't recommend it as a career choice. They lack good pay and hours and benefits aren't great. Overall it's a great start for a first time job but I wouldn't recommend it for a career choice.
good,Fun place to work at in college. I proved to be a good employee so they constantly worked around my school schedule and I could work as much or as little as I wanted.
good,"For the most part, Panera is a great place to work. It's like a big family, sometimes a little dysfunctional too. You definitely get what you put in. Do your job and be willing to learn and you will enjoy it."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Management with both stores needs better communication. From top dog down to employee. I enjoyed working with Panera. Has good, healthy food. Employees need more motivation that it isn't just another job. Give a reason why they should give 120% every day."
good,"fast paced environment, stressful, not enough training, improper management, good location, good work schedule, hard working employees, to much favoritesm"
good,"Panera Bread was a great first job and taught me a lot about responsibilities and customer service. The job is stressful but the co-workers are what makes the environment tolerable. The company as a whole does not treat their Managers as well as associates well. Examples include but are not limited to: no raises, low wages yet claim premium wages, odd hours, no holiday pay, no time off."
good,its an ok place to start out working but there are varierty of thinks to do like taking out the trash bringing recyclables to the trash bringing dishes to the dishwasher and stuff
good,"Located in a collage town. Often slow since school is out. On game days the place is very busy. Flexible hours, management could be better. Wonderful staff. The food is great."
good,"Panera was a good opportunity for me to experience the food industry, with Panera being the sort of halfway between casual dining and fast food. The people were enjoyable and the location is very comfortable."
good,"Cashier, Maintenance, Closing, Barista, and Inventory. I learned how to work efficiently in a fast paced environment. The setting was competitive but still enjoyable."
good,"Food rushes are generally not too bad. I heard that working at Panera Bread is usually bad because of the management but I believe it has to differ store to store. The hardest part of the job would be just dealing with unexpected errors such as the soup store breaking or running out of certain items too early. I enjoyed working with everyone because we all are similar in age and can relate to each other. I learned that I like to switch around in position. Sometimes the repetition can be frustrating so I would want a new challenge, but the managers did not train me in other areas when asked. In turn if someone called off it was sometimes a hassle to move people around because everyone only knows certain spots. But overall I liked working for Panera, its a great company. Also I worked with good people."
good,"I love the place, the work isn't too hard and the coworkers are great, but upper management lost its touch with its employees, and in two years I received no more compensation than when I started, despite good worker evaluations."
good,"Panera uses a business model that encourages young people to come to work for their first jobs as CSRs and Food Prep cooks. Great model, but you wind up carrying the load for those who don't really want to be there."
good,"Taking care of our customers and assisting associates when needed.  I learned to communicate more effectively with the associates and demonstrate my leadership skills.  "
good,"This job can be stressful at times because the company expects so much from its employees. It is not a laid back kind of job. However, the managers and people that I met while working there have been great. I think it was a very good first job, as you learn a lot about responsibility and time-management."
good,My experience. With Panera was a learning one. Having the bubbly personality I have. Enabled me to express that with customers.giving them an enjoyable dining experience.
good,"What to expect at a typical day at Panera Bread as a cashier would be serving many older customers and providing service with a smile. Although, since we serve many older customers, you have to be patient with them."
good,"A typical day for me would include clocking in and getting straight to work, I generally went in around either 8am or 3pm so it was always busy work. I was always around my coworkers and managers so it was a stressful atmosphere at times but it usually made it easier to keep working harder. It was a fairly enjoyable job and I still have friends that I used to work with so I feel the job was worth it in the end."
good,"Culture was great always working and meeting new people. Flexible hours, discounts, and paid time off. "
good,I would come into work and the person on shift before me would not do their duties before leaving (cleaning and stocking). I also mostly worked closing shifts because I was in high school. They would get away with not doing this because some managers did not care enough to check them off. Management is bad about finding people to cover shifts and I even went in sick to work because they refused to help me find someone to cover my shift.
good,"Not much to say,great concept of the vision of the company. Every employee should have their breaks when due.  Keep communication with all line members so things doesn't get overwhelming with them."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"A lot of gossip between employees.Lazy employees. Stressful during lunch and dinner, everyone gets angry, but no one does anything about it. Working on the line seems  like its the worst, and getting a break seems the best."
good,"Love Panera bread, friendly service and the customers were great.fun and exciting environment to be a part of.I would highly recommend Panera bread.fun fun fun"
good,"Good place to work, not enough hours. Kind of relaxed for and laid back for a restaurant. Do not always get breaks doing busy days. Mangers are usually low key."
good,"I worked for Panera for about 7 years. It is very fast paced, with high expectations. I worked my way up through the ranks rather quickly. So I will say there is opportunity for growth. Once you get into management though, the Work and life balance gets blurred quite a bit, which didn't sit well with me. But I know other people who thrive in Panera's job culture. It's different for everyone. But overall, a good place to work."
good,Not a career was only a temporary job.  Management was not great pretty ineffective at times.  I think it is pretty silly that I have to write a review.
good,"At Panera, everything is very fast paced and you have to be able to pick up on things quick, which i can do. Everyday is pretty much the same, I go in and do whatever it is that needs done. I can not really say anything at my job is hard, but the most enjoyable is that fast paced environment. I like going in and being busy until i am done for the day, because it makes the day go much faster."
good,"The job can be very stressful. If you want a job where you are always busy and don't even have time for a quick bathroom break, then this is the job for you. Honestly though, it is a good job, it just doesn't provide benefits right away which I need."
good,I found it very enjoyable to work there.Time flew because we got very busy. But it was fun and customers were regulars most of the time. I knew them by name and they enjoyed my serving them. Food was great and very healthy.
good,I learned how to deal with cash and how to communicate well with people. We also would learn how to clean efficiently and we also learned good team work.
good,It is a very tedious job with little excitement. If you don't mind scrubbing dishes and mopping floors then this is the job for you. It's a job for those who know that they have no more potential in life.
good,"awesome place if you just need a job. employee discounts, vacation time, overall nice. however your entire experience is built around the management. at my particular store everybody was nice and really close, but  a couple managers that would just ruin the mood and really had no ideas what they were doing overall. Great company, lots of good opportunities if you find the right store"
good,"I loved the customers I helped but some nights were worse than others. The co workers were sometimes unbearable because they brought their baggage of the day with them or sometimes the stress from the job would cause them to be a little rude but sometimes I loved them. Some managers were nice and some were mean, which was expected. Bread bash was always fun but pointless sometimes. Some nights I'd stay until 11;30, or midnight because they wanted the store to be spotless which was irritating. Lunch rush and dinner rush was definitely the hardest and drove me up the wall but when it was all over, it was total calm. So yeah, a hate/love relationship."
good,My views are mixed. This is a great first job and i highly recommend It to anybody. They start above minimum wage and have a lot of opportunities for pay raise and  low level advancement. However being such a new and innovative company leaves a lot of room for mistakes. My personal experience was with management who were unable to adapt and move forward with the company and gave a stressful and toxic experience.
good,"The typical day would have been, lots of training and perfecting the items for opening day. Although it was a fun job, I was in high school and unable to work late. I am a natural shy and nervous person, but the manager there made sure that I was comfortable, and was learning in the things I was doing. The hardest part of the job was being left to take care of things alone. I was unable to handle both drive thru, consolidating, and order taking alone comfortably. The Most enjoyable part of the job was making friends both professional and personal."
good,"Can be fast paced at times, but there was a good work-life balance. The compensation was less than I anticipated but it is a good company to work for."
good,The place is lovely and the people are so nice. Work wise people are still nice and you make friends easily. My favorite things are the bread bash and doing Cashier.
good,"Overpriced food you can make yourself at home for a fraction of the price. I only worked here to help pay my way through college, so it was worth it for that."
good,"A great place to work if you have a management team that cares. Each store is different. The first store I got hired at was a great place to work. It's still food service so the demands are high for people who are there to work. You tend to work with younger kids who don't value hard work. After transferring stores, I was disappointed. Less organization, terrible scheduling, unreliable workers, poor management."
good,great intro level job and fantastic place for young adults. you get a half off discount on your days worked. You get to learn a lot of different decisions in the food bussiness.
good,typical food service. fast paced. no set schedule. good food. discount on meals. Point Of Sale software/machine  is easy to lean and use. the team acts like a family in many ways.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,I liked working here but couldn't stay because they were not able to give me the respect and pay I deserved. Some of the managers actually cared while the others couldn't care less. Also all types of customers which is both a good and bad thing.
good,Really easy work but no benefits or any sort of long term benefits. Did enjoy working with the people there. It's easy work and you get to learn how to make pricey sandwiches.
good,I love the customers we serve< they are what makes the job great. I l like how the company lets you be unique with a warm atmosphere.  I would work here again
good,"I enjoyed working her most of the time. But some days there was a lot of drama and that's not easy to work with. I did make some friends while I was there, though. I left this job because I moved."
good,"Overall if you need customer service experience this is a great place to get that.  No matter where they assign your position you are always interacting with customers.  Especially since it is a cafe you can really have stimulating conversations with a lot of the customers, which gives them a very welcoming experience.  The culture is very positive and encouraging.  Everyone is there to make sure tasks are being done in an effective way."
good,working here honestly wasn't too bad you get out what you put in. If you just want some job then this is for you. It's always good to work in the food business at least once in your life.
good,Depending on what time you worked and what job you had. the job could be fun and enjoyable. I had learned how to handle money alot better than I had before.
good,I learned the company is a good company and cares about it's health.  Hardest part of the job is continuing to work when something is always changing and company can't keep up with it.
good,Great people (staff wise) upper management kinda sucks long hours lots of standing. Supervisors are awesome and nice.You get mileage for doing deliveries
good,Nice Place to work love working with the customers need more hrs. And feel like Managers need to encourge the employees for there work they do there to be appreciated
good,"It demanded a lot of commitment and time, the environment was fast paced but most of the workers were happy to be there and the management seemed to care about their jobs."
good,It was a great experience for me I liked working into I moved to St. Louis I couldn't make it to work on time anymore I tried to transfer but before I could they let me go after I told them that's I noo longer lived close to them anymore but other then them acting like they didn't want to transfer me it was a great experience.
good,Panera bread is a great place to work as a young adult. Its very upbeat and energetic. However if you want a job were you can move up in the company Panera bread might not be the best choice for you.
good,"During a typical day, you will have to deal with employees and managers that lack communication skills, which is a downside when things need to get done. I learned to be more upfront and direct, to get things done. The managemnet staff does not communicate with one another, they have had over 4 employees quit during a span of 1 and half month. The hardest thing for me the lack of communication the company has. The best thing about the job, the discount on your meal."
good,"Always learning new things on a typical work night. Learning techniques about proofing dough as well as baking the dough. Learning about the crust, how to ice products. it is a great baking position with opportunity only so far."
good,Enjoyed the relaxed workplace environment and flexible work schedule. My school-related conflicts were usually respected but occasionally I ran into problems with management being disorganized and stressed.
good,After working at Panera for about 3 months I got very tired of management. The manager was very rude and disrespectful. The people were great and customers were as well.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Working for Panera is a high-energy, quick paced environment.  The products and customer service are held to high standards. Working for Panera, you will learn what ""clean"" means through their products."
good,"Nice place to eat. Food is delicious."
good,"This was my very first job, and I feel that the systems that Panera has in place are a great way to learn about the food industry. It is a really good start for anyone who is looking to get into management or who is just looking for a respectful hourly job."
good,"Working for Panera Bread is about what you would expect from a ""Fast-Food"" environment. It, however, is miles ahead of McDonalds, Burger King--etc. The staff are usually* friendly, management is usually* quite good, the food is good, the pay is minimum wage (or slightly higher), they hire minors >=16, Fairly good Part-Time Hours, a tendency to work Full-Timers over 41 hours, and in a clean environment."
good,"My day started out with setting up the line, getting product and getting and slicing the bread. Then making sure that everyone had what they need to start our day. Cleaning up the area so no one would have to stop what they were doing. I learned that when you work as a team there is nothing that could stop us for reaching our goal, on speed, accuracy, and making sure our customer enjoyed there food. The hardest part of the job was learning that we would have a new product every season, but after learning everything it was great. I enjoyed the people and how they love to just talk to you about a great job that we were doing, seeing the children smile when they got a cookie that they wanted."
good,Usually worked 8 hour shifts at nights making food. I learned more responsibility and how to better balance personal life and work. General Manager was usually very understanding about school schedule. Co-Workers were usually not very reliable. Hardest part of the job was balancing the 30 hours with high school as well as leadership in Band and Colorguard. I enjoyed meeting people and making people smile.
good,"I like the different variety of sandwiches that we offered, and tasting them, being open to new things. I was raised on white bread you buy in the store and the basic lunch meats mayo and mustard."
good,"I love coming into my shift and seeing all my co workers which I consider my second family. Everyone for the most part is very high energy and positive which makes for an enjoyable shift. Hardest part of my Job would have to be when labor is high and there has to be hour cuts, weather it has to do with me losing hours or me having to close down the kitchen with just one other co worker. We do try our very hardest to make every harder situation positive! Always having fun, complimenting one another on our job throughout the shift and at the end of the night when closing we love to sing and have fun while we get our job done"
good,"Poor scheduling leaves many of the workers by themselves allowing only minimal production, and causing angry customers in the mean time. I've also learned that i could never get a handle on things because things are always changing so we have to be flexible. Some co- workers can be frustrating seeing how others have to pick up the slack for them. I believe their isn't any hard part of a job. Every situation should challenge us in a different way. The most enjoyable part is knowing that we've done a good job."
good,"My typical day at work changes depending where I am in the cafe.  Lets say I have a closing shift at the cash register.  My duties are to take orders, get pastries, bagels, drinks and takeut orders for customers. Management watches carefully when it comes to cleaning duties.  Breakfast and lunches are the busiest times for Panera, with the occasional mid morning rush.  Your uniform is non-slip shoes, jeans, polo shirt tucked in, apron, and a Panera hat.  Any cleaning has to be done when there are no customers.  There is only one complaint I have about Panera's management.  This is that they make you stay and clean the store even though your shift has ended.  In my opinion, when someone's shift ends they should go home. But because Panera has so many cleaning duties, and they are so busy it is almost impossible most nights to get out on time."
good,"We would show up at work wait to start shift. On a normal day it did not matter what shift it was I would check to make sure everything was stocked up and that it was clean well for the most part to be in the middle of a shift it was really just that the floor was cleaned up as much as possible and that their were no dishes on table, also making sure the dish-washer removed the dishes from a container in the front to wash them. All through-out my shift I would continue to make sure that the dishes, tables, and floors were clean and taking care of. The main thing about Panera Bread is that the customers did always come first we were to make a customer happy no matter what it takes.he  The management was ok for the most part better to eat and be a customer then to work their. I know if I just wanted to eat I could go their with no worries. My favorite part of the day was when we got really busy and we did not get a break because I love helping people and making them happy and believe it or not people will be happier that you got their food right then any other job. like I said its a decent job but the only reason I left was money and Hour."
good,"It was a fast paced, safe environment with a lot of friendly interaction with customers. Long days with only half an hour break."
good,Working for Panera Bread is rewarding and at time challenging.  The people that I work with are wonderful and I enjoy working with them.
good,"Had a lot of fun when working with the right managers, learning a lot, and the food was great. Managers were nice, associates where okay."
good,"Panera Bread is a great company which aims to serve all natural, high quality food to a diverse group of consumers.  Panera Bread demonstrates what they call ""Panera Warmth,"" teaching its employees to be kind-hearted and welcoming to all people.  It is an everyday oasis for its guests and it provides a healthy menu that promotes good eating.  I have created great relationships with my coworkers.  Panera is a fast-paced, medium stress job, but it is a lot of fun."
good,This place has good people but up until now bad management. It is slowly turning around but it is going to take awhile to be up to the Panera standards.
good,"I enjoyed working in the bakery, and slicing bread, making food. That was always my favorite part. I learned that Panera is considered a restaraunt and not fast food, which is what I thought. Managers were very helpful when needed, but they weren't always easy to get along with. I got along with all of my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with all the orders we get. We have people coming in, ordering over the phone, online, ect. It can get really busy, sometimes I would go all 8 or 9 hours with out having any kind of a break or drink."
good,"Hours vary, work 1st shift but mostly 3rd shift. Started as a baker and worked my way up the chain to a Baker Training Specialist with certifications throughout. Management is unstable, 7 market managers within my 10 years with the company. Co-workers are very supportive in one market and unsupportive in the other. Varied hours with little to no support would be the hardest part of my job. I enjoy training and working with my employees on a day to day basis. Watching employees grow within the company is enchanting."
good,"I enjoyed the work days at Panera for the most part. The cooperation has solid systems dialed in for its employees to quickly and easily prepare the food. "
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Fast pace, fun place to work. Lots of good things to eat around you. You learn a lot about bagels and breads. Mandatory quarterly Sunday night meetings about new items coming in and items going out."
good,"Working at Panera Bread gave me many opportunities to meet new and interact with new people on a daily basis. At Panera I've learned how to make quick observations, multi-task in a fasted paced environment, and create specialty drinks."
good,"The biggest thing that I can take away from working at Panera Bread is the ability to satisfy a diverse community of guests. I interacted with many guests, all with different tastes and preferences. I can say that I am able to better achieve customer satisfaction because of my experience at this workplace."
good,This was my first job. They helped when they could to work around my school with only a couple mishaps. Overall a nice first job and a place to learn a lot.
good,"great Job and fellow associates are great to work with and for - upper Management VERY questionable, would not trust them as far as i can throw them. no loyalty."
good,"If you work the morning shift you can expect to be busy all afternoon."
good,While working at Panera Bread still attending school and having an internship they were very flexible with my hours and everyone was treated like a family member. The most enjoyable part of the job was always walking in with a smile and greeting customers.
good,"Panera hires many friendly coworkers unlike other companies where malicious gossip is spread, at Panera I've noticed an upbeat and fun atmosphere. Like any food service job, it is very busy, and being a franchise this well known, it is extremely busy, so expect to move fast."
good,A typical work day i would get to work and clock in.  Then i would pick a draw and get the money for it.  I would count the money to make sure the draw was accurate before i start.  Then i put the drawer in and start ringing up customers. I suggest food and interact with customers in a positive friendly manner.  Once my shift is over i get my draw pulled it gets counted by a manager and then i clock out.  Most of the time when there are not alot of customers i am also helping out other people with cleaning/organizing the store.  I learned to put on a smile for the customers no matter what.  Also learned about product management and alot about Panera in general. management was very good for the most part and almost all my co-workers were great. Honestly the hardest part of my job was staying standing for so long.  I do not like to stand lol.  I enjoyed interacting with my co-workers and sometimes the customers.
good,"I was a opener and a trainer for 3 years.  The job is fun, but pay was very low, even for fast food.  Lots of fun people work there, but quite a few bad apples.  It really pays to befriend the store manager if you want to move up.  We cycled through 3 managers while I was here, the first pretty good even though he was drunk on most of his shifts, the second was great, and the third was awful.  They had about 20 employees leave in one 2 weeks (myself included) because of the new manager.  She cut the hours of one girl who missed a shift because she got t-boned on the way to work and was in the hospital.  "
good,"Food is great, atmosphere in cafe is warm, and I met many great friends at Panera. "
good,The people there are friendly. The co workers where the ones who made the job worth it.
good,"very nice job, claim enviorment, get expriance with customer service, and time/money handling."
good,"Very fast paced during the lunch and dinner rushes. Management not helpful when it comes to lending a hand when the store becomes busy and they all lack information. They are not on the same page you will more than likely get a different answer to your question from each manager. Managers think your life revolves around Panera Bread. Raises are are hard to come by. I loved my co-workers, they were the reason I stayed at Panera as long as I did. Overall, this is a good job for college students but I wouldn't make this a long term place of employment."
good,"While working at Panera Bread, my day to day would consist of, coming in 5 minutes early to clock in and start working, I would either be opening the cafe, or prepping for the cafe that morning, then I would vary back and forth from cashiering, and working line crew. While working at Panera, I learned to always do your best weather you're noticed or not, because doing your best is what is going to make work easier for not only myself but the other associates around me. Management, is one of the main reasons i chose to leave Panera, management was not the best and they worried about there-selves rather than the people around them. My co-workers were very understanding and respectful of each other, therefore being my favorite part of the job, if the management didn't have someones back you could always count on a co-worker to help you in a tough citation."
good,"The people i worked with were nice, management was very accomidating for a flexible schedule. overall a possitive experience"
good,"For its bracket, Panera is an excellent company to work for, but this is a bad economy for food service.  Benefits and considerations that used to be standard fair for employees have been removed (such as holiday pay), and the ability to advance, while still present, has become steeper."
good,My work day is full of hard work and team work. Getting the job done is not always easy when working alone in a fast paced restaurant with breakfast and lunch rushes
good,get in to work and you would get straight to work. if you work in the dinning room then you had to clean off all the tables bring out food to the customer over all it was pretty straight forward.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Typical day consisted of food production and safe food preparation. I was trained in all areas of the store from cashier and running to food production and inventory. Also certified in food preparation and barista and running. Management was difficult to work with because of so many different standards that were personal standards instead of company policy. Co workers were fun to work with, and enjoyable personalities. Never had a problem with a coworker. The hardest part was cleaning the production line because of the amount of food spilled and splattered. The most enjoyable was inventory because I like being in my zone and have a list of items that I can check off to complete me work."
good,"Cleaning and taking care of customers"
good,"The associates hired are not always the best as far as discipline and professionalism goes. I learned how to delegate responsibilities to certain individuals and lead a group of people through a difficult food rush. I have assisted in closing operations and counting store inventory. The hardest part of the job is working closely with fellow associates, who sometimes are difficult and effect you with their negativity. I enjoy developing customer relationships and being in a positions of authority over other associates."
good,There is a slow opportunity for advancement. The atmosphere in reference to the teamwork skills that have been taught to my fellow co-workers is severely lacking. And the upper management is excessive when trying to obtain information about the personal life of its emplyees.
good,"I work as a cashier, and enjoy interacting with customers.  It's a good company.  Only downside is not enough hours."
good,"When I went into work and after clocking in, I would jump on the register help the customers. if there was no customers I would bake cookies if needed, make Panini's, or even baguettes, and bagels. My co-workers were all great, the hard part of the job was doing dishes at the end of the night, there was only one dish washer person. when all the dishes in the café would come at me I had to try and keep up so everyone else would be able to do there job. The most enjoyable part of working there was at night when we were closing and we able to listen to music and we would sing to each other as we were cleaning."
good,I loved the job at Panera bread it was simple but for people who like to do different tasks on a day to day basis this job isn't for you its the same everyday its rare that anything changes
good,"Over the past two years I can honsetly say that Saint Louis Bread Company has changed my life.  My everyday goal is to share a loaf of bread with every arm.  Business is always fast paced, but the customers, managers, and co-workers make the experience easy gong."
good,It was a good place to work in high school. Not a great career. 
good,"Since this was my first job, it was great opportunity to learn about proper customer service and how to properly communicate with co-workers to make a better work atmosphere. "
good,"In the opening shifts, you are setting up stations, prepping portions and finishing any left over baking projects.  During the day, its customer service, food preparation, cleaning, and more portion prepping.  Night shifts are full of cleaning, food prep, and donation preparation.  The associates you work with are generally kids under 22, but there are usually a couple of adults too."
good,the fellow co-workers are great and overall its a good job but as far as management goes there is much to be desired!
good,"i love the job and i love helping customers. i enjoy meeting new people and helping them get what they want. I've learned a lot in the past year but I've also learned that this it takes a lot of patience dealing with the public. in general i am a patient person but I've had to increase that patience to be able to remain in the job. the managers are not all nice and they can make your day a non-enjoyable one. Never the less, experience is experience and later on in the future it will count for something. The most enjoyable part of the job has to be the food and having quality time with some of the employees because not all of them are amiable."
good,Work at Panera can consist of many different tasks. The management has improved since certain management members quit.
good,"Overnight shift. Very fast paced job. There is no time to stop and take a break for the first 7 hours. Mainly forming pastries, breads, and then baking and finished. No bread or pastries are made from scratch. Long nights are spent, mostly without any coworkers. You work alone, for the most part, except on days where more help is needed. Management is understanding and sensitive to our issues, though at times they are stretched thin with no time to solve problems. Hardest part is trying to find motivation. Job is the same from night to night, just different amounts and figures. Most enjoyable part is that it is an easy job because it is so repetitive."
good,"The ""company"" of Panera Bread is a great brand. The franchise unfortunately struggles in several areas, such as staffing and morals. The managers do their best, but are periodically hindered by the owners and district managers."
good,"Panera is a very demanding, fast paced restaurant. A typical day for me was to wake up 5am and set up the bakery. Once we were open I maintain the register, stocking the bakery, making coffee and preparing the food for lunch. I learned how to multitask, Organize the food by a plan-a-gram. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting your regular customers and actually having there order done before they said anything. I enjoyed knowing my customers and there families. The hardest part of the job was there was always an abundance of customers. There were times I wasn't able to take a breaks. Once we we took the trash cans away, we had to adjust to cleaning up right after the customer making it clean for the next. I just felt we were doing so much for the customers and we were not allowed tips."
good,A typical night at work lasts for about 5 hours.
good,"Typical day for me would be to come in and review invoices for catering. I would set up all my orders according to time of delivery and proceed to set them up. I prepared sandwiches, soups and salads and also provided all necessary utensils needed. Then I would go out and delivery all orders and after the deliveries were made I would come back to the cafe and help out if the cafe was busy during lunch. When the lunch rush was over, I would do all my call backs to the companies I did my catering deliveries to and make sure everything was enjoyable. Lastly, I would enter my invoices and necessary information into the Panera computer base.The hardest part of my job was probably making sure you allow yourself enough time to get prepared and have the deliveries out on time. The most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction of having the clients say everything was great and they enjoyed the food."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,This was my first job. I started out as an associate working in the bakery and on the cash registers. After a couple months I was moved to the sandwich line. I would make and ensure all orders were correct before calling up the guests to the counter to retrieve their food. I was made a trainer after completing a training course. I would train and test all new associates in all areas. This job taught me how to be a leader. Everyone working there including management was always smiling and willing to go out of their way to help out. The hardest part of this job was opening the bakery. I had to be in the store at 5:00 AM. The most enjoyable part was working with friends.
good,Prepare and bake products for service the next mornig. Usually worked alone unless really busy day ahead. Communicated with closing and opening managers. Work through the night.
good,"Working at Panera Bread you really feel like family, the down fall is not having personal time because of the erratic hours."
good,Panera is a fun place to work but I was not happy with the managers ways to handle situations.
good,"I loved my time at Panera Bread, but the district manager has made my days more stressful than need be. Otherwise, worth it. Decent pay, good hours, friendly staff. Everyone makes you feel very welcome and the positions are fairly easy if you can handle time-management. Can be stressful when busy, but that goes for anywhere. 7.8/10"
good,"Panera being my first job, I learned everything I know now. The mornings at Panera are busy because people usually what to eat breakfast. It is a fast paced job. We want to see the customers satisfied with the food they are paying for."
good,"Panera Bread offers a wage that is fair in the employment market, but one cannot afford to live with just a job at Panera. One needs twjo or three jobs to make it. I recommend using Panera for your insurance job and getting a second or third job to cover the biills Panera does not pay."
good,"Management cares more about good reviews than employees"
good,"I enjoyed almost all my coworkers almost all the time. It was a restaurant, so you can't ask for more than that. No matter how many pastries we baked, they sold super fast, so sometimes, customers would order twelve online and we only had three left, so we had to call them to figure out what they wanted instead. Customers at my particular location felt entitled to give us lowly college student workers a hard time for something that wasn't our fault at all. I left because I graduated and because the customers drove me crazy."
good,"Not enough pay for the work that was being done. Didn’t get treated the best by other coworkers, some customers were rude. Didn’t like the work environment"
good,"My task was easy, I did salads all day. It was simple I've also leaned a lot from that job also about different veggies and products. It semi always were a little slow."
good,Panera Bread management needs a lot of improvement in their communicaion and i don't want to leave a review this is not worth it at all. pointless waste of time.
good,"Collaborative and casual work place to work in. Employees and management were respectful, professional and dutiful. Training was proficient and to the point."
good,"They are a good company it’s just sometimes they are extremely strict about something or some people, I feel like sometimes are work is underestimated and you don’t feel much important as a person"
good,"This was a great job for me when I was in high school, as I worked as a cashier so it was never anything too complex or serious. I throughly enjoyed all of my coworkers and managers, and the job itself was fun."
good,"I told management that I loved doing the dishes because no one else liked doing it. So, everyday I was doing dishes because I was scheduled as the dish washer and no one else wanted to do it. I was fast, efficient, and enjoyed it a lot."
good,"I loved working there but some of the management was not very kind and could be discriminatory at some times. Work culture depended on who was working with you. For the most part, people were very nice to work with."
good,The job was fun and a good starter job. But like any other job it has its ups and downs depending on who your working with. The hardest part of this job is when your trying to learn how to do things in a rush but once you get over that it's a pretty fun job
good,"The CEO really ran a great large scale chain, the area of operations managers did a great job getting the big picture into the day to day delis objectives."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,It was a typical restaurant work setting the management was great at the location I worked at. The hardest part but also the most rewarding part of the job is that you have a high customer turnover rate during lunch and dinner hours so a lot of time will have a line out the door and there’s many orders that you have to take and get correct. This gave me good experience for a very busy work setting.
good,"As a baker, you're not fully forced to work at one location. You will work at other locations which is nice, if you're okay with it. A typical day would have the same order of prepping ingredients and pastries, proofing breads, and the baking and decorating sweets. I learned a lot about baking and did enjoy the job. The management for the Baker's team were fantastic. Knowledgeable, and very respectful. The issues came with dealing with the retail team which acted like its own high school clique. The hardest part of the job was getting everything done on time, looking right, without rushing or burning yourself. I really enjoyed baking and decorating sweets."
good,Enjoyed learning how to make fresh bagels and bread and seeing the transformations from dough to finished products. I enjoyed working with most of my fellow co-workers.
good,Pretty high tense unless you don’t work at a busy location. Rarely got my 10 minute breaks. Mostly focused on customers rather than how tired we were. Constantly we’re changing rules and choosing when and when not to enforce them. Mostly nitpicky on those they didn’t favor. Cut hours when they were upset with you.
good,"Fun workplace great co workers, great first job, its not that stressful once you get used to with the place and its better than working in McDonalds for a first job."
good,The customer always comes first. By providing guidance and support to my team makes for a smooth shift. Making sure aces are in their places. I have ordered produce and completed deposits. I'm easy going and can adapt to any situation with enthusiasm.
good,Panera is a great place to work at and the atmosphere is also something that does not get tiring. There are more responsibilities that are expected from a delivery driver than just delivery so be aware of that.
good,If you work on the line you typically just set up the stations in the morning. One person will handle breakfast and another person will handle the catering. When you close you just clean up from the day.
good,Panera Bread was a okay job honestly they did not pay enough for me but it was decent at least but i end up eventually leaving due to my school at the time but i recommended
good,Long hours standing on prep my back was hurting so much.but i liked working at Panera Bread. I wish i can go back again. I was on prep line and also as running food.
good,Pretty decent place to work although people are generally underpaid for their skill level. Lots of associates not showing up to work so the management basically works overtime constantly.
good,In the beginning it was a blessing to work for this company now it is Challenging to even keep a smile with how people act towards one another old -young -race still a problem in this world it's sad
good,"Panera is great for new workers, flexible hours, easy skills to learn and for the most part pretty relaxing. There’s many stressful /busy times but for the most part easy to manage"
good,"Working with a new management crew can cause problems, especially with two managers conflicting over developing the schedule. On the job, you learn basic builds for sandwiches, salads, and our heated items. The workplace culture can be nice, able to talk fairly freely, with reminders from managers to stay on track."
good,"Decent pay job, I live in southport but the job was in Wilmington. Decent amount of turn over since it is a mostly 3rd shift job. Shift was normally between 2pm and 10 pm but the main issue was living an hour away so it added additional unneeded stress to a moderately simple job."
good,"Panera was my first job, it was something to start out with especially being in high school at the time, but school and work got in the way so my hours kept dropping"
good,not a bad place to work. If you have worked at fast food places before then you know what to expect. Overall i have enjoyed working here.               Not sure why I have to write this just to apply for a job on this website.
good,"Working culture wasn’t that well , I’ve learned a few things from there . The management wasn’t bad but it also wasn’t good . Enjoyable part was getting discounts and meeting new people ."
good,like flexibility of hours collaboration management participation food was real good customers approachable cons were getting hit in the parking lot while parked and also shoveling snow in winter
good,Its a very fast paced environment that takes some getting used to but its a really great place to work. the food there is great which is a plus and most of my co-workers were friends
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,The management was very supportive but the job overall was very stressful. My favorite part about working there was the coworkers. They would make working more enjoyable.
good,"I only worked at Panera for a short amount of time but I enjoyed my time there. I was able to have different tasks on different days, my favorite being cashier."
good,"Great place to work, Love the people. Every place has flaws, but when the right team is in place, the job is a blast to do. They offer great benefits."
good,all in all it's a great place to work. the customer base is pretty easy going and most of them are regulars that take pride in getting to know the staff.
good,"although the management was sometimes iffy, my experience at panera was good and taught me many new skills. during my time there i learned how jobs function and how to succeed in a work environment, as this was my first job"
good,"I love the employees there, they were so loving and caring until a lot of drama happened and suddenly everyone wasn't so sure about each other. You meet a lot of wonderful people working there, I met most of my friends there. The hardest part of the job is when you try so hard for a job that you loved, only to get a little back."
good,Panera had a problem keeping relationships away from the business I needed more hours I wasn’t in school at the time and was available I want to get some skill and more professional job opportunities
good,"I love working at Panera because of the management team and the great food which I get discounts on. However, they are very particular with many things relating to advancing in the career, and they rarely hire management from outside of Panera. Their benefits are not very good, if you even get them. I have no paid time off and the wages are minimum wage. Not enough pay for the work I put in there."
good,I trained new crew members I was a closer so I made the food and prep was put away in the proper positions clean and mop floors sanitize are smallwares
good,Very friendly staff and management.  Great interaction with regular customers.  Must stay aware of changes that happen often.  Advancement to management is attainable.  Very clean.  Practice safe food handling.
good,"Love the management, clean , customers are nice too. Easy to move higher up. Fast paced inviroment . No drama, all employees make you feel like family."
good,"The people there were awesome and I enjoyed working there. I would have liked to see better pay-- maybe $10 an hour, more career growth options & promotions, better benefits. Other than that, it was a nice job for the time being. Also, the amount of shifts they offered for you to work was superb. There was always a chance to work more if you needed to and the management team was really sweet. I would say overall, it was a positive experience."
good,Working at a restaurant puts you into a mindset of thinking ahead 2 days in advance in order to lighten the work load and to ensure that things are running smoothly and efficiently.
good,"Panera offered flexible hours and decent wages if you are experienced. Being a driver, the tips made it worth it on most days. Their workplace culture is based on who works at which location."
good,"This was a wonderful place to start for a first job. It taught me great customer service skills, time management, and interpersonal skills. I enjoyed the fast-paced environment and the everyday oasis company moto."
good,"Very face-paced job but, has it's down periods, there was always something that could be done so you really feel like you're working for your money other than standing around having nothing to do. The customers are so kind as well as the employees. Always ask how you're doing and engaged in conversations."
good,Panera is an okay job... i didn’t really learn anything new because is the same thing as my other jobs... i take orders on drive thru and make food and do soups
good,"Leadership from management varies from store to store, but overall I had a pleasant work experience in my time at Panera. I learned a lot of skills that are transferable to other industries."
good,"I started as a Product Demonstrator, proactively interacting with customers, greeting them and making them feel welcome. I would offer samples to the guest and talk about the products positively while making an effort to connect with them. As a cashier, I would receive orders, as well as collect payments and vouchers. Build rapport and establish relationships with customers. Resolve any problems a guest may have, going above and beyond their expectations. And share any feedback or concerns to upper-level management."
good,Frequent change of general management every 2-3 months!! What’s up with that? I had the weekends off so it was great working Monday-Friday. Most days I worked anywhere from 6-8 hrs. When it’s really busy you’d be lucky if you get a lunch break AT ALL!!
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Working at Panera definitely gave me an apprecaition for food-handling and customer service. Learning different avenues of service as well has greatly helped me further my career later on. It was stressful most times, but the position taught me many things."
good,The Job is okay. Nothing too special. The discounts were nice. The management was understandable and helpful. The work load isn't too heavy. It just got crowed around the same time everyday.
good,"I loved my Panera family until I wanted to move up and was prevented by the franchise owner. I was given promises for 2 years about getting more help, but never got it. Management in the cafe changed and I began to be treated poorly. This is a very stressful place to work, but the atmosphere is awesome. I loved the people and was sad to go. But being overworked and never provided the assistance needed to continue to grow my department was just too much."
good,Panera was a great experience they actually helped me advance as a cashier and in customer service gave me a lot more patience for those who need assistance.
good,Company is a beautiful company to work for Product and People wise. Goes into depth on what makes the company run and what the associates can gain from keeping an Oasis for our customers.
good,"Hours suck! You work most weekends and holidays. With that out there, there is a lot of potential with this job. The cafe managers and associates are nice as can be and take care of us. Communication is something that is really lacking as we are currently on our fourth Distribution Manager in two years so we are never really sure who to get in contact with. With a new lead driver, communication has improved. Pay is pretty good, but who doesn’t always want more money, especially for the hours and physical work this job involves."
good,"Good place to work, lots of great customer service in the work place. Fair pay and good amounts of hours. Flexible with positioning and management. Neutral atmosphere."
good,My time at Panera was spent well. Coworkers were great and welcoming. Though some of the managers were incredibly rude and abused their power. 10/10 would recommend working there. Just not at the location I worked at.
good,"they were to little hours its good for younger kids with less real bills."
good,"Panera provides a very affordable discount for delicious food daily. This job is good for a college-age worker. Once you have left, or should have left college the money for work expected is not nearly as attractive. Fine for awhile, not a permanent job - although to be fair it is not intended to be."
good,"I enjoyed working at Panera. The community was open and friendly both within the employers and the customers. Depending on the manager, some were friendlier than others, but hey management can be stressful, so I definitely understand."
good,"For the location I worked at, I highly disliked the general management. Having a highly stressful work environment while working two jobs and 50-60 hours a week was horrible. Other then that the team where I was working was over crowded to the point where in average each person was only getting 7-13 hours a week. Before I put my 2 week notice in I had one girl come up to me and say ""Wow I haven't seen you in months!"". As well as having the occasional week where I was only scheduled 1 day was very disappointing. And most people ordering deliveries did not tip or only tipped 1-2 dollars because the prices where as high as they were. At least in our area."
good,"Still is stressful and busy as service jobs are, but in general not bad as a workplace. Friendly environment with opportunities to advance. Cross training as well."
good,"I got the job in January, 2018 and still currently work there (July, 2019). I know every position in the store and i have good relationship with my coworkers. Management is good."
good,It wasn't a bad job the only thing I didn't like was traveling from the Bronx to Brooklyn and some days to queens my schedule had to work sometime in 3 different stores a week that's the only thing I didn't like cause each store had different times to start so my sleeping pattern was a little bit off but other than that it was okay
good,"Like above, it was a good job to have in college and is acting as a good job placement until I can find a better job in my field. I'll miss the people more than anything when I leave this job."
good,"It's a pretty standard job, as far as minimum wage food service jobs go. Great as a first job, or just an easy hire for some quick cash. The work itself is very repetitious and basic, it's hardly ever unpleasant and can even be enjoyable at times. Expect a few rude customers on the daily, that goes for any customer service job I guess. The baddies are a minority though, don't let a few bad eggs ruin your whole day. Most customers are painless, many are friendly. Generally, if you're nice to them, they'll reciprocate. Management is surprisingly laid back. Unless you commit a felony or something, your bosses will be lenient. They also spend a lot of time working alongside you, so they'll probably be pretty tight with you and your coworkers. Speaking of coworkers, you never know what you're gonna get. Employees quit or are fired very frequently, and are hired just as frequently, so seeing new faces is a common occurrence. My coworkers ranged from really amazing to work with and incredibly useful, to really awful to work with and absolutely useless. Just like customers, they're a mixed bag but they're mostly fine. Everyone will teach you and help you out, and in no time you'll be teaching and helping new hires yourself. But don't expect to be promoted to trainer just because you're doing some training. There are opportunities for promotion but you need to jump through some hoops first. Honestly, I don't think there's much incentive to climb the ladder, the increased pay doesn't really justify the increased responsibility, in my opinion. Unless you want to go all the way and become"
good,Fun place to be around. Wish I could get more hours but perfect place to work while getting other things done. Gave them the set days that I could work but only worked 2 to 3 days per week.
good,"I think that overall, this is a good company. It gives it's customers an actual healthy option in the fast-food world. The way workers are treated depends on which store you're at. At my store, it was great if you were a student or had another job as you could just come in, take or make orders, then clock out. But working full time is different, as closers and openers are the ones who hold the store together. The culture is based around making time go by as fast as you can. With your co-workers you can joke, work harder, prep more, or really anything that eats up time while you're performing whatever task you need to do. The best part is making a customer's day, maybe with a free cookie for a minor mistake, or an engaging conversation. Many people have dogs in their car when coming through the drive through, and I love learning the dog's names. The hardest part is getting too many tasks with only a little bit of time to finish them, and picking up the slack that co-workers from earlier left behind. Also dealing with entitled or demanding customers is never fun. Overall, I think I've reached a good work-life balance with Panera Bread. I'm friends with at least 60% of the staff, and we all do hang out outside of work. We really are, a team."
good,This job is great for people in high school or just graduating from high school who need experience or enjoy working with others. It is a nice environment with people who usually easy to work with.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Initially Panera was an amazing place to work. They cared about their employees and were very competitive with their pay depending on your previous work experience. The job went downhill later due to issues with the manager leaving and not being stable for a while but outside of that I enjoyed it
good,It was a nice place to work I enjoyed it for a while until they dropped my hours to the point where I couldn’t pay rent but overall it was a good job nice employees
good,The workplace culture was very fast-paced and very demanding ; the hardest part of the job was mandatory restock even though the workplace was busy during my shifts. What I learned from working here is to manage my time wisely so that I may be multi-useful in multi-tasking.
good,Worked here for about a year now and absolutely enjoyed it. Flexible Hours and Competitive pay. Good place for a first job for teenagers too. They also provide opportunity to grow with the company.
good,"I loved my actual job and like what I did, and both the customers and my coworkers were great, but steer clear of management. They used to give me 5 am shifts every weekend both Saturday and Sunday when I specifically asked them not to due to my school schedule. It was horrible!!! I literally never got to sleep because I had school every day at 6 am and then on weekends I'd wake up at 4 am to get to my 5 am shift. They also gave me way more hours than we agreed to and after speaking to my manager repeatedly, nothing changed. Apply with caution!"
good,"A typical day at work was great for me, I worked evenings. I learned a lot about food prep there, it was my first job actually working on the line. The mangers were mostly really great people, although we went through 3 GM's in a year. The hardest part of the job was being short staffed sometimes, and having new people that weren't fully trained on the line was difficult to handle during rushes. The most enjoyable part of this job was the friends I made, some people that I am still in contact with years later. It is a good job, but if you need a little more money then it may not be the job for you."
good,It was a cool place to work learned a lot and iv grown from my experience. If I had to change anything it would be more room to advance in the company.
good,"Very good benefits for low price. Great co workers...Most of the managers have treated e very  well..But not everyone can handle such a fast paced, customer service related job...If it weren't for some of these customers, I would absolutely not want to ever leave!"
good,I really liked working at Panera however they kept adding more job responsibilities without any pay increase. They also changed management several times while I was there. It seemed disorganized at times.
good,"It was a very good job and had great management, I enjoyed this job and the environment of it. My general manager was great and made me feel like family but still respected the work relationship."
good,"Currently undergoing rapid change and growth, Panera is a strong company committed to customer service. entry level jobs are simple, but the environment is busy. the community created by the employees and customers is truly rewarding, and the sense of familiarity and friendliness alone makes it worthwhile to work there. there are plenty of opportunities for advancement for hard working and focused individuals, with decent pay and incentives."
good,"- I would typically take orders every day "
good,"I enjoyed my time with panera. The staff was great and the environment was comfortable to work. I do feel that for the amount of work we performed, we weren't paid enough. Staying late was common due to the job of cleaning."
good,Wonderful place to work. Most of the managers are amazing and Co-workers are friendly. There are definitely a few that could use some serious job coaching but that’s normal for a large business.
good,"Gets stressful but is a great environment. Many people don’t really hold to their positions, leaving them non reliable. Only a few people are reliable to show up."
good,"good job, bad workers. The employess at panera were wrongfully hired, had poor customer service, bad attitudes . also lack of teamwork and support. okay"
good,"It was my first ever job I got when I was 16 (5 years ago now) The time there was fun and stressful at times. My original coworkers were great but it gradually decreased in skill over time so it made it harder to continue to work there as it is more for a starting job. As an adult, I would not recommend. As someone looking for their first job, it's great and you can earn spending money but it's not serious employment. Pay was terrible but I'm not sure what it is now (min wage and never got a raise in 3+ years even when asked for)"
good,Generally speaking Panera Bread has been a nice company to work for. I had no issues at all. The only reason I had to leave is i had a change in household income and I needed to make more money.
good,"Great place to work,  supervisors are awesome,  but if someone gets mad at you and goes to HR on you, you don't have a chance regardless of what the managers say on your behalf"
good,I never knew how much lifting would be involved with working there! You get paid higher than normal but that's because of the level of work that comes from the position.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Definitely fun environment, you meet very nice people to work with. The workplace itself is very fast-paced, and also can be hard to be flexible with your schedule."
good,"For the most part I like my job, not very hard. I am a closer so most of my evening I spend cleaning. I take my job seriously, kids don't! Some of the managers are pretty young and need to be more consistent, tend to overlook the quality of work from some employees. It's hard to work with people who don't care or depend on their paycheck to live!"
good,"This job is easy and fun and they hire young (16). It's very fast-paced and keeps you moving. The customers are unique- not your typical fast food customer. They can be a little extra sometimes because it's, for lack of a better word, a snooty place. One of my coworkers had a customer throw a baguette at her once... Honestly, the customer base is among the worst parts of working there. "
good,"While working, I was a college student.  Everything was going well, but then scheduling became an issue when I made management aware of my class conflicts.  There were times I was put on the schedule when management was made very aware of when I could work.  This eventually lead me to quit this establishment due to the imbalance of work over my education.  Other than that, this job was decently enjoyable."
good,Not a bad place I wouldn’t mind to go back a work there good benefits easy job people are friendly good environment also the food is great with respectful people
good,Not a bad first job and is only busy during lunch. I enjoyed working here and think it was a good introduction into customer service. Strong company culture.
good,"I met a lot of potential friends and family members that I was able to get to know them and a little more about their family and lives  "
good,"it was an experience, co workers were good, management could have been better but not all too bad. it can get very busy so you must be able to work under busy conditions"
good,"When I began working here I was only there for weekends, and during the summer I picked up a full time schedule. Our location was GROSS - rarely were things dated, old food mixed with new, fruit flies in every inch of the place. Additionally, our general manager was super incompetent - we were consistently running out of both dry goods and produce, the prep tools were old and half broken, you are expected to learn your position and function in it flawlessly after one day of training, etc. Other than that, the regular customers were always a delight and helped me get through the day."
good,I worked part time here and the managers are usually helpful. Most of the shift I would just take orders which was simple. The coworkers are really nice so that's good.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the coworkers and the environment. They hire plenty of teenagers and young adults that turn into friends. The work environment is easy going.
good,While working at Panera Bread I learned what it truly meant to work in a fast-paced environment. The goal for employees at Panera Bread is to always increase customer service and make sure that the customer is satisfied. I learned how to satisfy the wants of the customers and provide great service to them in a timely fashion.
good,"A typical day consisted of taking orders, maintaining speed with helping customers as quickly as possible. Jumping in where I was needed was a big part of the day especially during peak hours, and being guidance and a problem solver for other employees. I learned how to work with a team through language barriers as well as stressful situations. The workplace culture was a community with most of us being friends and learning how to work well together. The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers during peak hours that demanded my full attention to fix a problem for them. It detracted from my ability to help my coworkers, but helped me learn to share responsibilities. The most enjoyable part of the job were the friendships I made and the sense of community between all positions including management."
good,At Panera I learned great communication skills and how to work as a team. Panera has taught me great skills for my future and I am forever grateful of them. I learned how to get work done at a fast pace and not get stressed out.
good,Every person works together as a team. Good management. Quality food. Some days are busier than others. Not much room for career advancement. Not physically challenging.
good,"Currently looking at it as an in between job. The pay is low, the lowest I've ever worked for, and the business is very slow paced. Too slow. They have been extremely flexible around my school schedule since I'm working part time during college though. Very happy with that as that was a bigger deciding factor, for me at least, than pay was, though I do wish it were more."
good,"A typical day at work was always either busy or very slow, never much an in-between. Management was dependant on who was working and who was there to help out for the day. It always varied. It was always nice to have regulars come in so that you'd know them immediately they walked in and they're easier to talk to."
good,"Management could be more supportive of their works. Give bonus for employees. Met some awesome people while working there"
good,"At Panera bread I learned how to memorize a complicated menu that shifted from morning to night, and changed even more every season change. The customers at Panera seem entitled to getting their order and want it perfect, so I had to learn to adjust to angry or frustrated customers every single day."
good,The managers worked well with us and were really understanding with a lot of good communication and positive reinforccement. I enjoyed working there and enjoyed talking with customers and managers alike
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Fun work environment. Great training.  New clean menu introducing no artificial dyes or preservatives.  Panera has a great training program and allows all employees to have the opportunity to become successful within the company.  They have systems in place in order for self development.  They also have made great investment in updated technology including Rapid Pickup and delivery for customers over the last year.  Catering is also a great option for local business.
good,"fast paced environment.daily meetings between opening,mid,and closing managers. learned to deal with diverse group of people. workplace culture was no jerks allowed."
good,"This job is great for entry level workers of all kinds. If it's your first job or first management position, it teaches you what it's like in most food service. Unfortunately I feel the chance for advancement comes at a steep ""all or nothing"" price. There's no mid-tier position that's worth the time and effort."
good,Panera is more often busy than not so you need to be ready to be constantly moving and multi-tasking. Management is usually pretty laid back and understanding. Overall a fun work environment.
good,I loved working at Panera Bread. The management was excellent and my work was often recognized. The team members were great to work with and I really enjoyed the work that I was able to do.
good,"A typical day at work consists of preparing the lines for Lunch/Dinner and keeping all orders under 3 minutes and 30 seconds during our rush. I have learned to handle stressful situations with a lacking staff and make sure orders are correct/keeping customers happy. Management has done a very poor job of keeping stress levels low during these times, in fact I feel as if they make it worse. The hardest part of the job is when we have slow workers because it causes ticket times to rise and makes customers unhappy. It is equally as difficult when we are understaffed. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I train an new employee and they seem to catch on very fast. Another thing I enjoy is creating food that looks flawless."
good,"Great company to work at, decent pay for a college student with the ability to work around my busy schedule and make some money while also having fun with the people that i worked with."
good,"working at Panera Bread was alright job, wouldn't give it a 5 star rating but it was a job that helped me get on my feet until I found something else. Couldn't stay there long due to the location but it was fine job to have."
good,"Coworkers were fun, costumers were fun, lots of work, There was almost never a dull moment while working here, managers were kind although sometimes they were a pain."
good,"I have worked for Panera Bread for approx. 3 years and have enjoyed my time there. All expenses paid Shift manager training, paid Bread bashes, paid training classes. Overall it's been a great experience for me."
good,Prepared food to be sold to customers. A lot of work was required and heavy cleaning. Crew was nice and very helpful. They all worked together to get work done and customers satisfied.
good,Panera bread is good work place with team sprite and better work culture. It gives flexible  to get experience from others and gives training on job except less salary.
good,Always working and fast-paced. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to customers and taking orders and making food. The hardest part was during rush or when short-staffed.
good,"First thing in the morning would be preparing for the morning rush so you have to be on top of things once you start slacking off you'll regret that decision. You have to be on top of things life becomes a breeze, you don't hear complaining from your associates, food gets out on time, and the customers get what they've been waiting for. Management they try to wok with you to bring you up and get you in the right path and  they try to help you out in any way possible. Communication on the food line needs to be on point if someone starts slacking they will bring the whole line down/"
good,Every day was practically the same but that doesn't mean it was bad. The management was nice and understanding with their employees. The other workers were also really nice to work with. Nothing really negative at panera or anything hard to do. Most enjoyable part was the huge discount on food which is always great. It can get extremely busy and stressful depending on location
good,"This job is easy and something you can leave at the work place at the end of the day. When busy, the stress you feel while working can be increased depending on the quality of your management team."
good,"This was a fast paced job where there would be a huge flow of customers or no one at all. There was always something that could be done which kept me productive, which I liked."
good,"Great job for people at entry levels, learning people skills, how to properly handle food and handle cash. Can move up in this company fairly quickly."
good,"My work days last 8 hours a shift, 40+ hours a week. I work by myself overnight and produce all the baked good at Panera bread. The management and staff are very nice. It is a very good company to work for with great benefits. The most important part of the job is time management and being able to multi task. The best part of the job is the satisfaction at the end of your work day when you see all the finished product you have created."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Very friendly workplace "
good,I liked working their and I liked the people who I worked with. Everyone there was very well with trying to manage work and their personal life’s. Liked it
good,Panera kept adding responsibility to the GM but the did not change the compensation.  The values of the company were where they should be.  I would have stayed if I would have been compensated for my hard work and the passion I had for the company.
good,"Typical day, get assigned a register. Meet, greet and welcome customers. Be ready to learn more than 1 position, job forces you to work on people skills."
good,"There is nothing particularly wrong with working here, it is just very fast and customers get very angry very easily. Because it is a corporate company there are very strict rules and very strict ways to do everything which I don't like that much."
good,"Working at Panera was fun, and I felt close to my fellow employees, but I was not a priority to them, no one was. I know every location varies, but as a driver specifically, the pay is not worth it, and the workload can be over-bearing."
good,"Panera Bread was a great place to work. If I didnt have to move, I wouldnt have left. Although it was fast paced, employees were very helpful and the customers were friendly most of the time."
good,"The money was great , but the workers weee not easy to get along with. I got fired after they let me work for an hour. They name call and they don’t show an ounce of respect ✊"
good,Just like any corporate company Panera Bread was your average company to work for. We worked long shifts with little to no breaks. Although I did learn a lot about customer service and multi-tasking skills.
good,"During my employment with Panera Bread, I appreciatively learned the art of baking breads and pastries from my fellow bakers. I learned to make quality baked goods on a daily basis and then proudly displayed them to the customers each day. I feel as though the environment was a positive and nurturing place for product and personal growth. The best aspect of my time being employed there was when I would pick my son up from kindergarten and 1st grade and all of his little friends would run up to me and either say Hi or give me a hug and comment on how their friends Dad smelled like blueberry muffins or cinnamon rolls ha ha ha ha!! The most rewarding aspect of the company was how the extra and leftover baked goods were donated to the Food bank of Stockton and Lodi twice a week."
good,It was a ok place to work but I had to leave because I was having bad pains in my stomach and to have an emergency appendectomy they gave me points which they should not alltemetlley leading to me losing my job
good,"I think i had an alright time working here overall. My coworkers were great for the most part and the customers were always nice. The hardest part of the job was dealing with high employee turnover rate. We were constantly rushing people through training and they would have to work regular shifts with too little experience.  Management didn't seem to worried about this ,but unfortunately it put most of the more experienced personnel in a bit of a rough spot as we had to ""babysit"" and it slowed down everyone."
good,"Its a fun place to work and you make incredible bonds with your co workers and even some of the customers that become regulars that turn into friends! I started with Panera when I was in high school and was my first job, I thoroughly enjoyed it. The company really cared about its people when I started however when the company was bought out they seemed to start caring more about the money than the people."
good,"Panera Bread was a good place to work at, it was easy to comprehend your position but being at the busiest one it did get stressful sometimes and you had to learn to work fast paced."
good,No advancement after 7 years.  Lacked consistent management and to quick to be judge mental of real loyalty and life situations.  To many attitudes with my morning prepper.  However I loved working there most of the years.  I loved my downtown location
good,"It is very stressful, quick paced, and un-adjustable schedule to follow on a daily base. Sometimes, physically, I be too tired because of the schedule itself."
good,"A typical work day consists of taking orders, preparing food, and handling customer orders and complaints.  Nightly duties include cleaning and setting up for the next day"
good,"Panera Bread provides a easy- going, fast paced and non hostile work environment. Career advancement is offered to all and cross training is encouraged for the betterment of the company and the individual employee."
good,"Almost every co-worker you have will be fantastic, however when it comes time to move up into or through management, you will find that the regional management is absentminded and slow to take any action or give any feedback."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Panera was an overall good experience. The staff is very compatible, but sometimes the managers can be a little condescending. The only reason I left was because, at the time, I did not have very flexible hours. I let the managers know about my limited availability but they didn’t honor it. So I gave them a full calendar with highlighted times I couldn’t work, but they still didn’t honor it. Finally I told them the only two days a week that I was available to work and the continued to schedule me poorly. Through all of this I was required to find people to cover my shifts on my own."
good,"The managers are very encouraging and the pay is pretty good. The hours are flexible for the most part. The job isn't too stressful overall but it has its days, like any other job."
good,Enjoyed working with regulars and the coworkers worked together well. Managers were difficult to work with because of my slim schedule with school coming into place.
good,this is a job where a person must learn fast and be comfortable with multi tasking every shift. customer service is very important verbal communication is needed along with being able to listen to guests and help them with their every need.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of taking orders, being friendly and making sure that I was doing my job to the best of my capacity. As a cashier you would have to receive payments by customers and give their change to them, make sure you had everything you needed such as cups, plates and etc. I learned patience through this job by meeting new people everyday and taking the time to take their order. The hardest part of the job would probably be staying busy, whenever there was no people coming in."
good,great place to work but the pay differs from whatever position you are in so be careful of what you choose and you can get ot cause it seems like someone calls of each day
good,"It won't be fulfilling, but it's a reasonable job if you're a student or otherwise need a flexible schedule. The work is not difficult but can be frustrating at times."
good,"Depending on whether I had morning or night shift things would be higher or lower energy.  Most of the career focused positions and like head mangers worked earlier so things moved along better.  Mostly high school students worked evenings, so those hour were more laid back, but sometimes harder to work because of that.  It seems like an easy place to move up in the company with relative ease, up to a point."
good,"Working at Panera Bread opened a new door of opportunities for me. I made new friends, I got more experience in customer service, and I was able to connect with my coworkers like one big family."
good,"Panera Bread is a good environment to work in because everyone is super nice and the cafe is very organized. The issue is, is that it has poor mathematics and it is very crazy sometimes because no one know show to do anything even though they are trained to do it."
good,Panera is a great place to be as long as you enjoy being given tasks and allowed to complete them without supervision. You must be self motivated and aggressive about learning if you want to survive.
good,I would say that working for Panera bread has been a real experience because you're able to work yourself up to different positions and i was able to meet a lot of famous people
good,Overall the store was A great place to work. They just don't understand family problems and do not Care either. They tend to have a uppity attitude and the food is not that great to act like a five star restaurant
good,"walk in count drawer for the cashier "
good,"Despite Panera's not-so-fast-food feel, they are most definitely a fast food restaurant and treatment from customers and employees simply come with the territory. Great food, great brand, savage customers, and savage managers."
good,Panera bread is a fun place to work the managers are fun and the overall atmosphere is great everyone is so nice. It does get crazy though during diner rush.
good,"The job itself is not difficult but unfortunately we hire mostly teenagers and they can be a problem to manage sometimes."
good,"Good clean food. Friendly staff. Very fast-paced working environment, but duties were concise. Managers were rather approachable. Overall a positive experience."
good,"I was an opener, a typical workday consist of coming in at 5am, setting up lines, getting back ups, prepping, making sure everything was stocked, and ready for lunch time. I learned a lot of customer service, helping customers with rapid orders, catering, apologizing mishaps, fixing orders, numbers (food costs), I worked in two locations Acworth management was very good it was structured, and set. I relocated to Austell management was very poor. The hardest part of the job was opening, having to fix everything the night shift would leave behind, the most enjoyable was the job within itself, and coworkers."
good,Panera is a fast-paced environment that is constantly changing. Panera is a pretty understanding job as you are allowed to take time out when you need it. They'll work around your school schedule.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Panera Bread was my first job and it was one of the best ways to learn about cashiering. i learned about all the different jobs that you do at panera.
good,I enjoyed my time at Panera Bread.  It fit into what I was looking for at the time.  I enjoyed working with the other employees and helping to make the customer happy.
good,The enviroment was fun and a good pace some of management was poor and didn’t like some of their ways but other them that some of the managers understands you. I’ve learned alot working at panera because I never work inna fast food before. The hardest part working there for me is remember the sandwhices at a very fast pace. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers.
good,"I personally did not have any problems from Panera,  It was a enjoyable place to work. I do not regret making  Panera my first summer job. The environment is a great place and the mangers are responsible."
good,This job is great for students and older people. They work well with schedules and encourage you to always learn more and advance in the company. They are always excepting new faces.
good,I enjoyed working with my fellow employees and being able to get a drink whenever i wanted and having the capability to work at my own pace unless if it got very busy.
good,"Panera ended up being a difficult place to work in at the end, but the start of it was honestly refreshing. The manager was understanding and I ended up making some pretty solid friends there. Sadly a lot of new manager hires and change-ups in a very busy store made everything pretty crazy."
good,"Good management fast pace good customer assistant , I have to have a fast pace on dish constant moving heavy lifting learning your salads, sandwiches."
good,"I love the people, but not the pay. It was an upbeat fun place most of the time. It could get stressful on days. If the pay was better for the people that deserved it and worked hard, it wouldn’t be a bad place to work."
good,Panera bread was a fast paced environment with a lot of tasks to handle. I learned how to manage all of these different tasks to different people. Every day is different at Panera Bread because you never know what to expect.
good,"Panero was a decent job to work at. Not bad at all for a starting job. During my time at Panera, there were many employees so I was unable to get many hours which was hard for me considering I need a full time job in order to support myself financially."
good,"always busy no matter how few or how many customers come in, never a dull moment, managers are all great to get along with, only problem is having to beat the heat, but still great place to work at"
good,The team-based environment of Panera bread allows for collaboration between workers to ensure a quality dining experience for all customers. Working here gave me tools of communication and team-building which I've applied in all future job positions I've held since.
good,"I have worked with the company for a few years now, and the company itself is not a bad company to work for. I will say that the staff and management turnover seems to be very high, especially in this location, which can make it a little bit of a challenge. Overall it is not too bad, though."
good,"Usually, at Panera, my day starts off with the basic duties, when coming in, followed by a break, and then good friendly conversation with my coworkers. Finally, comes the end of my day from a productive day at Panera Bread. I learned many thing at Panera, some of which I plan to take with me to any future jobs I may have. The management is very well trained, organized, and very easy to talk to. The culture of the workplace is casual, but not too casual. Casual in the way where you and your coworkers are on a friendly basis. Truthfully, I am not sure what the hardest part of my job is. However, the most enjoyable part of my job is getting to make the customer's day a bit better and talking with my coworkers."
good,Excellent place to work fresh out of school. Very fun staff. Good food if you don't like fast food and need something fast. Menu changes seasonally to keep variety.
good,This is my first job. It's a pretty good job. It's pays well even if you just started and it's an overall happy workplace. Could improve on working together with other co-workers but that doesn't take away from the great service.
good,It was fast paced and could be rewarding at times. Met some good friends who were employees there and learned a lot. If i learned anything from there it was definitely how to clean and lots of it!
good,"my typical day would start off with my clocking in and just getting my headset and i start making the sandwiches it salads and before we closed i would wipes down my station take some stuff to the dish washer put the soups up for the next day drain the dish washer and then leave.  At Panera I learned patience and proper people skills and how to multi-task. management was very nice they would come up and help when things got tough or when it got to fast pasted fro all of us. The workplace culture was very diverse. The hardest part of the job was a""rush"" it is when a bunch of orders come in at once. The most enjoyable part of the job was closing."
good,"The most enjoyable part of this job was interacting with customers and providing exceptional customer service. Although it was a very fast paced environment, I felt comfortable handling everyones orders and fulfilling my job requirements."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Worked at a turnpike location, it’s very fast paced due to many people driving the interstate. Overall everyone who worked there is very friendly and willing to help one another out."
good,"Overnight baking for Panera bread is a good job, DEPENDING on the market and your management team. It's not a difficult job once you learn it. Not for everyone due to the overnight hours and honestly...not everyone can bake."
good,Panera has a great mission statement but it gets lost too easily in the day to day operation of the store and not enough emphasis is placed on making sure managers hired from outside the company are bought into the culture of the company.
good,Would  like to have seen more benefits for the members working and putting their wellbeing and how they operate before the demand of the company. But not a bad place to start for a first job. Many opportunities to grow.
good,"It was a good job for learning customer service. It included cashier, barista, and cleaning. It was a very structured atmosphere. The scheduling was not organized very well however."
good,"Delivery for Panera is streamlined through use of smartphone app, does not require cash handling; pleasant atmosphere in-store; high customer service expectations; emphasis on fresh, clean food and friendly service."
good,"Everyday was fast paced and if you were falling behind it was hard to get others to help in your specific role. Everyone has a specific role and if one person is not doing their job well, the team crumbles."
good,Very fast paste environment for the Catering department. The general manager was excellent but the Catering manager was not always available and was unfair in how she shared the delivery routes and how many drivers she had a shift.
good,Got sick of working there after 2 years but it was a great place to work. They pay was ok but not great. I made 9.50 an hour making sandwiches so it was pretty easy
good,"Would have stayed longer if I did not have to relocate - great work force, excellent training process, and plenty of benefits to keep an employee happy and dedicated."
good,"-Relaxing days"
good,"I love eating panera, going there to study, etc. "
good,Panera was a friendly environment to work in. It is very fast paced at times and the employee must be able to multitask and handle pressure and stress from  the work itself.
good,Panera Bread has great food and many choices to choose from. At panera bread the employees do anything to make sure their customers are satisfied. They provide great customer service and always keep a clean environment.
good,"Panera Bread was a good expierience, would have stayed longer if I didn’t have my senior year of High School. Management was good and other Employees were good to work with."
good,"Overall Panera is a good company to work for. They offer good benefits, support the community and there is room for advancement. If you like to work hard and be in a fast paced environment then this is the company for you"
good,"Panera bread is a fun and exciting place to work because it gives you different stations to learn new things such as being a cashier, production, or table server. overall my experience was good."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Panera has a great value based culture. It's a place you can be proud to say to work. However, once you are promoted to GM, the work/life balance doesn't exist. It's a lot of work with very little support from your superiors."
good,"The job was vaguely stressful, but good all in all. I like the training process and the hands on experience you get to have while working here. Learning how to work with others was also an interesting thing to learn, but useful for future jobs."
good,"Its an ok place to work, the hours are very strange and they seem to favor employees who have been there longer versus newer additions. However there are some friendly people there."
good,Panera was a fast paced restaurant. It was fun and the staff made you want to come to work. We always got days off that you would request for. I would go back to Panera if it had better pay.
good,"a typical day would be coming in, checking where you are located, greeting guest, cleaning up your work area, working until its time to leave. cleaning usually takes an hour to do."
good,"Have to have alot of energy fast paced, never a dull moment,a typical day at work is not knowing if its going to be a steady day or are you going to get a a whole classroom of hungry kids"
good,Each associate is trained to work in multiple areas to allow seamless transition of duty assignments.  Each area works with associates from another area to provide the best customer experience possible.  Most managers would take associates preferences into consideration when assigning daily tasks.  The overall feel of the cafe was pleasant and heartwarming.
good,"Working at Panera can be very stressful and demanding. Personally, I enjoyed all the people I worked with and they are the reason I was there for so long."
good,"Very easy job, takes about 2 weeks to get used to. The customers feel extremely entitled because its Panera so be ready to be treated rudely. The panera family is everything. Was friends with at least 95% of the staff. Gets hectic but its not something I would stress over. Don't forget your hat!!!!"
good,"Panera offered many opportunities to advance my skill set and learn new things. The hardest part of the job was dealing with some of the managers being, rude, belittling, and undermining your skills. Never really gave you the opportunity to prove yourself."
good,"Its a good job to have as a first job or part time job if you're willing to get up and be at work at 4am."
good,I just had my shoulder treated and the management is making sure I do not do anything that would hurt it again. Really understanding. Team work is provided
good,As a third shift baker it really left no time for any life outside of work.  The healthcare package was very nice.  the 401k was matching.  I enjoyed my time but after three years I burnt out and needed a new job.
good,It was a very fast paced kitchen with a very good crew.  I still maintain friendships with co-workers.  The managers were always understanding of school scheduling conflicts.
good,I started as a regular hourly associate and moved up within the company. They care about their employees but I’m not getting out what I’m putting into it everyday. It’s always warm and inviting to work there and there are always systems in place for a reason and it’s up to everyone to make it work.
good,"Panera is very fast paced but it is a great place to work.  You take orders and make food.  Very friendly, fun, coworkers that still know how to get the job done."
good,"I like working for Panera and with the people there. The people are very hard working and love to serve people and care about the customers. Panera has a very relaxing and easy atmosphere and is a perfect place to relax and get school or work done, or simply hang out with your friends there."
good,pues me gusto por que aprendi de todo on poquito a conocer como se llamaba los panes a hacer cafe en una maquina expres a atender hacer desayunos mis compañeros me ayudaron mucho
good,"Taught me a lot of skills needed for working future restuarant/food jobs like register, food line, and customer service. You also get to eat a lot of free food."
good,Great first job for a high school student.  Very flexible hours for a college student.  You should be able to stand for long periods of time and be able to multitask and work quickly.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"At a normal day at work as a line worker, i would work through lunch, which normally lasts 2-3 hours and you basically would not leave the line at all until lunch was over. You have to be able to read and react fast to orders that come up on the screen. As a catering worker, you go in and check the orders for that day, make sure the things that could have been done the day before were finished, and complete them if they were not. Then make the sandwiches/salads that needed to be made, and then go deliver them. Afterwards, i would head back and do what i needed to do for the next day's orders. It was a good routine, but also different variables would pop up during the day that you must be able to adapt well to handle. I felt that my ability to deal well with customer complaints was part of the reason why we had so many repeat customers"
good,"when I worked there I had a horrible manager that made me hate my job, other then that I loved my job. it was simple & easy and I had good coworkers. its a good starting out job."
good,I have never worked as a cashier before is it working at Panera as a cashier was an experience that I would not trade for anything else in the world.  This would be a good part time job for anyone starting out or anyone that is retired
good,Good health benefits. Fast paced very stressful. Pay does not equal amount of work. Lack of leadership with the upper management. No communication with the AD or DOM. Need a change of field.
good,Days went by so fast here. There was always something to do to keep busy. The management and supervisory staff were so helpful with all of our training.
good,This place helped me to learn about the basics of customer service and to be fast paced and accurate. I worked the front desk and making sure I understood the computer system and entering in orders correctly was imperative to the customers overall experience.
good,"I personally asked for long days to maximize hours. i made food which gets stressful when you get a good rush."
good,Panera Bread is where the magic happens! They offer a delicious Strawberry Poppyseed salad during the Summer and the 65% discount employess got was a really nice perk because to me their food is somewhat expensive.
good,"I loved the employees and I loved the fact that as the Office Manager, I was very much the hub of the business. The senior management that were located in St.Louis, were difficult at best. They were for the most part uninvolved until the CEO started to ask questions about something and then they came in and looked for something or manufactured something to fire someone over. They ultimately became more trouble than the joy of the peer relationships, so I began to look for a new challenge."
good,"Great team culture."
good,"A typical day involved me tendering cash and taking customer orders. Management was intense, being our location was one of the busiest Panera in the area.The culture was intense being that we solely focused on customer needs. The hardest part of the job was just about everything, I don't recall a slow day. The most enjoyable part of the job was going home. I learned that there was passion inside of me I've never thought I had, it being my first job."
good,"Overall, I enjoyed working at Panera. The reason I plan on leaving is because I have been trying to become a shift manager for a little over 2 years, and I still am not one. There is nothing else I can do to pursue, all of the managers say that I am ready but my general manager ""has a lot on his plate"" so I feel forgotten about. I believe that I deserve a pay raise and more responsibility but I am not given them. I want to work somewhere that I'm respected."
good,At Panera Bread I was considered an Assosciate. For the most part I was serving food to customers and busing tables. Some shifts I was be on dishes or cashiering. I would not work in a restaurant again unless I was strictly serving or hosting.
good,"At Panera I learned how to think quickly on my feet and help customers with any of their wants and needs. I was able to learn about many of the positions Panera had to offer such as production, barista, drive thru, table running, dish washer, etc."
good,"Great place to work. Sales associates have a lot of tasks during the day. There should be more workers, so that task are divided among more people. The atmosphere is great."
good,"Working at a Panera keeps you on your toes because there is always something to be done. The fast pace work environment can be hectic, but it is also rewarding to know that you are able to keep up with it and do your job well."
good,Panera Bread is always evolving and changing. They constantly change there menu and focus on the customers changing needs. It is very fast paced and customer driven.
good,"Very fast passed and keeps you in your toes. Clean eating that you can be proud of, great job if you are looking for experience in almost any field. Multiple positions so you never get bored."
good,"panera bread, was way to stressful. it was a very fast pacing job, you always had to be on your feet, and the team wasn't always fun to be around. i highly recommend not working here."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"As with any job, there were issues when it came to having multiple managers with different preferences. However, when it comes to working with fast food or any type of cashier job, Panera is easily one of the best jobs you can get. Pay is low, but there are semi-annual evaluations and possibilities for raises."
good,"Panera was a great place to work for my first 6 years the last 3 years I had to personal life.Had to be on call 24/7!. The team that we developed at Panera was my best accomplishment since I believe that they are the most important component of the Company.I loved working with them. We had a open door policy and a culture of fun and respect for each other.I just was not able to handle the constant 24/7 work schedule which was expected from the regional manager.I had to problems with the plant manager ,we got along great. I would gladly return to Panera if the current regional manager was no longer there."
good,"At first it was great to work there, but they over-staff themselves and then are forced to cut hours. Many employees were allowed to be lazy while others had more responsibilities thrown on them."
good,I worked at the Kirkwood location for my first job. Everyone was super nice and it was easy to learn everything about the job. I would definitely recommend this job to anyone for their first job.
good,"Panera Bread is a fast paced work environment where you can still complete tasks on your own time, minimal training is provided however but leaves room for you to personalize your work."
good,"Oversee operations of the cafe (open, close, mid shifts)."
good,"Pretty easy job, Nothing too stressful about it. I was a delivery driver and all i did was wash dishes in the back. Would get a order about every 15 minutes that was very simple to deliver. Nothing hard about it at all"
good,"Panera employees needs more training at the shop."
good,It was great except for understanding if you have a compromised immune system. Add to that I think I was hired for seasonal only but was told it was perm. p.t. Then I was fired for missing technically four day's.
good,"For a first job, they treat you well, pay you alright, it is easy to move up in the company, and you will get good benefits. A typical day consists of a lot of running around trying to please every guest, because there is never a slow day, and rainy days are just insane."
good,No response. Confidential. I do not like to review a job that I am working at. I do not think it is smart to say anything about the job. It is hard to explain a job that you may or may not like and someone see it.
good,"If you are wanting the chance to run your own business, this is a great company for growth.  Panera is a well known name and has a cult following which provides possibilities.  Management can be a bit stressful due to a demanding schedule on an average of ten hour days.  Work/life balance is difficult at times, must have a strong sense of self and know when to say ""no"" in order to draw the line.  Support is there, via websites and online training, but it is very self-motivated.  I feel the best parts of being with a company so long are the relationships I have made with customers and the friends I have gained with fellow managers and associates."
good,"The work environment is fun and fast paced. Although it can get stressful during busy seasons, there is an overall great energy in the store. We always had a good time at work"
good,hum... its a great company with simple food guidelines kind of pricy but my experience has been ok for the most part its really ideal for someone looking for something part-time!
good,"It was fun, but I felt that some things in the workplace rubbed off on my wrong. If you spoke up there was always someone to back someone up even if it was a lie."
good,"I was a supervisor at Panera Bread I was in charge of basically everything. Coming in early in the morning to open the store, making sure everyone was on time and making sure everyone was following the proper polices. I would say the most hardest part of this job was finding replacements for people that would not come in to their shift. The most enjoyable part of this job was having full blown conversations with my customers."
good,Panera bread is a career worth working in if you want to be apart of understanding coworkers and and serve customers who are strongly connected to Panera’s workers and atmosphere alike
good,"They do everything they can to set you up for success, unfortunately, the front line management hiring was continually less than stellar. There is no time to breathe and the work became very tedious."
good,"Co-workers were great, hours were always varied, never sure what position you will be in, some days there were no breaks, always stayed later than when my shift"
good,Evaluation is based on the only store I was able to work in NC. I do not believe Panera Bread is a bad Company. I just happened to have the worse GM and DM at the time.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Relaxed place to work with flexible hours but a very low wage for hourly associates.  The culture was very relaxed but you had to work at a quick pace to keep up.
good,Good JOB to work for company was excellent to work for places of business is great typical day busy busy busy just a busy places employees get alone just a all round good place
good,This is a great place for a first job. They are flexible with hours and allow you to work weekends only. The majority of customers are regulars and make coming to work more enjoyable
good,"The managers were positive and caring, and the other employees were friendly and fun to work with.  Sometimes the work was stressful.  A typical day includes interacting with customers, filling bagel orders, making drinks, and cleaning."
good,"If you want to learn, Panera is the place to work. Constant information about the company and always room to learn different job positions. Everyone is always so kind and they act genuinely interested in you as a person."
good,"Very conveyor belt style of management. They don't really seem to appreciate independence of thought. They train to have their managers all execute the exact same way - as robots. All the thinking is done for you..."
good,This was my first ever job when I turned 16. It allowed me to learn the ins and outs of the customer service industry and definitely shaped who I am today. This job taught me patience and time management skills which I am truly grateful for.
good,I liked working there but it’s not really something I want to work at. I rather work in a store. The people are nice there and it’s always busy. But overall it’s nice.
good,"Panera was a very good company to work for, they are very healthy and safety oriented They provide a fun place to work with balanced work load. I enjoy making people happy and that's what Panera does."
good,"The only reason I left was because of a change in management, my favorite manager left and I didn't like the way the other ones treated me. the pay is low if you have no experience in food but that's fine when you get a 70% discount on food."
good,The one I worked at was great. I had a wonderful manager at first but we had quite a few assistant mangers that they kept switching in and out. But other than that it was fun and a great place to work. And they donate all their extras left over at night to the food pantry.
good,A typical day ay work would be be very busy but winding down to the end of the day would be slowing down. It is a good job to have and a good environment.
good,"Typical days of work consisted of coming in and setting up the line to start making food, once orders were completed they would be delivered. After everything was delivered we would close out orders and write an end of day report."
good,"In a typical day at Panera bread is to help customers to get their orders ready as soon as possible. I learned some few good things in this job that I eventually used in my future jobs. For instance, this was my first job to teach me how to professionally interact with people. The workplace culture at CVS is a quick paced and diverse culture. The hardest part of the job was just at the beginning at least for those who have never have had a job, it is a learning experience, a challenge that will train you for future jobs. The most enjoyable part of working a Panera is that you get to work with wonderful people, co-workers, managers, a customers alike."
good,Panera is great for young people looking for a part time job. Panera does not seem to open a lot of full time position unless you would like working over night as a baker. This was a part time job for me as they did not have any open full time position and they also do help you push or move to far in the company. They hire you for a certain position and that is where you basically stay.
good,I learned a lot working here.  I like the location and my co workers  were very helpful training me.  This experience helped me gain the knowledge I needed to get a job in my field.
good,"It was a great first job to start at, was fun at times. The work is not to hard, but training is a little more difficult. Everyone worked well together, got along for the most part. Part of the job is treating a guest as you would want to be treated. Its all about the customers experience. I do not make enough money to stay here so I'm looking to find something with more money."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"The employees are amazing at the Vacaville Panera. Although if you plan to work here, be ready for rushes lasting atlas 3 hours long. Some managers are nicer than others, but the employees are great and very energetic. A lot of people get hired as well here, but what the downside is is that your hours are not consistent and your schedule could be changed a lot. If you live in Fairfield in general and plan working afternoon-night shifts in Vacaville, expect hour long traffic."
good,"low wages but fun environment , fast paced a lot to do but not enough to keep you there long term no good pay was ever offered to anyone not even through out management"
good,"This particular location is slow paced so I am usually helping the employees with other duties if I'm done marketing, making orders and completing paperwork. I've learned time management, communication skills, productivity ans teamwork. Management works with me when I need it and they are good at managing the cafe. I dont find much of my job challenging but times can get stressful when it comes to handling last minute orders. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people and managing everything that has to do with Catering at my location."
good,"Fast paced environment where you'll always be on your toes. It's nice to run time by quick, food is great, managers are terrific where i was employed."
good,"I was cross-trained in three positions; Dining Room Attendant, Dishwasher, and Cashier. Cashier also includes being a Barista. I enjoyed the work well enough. In the beginning I was only trained as a DRA and would clean the dining room and stock hot and cold bars and clean the bathroom. It was easy but sometimes tedious. I was also only a closer. Every closing manager was different and required us to do different things and overall very inconsistent. As a Dishwasher I washed dishes and cleaned the back of house. I also stocked lines soups and prepped for them if asked. I also would help out the DRA with anything they needed. When I was finally trained on Cash I was to take orders, recommend menu items, make drinks, and prepare pastries for customers. I also cleaned the bread and bagel wall and swept and mopped the floors for the cash area. I also had to count my till at the beginning and end of every shift. I made sure I started with 200 hundred and ended with 200 and deposited anything all the earnings. If I worked anything other then cash I was still expected to do that and take customers during rush which would set me back a lot of the time. The GM and AM would also gossip about coworkers often in the front of house infront said coworkers and customers. I found it disrespectful and unprofessional. The GM also didn't seem to like me very much and would schedule me out of availability. The manger who wrote the schedule would accommodate my ride circumstances with the other manager and schedule me to close with her, however the GM would change the schedule as to make it less"
good,great starter job flexible with hours. hard during slow times not for someone who need set schedule. friendly and easy to learn. needs to learn on your own.
good,Learned about baking and also timing and work ethics. I learned valued techniques such as time management and working with customers to ensure accuracy
good,"There are many cafes established so it makes it easy to transfer to other areas. People are friendly and management helpful. Not a hard job to do, but need to be hard working and able to self delegate."
good,"I took the job to fill in like an interim job. I enjoyed working there. The only issue I had was the room for advancement and pay was limited, being it was a franchise company."
good,The company is good for people managing two or more jobs or going to school simultaneously. I would not recommend being a full time employee if you value your sanity or if you have better options.
good,"A typical day consisted of being able to ease into my position in the morning, followed by the lunch rush from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. I learned many great skills and gained valuable experience, such as patience, time management, personal discipline and team member cooperation. Management was excellent as well; even as the pace picked up during the lunch rush, I found my manager still able to maintain a positive, upbeat attitude even under strenuous circumstances. The workplace culture was excellent, working alongside peer co-workers and fellow college age students. The hardest part of the job was the lunch rush within the busiest restaurant during the day in town. The most enjoyable part of the job were my easy going managers and fellow co-workers, whom I noticed all got along and worked well together."
good,"I loved learning about bagels and bread. The worst part of the job was that I couldn't work enough. The bagel slicer was a scary machine, I was concerned I'd lose a finger but I never did!"
good,"Provides a subject matter to present to customers which affect their daily intake of food products."
good,"we were like a big family where we are able to come to work on our worse days and leave happy from work, we opened a new store so being that everyone was new we all got along and everyone bond was connecting"
good,"Trained and coached new employees on the tasks they would need tp preform on a day-to-day basis. I would train each individual on dishes, dining, cash register, food line, opening and closing."
good,I've learned how to be an effective leader and take on many responsibilities. The days working at panera included stocking up your ingredients before you actually started prepping food in order to be prepared for any rushes that could happen at any given time.
good,"I enjoyed working at the St. Cloud location Panera. "
good,Very depebable. ..fun friendly staff clean food always there if you need to talk. Loves hiring new people but very young people can't keep staff......
good,Typical day would start out punching in and start taking orders and would end cleaning the restrooms and the diner area. the hardest part would be when the it would be full and you couldn't find the customers table.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Working with good people. New and old faces all the time. Typical busy day is breakfast and lunch. good management. The most enjoyable part is coworkers and old customers.
good,"For me it was a great work environment, mostly awesome co-workers and management staff.  Would recommend to anyone likes fast-artisan food and its eclectic environment."
good,"Although Panera is a fantastic place to work, with great managers, the lack of hours that they provide is disappointing. I was promised full time, or close to 40 hours, but haven't been anywhere close to that. "
good,"I'm not going to blast names or pick favorites. Overall its EH. Some managers knew what they were doing and they were amazing at what they did and therefore deserve the credit of doing their job awesome, others, not so much. They didn't really understand their employees, nor did they not miss a chance to abuse their title and power. Those managers should be demoted back to either zone leader, expo, or even a sandwich artist. Scheduling manager wasn't the best, he tried to act like a friend sometimes and pull some (not so appropriate words) on some employees with their hours. "
good,"Panera was a great first job, I worked for this company for a long time and learned the ins and outs of customer service with them. I enjoyed working at Panera and learned a lot of valuable skills."
good,"Panera is a fun place to work, although management is very serious and supper fallow the rules. Sometimes you have to stay late to finish things that are not rediciously perfect."
good,Panera was an interesting place to find myself working but they gave me excellent hours. I had to leave because my schedule became too busy for all of the hours at the time because I enrolled in an accelerated year of college. The management was not the best but who can blame them because working around food it stressful.
good,Friendly management after you've earned your place there. Closing shift has good benefits. Simple job with pay that's always $1 over minimum wage. You get to test and learn about all new products switched out every 3 months.
good,"The overall branch manager was great but, other managers were not so great.  This was a part time job for me and they would not work with you at all, even if it was necessary to be absent."
good,"Panera was a very enjoyable work environment. However my hours were never consistent and the hourly rate was not enough to live off of. Definitely a high school job, not a potential career."
good,"Typically, I worked from 4:40 am until around 2pm. The job itself isn't very difficult, but the hours are long. I liked the people I worked with, everyone was nice to be around. Management was strict, but respected. The most enjoyable part was being able to make friends with co-workers."
good,"The usual work days don't drag on too long. The managers make the job very simple so each employee can work efficiently. Training isn't too hard and the atmosphere inside the restaurant is always friendly and nice. I learned a lot about working as team and not reying solely on my skills, but using what I excel at to bring the group forward. For example: carrying multiple plates at once or being flexible enough to switch in between every restaurant position. I'd say the hardest part of the job is keeping with the demands of so many customers, but the most enjoyable part was being able to provide them with the best customer service I could."
good,"My time at Panera Bread was fun and at first great, but after a few months you realize you can not rely the majority of your co workers to help you to the job correctly. Most of them just expect someone else to do magically happen."
good,"Panera Bread is a warm, welcoming place to work and I have enjoyed my time working in the Ames location. My coworkers and I are dedicated to the Panera values and ensure all customers felt welcomed."
good,"I had the fortune of working with a wonderful group of people, which made each shift enjoyable. The work is sometimes hard and thankless as many food service jobs can be, but it is rewarding to see that through good service you can have a positive impact on someones day."
good,"The managers are very unprofessional, the employees here get away with almost anything because the managers just don't care. They had me working 6 days a week with no care about my life outside of work."
good,"acquired a number of skills that I didn't know I had, like servicing customers on a personal level attending to there satisfaction and multi tasking. Servicing several customers and maintaining my professionalism. Maintaining company policies and adhering to its rules and regulations."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Management was a bit pushy but overall it was a good experience especially customer service. Work days are long however.
good,"Very busy location time fly's by, I'm responsible for"
good,Panera is similar to alot of restaurants I've worked at.  Fast paced and there's always something to do.  I enjoyed my time working at Panera Bread in Madison Wisconsin.
good,"Constant hour cuts"
good,Great place to work. Constantly moving and you get exposure to a lot of different departments.It was a joy to work here if you get a chance. CEO is very involved in the company.
good,I pretty much just took orders and closed the bakery at night whenever I closed. I learned how to close a restaurant. The management was decent. The hardest part was learning how to close at night.
good,"Everyone I worked with was really fun, and I made a lot of great friends that I still have there. I had a lot of trouble working with the managers at first because I had no previous food prepping experience and I was expected to be super quick with a super sharp knife. Do not regret, would not repeat."
good,Panera Bread is a relaxed and enjoyable establishment to work at. I learned teamwork and organization while working here. A typical day at work started at sun rise and excellent and friendly customer service was a huge part of the job.
good,It gets kind of stressful during the rush times but the co-workers make everything better. It is fast paced so you have to be on your toes.
good,"Very productive and fun, a lot of great customers and employees. It was a great experience overall. Great place to work at."
good,"Looking back leaving the company was a bad decision on my part.  The travel became too much for me to manage effectively.  All in all I was happy working there, and compared to working for Heartland Restaurant Group I was much better off."
good,"It's great working for this company, they give raises every 6 month and there are lots of advancement opportunities. it is usually fast pased and for people who enjoy working with others this is great."
good,"I've worked with the company for almost 2 years. I have never called in, I have never been written up, and I have never been in any sort of trouble with any of my managers. With all this being said, my hourly wage is very low."
good,A typical work day at Panera included doing a lot of prep work for the different stations. I prep the panini's and salad stations. Making sure the food is fresh and everything was being rotated properly. I worked the food line. At times we were short staffed so I had to maintain both salad and sandwich bars. I knew the whole menu and was able to prepare and present the customers food per order.
good,"Panera is a phenomenal company, very innovative and health conscious. Not so great on finding the right people to execute the vision of the corporation."
good,"Busy company."
good,"Not the greatest place. The managers are somewhat conceited. Some co-workers are solid, others are not. They rope you in with promises and don't exactly follow through."
good,Most days were busy but manageable with a good team. Good and fair managment team. long work days but made easier with hard working co-workers.
good,Sometimes challenging but overall a pleasant work experience. The worst part was dealing with costumers because the food business is very touchy but the work environment was wonderful.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Its a good job to work at if you want to make a few extra dollars"
good,"Pros: "
good,"I loved working here when i didn't have to do the work of 3-4 people, which rarely happened. The staff and management that did come to work was great however! And the discount for their delicious food is always a plus."
good,"A typical day at work included me walking in 5 minutes early, throwing on my apron and going to find out where I'm placed by looking at the deployment chart. i began to work in that section until my lunch break came around. I have learned how to work at a fast pace and speak up for my needs as an employee. I have also learned how to satisfy the needs of others efficiently. Managers tried their best to work with my school schedule. The hardest part of my job, would have to be running out of product and disappointing customers. I enjoyed working with the people around me and making food."
good,A good job if you haven't worked in a long time. I was able to further build my customer rapport. The job taught me a lot about responsibility and learning how to work under pressure.
good,Fun place to work at. Flexible with your working schedule. Easy job to work your way up. You can learn really quick depending on who trains you. You have to have a fast pace in order to get your job done.
good,Same as any other job but a little different. We at Panera Bread serve our guest and make them feel at ease. We also give away free items for our guests.
good,"Busy, lots of work and cleaning"
good,"Cash handling,cleaning, food prep & drive thru. I learned how to prep & make certain foods. My co workers at Panera Bread were good hard working people."
good,"-Food Prep person, sliced and cut fruits/vegetables for the front end"
good,Good managers and co workers but a high stress environment. This was a very good first job for me and I truly enjoyed my time there. The pay is fair based on the job.
good,"I loved working for Panera and at my store. We all worked very hard, and got thru each busy rush together. Our managers all worked together to provide an excellent environment for the whole team to succeed. I would recommend Panera to my friends."
good,A typical day would be making food and restock daily. I learned how to maintain a calm attitude when multi-tasking. My co-workers were very nice and easy to communicate. The hardest part about the job was keeping up with the crowd. The most enjoyable part about the job was creating a pleasant visit for the customers.
good,Worked here for about a year and a half. Was a great experience. Would work here again if I didn't have to quit in order to make more money.
good,Good workplace where we aim to please the customer to the highest need everyday. Boos and coworkers are great and some of my greatest friends.
good,I worked on the  line. due to low line workers I couldn't learn cash. I regret not learning cash don't regret working for company .great location to work
good,Panera Bread was a great work environment to be in. I met lots of new people that I would call now my family. Working their gave me an opportunity to expand my work experience. The staff are really fun to be around and its always a fun busy day when ever you get to work but it all is satisfying when you see that wonderful smile on that customers face.
good,"This was my first job and I learned valuable skills there. I learned about how to deal with customers and coworker that are difficult, about the value of hard working people, and how a company hierarchy works. I also discovered how your coworkers can become a 2nd family. Unfortunately you have to have immense drive and unending tolerance and patience to make a full career of Panera. In under a year I went from an associate to and associate trainer, but after that I stalled. I wanted to advance but every time I talked to the managers the kind of put me down, told me I didn't have the right temperament for the next step, that I wasn't good enough at stress management, and in general gave me the run around."
good,"A typical day at work could be a simple one, or a stressful one. Either way, when working as a team we could get through many of the stressful situations. I learned proper customer service while working at Panera. Management tried their best to keep things moving steadily. Co-workers were hard working people that made the day easier on everyone. The hardest part of the job was filling in for the shortness of staff. The most enjoyable part was the fact that we all had opportunities for a raise and advancement in the company."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Panera Bread I was able branch out a little  in my field, I was there for two years and left for career advancement. I recommend Panera to any individual who is hard working and willing to learn."
good,"You have a routine at work,makes things easier when you have a game plan. Associates's ran everything, Management tend to stand there and maybe help out for half hour for their entire shift. Co-workers really work well and hard together due to being left on our own. The hardest days at work were being short staffed by a lot and we're slammed busy. I like a challenge, makes work more interesting."
good,"Very relaxed environment, employees are fun and the customers are for the most part enjoyable. Pay isn't too great and breaks are non-payed but overall would recommend working here."
good,"You are never bored at Panera. Busy, sometimes hectic work environment. Heavy in customer service and multi-tasking. Flexible hours and availability."
good,Overall great place to work.  All products are baked fresh daily and leftovers are donated nightly.  Great group of employees.  Professional work environment.
good,As long as you pay attention And smile at the customers you will do fine always be polite and the customer is always right.the mangers can sometimes force things on you like call ins and if your cool with making money then all means but its okay to say no if your busy I wish someone would have taught me that.
good,"For the most part I like the job and the people I work with. The customers are usually great as well. You occasionally get the ones that can give you a little bit of a problem, but its a nice place to work."
good,My co-workers are great. They are what make coming to work enjoyable and keep a smile on my face. They all have so much energy and kindness that just makes you really feel welcome and enjoy your time at work everyday.
good,Relaxed environment that focuses on the personal lives of associates and customers. Managers are fun and focused on creating customer loyalty.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is helping customer out when in need or spending time with my co-workers because I'm really easy to get along with.
good,Was fast and a lot to do and remember management is great depending on the person. Co workers are fun and it feels like a family there. Hardest part it making sure everyone is stocked and ready for anything.
good,Panera is a good place for a high school students first job. It will definitely teach you responsibility and hard work. Working on the line is a fast paced environment.
good,"Over night stocking by procedure and guidelines per store management. Fast pace multi-tasking duties. Recording daily task. "
good,Great college position and starter position with a lot of potential.  Very welcoming staff and administration.
good,Panera Bread has taught me how to be a winning manager and be a leader in customer service. This company has given me the opportunity to gain new skills as well as improve the ones I currently have.
good,"There's not a single day that is slow except for Sundays, and even then there are sudden bursts of customers that send us in to a frenzy that is more enjoyable than most would expect. Fellow Associates help each other and really stand next to and for each other during any difficult. By far, this has to be my most favorite job that I've had in a while."
good,Panera Bread was a fun company to work at in high school but I wouldn't recommend it for people who are trying to pay bills.
good,"It was difficult at first, but a job is a job.  There's no use complaining.  The managers are awesome and very friendly.Very good placement of the restraunt and very busy"
good,"Panera is always busy with the line out the door, I enjoy working there and handle the customers very well. I have learned to adjust to the pace."
good,"Baked all breads, pastries, and sweets fresh every night while keeping a clean work area in a fast paced environment.  Participated in daily ordering.  Needed to multi-task and have the ability to work without supervision.  Checked bakery products each morning, measuring size and color, ensuring they were within Panera's standards."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"A typical day at work tended to start around 4 in the afternoon and go until around 10 or 9. Consisted of making sandwiches and salads etc, serving guests, and closing. I learned a lot about team building and working together, along with making food and customer service. My co workers were kind and helpful. The hardest part of the job was getting up early around 6 am to open on the weekends. The most enjoyable part of the job was working in a space with morals I support, and good healthy food."
good,"I would show up to any particular cafe that needed my assistance and would assist the employees or would complete the bake myself. I would bake the bagels, sweets (cookies, muffins, pastries, etc.), sourdough, and focaccia and ciabatta. I would also have to maintain a clean environment and ensure that I set the next person, who was baking there, that they were restocked with all new product and nothing was missing. At the end of each shift I would clean my work area, wash any dishes that I dirtied that day, and sweep and mop."
good,Loved working for them. Had great employers and employees. Some employers had a bit of attitudes but all in all great place to work
good,"While working at Panera Bread as an Assistant Manager, I have been in charge of both food cost (inventory, ordering of products and produce) as well as training for newly hired associates and cross training for current employees."
good,"managers are great as well as coworkers!"
good,"Worked here through high school and college. Great Job, worked around my hours, loved it. Worked my way up from associate to shift supervisor."
good,I worked all the different positions and it was a great start up job for me.  First job I ever held and sometimes would get free food!
good,"Panera bread is a well oiled machine! it is extremely busy most of the time, yet the employees maintain they're poise, and get food out quickly and with a smile."
good,The job at Panera was fun and really fast paste i could not complain really about this job if i wanted to i would work at another one but i an trying to move forward in life.
good,My training was never properly handled and the management was too lenient. But most of the time people and customers kept the job fun.
good,Most of the part-time employees were students and we all work together to make a difference and management was always impressed.
good,i felt like this job is designed for high school kids who need a job just for money i was here part time asking for full and the thing they could offer me was nights when  i had my daughter
good,The management team needs to learn proper procedures.  They need to take ownership of their jobs.  Too much favoritism.  Hard work and sometimes don't have the proper equipment to do your job correctly.
good,A typical day at work is showing up and being able to work through the lunch rush as quickly and efficiently as possible. I was able to learn all positions except manage in under a year there.
good,"Panera Bread is a friendly store , co workers are very warm. Wish they paid more. Currently a student and schedule doesn't match up with school schedule."
good,"A typical day at work would depend on the time of shift but it may include; stocking, prepping, cleaning, cashier service, dining room service or food production. Morale at the company largely depended on the manager on duty, the general manager, and their respective styles of management. My co-workers were by far the best part of the job. I worked with generally great people. The hardest part of the job were dealing with unnecessarily harsh managers and guests. But most of our management and guests were very polite and enjoyable to work with and serve."
good,"Panera is a great place to start if you're looking for your first job or somewhere that you feel you can excel at your job. I have worked there for five years and I have truly enjoyed it. The store I work at is very busy and there is always something to do. If you are a person who likes to keep busy and feel productive then this job would suit you. There was just a change in management and it has a been a positive one. I have learned communication skills, time management, customer service skills, and many others while working at Panera. They were always really flexible with my school schedule as well and always did what they could to accommodate everyone."
good,"Very busy, hands on, challenging and fun.  Little time for management responsibilities.  Average days are 10 hours, non stop and dealing with guests that are super with the occasional tough customer.  Meeting and being around people is the most enjoyable part of this job."
good,"Friendly People, enjoyed the environment. fast paced. Really enjoyed working their, just wanted to find a better paying job."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"I enjoy serving others and working in a fast pace environment. Team work is necessary to effectively serve customers during peak hours. My time here improved my communication skills, as well as team building."
good,Maintained front cashier area; interacted with customers in hopes that they got the best service possible. Made sure new employees were trained properly and understood the rules/expectations. Enjoyed atmosphere and fast paced environment.
good,"Take customers orders in a timely manner"
good,"I learned a lot about how to effectively communicated with many different people, as well as how to run a line in a culinary setting."
good,"Panera bread was a great place to work but had no opportunity for advancement. I worked 6 nights a week and would only get about 28 hours a week. I greeted customers, processed transactions at the register, stocked coolers, cleaned/organized, delivered food to the tables & cooked meals occasionally. I loved the people that I worked with, we were all a great team and worked very well together. The hardest part about the job was knowing that there was no room for growth."
good,"A typical day is you clock in, then you go and view your job duties, and then you go and complete your duties to your fullest potential. I learned a lot at Panera. I learned that jobs are not easy, but you have to work though it and be a good team member. My co-workers were very supportive but very demanding. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with customers. The most enjoyable part is the feeling of accomplishment at the end of your shift."
good,"I had to operate the cash register, answers calls, take orders, maintain stock, clean, and provide customer service with a fast and efficient pace."
good,Bread Co is a good company with great people and good processes. It is a fun and fast paced environment. Bread Co is a also a great place to find yourself in when you are transitioning to a new place to live. It has been a great place to start out in a new area.
good,"A lot of multitasking required. I liked that time went quickly being busy for almost every minute. "
good,"A typical day at work for me would start off about 30 minutes before the lunch rush comes in. Some days I would run orders to customers, other days I would work on the production line, and occasionally, wash dishes while bussing tables. From my duties, I gained different skills such as communicating with a customer, being a critical thinker, multitasking, and working at a demanding pace. I enjoyed working on the production line because of the team based effort made the lunch rush -  the busiest time of the work day -  enjoyable."
good,Fun place to work while in college.  Get to keep bakery items at the end of the night.  Good discounts on food for employees.
good,"liked the people i worked with, poor management, didnt care about employees i really got to know the guests an know them personally"
good,"A typical day at work would usually revolve around making food on the line for the customers as well as helping out any customers that need assistance or have any questions. In addition, handling the cash register and making sure that the customers know they can ask for help if they need any as well as providing a warm and welcome environment for them."
good,On a daily basis I would provide customer service by ringing up orders for food and drinks. I would also stock merchandise.
good,"Upbeat, changing work place surrounded by hard workers that push me to be better everyday. Work as a cashier and dinning room attendant with other duties as needed. Have learned how to be a hard worker and how to manage my time and duties."
good,The food and management are excellent but the workload can be stressful. Pay not commensurate with amount of work done. Has advancement opportunities.
good,I was hired as a pep-cook and it was a learning process but I learn quickly and did the job on time and with quality. Sometimes had to react quickly to over sales. I did a good job with the head cook to make sure the sandwich makers had what they needed. Was only a part-time job and my second job. I got to the point where I could not do both jobs and resigned from this.
good,This was a good place to work. You got to meet a lot of new people as well as learn how to bake breads and other sweets.  Inventory as well as stocking and ordering for the store. A lot of room to grow as well as becoming a owner some day.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Nice place to work"
good,Set up lines working morning shifts. Learned to work at a high level efficiently. Management was helpful. Co workers were fun. Hardest part was catering while still doing customers orders. the most enjoyable part of the job was baking pastries and bread
good,The food is great so customers are already pleasant. I enjoy working there part time and like the benefit of discounted purchases.
good,Typical day at work was hectic.  Fast pace environment which I loved.  My most valuable learning experience was learning how to trust without reason.  You must first believe that the customer or employee is being truthful and give them that opportunity to prove or disprove there own honesty if that be the case.  I worked with an awesome team of employees.  Hard-working and for the most part loyal.  The hardest part of the job was the amount of team I spent worrying about the job.  when I was at work I was worried about work and when I was with my family I still worried about work. But the part I found most enjoyable was the people I worked with and the customers I saw on a regular basis.
good,I learned to be self motivated working as a prep cook at Panera Bread.  I was given the tools I needed to get the job done and sent to do my tasks.
good,"Great products, customers made to feel like family.  The work day is filled with the knowledge of satisfying each person who comes through the door by producing their order individually"
good,"A typical day would be non-stop from 5:00am till 11:00pm. Customer service was number one, then it fell to food safety. Finding the right people was a challenge but there were so many young people willing to earn their wages, they made it easy."
good,"I would go in at 5 am, opened usually with the same crew. Friendly chatter but in the morning everyone works mostly quiet until breakfast rush. Usually things ran smoothly and we all did our part everyone helped out where needed and everyone got along."
good,"Co-workers are great, as are the customers. Managers are very unprofessional. They lack in assistance when employees need it. They also play favoritism, they do not help employees on areas they need to improve on."
good,"I really enjoyed my time working there, They take care of employees, I had no problem transferring to a closer location to be near my family."
good,I did alot of different things at Panera. I loved working there but when my divorce happened it just became too hard to travel from Downtown to Noblesville. I made sandwiches and interacted with customers and consolidated and prepped. It was awesome. Management was awesome but I did have beef with one of them but I didn't know why so we just respected each others company when working together.
good,"A typical day at Panera is just running around. Run register, make drinks, clean the lobby, and assist customers. I've learned more about customer service and how important it is to like the job you work at. Management for the most part for me is wonderful. They do try to work with you giving constructive criticism. The hardest part of the job would have to be to keep a smile on my face when a customer isn't happy which is rare. The most enjoyable part of the job is just getting to interact with all the customers that come in. I enjoy talking and getting to know my customers there."
good,Great first job for anyone that hasn't had one.  Can easily work your way to full time if you work hard and prove you're reliable to management.
good,"Panera is a nice company to work for.  However, there are some communication issues and the shift is tiring without a break."
good,"Typical day at Panera Bread would consist of me being on the line, cooking food and consolidating orders for customers. I also would work cashier and barista as well."
good,"A typical Day at work would include getting breakfast ready for the morning and preparing for the lunch hour. I learned a lot about myself, how to be patient with others. How to create a positive and calm work environment."
good,"Being an associate trainer, I was in charge of training new employees, and upholding Panera Standards within the staff on a daily basis. Since this was my first job, I learned everything I know about hard work and discipline. I learned a lot about the food industry, and how to properly handle food. Over the last 5 years, I worked with over 20 different managers, all of whom trusted me to get my job done efficiently. I have had manager training and worked side by side with managers to learn what jobs they uphold day-to-day. My coworkers have been some of my best friends over the years, and I couldn't have asked for better coworkers. The hardest part of my job was handling customer complaints. Although I always handled them promptly and respectfully. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to work with my friends everyday."
good,"Lots of hard work, always plenty of hours, and training practices are excellent. Advancement through positions is very slow, but understandable."
good,Panera Bread is a good starter job but it is not a career path that I would recommend. Some of the mangers at the Panera I work at should not be mangers as some take the position to the extreme where as some do not have a back bone to help out the associates.
good,Typical day at work would be which ever I was placed for the day. Whether it was the barista making drinks or cashier or back up runner. I learned multitasking with food orders because there was always an order after another and I would have to remember these orders and make sure it was delivered to the right individual or group. Customer service as well as I was pre busing tables.  Management was great but very stressful at times because of a fast paced environment but all in all great management team . The co workers were wonderful and great trainers as well. Hardest part of the job was the remembering orders. That was a bit crazy but got through my day and did the best I could possibly do. The most enjoyable part of the job was the team I worked with. I could not have done it without them.
good,It was a fun place to work. I had learned lots that I didn't know at all. They where very understanding and gave lots of constructive criticism.
good,"Come in clock-in, count my drawer. Standing at register waiting on customer to take their orders. Cleaning dinning room."
good,"At Panera, I usually start off my day as a dine in person, which is busing tables and delivery orders to the guest. After a few hours i am moved to either the cashier area or the line. Ive learned how to make expresso drinks, sandwiches, salads, and many other things. Management is okay but could be a little better."
good,Job is best done with an upbeat and positive attitude. It is exactly like what one might expect with higher volume at my location.
good,"I do a little bit of everything at Panera. From prepping the food to be used throughout the day, assembling guests order, and interacting with the guests as they receive their entrees. I was recently promoted to a new employee trainer and have the opportunity to train employees in a store that is opening at the end of July 2015 in Georgetown."
good,"Working here can be very stressful, but some of the people you meet and work with make it worthwhile.  Our Café is one of the busier ones."
good,I enjoy working here very however the pay I feel isn't enough for time and labor I put in. I feel there is no way for me to grow in this company and its time for a change.
good,"It was cool when I first started but when other managers begin to take turns doing the schedule, it became a hot mess. I never had an consistent schedule after February."
good,Typically would work on the drive through production. My job was to make all the food from drive through orders by myself and get it out under 3 minutes. Very fast past environment and management rarely helped out unless it was super busy. The hardest part about my job was trying to help out the drive through people and take orders while making the food.
good,Fulfilled different responsibilities each day depending on business needs. Worked with hard working associates to provide superior customer service. Maintained a clean and tidy store during very busy hours.
good,"benefits have changed and working hours have been extended to long night hour with out compensation."
good,Working with Panera Bread was an opportunity to grow personally and professionally. I recommend the company as a growth potential opportunity for anyone.
good,Baking for Panera Bread was basically like a dream. Typically I was working alone or with one other person overnight. I really enjoyed being accountable for my own work here.
good,I made sandwiches and baked bread. poured soup in your bread and you ate it. if you wanted i gave you some extra bread rolls
good,I usually come in early in the morning and begin with stocking and helping customers in our store. I have learned how to work well with others and how to effectively communicate with consumers. My co-workers are helpful and are willing to help where is needed. The hardest part of my job is dealing with irate customers and having too many people not focused on tasks that have been given. I enjoy talking to our regular customers and spending time with my co-workers outside of work.
good,Typical day is busy and can be hectic but goes by fast and can be very enjoyable. I've learned a lot about customer service as well as how to maintain things in the food industry. Management is usually kept up with everything going on in the restaurant but sometimes they make our jobs unbearable to deal with. Some coworkers are great to work with and do their job to their best ability and help others while other coworkers don't care for their job and don't do things to the best of their ability or help others. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the managers and coworkers on a bad day and the most enjoyable part is having a good day where nothing goes wrong and customers are getting the service they want.
good,"Call every evening in order to figure out what was happening the next day. When there were no orders, I was asked to help associates. Was not given a team, so a lot of responsibility."
good,The store in which I work at is constantly busy and alternates between being the busiest Panera Bread in the world (Alternating with Manhatten). Workers are friendly and we all work together to do our tasks.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"My favorite thing about working at Panera Bread is the people that I work with, we are like a family with little to no drama. The management is enjoyable and very understanding. I am a part of the management team as a Shift Supervisor. A typical shift started by checking e-mails and preparing for the shift my checking who I had on staff for the day. Then I would work my shift my making sure that the employees were doing what they were supposed to and helping them out if they needed it. I gained valuable life experience here by learning to work with unhappy customers and make them happy. Which is also one of the more difficult aspects of the job, but worth it to see the smile on the customers face when you fix the problem that they had."
good,Lunch rushes were the most difficult. Co-workers were very friendly amd understandable. overall a great place to work
good,The place doesn't know how to pay its best employees. So when they find someone who really cares about the work and will help them get ahead they end up leaving because they can't afford to work at Panera for next to no money
good,"*   A very high end cafe, with high quality food."
good,Prep produce and meats for daily use. Then i go to the production line to put together orders. Management helps out when needed. Co-workers communicate really well with one another. The hardest part is when we are short staffed and are slammed for lunch rush. I really enjoy my co-workers and the management
good,"Panera Bread is a great work environment.  Management is great, often rewarding their employees for accomplishments.  Panera is a very popular place to dine resulting in busy breakfast, lunch, and dinner hours.  Working at a fast pace is a great way to sharpen your skills."
good,"Easy first job, did it all throughout high school and college and did not find it to majorly affect my studies. Management was willing to work around my school schedule, this attributed to me staying there as long as I did."
good,"walk into work with a line out the door and a full screen with orders to be made, from roughly 11:00am till around 3:00 typically would go on break, come back from break and get ready for the dinner rush which typically came in around 5:00 pm-6:00 pm till about 8:00pm then from there on out closed shop and got things ready for the next day"
good,"Great place to work if you like the fast-paced environment! Easy to stay busy, there is always a lot to do. I always had a great management team while I was there which was great. Flexible with your schedule and you'll get the hours if you do a great job. Definitely possible for company advancements!"
good,i learned how to bake things and it was laid back but unless i become a baker it didn't give me much experience
good,"A typical starts out by getting breakfast ready as well as stocking utensils. After items are  done continue line setup for lunch as well as for catering. Having backs up for lunch and if a new trainee comes in start training. But helped with getting catering done."
good,"Strong management, good training, fun and well rounded staff. Learned a lot dealing with the food business. Fast paced makes it difficult, but it is also enjoyable because of the satisfaction of overcoming the challenge."
good,As an intern the Department really provided me with a first hand experience of Corporate America. You are put in an environment to work with people from all over the world all coming together to share ideas and policies to move us into a greater future.
good,"I was there four years, never moved out of normal associate ranking. I was doing everything there, from training new managers to specialized services (Crispani's the panera pizzas and catering). Managers came and went and some I got along great with and other's I did not"
good,"assisted customers with food and beverage purchase.maintain store appearance  with cleaning and tidying, helped on food line when not assisting cx, increasing productivity. loved how the managers always helped instead or just telling you what to do. Co workers we just as nice. hardest part was working food lie making sure orders were correct and out in a timely manners. most enjoyable, had to be the"
good,pretty good place to work. Some days are better than others but the culture is great and the guiding values of the company are fantastic.
good,Friendly staff. I enjoy interacting with customers as well as my other responsibilities. I do not enjoy standing on my feet for eight hours without a break.
good,"Oversaw all aspects of the cafes. Hiring, training, disciplinary and terminations. Did all ordering and following of labor and food costs."
good,Management is amazing and amazing work staff. The setup for starting the job gets you excited to work there and is followed up by a fun and friendly environment  to work.
good,good family environment. every one keeps a smile as long as bread are sold.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"People here are amazing. I have made some of my closest friends here. As a job, Panera is a great place to gain food service experience."
good,I liked staying busy and coming in and know what I had to do everyday. I was good at my job.
good,arrive at 5 am. prep food for the entire work day. takes about six to ten hours depending on how much food is needed.
good,"I enjoyed the friendly co-worker and manager, always with a smile on there face.  Just to pitcher and help you out.  The love setting up the salad line or sandwich line.  I different people who would talk to me about the taste of there sandwich or how there life was.  I learned to be more patience with the public."
good,"I worked at Panera Bread part-time for 9 months."
good,"A typical day at work went by in a set order of tasks.  Take inventory, determine what is needed, prepare what is needed, restock carts and clean up, I would come into work with determination to meet all of my daily goals and clock out with a feeling of accomplishment and relief."
good,"Depending on location, can be a fun place to work.  Quantities seem to over shadow Quality."
good,When i worked at Panera Bread i had a coworker ask if i can work for her i told her yes she also worked for me to that week.The management was nice people to work for we had a lot of good times. The hardest part of the job was getting up at 5AM every day thr thing i enjoyed the most was the food there.
good,Great Environment to work in. Co workers felt like a second family. We all worked as one to make the store run well and efficient .
good,I learned so much at this job. My manager was pretty cool and help me learn about flooring.
good,"Busy days but it kept me doing something. I learned how to work more efficiently as a team member but also as a trainer, I learned when to take initiative. I learned how to please my customers. Got along well with everyone. It's a great environment."
good,"good food, fast paced, excellent customer service. Good place for a person to gain restaurant experience."
good,"I was young and the franchise was young. As an assistant there were a lot of night and weekend hours. The benefits were decent. My personal status changed in my 3rd year with the company and I decided to choose to stay home with my daughter who was 13 and being home schooled due to health reasons. When I look back at this job in particular I see that there were a lot of lessons to be learned. However, given my home situation I stand by my decision to stay at home."
good,The job was not hard but the work at times was. There were times we had a ball while working.
good,Came into work and worked on the line. Enjoyed most of my co-workers. Was a great starter job.
good,"During a typical night at work I would be required to prepare dough and sweets for the proofing and baking process and well as top, ice, and arrange everything for the next day. I learned excellent time management skills as well as working well with a partner on a series of tasks. My co-workers are all dependable and likeable people who helped to train me accurately and in a short amount of time. The most enjoyable part of my job is coming in to work the next night and seeing the previous nights work on display for the world to see."
good,Panera Bread is a great company to work for. There is a lot to learn and a lot of great people to work with. My experience working for Panera has only been positive and I would recommend this company to fellow job seekers.
good,"Making sandwiches, and salads, in a professional and timely manner. Prepping ingredients for said sandwiches and salads. Engaging with the customers to see that they are comfortable and have what they need to enjoy the “Panera” experience."
good,Quick paced and sense of urgency is required. The job is exactly what you'd expect from an entry level food industry. Hardest part I would have to say would be having to engage customers on a consistent basis but even then it's not overwhelming.
good,Days can be fun but long. Quick-paced environment with constant interaction with customers.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Very busy fast paced"
good,"A typical day at work consists of me laughing with my co-workers, chatting it up with the regular customers, and learning new things everyday. The hardest part of the job can be simply learning all of the basics behind how to prepare to food for the customers, especially during the very busy times the line can be out the door for hours. The most enjoyable part is probably the entire job because it feels more like a second home for most employees and we all get along with each other and help out and make sure nobody feels left out."
good,"Very awesome company to work for. Very clean and they hold themselves to a high level of quality food as well as customer service. Making and prepping food for all catering orders, delivery and setting them up. Also selling catering sales."
good,"my typical day at work at first used to be me coming into work and being a cashier all of my shift, then i got trained into making sandwiches and preparing salads. preparing hot soups, drive thru orders, making smoothies , cappuchinos, frozen beverges. My management team wasnrt so good due to the fact i went through two general managers and about five different asssistant managers due to their neglience and of the company and its employers. My co workers were great and i got along pretty much with everyone. The hardest part of my job was working extra long hourrs and too much overtime and i felt like the company was taking advantage of me since i was one of the few people ceritfied in various positions. the most enjoyable part of my day was seeing the smiles on my customers faces."
good,"The work environment and people were both enjoyable, however the pay was sub-par for the food industry and advancement opportunities were largely non existent."
good,Working at Panera Bread Co. I have been able to polish my customer  interaction and leadership skills.
good,"loved my co-workers. everybody worked together to get things done. needs to work on management. very unorganized and child like with the gossiping, i had a very personal matter that i called and spoke with the head manager about, and when i returned to work a week later EVERYBODY knew my buisness."
good,Panera provides steady hours and an upbeat work environment molded by key values to provide optimal customer service in the food industry. The management team is sharp and seasoned with knowledge and advice on how to work at one hundred percent potential. Co workers are fast and positive. The hardest part of the job would be not eating the food. The most enjoyable part would be the respectful work environment.
good,"make food, operate cash register, cleaning duties, making coffee, management was good about giving hours and hardest part of job was keeping the orders down so there was no line of customers."
good,Fun environment great place to work meet alot of new people mangers are great
good,A typical day would include greeting guests with a friendly greeting and helping and taking their food or drink orders. There is usally at least three other coworkers doing thesame task. I really enjoy interacting with customers rather their the stores regular customer or new as well as my coworkers and managers
good,"Working at Panera Bread, I have enhanced my knowledge of working in a food preparation store. I have been trained and officially certified in the following positions: cashier, dining room, barista, sandwiches, salads, and breakfast. I have assisted in opening up the store and closing down the café side of  the store. I am skilled in handling cash and credit card payments for food and/or bakery items. I have learned how to prepare specialty drinks in the barista station. I've mastered running the café line, preparing salads, sandwiches, and breakfast items for our customers."
good,"A typical day of work:"
good,Working at panera bread was a pleasant place to work its a very clam environment the people i worked with became like family to me the costumers are always kind and easy to work with. hardest part of the job was keeping up with orders when it got busy.
good,"Perfect place for me to start working as a young teen. Taught me how to have great customer service and deal with many different types of people. I enjoyed working along side all of my co-workers and shift supervisors. The job got somewhat stressful when we received rushes that lasted for hours, but that's expected in the restaurant business."
good,"The hardest part of the job is dealing with coworkers who don't take any pride in their work. They are consistently focused on themselves, and not willing to go above and beyond their job description."
good,Panera Bread is a family friendly place to work at. I have enjoyed working for Panera Bread for about 5 months and i have really enjoyed it.
good,"Typically as a cashier I would be ringing in customers, making drinks, and serving the customers bakery items.  I've learned how to deal with difficult customers from this job.  The management is not that great but the coworkers were awesome!"
good,Untill the company fell apart I loved the job. If you love pizza and have worked in the industry you understand the people are unique and hours are oh so fun.  This was a great stepping stone for me to develop mgmt skills.
good,coordinating associates to daily task and customer service duities
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Fun environment, great employees.  It was nice to also receive discounts on all food items.  Love the quality of their food and what this business stood for.  They donate all leftovers at the end of the day to the needy :)"
good,"Panera is an overall great place to work. Fast paced, constant new -challenges."
good,"Being the first one in gives you the pleasure to have the place all to yourself, and to really get to know your customers, since most of the time you'll be the only front of house personnel in. The hardest part was dealing with frustrated customers. Sometimes they are very stubborn."
good,It was warm nice place to work food is great and its lovely in the spring
good,"Provide outstanding costumer service"
good,"A typical day included prep line, where we contructed the food. Cashiering, taking guest orders and cashing them out."
good,"i cashed guests out, gave them buzzers for when their food was ready,  and stocked when it was needed."
good,"Co-workers and managers are great. They provide a fun and energetic work atmosphere. For $20,000 a year I would love this job, but for slightly more than minimum wage I'm out."
good,"a typical day at work"
good,"My typical days at work were very fun.I learned so much about making drinks ,preparing bakery items and also how to be a helpful co-worker."
good,I liked most of my co-workers and the management team was very awesome!
good,The food was great and we got it at a discount. All in all a pretty typical food place to work. Higher levels of cleaning were expected that at most food jobs.
good,"I fully indulged my carb-o-holic side while learning about making the most consistently great bread and pastry in the industry.  The efficiency with which these restaurants are run is definitely exciting, but can be grueling at times to keep up with the expectations.  Food service hours are long, and you are pretty much always working when others are not, but the varied schedule can give you a lot of freedom, too."
good,Working here was alright.  The task were never too much but the fact that the store was under staffed proved to be difficult. The time given to get the task done was impossible. The rush atmosphere was not for me.  I learned how to manage my time better and the best part of my shift was closing because I could work at my pace make everything look the way it was supposed to.  My managers were great to work with it was just over compensating of not being staffed that would put them on edge a little.
good,"I learn a lot at work I learn great customer service skills as well as money management skills."
good,Working at panera bread i have learned great customer service. Always help the customer to my best ability. I enjoyed the job most when everyone was at their best. Management was always helpful with me and any help i needed.
good,"I would come in and work dish/bus, cash, line, prep, barista or crispani. I would also train new employee's on these areas, as well as travel to new stores to train and help open them. I knew how to open, work a mid-shift, or close. I worked there for a few years, so there were some bad apples, but mostly good people. The hardest part of the job was not getting enough hours to support myself. I was told that if you were not receiving very many hours, then to talk to the manager to find out why. When I asked my manager why I wasn't getting more hours, I was told that I was not doing anything wrong and that they had no explanation for why I was not receiving more hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was being there since day one. I was part of the new store crew and I felt immense pride and satisfaction from how our store was ran."
good,Panera Bread is a value oriented company that cares for its employees and customers.
good,"Responsibilities: Create and maintain customer relationships and connections. Handle all transactions and attend training workshops. Manage and counsel associates. Clerical work and cash handling. Responsible for food preparation, and service. Perform general cleaning duties and sanitation procedures. Conduct myself as a role model for other employees. Cross-train and educate myself on many different roles and duties of the bakery-cafe to be a well-rounded and knowledgeable employee. Contribute to an environment of teamwork and shared responsibility so that I may be successful as well as contribute to the success of others."
good,My role as Catering Coordinator allowed me to gain experience with marketing and customer service.

good,"I loved working there. Very great team work, everyone helped each other out even the baker. My managers were understanding and very helpful. My co-workers worked as a team and everyone got along. The hardest part of the job was waking up at 4 to be at work at  5AM to open the store but it was worth it. The most enjoyable part of my job and knowing the customer got exactly what they wanted and leaving satisfied"
good,It was a good experience working for Panera Bread. They really are about great customer service and quality food. I loved working for Panera Bread. It was about that time to move on and get a job that was more serious and could help me improve my experience professionally.
good,"It was a great environment to work for. The coworkers were easy to get along with and were very easy going. The managers were great also, they were there when you had a question. They helped when they could."
good,"Show up for shift, if you opened you set up the bakery, made all the coffee, counted safe, counted drawers, got the breakfast line set up. checked in the truck. Set up the barista and then did your break down of employees to the proper positions."
good,"a beginning operations manager will learn a lot from this company."
good,"A typical day at Panera bread would be coming into work being greeted by my co-workers, then going to the back to count the money in my drawer. After that I would pick a register and start taking orders. At Panera I learned how to make drinks ( frozen lemonade) I learned how to work well with others. My co-workers at Panera made my job fun. Everyone there was energetic and very nice. the hardest part of the job was working with customers who were generally unhappy.  I enjoyed our meetings and getting to try all the new food."
good,gets boring after awhile. co workers are fun so are the managers. gets really busy at times.
good,Cheerful environment and workers. Loved working with the customers. Constantly something new. Very rewarding to know you can make a customers day
good,I was taught a lot about management at a very young age and it helped me mature in work ethics that I had not yet had before
good,It's fun working here it's upbeat and all the workers want to be there
good,"working here was very routine, I learned how to work well with others and the best part of the job was the co-workers I had."
good,"It is a great place to work however you may find yourself working around a poor staff and/ or management. There's a lot of gossiping in the work place which is typical. However, I would like to make note that the management at the Panera Bread I worked were very unprofessional and racist. One shift supervisor was fired for insulting a coworker. The work schedule isn't so great if you work during the dinner hours and you might find that during that shift you have more work loaded on whereas if you work the mornings nothing gets done to help the night crew with their duties."
good,Good experience for a first job.  Need to move up and out with your new skills though.  Socially caring company that donates food and does a lot of fundraising events in our community. Our product is fresh and a good value. Training is pretty good but have to ask to be trained in different areas. The lack of communication within leadership is bad.  Schedules are posted a couple days before you are suppose to work and done messy and in pencil.  Makes work/life balance almost impossible. Favoritism is pretty obvious based on hours/schedules/job assignments. Co-workers are a fun group who all feel pretty much the same way.
good,"Managers are upbeat, friendly, co workers were professional and fun wo work with."
good,Hours are extremely difficult. Some days you have to be at work at 4-5am to open and some days you have to close and go in at 1 and work until 11pm.
good,"A typical day at Panera Bread is creating an enjoyable atmosphere and high quality food for all customers. Over the past four years, my knowledge and understanding of such business has grown tremendously. The employees I work with also make working at Panera Bread fun. Lastly, the most enjoyable part is having repeat customers and receiving positive feedback."
good,Going to work to getting everything set up enjoyed having to work fast and getting everything done on time it kept me busy
good,For the most part I enjoyed working there. I didn't get along with one of my supervisors at all which happened to be my downfall there.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is to see the regular customers that ask you how you are doing and make sure to always greet you before they leave if they were helped by someone else. It makes you feel good that you are known by your customers and that they treat you as family when they walk in.
good,"The work is difficult at times, there's always equipment issues, co-worker issues. But it's steady work and the manager's are good at communicating and will help you get caught up when there are issues and they are free. As a baker, you have to stay within 40 hours for a 5 day work week, there are no exceptions including meetings, travel time for meetings, and training. If you can live on 40 hours and are ok with changing stores occasionally, and able to work in often changing conditions, then this job will be great for you. Stay with them for a couple years and work hard and you will eventually advance as opportunities arise. However, long periods can go by before management positions open up and there is a lot of competition for them being as they are salaried. So it can be hard to land a higher up position being as the company is so big. Overall, I love the busy work and constant flow of the night shift, even on nights when everything goes south. At the end of the day it feels good to have accomplished all your tasks in the time limit despite always needing to improvise and work with hangups. I would recommend this job to anyone that can work a flexible schedule or is going to school in the daytime or nighttime depending on the opposing shift worked. As I said, it's great if you're just out of school or enrolled in higher education, but the 40 hour cap makes it difficult in my situation trying to support a family of 3 on a single income."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Vast opportunities are always available at Panera Bread.  There are many different modules to be trained in, including taking customer orders, making the food, cleaning up the dining room, as well as food prep.  This job is very fast paced and keeps you on your toes.  Management system is great, always room for advancement, many management staff have worked their way up from an associate position.  Co-workers are great and most have fun upbeat personalities.  Keeping up with busy times can be stressful and challenging but very rewarding.  "
good,"great customers wonderful coworkers, a lot of laughs and giggles learned a lot of food service info. great food"
good,"Go into work and check the chart to see where i would be for the day depended on what I would do that day. sometime cash some line, or prep. the management there could use lots of work. Co workers kept a lot of drama going all the time. There really wasn't a hard part to the job to me. "
good,"Used cash register, took orders, prepared platters in bakery, etc. Good place to work, kind coworkers, just a lot of work for minimum wage."
good,"-I ran food out to the customers and built a nice relationship with many regular customers as well as management and co-workers."
good,"Working at Panera was very fast paced, but detail orientated. You had to think on your toes and manager promptly. It was a case for the books."
good,"typical day at work would be taking orders, making customers food, customer service, and clean store for the following day."
good,Usually jump immediately into your duties at the start of shift. Management was always willing to jump in and help with any tasks if the day started to get hectic. Co-workers were usually very helpful as well throughout the day. The hardest part of the job would have to be closing/cleaning which could sometimes last until 1 in the morning.
good,Management was okay
good,made food for customers and cleaned the kitchen. also took out the trash. management was alright because we trained managers to ship off to other stores.
good,"I was a sandwhich maker on the line I would get there when it opened and stayed until 3:00. In the mornings i would set up the line and make the hot sandwhiches. Then i would work on the line making the food and doing what ever i could to help. What i learned was how to run the grills,dishwasher,prep food, clean, and make great food. I think the hardest part of the job was learning all the sandwhiches my first day. The fun part about the job was working with food and the customers."
good,"As a catering manager, you work quite early in the morning until quite late in the afternoon. Time management is an essential key to catering at Panera Bread. The management staff is always willing to help out with production and deliveries although sometimes you are assigned an assistant. You create a family with the people you work with because most have set schedules that work around their life. The hardest part of Catering at Panera is the high volume throughout the store and Catering. Sometimes it feels as though its impossible but with all the support, anything is possible. Most enjoyable is the people you work with. They all have very positive attitudes and are very friendly towards past, present, and future employees. Trainees get treated with respect and are trained to properly execute the new job they have to succeed in."
good,"A typical workday depends on what job you are doing. If you are doing dining room it will depend on how many people are there. It can be very slow to something very fast past and difficult work. The management is friendly and young, so they work well with the associates. The co-workers are mostly college students or people who are generally young and fun to be around. The hardest part of the job is the fast pace work environment, but it makes the time pass faster. The most enjoyable part about the job is the co-workers."
good,I liked this job a lot but it came to a point that i was at the cafe EVERY DAY and it hurt my life and family so i had to move on .
good,I learned how to problem solve in stressful situations among a lot of other useful skills
good,I cleaned the dining room at Panera Bread in Burlington MA. It was an alright job I was there for 4 years.
good,"It is a god company to work for, a ton of growth. They dont have enough people for coverage but very rewarding"
good,As a closer I'd be happy just to have the mid-day crew to have me pretty much have me set up for the night. Management some play by favorites.
good,I have made friends at Panera bread as well as just other co-workers. There is not a hard part to this job as long as you have the proper communication skills.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,this was fun job enjoyed the people i met the customers were awesome i think they had a great menu wit a variety of items to combine an choose from that you really couldnt go wrong either way even health choices .tthe co workers were nice and professional they worked yhard and efficient was on time with the product.there was nothing hard about this job
good,"This store branch is exactly that, Good concept, bad execution if only for the selection of its management staff."
good,"While working at Panera Bread we were not just all associates but family. We would work together to ""WOW"" our guest to the best of our ability. We would enjoy getting to know our guest by there names and build a connection with our guest."
good,"A typical day at work for me involved operating a cash register in the bakery; this included taking patrons' orders, delivering any bakery items they ordered to them on the spot, and receiving payment and making change for the patrons. I learned how to properly man a cash register (things like counting down the drawer at the end of the night), something I had previously known nothing about. Management was always cheery and willing to help at a moment's notice. My coworkers were my home away from home. I worked with some of the friendliest, energetic people you will ever meet. The hardest part of the job was the long hours I had to put in some weeks. There were some weeks I worked upwards of 60 hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting the opportunity to converse with customers throughout their dining experience."
good,"Working at Panera can be pretty fun. I would probably enjoy it a lot more if I didn't already have a degree and this was the only place hiring while I searched for jobs in my field. That thought makes working here suck sometimes, but it truly is a nice job."
good,"I loved learning new things about the different types of breads as well as soups and salads. This job showed me more in depth the needs needed to keep up a ""restaurant."" Management was great. This job allowed me to float and learn different things which I loved because I don't like being ""stuck"" in one position to long. My co-workers made work worthwhile so I didn't see time."
good,"a typical day would be help open the food line, stock the bread area, clean. i learned a lot more about customer service and how to make different kinds of salads, sandwiches, and soups that i have never made. the management was ok. some time they didnt take there job as well as they should have. the hardest part of the job was how much drama went around. i liked the job overall. it had its ups and down but was pretty fun."
good,"A typical day at the P. Bread consisted of consolidating customer meals, working on the food line, and making sure that we had our food products fully stocked. I learned that in order to work well at Panera Bread, I had to learn how to work in a fast-pace environment and make little mistakes. I enjoyed working at Panera Bread because of the co-workers, managers, and the customers that came through. I was able to build relationships with both co-workers and managers as well. The hardest part of this job is remembering the little details to each area of work you are certified to work in."
good,"It was an exciting place to work great food, compensation, and co-workers. The difficult part was being a cashier while working the dining room and sometimes even dish duty."
good,"Great people, accomodating supervisors, and co-workers who are willing to switch shifts if they're able to."
good,I Learned How To Become A Stronger Team Memeber. My Co-Workers Was Responsible and Helpful. My Communication With The Customers Became Stronger.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing our guests return and tell us how they enjoyed their meal. It also is rewarding to know that I could recommend something yummy that they wouldn't have normally eaten.
good,came in each morning everyone greeting with a smile very energetic
good,"Fun to work, management is very much looking to provide a great oasis for customers. Great co-workers, buidong relationships with guests is unique."
good,Its a food service job for minimum wage. I'm pretty sure all of them are about the same.
good,"teaches basic customer service skills, how to be diverse and give your all with a smile"
good,"Fun place to work, everyone has their responsibilities, I learned a great deal of customer service"
good,I enjoyed working at Panera. I would show up and make sure my station was clean organized and ready for the day. The hardest part of this job for me at first was waking up at 5 in the morning to open the store at 6. After a while it got really easy. I made a lot of friends and the mangers were always so sweet and energetic which made our team the same way.
good,Helps customers decide on what type of product they would like to eat.
good,I was responsible for the training and supervising of the new and current employees.
good,"People that work there are extremely two faced, and the management is not very good at all."
good,"a typical day at panera bread is busy. keep us always busy. i learned that your skin color has alot to do how you move up in the company. the management is okay. my co-workers are great, they do the best they can to get there work done. the hardest part of the job is working with the management. the most enjoyable part of my job is to work with my co-workers"
good,"A very relaxing atmosphere for customers, food is very fresh, great place."
good,Handled cash transactions while assisting customers. Learned communication skills and professional customer service tips. Management was helpful and understanding. Co-workers were a pleasure to be around. Most difficult part of job was assisting difficult customers. Most enjoyable part of the job was amazing co-workers and friendly work environment. Made coming into work enjoyable everyday.
good,I typically interact with a variety of individuals throughout the day. Being able to multi task is essential. The most enjoyable part is being able to interact with people.
good,"Restaurant opener (5 a.m.), cashier, baker, customer service associate. Always ""rocking"" with business, fun to assist customers."
good,"A typical day at work is very busy and fast paced. Management at Panera Bread do there job, they manage and they assist. My co-workers are amazing! Nice people who come to work to have a relaxed night and work. The hardest part about the job is not getting upset. It can get crazy and busy at times and you just want to quit but its a good job."
good,A typical day at work was good overall. I work well under pressure each day as I trained and got used to the enviroment.
good,The people at Panera Bread are awesome. I love having the regulars come in because I have an amazing relationship with them.
good,Panera is a great company to work for however my experience was not the best in my particular store there were WAY too many managers and not enough associates. Only a select manager or two was actually good at what the were being paid to do. It seems that simply time in service leads to advancement instead of the quality of service.
good,I enjoyed working for Panera Bread and loved the marketing team.
good,"I started at Panera in 2006 as the opening cashier. It was only a short while before I was promoted to shift manager; my position was to arrive at 5am, set up and open the cafe and stay through lunch until 2pm. I held that position for 6-8 months and then I was promoted again to salaried assistant manager. During my time as assistant manager, I was in charge of hiring new associates and training for new hires and existing associates. I did some ordering, managing safe and cash drawers, closing the cafe, etc. I resigned my position as assistant manager at the beginning of this month for personal reasons."
good,"Good pay for someone still in high school. Friendly, clean environment. Learned top notch customer service skills here. Working here is why my customer service standards are so high!"
good,"Work starts early in the morning at around 6. Ingredients and condiments are taken out of storage and refrigerator, frozen patties are placed onto racks and into the oven, avocados are peeled and sliced, omelettes are cooks, etc."
good,"Most of the people they hire at the specific cafe are nice. Management is either lazy, or more worried about meeting quotes than keeping employees happy. They are good about working with people with school schedules. Don't expect to stay until you're scheduled time."
good,The workers that I work with are good. Everyone is nice and kind to each other. Some of the managers are bad. They don’t really care about what we regular employees go through. If you call off a day they would barely put you on the schedule. They also schedule me outside my availability when I’m not available.
good,"As a first job, Panera Bread is a nice fit. There are multiple skills you can learn, and the pay is relatively high compared to other food service jobs."
good,"Everyone was nice and patient with me, my typical work day was cleaning, greeting customers, answering phone in order or any other questions needed. As well as taking orders and keeping the dining area clean and presentable. I enjoyed opening the store and seeing all of my regular customers, and having a good routine down every shift to make it a enjoyable experience."
good,The workplace is great but there could be better employees and better managers as well. The environment is great when working with people that take their job seriously but when you work with slackers it is a bad experience.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Everyone yelled out my name when I came to work.  I always felt appreciated by the other employees their.   It was a fun place to work and i really enjoyed my time their..
good,"Panera is a decently nice place to work, the one main downside is their managers, some are rude and impolite to their employees. I had several issues with them."
good,"The managers are overall good when it comes to training but as far as working with you on changing your hours, they are a bit sloppy. The energy amongst the crew as a whole can be a bit sloppy at times but with time they get better."
good,working at Panera bread in EastLongmeadow has many benefits like easy promotions and competitive pay and there are many things to do to keep you busy. only problem is management needs to be on the same page
good,I would like to see more advancement opportunities. The food was awesome and I enjoyed the variety of choices. Some of the employees embraced the Panera family spirit while I found later that a lot of the newer associates did not. Management was great at first also and over time has not been as good.
good,They don’t even tell you if you fired or not they just won’t put you on the schedule then when you text them they’ll leave you on read and won’t even give you a explanation to why you fired🤷🏾‍♀️
good,"I love the place for the most part. I do however believe that there should be more structure in the staff, and scheduling. As well as responsibility from the managers. Overall, I feel as though we should be paid more as cashiers considering we take on numerous tasks all at once."
good,"I’ve worked at two different Panera’s. One corporate and one was franchise, and yes it was a big difference. The cooperate cared about the people, cared about the customers, upheld Panera standards, and prioritize your time. They were very organized. Well franchise, it’s exactly what it says. It’s just like a normal fast food restaurant, little pay, limited hours, not much structure, management is ok  But I will say I had a good experience working at both. Both have drawbacks so what you’ll expect is it’s better than a fast food restaurant but around the same pay, you’ll get flexible hours like most fast foods  and you get to wear jeans and a polo. Mostly for the young and in schoo"
good,"Panera is a good company to work for but I feel they give way too much towards the lbgt unit, i'm probably not even spelling it right, there are clicks also as with every company. but remember I've been in the workforce for over 50 years so I have been, seen, and heard it all. if a person wants an honest living then go to work for Panera."
good,Dont like how they cut hours but others then that its a good company to work for the mangement is nice the food is good. But how they cut people hours i dont like
good,"I have worked at Panera for over 3 years and have never once gotten any type of recognition for something. Even as small as a pin for my hat that we are supposed to get when a customer compliments us to a manager. I’ve never gotten employee of the month, even during the 6 months I was working almost full time, and felt like I was cleaning things other people would look at and leave."
good,Delivery drivers don't make enough money for Panera to be their only job. Panera expects people to tip (some don't or they don't tip much) so delivery drivers spend whatever money they get into gas.
good,"I loved working at Panera Bread. It’s friend & family-oriented. You grow to love your associates and also build bonds with regular customers. That are big on accuracy which is a great trait to have in a fast food company. It actually helps with your attention span and listening skills. Also, helps you build your work ethic because, it’s fast past as well as multi-tasking."
good,"I worked as a delivery driver and I enjoyed the people I worked with but I only worked 4 hours a day 5 days a week and got paid poorly and only made a few bucks a day from tips. I told my manager I wanted to be a cashier or work on the line instead and the only position he offered me was opener cashier, meaning I’d have to be there at 5am everyday but then he was hiring new people for normal shifts."
good,"I love working for this company, the team building and time they have for training is great. The management and communication could use a lot of improvement. The job isn’t difficult and there’s always someone to help if you’re struggling."
good,I worked at panera for over two years and for the most part it was great but after a while i didn't see any opportunities to advance and the management had slightly declined.
good,"Great opportunities for growth and development.  Manager level compensation is average with industry.  Associate level compensation is below average.  This makes staffing the cafes very difficult.  Very face pace environment.  Panera's cafe's have a lot of moving parts to manage at once.  Catering, Cafe Operations, Delivery... ect"
good,"Now don't get me wrong, I hated my job because of the customers and nonstop cleaning and running around I had to do. On paper I was a cashier but I also would switch some shifts as a Table Runner. That being said, my colleagues were amazing, I loved all my managers, and I honestly miss everyone. The pay was low for me, which is why I think it is good as a first job thing, and there wasn't much beneficial discounts. But the environment made work livable and worth it. I would actually go back, but probably as a full time position for better benefits, or as an overnight baker so I can avoid rabid customers."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Personally i loved working here, the people are all very nice, but I need to be able to afford living and have benefits so i left the job because it doesnt pay much. I spent more on gas to get there."
good,It helped a lot with my personal growth as a person. I do believe I learned from this job about how to work well with others along with the routine of customer service. I constantly had an interaction with someone whether it be a co-worker or a customer on my usual shift.
good,I was a day Baker for a year and a half and I loved it. Once that position was eliminated I hated the overnight job. It wasn’t for me. If you’re a overnight person that doesn’t mind working alone then it might be a good fit for you
good,You get good discount if you work there. You have to be nice with customers whether they are wrong or right. Nice place and nice inside decoration. Most people are friendly.
good,"Panera is a great company to work for. Ive never had an issue with the management, they train you, they pay you a good amount of money. Fast paced, plenty of things to do around there, barista, cashier, line cook, etc. I was never bored. Treated well."
good,Make sure you are hard working and it is very easy job and relaxed. I think anyone that would apply and would get the job would love it. We are family at Panera Bread
good,"Panera is a fun place to be as a teen looking to get started in the workforce. There is so much diversity in their employees and you get to meet so many different people being customer-facing. Benefits did not exist for part-timers at the time, but the pay was pretty decent for a first job."
good,"I have worked for Panera for about 4 years total and while I love my coworkers and the management, nothing ever changes.Raises are few and far in between and take forever to actually be applied. Everything is constant, despite menu changes.Perfect job for teens and first time job seekers but don't think Panera will allow you to live the life you want after high school."
good,"For the work that is expected, the pay is marginal.  You work by yourself and that may be a pro or con. As long as the work is done you are able to work in your own style."
good,Great workplace and the management was always understanding and willing to work with me when needed help especially in the beginning and really good culture they had there and were always welcoming.
good,"Would usually be busy most the time. Learned a few new ways to make food, what to add in stuff. Management was awkward. Some would be nice other would be mean. Hardest part was closing the place. Most enjoyable was making the food."
good,"Got hired right on the spot, easy system, picked up everything quickly, employees were very nice and fun, managers were good, worked with my school schedule, got to take home pasties during closing, amazing food discount."
good,It was okay for a minute i made a lot of friends working there and enjoyed being around the people i worked with. Its a great environment really clean and organized but they will let you go without telling you.
good,It was a great experience and a nice job. They do ask for more than what you get paid when you first start out. The job is more so for part time or if you are in school.
good,Managers are easy to work for as long as you do your job. Hours are flexible and they work with me when I need time off. Most employees are friendly and work well with everyone.
good,"I am currently working for the company and I say that if you are a hard worker. You can make good money there. Be aware that depending on the location management, working there can either be a breeze or a struggle."
good,"The place pays well and overall is a good first job, but it can have really poor management at times and the schedule is very unkempt at times. It’s a very diverse work place tho."
good,Good for high chool kids. Super easy work. You can advance as long as you show the work. Managers work like slaves but the coworkers make it worth it.
good,"Its a fun job, reliable for hours. its prety quick paces when your short staffed. Some customers are very rude , but its helped me with my patience problem. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers find new items to try, or helping them save money when they have a MyPanera card."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"For the work you are doing to only be paid minimum wage is unfair especially if you stay with them long term. Management is okay, but could be better. There are certain situations they do not handle appropriately."
good,"Panera is a very good company if you are mistake free. If you get caught with any mistake, you will be set back a lot. Management is very good though but they are very young and very likely will not stop drama quick enough. The best part I would say is the people you'll meet in the company."
good,I love working for Panera. I have been an employee for over 10 years and truly believe it to be a quality employer. I have nothing but good things to say and hope to remain with then from some time longer!
good,"Loved the experience, new friends and the food but the hours and minimun wage were not enough to manage a household. There is little room for growth within the business as well."
good,"The job is an amazing experience for a person that has never had a job before , if you are a teenager they don’t give that many hours this is not a job to make a living off"
good,As far as working there it's a fun and clean environment. Working there for the closing position is a Hassel theirs only one closer for all three stations.
good,"Customers get annoying and it pays minimum wage, which is too low based on what tasks I have to do but it can be worth it if you work with the right people."
good,"I think Panera bread as a company is fairly alright. However I think the idea that corporate wanting every Panera bread to have the same set up, hours, and/or produce is a bit foolish. Some Panera breads are busier and some aren't as much. Due to recent changes in the company the expectations have doubled but the amount of time to get things done as not. Not receiving more time to complete this tasks or more pay since are work has increased a fair amount has made working there a challenge. If you are not capable of handling high stressed and fast paced work environments I wouldn't recommend this job."
good,St Louis bred co is a clean and relaxed company where everyone works hard and does their best to satisfy the customers. The management is top notch and took care of their employees.
good,When I started working there and to this day everyone has been extremely nice to me and other new comers. It’s a great job for someone interested in working in food.
good,"I liked working there and interacting with the customers, just like with my Starbucks jobs, but I had a difficult time learning their cash register. The previous manager laid me off less than a month of my getting hired and didn't want to invest the time to teach me how to learn their system nor help me get properly trained."
good,"Panera Bread is a good company to work for, but are in need of better management. When trying to put in my two weeks notice, because I could never get as many hours as needed and had to start school soon anyways, I was ignored. For over three weeks my manager dodged my request and it wasn't until I resent it that i finally got a begrudged ""Ok"""
good,Great environment but there is always somebody not doing their job. So it’s up to you to pick up the slack or not. There is constant turnover in management and the people that are in management are incompetent.
good,I am a delivery driver and I would say it is a pretty chill work environment with some cool managers. I get paid 5 while delivering plus tips and 8 while inside. It can get pretty boring though when it is really slow and they will end up making you do a whole bunch of miscellaneous stuff but its not hard and makes the time go by sometimes till an order comes in. the tips are OK like you will get a big one here and there but don't expect anything huge so it is definitely a gamble sometime but still can make some good money about 12-15 an hour but don't forget it uses up your gas so thats were some of that money goes.
good,Relationships with coworkers and management tend to be good.  Mostly a relaxed environment compared to other food service jobs.  Management works hard to take into account your personal life and needs and works with you to find a schedule that works for you.
good,Panera is a good job for someone who is willing to interact with customers on regular basis. the work environment was fast paced and had fair opportunities to advance.
good,I really enjoyed the staff because the people there are great to work with once everyone is on the same page working as a team and not as individuals.
good,Always moving! Learned to perfect my customer service skills. Management means well but not always comes off that way. Workplace culture is awesome. The hardest part about the job is moving heavy racks filled with lots of baked goods. The most enjoyable part of the job is the employee discount and amazing coworkers you can meet while working here.
good,"I worked at Panera for 4 years, I was able to advance within my position from a cashier to a baker, which came with a pretty good pay raise. Even if you stay in the cafe side, lots of employees have the opportunity to move into management. "
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"I enjoy working at Panera, but there are times when I feel very worn out.  It is a very fast pace workplace.  The hardest part about the job is staying on my feet for hours on end."
good,"It's a great starter job or is a great job if your in college and you need something as part time and fast paced!!"
good,"Panera has a great work environment, it’s fast paced but a lot of fun to interact with others and make food. I would of stayed longer if it wherent for other better job opportunities open up for me."
good,They give employees discounts on meals. They have a very flexible scheduling chart. It's easy to request days off. They work with you on last minute requests the best they can.
good,"Most managers and coworkers are nice. Was told when hired they had a no jerk policy, which was mostly true. Much better workplace than my last job."
good,Panera is not a bad job but it is also not the job you want if you are looking to move up in the work force. There are not many advancement opportunities and the pay is okay for a college student.
good,"Panera Bread was definitely a good place to work at, especially for my first job. I think that everyone should work in the service industry at least once so that they can truly appreciate the amount of work involved. "
good,"I liked working there but the one manager hated me for some reason and when she became in charge of scheduling, she started scheduling me for times that she knew I would not be able to make it."
good,"Worked here for 3 years and it gave me great experiences! The customers are difficult at times so it gives you really great people skills. The job is fairly easy, but gets stressful at times."
good,I don’t suggest anyone work here. The managers don’t really care. Employees are slackers.  Didn’t get many hours even though my hours were flexible. I wasn’t given the right pay for all the work I did also pay was horrible. But as a my first job it could’ve been worst
good,Working at Panera is an experience in and of itself.  Working with a diverse and hands on crew and staff is fun and rewarding.  It is a serious job and position without being overbearing.
good,"As a delivery driver It was fine. Would spend most of the time on the road making deliveries to customers. When I didn’t I would be doing dishes or cleaning tables. You can’t really advance much with this job, but it’s a great job for college kids or if u just need some side income. Management for the most part was good. U won’t get rich, but it’s good for a short period of time:"
good,the job can be very fast. especially when lots of orders come through. the managers are cool. the hardest part of the job is probably drive thru. I learned how to make certain foods on the menu. it was great and still is.
good,Panera was a fun place to work and it really allowed for me to understand the processes and how to strive for goals with in a limited time frame. I was very thankful for the experience to learn all of the processes and to help everyone achieve the team goals.
good,"I started as a low paid employee. After being there for a few years, there was no real benefits coming my way and there was no real incentive for me to grow within the company. I took pride in my job but could not survive on the little pay."
good,"clock in, get delivery equipment for driving, take order from cafe to house then head back to cafe"
good,Working at Panera Bread has given me opportunities to grow as an employee and learn how to become a hard working one. I learned that building connections with people can make a workplace a lot smoother.
good,"This job can be physically demanding at times as you are required to be on your feet for several hours during one shift."
good,I was a college student during the time of working here. It had a good work pace. The pay and hours were good. My only problem was my work schedule conflicting with my school schedule
good,Working at Panera is okay. Managers are flexible with the hours. Pay is a little low atleast when I was working there. You do get discounts on your food but only if you work that day.
good,Food is always amazing without a doubt. Everyone there is always so kind and full of positive energy and willing to help you in every way they can. Never had a negative experience dining here or working here.
good,"A typical day can range from laid back to extremely busy. I thrive on busy because I enjoy staying active. I worked drive through, which is basically those who can manage themselves. I enjoyed my co-workers and managers as they all put in effort as a team. It was enjoyable because of the teamwork aspect as I get along with almost anyone."
good,"It was a good place to start off, as a first job. I learned a lot in customer service and how to deal with unhappy customers. It's easy but very tiring and stressful. Some managers tend to talk in third person instead of being straight up and would take things out on workers when it wasn't our fault which I found unprofessional."
good,"As my first job I was surprised by the friendly management. As I progressed through my career I began learning more and more skills and traits at Panera. However, I started feeling that I was underpaid for the work I performed."
good,"If I didn't need more money, I probably wouldn't be searching for other Work. Management is awesome, the Associates are awesome to work with, and the customers are worth serving."
good,"I started at Panera as a normal crew member, then worked my way up to trainer and barista of the store. Once they realize you are willing to work hard and train well they will give you the hours you request or deserve."
good,"Working anywhere can be stressful. Feeling underappreciated, overworked, agitated and frustrated with little advancement can be a part of any job. I personally enjoy working at Panera but feel that I can do more, offer more and hopefully be compensated more."
good,"Advancement is almost nil, pay is minimum and raises are inadequate. Great place to work if you are a student just needing some money here and there. Most people are undervalued and even the hard workers don't get paid very well. I know it's a ""cafe"" and everything is based on customers but those with a lot of knowledge and training should be equally compensated for their dedication."
good,"I overall enjoyed my time with Panera Bread. However, they are NOT a company to work for if you are wanting a work life balance. I would recommend this company to anyone wanting to get into hospitality as a start."
good,"If you can put up with long hours on your feet, management that is slightly disorganized, and trying to sort out solving issues on your own, this work environment would be great for you."
good,I worked there for over two years and I eventually moved up to an associate trainer. I was there from the start of my Jr. year in high school until my freshman year of college. They were flexible for the most part but were not meeting my requirements for school. I was over worked and scheduled too many hours and found it increasing difficult to juggle a full time job and full time schooling efficiently.
good,"Management was helpful and patient. Panera became a second home, the staff was friendly and understanding. Hours were flexible. The pace is fairly fast which led to high stress."
good,This is a good job for someone who likes to stay moving and likes the stress of a fast paced environment. It was a really good experience for me while going to community college.
good,"Panera Bread was my first part-time job my senior year of high school. It is a very welcoming company, and each store has its own unique vibe and culture. Pay was modest but always an opportunity to learn more."
good,"Company is alright. Needs to pull through on promises,(becoming manager, raises, improvements), however a good opportunity to obtain experience and maintain ethical work habits."
good,"- days were pretty busy which made them go by a lot faster. "
good,I worked here over summer before going back to school and it was great. I only left because of school but i definitely recommend it as a summer job for flexible hours.
good,I've learned how to interact with the public and co-workers.  Team building skills are more enhanced.  Working as a multi-tasking environment has helped me appreciate what I do.
good,"Overall Panera Bread has taught me a lot about myself. I loved the employees and even the customers.  It was a very fun place to work, the employees loved one another and fulfilled the everyday goal of providing customer service."
good,Working at Panera Bread was a good experience and I enjoyed the people that I worked with. Sometimes Panera would get a little intense during lunch hours of the day and it required fast pace working. But overall it was a good job.
good,"While Panera as a whole has a great culture, the Danbury Cafe and many others in the district are lacking in warmth. The culture is to have a warm friendly atmosphere for guests and employees operating on their number one rule no jerks. However, the Danbury Cafe is often surrounded by a tumultuous work environment causing employees to be stressed in ways that should not be existent for a glorified fast-food establishment."
good,"Panera Bread is a good stepping-stone job. It has allowed me to develop leadership and customer service skills that are applicable in most careers, which I definitely think are my best takeaways. I left Panera for a few reasons. Most notably, the pay is awful. I worked at my location for a little over a year and saw scores of talent walk out due to not being compensated enough for their work duties. Work at Panera is stressful. Even line workers have t deal with angry customers and it definitely breaks some employees, The management was nice and did their best but scheduling errors were frequent, which also drove many good employees away. Aside from pay, I am leaving because I am done with the food-service industry. Working at Panera reinforced that it is definitely not for me. I like the company`s clean food and daily doughnation though."
good,"At this panera, there's always something to do. It was one of the busiest ones, during it's lunch hours and dinner times. You don't know multitasking until you've worked here: dealing with customers' orders, keeping your area sanitized, dealing with unsatisfied customers, all while trying to keep everyone else's orders out in under a timely manner and keeping them satisfied. It was definitely stressful, but having the right team, made it a lot smoother to run during those crazy hours. Many times, you'd go over your stay because of it, and it became the usual, but that's about it. It was just always busy."
good,"The managers were kind and thoughtful, the work wasn't hard. I would recommend for a student or part time work. working there you receive half-off meals and 30 minute breaks."
good,Panera is a great company to work for. It has it’s perks like competitive pay and bonuses. The company cares deeply about customer satisfaction not matter what.
good,"i learned how to communicate well with the customers, and how to multitask."
good,"Not a bad plAce to work if you don’t mind over night shifts, and getting burned a lot. It was overall very fun and easy. Management is very nice but stern on what they are looking for."
good,I loved this job. I wanted this to be a full time career. Unfortunately I was unable to continue when I relocated across the country. There was always something that had to be done. If you weren't on your toes then you were getting kicked out the door.
good,Management and staff are very friendly and helpful. Very clean and fresh place to work. Never had one complain from working. Hours are usually distributed evenly and you are always guaranteed 20-30 hours a week
good,The work environment was very welcoming and nice . The customers were great. Spacing and working accommodation was very good and manager treated us well enough. Even though some task was more then others
good,"Very fast paced fun atmosphere with other employees. But managers could improve on communication a bit. And need to give more hours to employees. Overall, not the best place to work, but not the worst either."
good,Unless you are in Management this is a great position as a part time job or someone recently graduating high school or looking for something part time while working full time or putting theirselves through college
good,i took the position temporarily. My managers were awesome. The Panera bread company makes sure your'e comfortable to where its unity amongst all of the employees.
good,"I will say this. It is really easy to move up with this company if you care and apply yourself. I went from an associate to an assistant manager in under 3 years. However as Panera tries to move forward with technological advances and fancier, healthier ingredients the workload has become insane for associates as well as managers. The job is not what it was when I started 4 years ago."
good,"I really enjoyed the fast paced environment. The type of people that work on our team are wonderful and I love all of our customers. It is however, just an hourly job and there isn't really much opportunity for advancement."
good,This place is great for working on team work. Buikding customer relations. The pay cycle sucks as its bi weekly. Bennifits are not good either. Advancment if you want
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Everytime i step in there I feel welcome like i am appreciated in Panera. The environment is relaxing, organized and pleasurable. Day by day, they have taught me how they make there food such as Sandwiches, Salads and bakery pastry."
good,"-There's a calm in the store when I get there."
good,This is usually a fast paced job and you have to work together to make things move along smoothly.  It gets hot in there and you may not get a break sometimes.  The hardest part of the job is the heat and the busyness.  The most enjoyable part is the people I worked with.
good,"There isn't room for advancement.Very poor choices in the hiring process.Very poor choices in advancement.No employee moral.Upper management doesn't give anything to their employees to lift or maintain moral.No holiday parties,etc.Not the cleanest restaurant"
good,"Great place to work if you're just starting out. Job can be very stressful during peak times or random busy moments and every position has different stresses unique to that position. If someone from the team isn't there to fill a certain position, it falls on everyone else to pick up the slack. Probably the most enjoyable part of this job is the people I work with because they make it more tolerable."
good,I enjoy management and the customers. Flexible hours and overall relaxed environment. Management is there for you when needed and the rest of the staff is also enjoyable
good,Good for high school and college students that likes a flexible schedule and willing to work with you. That's all I have to suggest for working at this company
good,"60% food discount, flexible hours, usually a great work staff, fun place to work,"
good,Long hours and more than five days a week. Minimal support from upper management. Employees are great and so is the culture. Clean and friendly place to work
good,Overall I like working at Panera. It has its ups and downs just like any other job does. It is a wonderful first time job to the kids who just turned 16 or is still in school part time.
good,Young staff that are easily to get along with. Quckin moving environment that goes through multiple changes throughout the year. Often has poor management due to the staff they choose to promote.
good,Great my manager was just completely and utterly awful but everyone else was lovely and i had an overall great experience there. Plus their food was good so getting free food sometimes was nice.
good,I really like working at Panera Bread.this is all that I am willing to say at this time.  is this for employers to see? I am just curious as to why I can't go on with my job search.
good,This was a summer job and worked out great for the summer.  I made a lot of friends. I enjoyed working with customers and really learned a lot about how a restaurant operates.
good,"I worked on the morning shift. I was the second person to come in on the line. I cut the bread for the day and premade the projected number of sandwiches for the day. After that I would stock the line of all the fresh ingrediants we kept up front. In between completing orders for the breakfast rush. Clean up breakfast and re-stock, if needed, for lunch. I was mostly on salad station duty. I was fast and accurate. The hands-on training management provided really helped me learn my job and different positions very quickly. Co-workers were very supportive and helped me out alot as I went through my training and afterwards. Management was not always the easiest or the most pleasurable to work with. To be honest, there really wasnt a hard part about this job. It was a challenging and rewarding job. I really enjoying the discount food. Panera uses nothing but the freshess ingrediants thay are hard washed, cut and measured by employees. The bread and all bakery items are baked fresh by the overnight and early morning bakers."
good,Panera Bread is a well run company with a good product.  Their compensation and benefits were very good in relation to other comparable concepts in the area.
good,At Panera bread you follow exact corporate rules and regulations. Wolf of opportunity for advancement within for management and training management. They strived on great customer service
good,"Very fast paced, high expectations with minimal return to employees."
good,"Panera has so many facets and moving pieces and it ask a lot of managers, which is fine, but it would be nice to be thanked or showed appreciation.  "
good,"Everything was great until our little franchise was bought by a much larger one.  Spent 12 years working for this company and I enjoyed the first 11.  "
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,All in all I would recommend  the job. The people are nice.  If you just do your job you get respected. I don't make a huge amount of money but that's just because I don't get good hours during school
good,Make sure you have on the proper work attire and follow safety precautions.
good,"* Typical day of work includes refilling bagel station, taking orders, and then going home."
good,"Paneras a great place for a first job, but people tend to get stuck there. pay isnt great either our the opportunities. its really just a good place to start off. after abut a year or 2 if you dnt move up you shluld really consider moving on."
good,"I worked there during high school. It was a good job to have under my belt during that time. I did learn a lot, like making the food and cashiering. Overall, the job was a good stepping stone."
good,Great place for working student since they are very flexible with your schedule. Atmosphere can be stressful and it is very fast-paced environment. Can get more hours if you ask for it.
good,I used to be a great manager at McDonald’s and they would give me a chance at panera Bread. I love talking and helping customers out. I love being part of a team.
good,Fast pace environment. Probably the busiest panera in West Michigan. Was not a fan of my boss but the work itself was not too bad. Pay could have been better though.
good,Panera's atmosphere was great! I loved being in such a welcoming environment. The only issues I have are the pay and the hours. I was a sophomore in high school when I worked there and they wouldn't let me leave even if I was done. I would be stuck there until late hours waiting for another department to be done cleaning.
good,I love Panera as a company and hope to see them grow in the future. The store I worked at was unorganized compared to what I was accustomed to with my previous Employer. But we worked hard to get the store organized and I worked with a great team.
good,I enjoyed my time with Panera.  I enjoyed all the regulars as well as the staff.  I worked for 3 different Panera Bread's during my time there.  It is a very wonderful food service industry with high demand for food safety.
good,It was a great job to have in college as it provided a flexible schedule and a fun environment to work in. The managers were all very helpful in making the best of the work day.
good,"Will work with any schedule, but they do ask a lot for such little pay. Must learn 3 different stations before being promoted. Overall, a good company for a temporary job."
good,"Work at Panera Bread was sometimes very busy, but at the end of the day, I was working with some of the best coworkers I could call my friends even outside of work. I learned a lot about food preparation and up-keeping the workplace (both skills I am now able to apply outside of work), as well as how to work with many people at a single time."
good,"A typical day at work can range from relaxed to extremely stressful. The day was dictated by the amount of preparation done the day prior. I learned that teamwork is extremely necessary for the success of the store as a whole. Customer service is stressed above all else. The concept that the company is selling customer service along with the product is what drives the company forward. The hardest part of the job was preparing for and working through the lunch rush. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the people. Some customers come in with a chip on their shoulder, but there were other customers that became family."
good,"Working at Panera Bread was a very interesting journey. Starting at 6 in the morning, the breakfast rush begins. Then the transition from breakfast to lunch is the worst. People are ordering literally everything on the menu. And then the deliveries start pouring in. It's an extremely fast paced environment. If you aren't fast, they will eat you alive. The management team was never on the same page. One manager would say something, but another would say something else. Nothing ever really got accomplished."
good,It worked well with my school schedule. It was an easy job to get the hang of. I was able to manage my time with this job. Majority of the time things ran smoothly.
good,panera was a good company to work for but when I requested to withdraw from benefits I was not allowed this played a huge roll in why i left the company
good,"it was a fast paced environment at times and downtime had many things to get done, and very customer service oriented. I had to leave the position as I was offered a position in my field of study."
good,all in all working there was interesting- I worked there when it was just starting to get large and there was no advertising. I wonder now how they are able to maintain quality under the much larger scale
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"The job was typical for that of a food service position.  I learned how to multitask on orders, memorize dish compositions, and to communicate efficiently with other team members to keep up a smooth, effective work flow.  Management provided an experienced and structured work environment that encouraged growth."
good,"A typical day was stressful most of the time, peak hours are crazy. I learned a lot about responsibility, time management, and multitasking. My General manager was amazing, super understanding, fun, and all around great person. The hardest part of the job was keeping everything in time, for example: making the food in under 3 minutes during peak time, sometimes there was low staff, sending out food in time, etc. The best part was my coworkers."
good,It's not a tough place to work. Management is pretty thorough. Employees are usually cooperative when it comes to performing certain tasks that a supervisor or manager would ask to do. The job is pretty simple to do but it's really fast paced at peak hours.
good,I’ve worked here for 2 years and I’ve made some close connections. I’ve learned a lot as well. However the clealiness is enforced randomly and there was basically no training for my position I took. Sometimes managers yell at you for no reason because the job is preach done or they will start slacking off. I feel like I’m not being paid fairly because I continue to get almost 25 cents less than people who were just hired with the some lack of experience and of the same age. They usually listen to schedule changes but if they mistake the wrong day they’ll blame it on you even if you asked them in advanced. Overall it was a good first job but I’m just done.
good,"Great environment, everyone is nice, managers are pretty laid back but there's been a lot of drama, communication issues, and taxes are very high on the paychecks"
good,It was a great work place just wish I had gotten more hours. Very strict with attendence. Managers are really nice. They have very flexible schedules.
good,Good workplace and environment with encouraging employees. The pay was worth the work and the job wasn't cheap like other food restaurants. Great part-time job!
good,"I became a manager very quickly in the company and I really loved their values! Your co workers are great and really make any food place worth it. Management was okay pretty disorganized, the associated kept the place together."
good,"Fun place for a great meal. Very family friendly, busy place at times but it’s all In all a great place to go if your looking for soups, sandwiches, and a good time"
good,"Great team environment, where employees enjoyed working together and many friends were made. Depending on the managers at the time you either felt like they were working with you or you were being unnecessarily micromanaged. If you dedicate the time and effort, advancement into managerial positions is very possible."
good,"nice place to grow if you want the restaurant business, not for everyone, good pay. but very stressful, hectic days, early mornings. leave early though"
good,"Busy from the moment you start till the moment you end.  It is organized chaos and you have to be on your toes.  Lots of things happen last minute and then the day is over.  I would market the product, execute it, deliver it and recap."
good,"Other then coworkers treating me rudely and management not taking care of it. I enjoyed my time working at Panera."
good,panera was always a fast paced soon as u get there until the day is done u always had something that had to be done it was fully staaffed so never short handed even managers would get down and dirty when it was called for the managers cared the staff was a team
good,Working here was a good first job until they changed me to what I was not hired for. I wish minimum wage was not so low there because I wouldn't enjoyed it way more.
good,"The Job its self is good for getting used to fast paced environments, in the morning (between 6:30am and 9:30am) our store usually had 2 dozen or so people who wanted breakfast. Most wanted it to go occasionally there were people who wanted a bagel pack (about 12 bagels and cream cheese) which I was also in charge of making. Lunch was the busiest part of the day with lines out the door. You will wear your voice out doing Panera’s sales pitch and re-reading orders to confirm them. By 2 to 3 Things would slow down a bit but you could you usually count on a dozen more people coming in at once after 3."
good,"I loved my co-workers. I enjoyed working with them, and whenever management didn't bother us, I felt the work day ran very smoothly. I knew the regulars, their drink orders, my job tasks, and enjoyed keeping a positive attitude. I worked their a little over a year, and sadly it took them a year to finally give me a raise. I hadn't even realized they weren't paying me equally to some of the other hires, even new hires until we were talking about it one day over lunch. Apparently many were getting offered to start at 9 even 10 dollars, and they had started me at 8.25 and hadn't offered me a raise until I requested it. Luckily they gave me a dollar raise. The managers were often rude, and if they were having a bad day, so was everyone else. There was only one manager that was truly very kind and actually cared it seemed. Standing on my feet for long periods of times were causing me plenty of pain. I would cry after coming home because my back, and I wouldn't even be able to walk after taking my shoes off."
good,"I worked here when as a 16 year old boy in my junior year of high school and I felt that our general manager liked everyone, but not really me. One of the managers was so awesome. She was so kind, funny, and made you feel so good that you wanted to do the extra tasks she would ask you to complete and she's the reason I stayed there so long."
good,"Panera is constantly busy! I was able to work on my customer service skills, time management, and communication with other team members. I was able to build rapport with the regulars and engage in meaningful conversation with other customers."
good,"Good place for a part time job or baker. If you choose to advance try you hardest because outside hiring is common for higher positions. Good food, nice discount, and easy to make friends."
good,"With knowing all my co-workers, and going through a lot with fluctuating management and customers, we became close and my co-workers and I would have each other's back. It was amazing to know someone would swoop in when you're running behind on putting out food, or you just need a little more help."
good,"The hours while they are good and the pay is good,you never know if you are going to get 5-what ever amount of hours you were hired for. Your scheduling manager can make or break what hours you make."
good,"I cannot deny that my Nampa branch of Panera was fun and great, and my coworkers are family, but management tends to overwork employees constantly with no regard as to whether they're pushing the limits too far or not."
good,"it really depended on the flow of the customers of their wasn't lots of customers then the work flow be of course slow. However, it was bust it was fast paced."
good,Corporate has a strong presence within each cafe. Manager needs to stay on top of employees to make sure corporate values and beliefs are carried throughout
good,"I love working here, it's a blast. Most the managers are amazing. A few bad apples but that's ok. The best makes want to live better. I need more money. They don't pay us enough in my opinion"
good,It's a great place to work at but it is extremely busy almost every day and if you can't handle a fast paced environment it's not the place for you orders have to he prepared in 3 minutes or less and things can pile up quick due to how busy the place gets but if you can handle that then it's the right place for you.
good,"Working there was good, the customers are great and the associates were nice. Management does the best they can to make sure the store is running smoothly. I loved being around the customers and the discount was nice too."
good,"its great when you have the plethora of fun interesting employees around, but the management can really bring all that down and make the work day boring, slow, and overall unenjoyable."
good,"Panera is a great place to work, although with a very high volume of business the team and the manager guiding the team must stay above water in attitude and work together to prevent bottlenecks. It is very hard to play catch up with serving the customers when that ball begins to roll all hands need to be on deck and ready."
good,My job experience at Panera Bread was not best. Management did not do too well of a job. It seemed as if they did not care. Management also tended to be mean. The employees were a pleasure to work with.
good,"baking all kinds of breads bagels and lots of pastries, I learned a lot because different breads are cooked at different temperature, workplace was very clean and we made lots of coffee, staying out of other peoples way, there was a few of us in small work area, baking I love to bake."
good,It was okay working here but my manager called me a dirty Mexican and still has a job so. other than that i have no complaints. The food is kind of a rip off though.
good,"As a first job its great. Good supervision and support. My coworkers were great friends at the time, but the food industry was just not for me. I did appreciate the family oriented work environment as well."
good,To work at Panera was a nice job.Food perks and all.Management was not so great all of the time .Staff argued a lot and not everyone would put in the same effort.
good,"This company is a wonderful starter job.  They begin hiring at sixteen and allow for growth. Once you reach a certain level though, promoting higher than an associate trainer is very difficult.  Sometimes the actions that management takes does not seem fair, or in the best interest of the employees, and it seems that they intentionally make the work harder for the more reliable employees. If you show up for your job on time and do your best while you're there, it seems that they expect you to pick up other jobs and finish it for them, rather than make the original employee assigned to the task actually complete it. There are some amazing people that work in the cafes and you can make many friends while working there, but this is not a place for a long time career."
good,"The management is well above standard and they take pride in what they do. The associates working there are professional and hard working. Everybody is treated with the up most respect; From the associates, to the customers."
good,"Panera is okay, but that didn't take the employees life's into consideration as if we don't have a life our side of work. It's good, but I wouldn't work there again"
good,"There are really no hard parts about this job. It's easy to learn here and if you do what you're told, you'll be well liked and get raises. It's easy to do well in this job. As long as you're good at costumer service."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,I kept the food cost down. I made should the store was ready to open at 6am. I prep all the food from meat vegetables salad coffee smoothies cookies bread. Panera bread is a very fast pace job. Very stressful as well.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job are the customers. The hardest part of my job was conflicting views with management. A typical day at work involved prepping and preparing for the morning shift.
good,You walk in and once you clock in you are exected to work. The way panera works you have to do your part of the day gets much more difficult. The co workers are really what make the job worth it.
good,"Panera bread was an enjoyable work environment, I usually looked forward to work mainly because of the people I worked with. I believe my location had a great management and staff which I believe matters most. Not only did we care about each other but we cared about our customers."
good,"it is a fine place to work, i had a lot of responsibility that i did like and the people are great to work for. I had to do almost everything, I ran the shift took care of the store and money handling."
good,"The management at Panera Bread is great. They are very kind and very understanding towards the employees. Unfortunately, the hours always fluctuate even though I had to asked to not go over 35 hours and go under 30 hours and they cut hours for no reason or because summer workers come back and they don't prioritize the employees that work there year round."
good,Panera Bread is a pretty good company.  Of course it has its' ups and downs but what company doesn't.  Once you are able to get a great staff of managers and associates to work together as a team then Panera really becomes a family.
good,"This position is nicer than a fast food environment, but is still fast food. Includes a fast paced environment, taking orders, bussing tables, working different shifts, and standing for the entirety of the shift."
good,"Have worked at Panera Bread for a little over a year.  Your shifts vary in hours...usually I had 2-3 shifts per week equaling about 10 hours a week."
good,"Fun and upbeat environment. some of the managers are just stuck in a job that they don't want to  be in, it has motivated me to move on. This job has also helped me create small talk out of thin air."
good,The work environment was felt relaxed and social. Working on the food line requires a brisk pace. Management was friendly and helpful. I would recommend this job to a high school or college student.
good,"Overall wasn't that bad of a place they would treat me good. I was apart of the Panera pro team to help open another café in Waco and train all the new people in cashier and production/barista .The café was good to its customers and really made people feel at home, staff and customers."
good,"Very nice environment to work in and staff is great. Good food and good discounts. During their busy seasons it gets incredibly stressful and lines out the door. They will beg you to stay past your shift. Ended up in overtime a lot. I was fine with it but I know many people were stressed and we had two people walk out during holiday season. Sometimes you won't get a break. They pay well, but a male colleague of mine who I helped train got paid more than I did when I had already been there half a year. Overall a good place to work if you're okay with very fast paced work."
good,Not my most favorite job. The pay was definitely fair for the work I did. Many chances to improve and move up. Shift managers were good. The district manager did his job well. Poor scheduling management. Very difficult to be put back on schedule after you took off for vacation. Very friendly environment to work in. Very clean. Plenty of downtime.
good,I learned the importance of clean food and the harm other food was doing to my body. I met a lot of wonderful people working there. I always had great hours and even better tips.
good,"If you're just trying to get some money, it's good, But if you're trying to make a career out of it, i wouldn't hold your breath. Granted, there is room to move up, but you gotta pay office politics.  It's a good gig if you're just trying to find something better. It's not too bad and at the end of the day you're getting good food to eat so idk."
good,"The job didn't pay very well and every time I asked for a raise I didn't get it. It was very stressful but it was a job and they're very desperate. The employees all gossip a lot, and all of the managers are smokers. It took me over a year of begging to be trained on all positions, and even then they wouldn't let me be a certified trainer to get another raise."
good,"Everyone works together to get things done, managers are very flexible and nice. A LOT of room to grow in the company and make more money. Only get discounts on days you work."
good,"Good company, as far as chain restaurants go. Don't expect tons of money, but the company does it best to take care of you. Great job for entry-level positions but advancement is a pain."
good,Panera standards are great when it comes to eating healthy and giving the guests a great experience. Panera is constantly changing for the better and trying to improve guest experience.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Great place to work, only got discounts on days worked. You begin to smell like the store, after working there you wont want to step foot in another one for a while."
good,"A typical day consisted of preparing the bakery for the morning, mid-day, and afternoon shifts. I learned all positions including dining room, bakery, barista, cashier, and line."
good,"Early mornings became my niche, setting up the bakery and having a smiling face for the people who came in early was great for me at this time in my life. managers were all super nice and helpful when getting know everything about the service. GREAT for a first job experience."
good,had some good days had some bad. learned a lot. free food was great. bad thing was no breaks though. lunches were always very busy so you have to be fast paced.
good,"The food there is great, and so are the people you work with, all mostly ranging in age. Some workplace dram as the co-workers are all in highschool or college, and the management is kind, but a little messy."
good,"My day starts with checking the food supplies for the day. If there is something low or missing, I would check the back freeze for what I need. Passing by the manager's office which is open and inviting for communication. After my area is prepared for the busy day, I would greet the employees and customers. Most of the employees are team members and our customers are our family and friends. I had to learn people's names and faces. Which could be daunting as we had sixty to hundred people per day. What put a smile on my face was the enviroment. Friendly, teamwork promoting coworkers that felt like age old friends. A manager was always working along side the coworkers. If something needed to be address, they had an office right there in the back."
good,Great place to start your first work experience. I've met great people and learned even more with customer service and food preparation. Prices are expensive though compared to what the workers are paid.
good,although the work environment is fun and the workers are nice the job of a freight person is quite difficult especially in a tight area. trying to work around others can get frustrating especially when you have such a short time period to finish your work.
good,"I made sandwiches and salads, cleaned, did dishes. The atmosphere of the job was great. Met a bunch of different people around my age at the time that went to different schools."
good,"The hours are long and there's hardly room to move up, though with the pay, management positions are a step down from catering. Takes its toll on your body, as like I said, the hours are long and the work is far from easy. *for catering positions only*"
good,I worked there for a year and I moved up in the company very fast. Nice people and good environment enabled me to learn new skills and sharpen them. I really liked my job.
good,Panera Bread is a great place for individuals looking for a first job. We are a fun and fast paced environment. Management works well with providing the best training.
good,"Coworkers and managers work to make every member feel welcome, great environment for fast paced work. Occasional ""benefits"" such as pizza parties as reward for service goal achievement."
good,A typical work day involved clocking in and working till or past when you were scheduled to work. Only problem I really had with the job was not getting time off that was requested months in advance.
good,"The work place was very professional. The managers however were very rude and didn't give many people the chance to move past what they started. I did like the co workers however, they were very helpful and respectful."
good,"Very quick pace. Must be able to think fast and work effeciently. Flexible hours, good management. Great starting job for anyone willing to work hard."
good,While I work there I wasn't given enough hours during the time I was there and the only positive was that I got a certain percent off on a purchase.  I do hope people have a better experience than I had.
good,"A typical day consisted  of quality checks, and constantly checking on the many different areas of production to make sure of quick and properly made products.  Food was verified and went out to the guest,  I learned how to balance many different systems and make sure we were producing efficiently and properly. The management was full of quality people and with ample opportunity to develop and seek out new talent.  The culture was one of embracing change.  The hardest part of the job was making sure we produced quality food in a quick and proper manner.  The best part of the job was our guest and our team members."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Same as any other food. "
good,Going in with a positive attitude will make you want to grow with the company i have learned so much in the 4 years that i have been with the company. I have chosen not to grow in the company because i have another job at the moment and i like to be able to dedicate my time there as well. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing returning customers with smiles on their faces knowing that we give them the kind of service that they enjoy.
good,Working here was alright as I can say I wish I made more money but can claim that I was able to get to college with 3000$ after working over 40hours per week for 4 months.
good,The job was close to my house and I was able to meet some new friends while I worked there. I didn't really see myself going anywhere with the company so I found something else that paid better.
good,"Clock in, stock and clean up. Close shop and open shop. "
good,Room for advancement but not a good work-life balance. Often have to go into work on days off or in evenings. Good opportunities for advancement. Fast pace environment.
good,It was nice while it lasted but it was a job that pays but I'm honestly more excited to pursue my future. A lot of positives and negatives but that is essentially life in a nutshell.
good,"I had worked in two different locations and had two very different experiences. The location in Green Bay WI was corporate owned and very professional. Fantastic management, team players and encouraged employees to want to move up in the company. "
good,"Throughout my time with Panera I had the opportunity to work a variety of positions. There is a lot of room  to move around and up, but only if you get good managers. The wrong ones make friends and chose favorites over hard-warking people and it turns into a high school social club. The right managers care about the restaurant and put a lot of effort into making customers the focus."
good,"awesome co-workers and managers. crazy shifts. busy schedule. great food. super fast paced job. with opportunity to move up! there's always something that will go wrong, but everything will still work out in the end."
good,I loved this job! The management staff are really caring and actually care about their employees. They take into consideration your needs and advancement opportunities are great!
good,I feel like when we they switched management it wasn't for me anymore. I feel they was not professional and they was not understanding. Other than that it's a good job.
good,Less personal problems with co-workers at the job. you know I didn't like how some of the managers would get upset with you not working up to there par. ( attitudes )
good,"It's not all Panera bread it's the one in river city marketplace that needs work. "
good,Fast paste work enviroment but fun place to work. You gain a lot of experience and there is multiple opportunities for positions at Panera bread. Hours worked can be difficult for some people.
good,Cool place to work. Cool people and great management when I worked there. Gets busy during lunch but if the team is lead properly then the day will go by fast and smoothly
good,"A typical day at work consisted of taking customers orders,making barista drinks, and serving and/or cleaning tables through lunch and dinner rushes and making sure the environment is safeand enjoyable for customers. The staff is amazing. Everyone is friendly and makes you feel ""at home."" The management is filled with smart, talented leaders who have awesome personalities. The hardest part of the job is dealing with some rude customers. Overall, i loved the relationships that were created with some coworkers."
good,"A typical day would be turning on the ovens and preparing everything you can so you can begin baking, like setting up yours breads and pastries on proper racks and trays. Something that I learned was how to multitask, operating two different ovens most of the time, you're constantly moving back and forth between the two amongst other task . As a night baker, your beside yourself most nights so keeping the managers informed if the is a problem is a MUST at ALL times. At the beginning of becoming a baker or even a baker's support, timing yourself to get done on time for the opening of the store would be the hardest part, it becomes simple after baking every day. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you finish baking and cleaning, the people start to come and they are excited and wanting to eat what you just baked. They get to recognize who you are and look forward to talking to you about your good job well done! You know you've done a get job if the regulars actively look for you every day!"
good,I like working here and I make decent amount of money but the management is not the best. I would love this job mainly as a part time job for now. If you pick the right locations you might get lucky
good,"- Getting the store set up for open and close, training employees, helping out where is needed."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Working at Panera was an opportunity that I do not regret. It was a fast paced environment, hard working but rewarding job. I learned about customer service, and what it means to be on a team. I was constantly pushed to be my very best even under the stress and demands of food industry. It got hard at times, when I did not agree with a manager or a co-worker. However that is one of the challenges I had to learn; to be able to work as a team always, even when we do not agree. Although my fellow co-workers and I had disagreements, they were great people in and out of Panera."
good,"They taught me some good cleaning skills, and people skills, other employees were good to work with. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to talk to people. The hardest part was management always pushed for us to talk more to the customers, I felt like I was bugging the customers."
good,"Panera is a great place to work. My coworkers and management are extremely nice and down to earth. We are extremely customer oriented and depending on who does the schedule, they are pretty flexible with your hours and off days, but as long as your availability is up to date you should be fine. My only issue is advancement within the company, it is not something is commonly discussed and i chat with people who have been there longer than I have ( 1yr 2mths ) and still have not received a promotion nor a raise, There is a career path posted, but not followed with the most deserving employees."
good,"Good place to start working, people are very warm an welcoming. Helpful to new hires an good food. Very clean as well. Good with working with schedules!"
good,"The experience at Panera Bread was grandiose. It helped me to grow as a person, and a leader. My coworkers were reliable, and went above and behind to help out customers."
good,"Collaborate with management over stock/bakery trucks, maintain panera bread culture, long hours due to employment turnover rates, collaborate with co-workers on excellent service."
good,"Management is very poor, if you tell them about a problem they brush it under the rug. Most enjoyable is the co-workers. What I have learned, good job if your in school but not if your trying to make a living."
good,"At the time I worked, Panera was understaffed. No matter when you started in the morning, the shift would end at 4. I signed up for part time, but got 40 hour weeks. Some of the managers and co-workers were fun to work with."
good,Typical day at work at the start my shift I make sure apron and name tag all right places. Then I will prep my line while orders are being made. Take out orders and also clean tables. I do this cycle over and over till my shift is over. I would say all my managers here were good but they all got fired. My co-workers were the best had great time and completed all work related activities efficiently.
good,Working for Panera Bread is a very fast paced environment. You need to be engaging and ready for every shift. The average lunch shift (12-1)  could serve up to 300 guests. As the General Manager you would lead a team of 5 assistant managers and up to 50 associates any given day. The  hardest part of the job is keeping staffing levels up to accommodate the business and the most enjoyable part of the job was satisfying thousands of different guests on a daily/ weekly basis.
good,"At Panera Bread, you receive a variety of different customers. Some will be regular customers and already know what they wish to consume. The managers are helpful in terms of flexibility in means of assistance if needed. My coworkers work as a team some are a little more knowledgeable than others . The hardest part was I found was the closing process, making sure everything is clean and accessible for morning shift but eventually, that became easier. I think the most enjoyable part of working at Panera Bread is meeting different people and being able to donate unconsumed bread to the local high school."
good,"The Company I Work For Is Really Nice, The Environment Is Clean And The Management Is Great! I Learn How To Interact With People. The Co-Workers Are Friendly And A Pressure To Work With. The Most Enjoyable Part Of The Job Would Be Meeting New People And The Fast Pace In The Work Place."
good,"my job at Panera was Cashier/ bus boy. the minute I can I would have to get my cash registrar ready and take the customers order on the kind of food they want. If a customer has a food allergy we would notify the prep food about the food allergy so it wouldn't be contaminated. if the front wasn't busy I would have to stock the fridges of product, clean the tables, take care of the trash, refill the beverages, and etc. it was a constant cycle that you have to be quick about."
good,good place to work I worked there for years never had a problem with any of the management they just promise too many things that they never do or they take a long time to do it.
good,Panera Bread is a great place to work. The employees are friendly as well as most of the management team. It is very fast-paced but if you get a little behind people are more then willing to jump in and help you. I enjoyed the relationships I was able to make there as well as being able to work with the general public. In the kitchen you do not feel cut off from the rest of the restaurant which is very nice and relaxing as well.
good,It was steadily busy on a typical day to day basis. I learned a lot about Panera and the company itself. Management was alright.Co-workers were easy to work with. The hardest part of the job is maneuvering on a busy line with a small amount of space. The most enojoyable part of the job is the food.
good,"Panera Bread is a good job. Work for me was always a little hectic. fast workplace. I was a cashier and a barista. We basically are the front of the restaurant. I handled cash transactions AND brewed coffee. Definitely broadened my multitasking skills. I learned a lot of new things I must say. My counting skills improved greatly, I was given more responsibility. I learned all of this fairly quickly because I love the place. Management was..okay. There was more than one, and I liked one of them. One of the managers was very lazy and didn't really follow the rules. He came in late a few times. He just wasn't a ""good"" leader in my eyes. Everyone there overall were very sweet and nice. I felt comfortable around them. The hardest part of being here would have to have been balance. Juggling two different sides. Making coffee, cutting bread, or at the register. Never a dull moment was the most enjoyable part."
good,i worked there for 7 years and never went there with the comp. i did a lot for them and i was never given any respect..i worked in the mornings and was there till late at night with only one break and i learned that the mangers would come and go all the time. the hardest part of the job was getting alone with the other crew members.
good,Great company to work for and the company is steadily growing and increasingly involving into a more health friendly company.
good,"This isn't too great sometimes the management can be a hassle to work with, but more often your teammates are the ones that make the job worth it and a fun place to be for the day."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Not the worst place I've worked, but wouldn't think of it as a long term career. Pay and hours are not bad, but the one I work for is a franchise so we don't get any benefits except for half off meals. Can be very boring at slow times and place seems to attract a very ""snooty"" and ""uppity"" kind of customer."
good,I worked as a barista and cashier here. I spent a lot of time dealing with customers and helping with whatever they needed. It could get very busy and hectic at times but overall the atmosphere was lively to be in. Management changed often which was very different for me.
good,"I acquired the basic job skills rather quickly and we had assigned drawers, unlike Batteries Plus Bulbs where you had separate logins, so you always knew why money just so happened to come up missing or appeared."
good,Liked working with staff and customers. Benefits not that great. Learned catering and barista which I enjoed  Owners were really nice and cared about their employees.
good,"Panera is a great place to learn how to work in a fast paced stressed environment, and learn to multitask. Co-workers will listen very often and they all work hard. This is not a fast track job where you will move up quickly. Progression is very slow. You will have to perfect your working area before being trained in other positions."
good,"The first Panera I worked for was awesome. My staff was very fun and outgoing, and they could really see the potential in others. They offered me a higher wage since it took a while to get me signed on after being hired, as well as free food. I loved working there."
good,"The managers were good about giving us breaks on time, but that was about it. As it was a new store, the management had been brought in from other places and this thus left a lot to be desired from them; many of the managers at my location are incompetent and have no business being managers."
good,"A Typical Day At work is VERY Busy and a lot of time consuming also organization but overall it alright and good. I've Actually learned alot i just wish that the managers and co-worker be more open handed with helping, without always asking if we pose to be "" team "" instead of criticizing and battering and sarcastic. The hardest part of Panera Bread is when the lunch rush come because you have to maintain everything like making sure you have all backups for your sandwiches and bread slice for the sandwich also maintaining cleansing having to change your gloves constantly due to customer having allergies . The most enjoyable part about my job is knowing that i made a sandwich or Panini the way the customer exactly how they want it and seeing their smile and appreciation ."
good,with Panera trying to stay ahead of the electronic ordering game. systems and processes are constantly changing. as well as the menu. It is tough to keep up.
good,"While working at Panera, I have gained leadership, customer service, communication, and money handling skills. A typical day consists of completing tasks like completing customers' orders or taking customers' orders in a timely manner while in the meantime, maintaining a clean and organized work environment. This also includes stocking food, and other products when availability of the item becomes low. The most enjoyable parts of my job is working with people I like working with and greeting and talking with new customers. The hardest part of my job however, is having to work with people that choose to not be productive at work and also do not work well as a team."
good,"I loved working here, the people and the guests were great."
good,"A typical day at work was coming in changing the coffee, making sure everything was stocked, and making sure everything was clean. I learned to be punctual and how to communicate. Management, some of the managers were very nice some were not but overall they were organized. My co-workers were okay some didn't do what they were supposed to others did like any typical work place. The hardest part of the job was that I had to do everything alone and it got very busy a lot of the time and it was a lot for one person to do on their own. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I got to take my 30 minute lunch break."
good,"A regular day at Panera started at five AM for me. I would get there and set up the line for day service. That included making breakfast for guests, and then later lunch. Most of the morning consisted of stocking. I learned about good organization skills, and proper stock rotation. The management at Panera Bread is by far some of the best I've ever seen. They are encouraging and hold strong everywhere they are needed. My coworkers were a team indeed. Where everyone tried to help each other where they could, in order to keep the team afloat. The most difficult thing, especially in the morning, was getting the line stocked. Because it was a busy location, a lot had to be done, in a small amount of time. My favorite part about working for Panera was my co workers, who were wonderful and supportive of each other."
good,"Working at Panera Bread has gave me the chance to juggle my personal life and work. The hardest part of the job is sometimes dealing with rude customers, the most enjoyable is being able to help new customers find what they are looking for."
good,I started working at Panera under different management and it was a fun place to work and I enjoyed it then most of our management left and the new management was mean and the vibe of the store changed.
good,"I did not mind working at Panera Bread, the managers were not all bad and the work was not hard, I was just not able to work my way up in the company and i felt like i should leave and pursue other opportunities."
good,The employees at Panera are like family.  There are times when the store got busy but we all worked together to get the job done.
good,My fellow co-workers are my family. We take of each other. I have received personal help from many of them on several occasions Management works with me on scheduling and getting through the day efficiently. I help my co-workers and they help me when we have busy days.
good,being able to meet the customers needs with a smile and working at a fast pace and learning many new skills being a new member and feeling welcomed like a family
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"greet costumer take orders, clean as needed.  Must work fact and accurately.  Drive thru you must complete all orders in 4 minutes or less"
good,Fun place to work with supportive management. Mainly about the numbers.The most enjoyabale part of the job was working alongside my colleagues. They are great people.
good,One of the things I enjoy the most is working in a team environment. Team work is very important in a job to make it run as smooth as possible. I also want to work for a company where I can grow so possibly get into a management position.
good,"The environment was very enjoyable, sometimes I forgot I was at work. The company does some great things for the community and charities. While I was baking we didn't really have on-site managers, we had to be self-sufficient. There was a lot of pressure for the bakers, but we were never left helpless. You become very close to your coworkers, because in total there were only three bakers staffed and there were 2-3 bakers scheduled every night. My only complaint was that there was no way to have personal time off, even for pre-planned family events or emergencies. We were always understaffed."
good,"This company is like a family in most ways. We learn to work with each other, and build friendship. I have learned how to improve my problem solving skill, multi-tasking skills, and more importantly customer service skills. I enjoy working for this company ,but I also would like to venture to share my skill they have taught me ."
good,"Panera was a stressful environment. In the Panera I worked at it was very busy at all times of the day. People easily get annoyed at employees because they believed our lines should move faster and our food should be made quicker but its not that easy, people. This was a good environment to learn patience when working with the public and taught me how to smile through the rough moments."
good,"Great people mostly good workers which is a must, especially working in this fast pace environment, you need to be able to work together as a team"
good,I is fast and can be hard at times. But you should havea good team behind you to help you out. I have not worked there long but the managemnt is okay and at times fun and supportive.
good,"as an overnight baker, you deal with a lot of things at night. for example, equipment might not be working, there would be a high possibility that the night crew or day baker might of left a mess for you to clean up, other bakers don't clean when they're supposed to, there really isn't any consideration when you work at some cafes. often times, management would not take what you have to say into consideration, if there's ever an issue, it would be left up to us bakers to handle and resolve our issues with one another and I personally don't think that's how it should be handled. Management needs to care more and handle their employees the way that they need to. "
good,"Good atmosphere, great customers. Overall good company to work for, although hourly compensation does not accurately reflect experience, and wage determination is questionable."
good,"I had an overall nice experience while working at Panera Bread, The customer's for the most part have always been very nice. It has been a good learning experience in developing my quality Customer Service skills.Management could have been better, but did not take away from my experience."
good,Panera Bread was a very good work place.  They days were fun and full of excitement and customers.  The managers were very understanding.  The food was awesome and very healthy.
good,Great Part time experience. Would recommend it to anyone going to school. Management could be more organized. But no holiday pay? At least you get and employee discount on food!
good,"cashier, making beverages, cleaning, assisting guests with placing orders and taking them to their table, training new employees"
good,"I started working at Panera almost 2 years ago. It was fun in the beginning, but soon after I started seeing some inconsistency's with management. They only promote you if you are young, and a suck up. Its very hard to advance. The hours are horrible. You either work a lot(50-60hrs), or not at all(0-20hrs). I would recommend this job if you are in desperate need of a job, but other than that find something else!"
good,"A typical day at work is to greet and serve customers."
good,"The management is good, but the pace of advisement is poor. Under pays workers who have been with the company for a good period of time,"
good,"Management is good, they make sure things are done in a timely matter. The co-workers are normally great, with a few exceptions. There really isn't a hard part to the job."
good,Panera is a constantly growing business. It just may take time for that to happen. There is always that urge to move up though.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Honestly the management never listened to me when I said I needed more hours. I complaint multiple times. The only benefit was the three dollar meals. But theres really no room to grow. Its like the managers picked there favorites and it was usually the suck ups instead of the hardest working. I do however love what panera as a company stands for. I will forever be a customer, however not an employee."
good,it is very nice to work with the associates and meeting new customers on a daily basis and also getting familiar with guest who visit often. closing duties are carried out  and i ensure that everything is in order and double checked.
good,"It was a tough job, very fast paced. Loved the challenge of the every day deliveries. Loved the money I made when it was really busy. The Management was very hands on with all the employee's."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is customer service. I love getting to work with people. The managers were great people to work for and I enjoyed getting to know them as friends as time went on. I loved the team spirit that was created while I worked there. They taught us to work well with the other employees so that we could serve the customers better.
good,Panera is a very busy place to work with multiple tasks to complete  during a shift. Every day is different so it keeps you on your toes. It has helped me to be a more accomplished at multitasking and handling stress. The best part about the job is you are never bored.
good,"My coworkers were the only reason I stayed as long as I did.  The work was not difficult, however the management was poor.  They did not treat the staff adequately and respectfully."
good,"great co workers, easy work for the most part, can be very busy but rewarding. the food is amazing especially for fast food."
good,"Panera Bread is a great company to work for. The smell of freshly baked bread and pastries is a great way to start your shift. The employee discount is 65%, plus you can get free pastries if you close which is pretty nice."
good,I like to have fun and challenges at my place of employment. I think that people should have the option to move up in there job.
good,"I enjoyed working at Panera Bread, and liked my managers as well as my coworkers.  We worked together well to ensure each customer had a great meal and experience in the restaurant."
good,You start with your tasks at hand and go about your business. as a baker the evening staff is closing while we are getting started. I feel the system set up works well if the people hired can abide by it. Overall a very nice place to work and definitely if you are a college student.
good,"Not much to say, it was an ordinary job with some lazy managers. Other than that, it was a great experience to work here as my first job."
good,"I worked with an awesome team, and there's always room for improvement. We provided each customer with quality customer service,"
good,"A typical day at work starts with clocking in and getting a cash drawer. After if have my register I clean the front of the restaurant along with taking orders as customers walk in. Panera's goal is to please every customer that comes in and make sure everything is as accurate as possible. I greet the customers and then take their orders (answering any questions they may have and giving suggestions if needed). Once their order is taken I go back to cleaning. If ordered, I walk over to basrista line and make them their smoothie, coffee... ect. When we close I prepare the store for the openers in the morning and I bag up all the left over bread, bagels, and pastries for donations that night. Once everything is clean and ready for the openers the manager  looks over my area making sure that everything is correct and sends me home. "
good,"Easy, monotonous sandwich making. "
good,"Panera Bread was flexible with my schedule while I was still obtaining another job. Panera Bread allowed me to meet many interesting people, both customers and co-workers. Panera bread was typically busy and stressful. But my job as the team leader was to make sure everything was done correctly and to work together. I learned that that even through the hardest moments. If you have a happy team that works together, you can overcome anything. The hardest part of my job was to except that some people did not value their job. there for did not care for the proper way of doing things, or doing anything at all. The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with the customers and receiving positive feedback from them. Working for Panera Bread was hard work but I was proud to train and lead my fellow co-workers."
good,"Panera has always been a changing environment. When I began, I noticed how the employees treated each other and their employers. At first I was hesitant. I wasn't use to abrasive and sarcastic mannerisms and I thought they were being disrespectful. But as time went on, I learned how to relax my stiff position and enjoy my coworkers. The hardest part of the job was really learning to breathe and trust my coworkers. I had taken on so many of the job responsibilities, from handling the production, to overseeing the preparation, that I didn't believe my coworkers truly cared about the job in hand. The managers were constantly changing. It took a long while before we had a manger team that ran efficiently and built the team to the fullest of their potential."
good,overall it was a great work experience. I gained customer service and social skills experience.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Working at Panera wasn't bad, but it wan't all fun either. I enjoyed working with front end crew memebers. There was something new to look forward to, when going into work, my only issue with this job, was the lack of communitcation. Part of the time the managers would play favorites and they wouldn't always be on the same page about some store issues. For the most part I enjoyed my time on the Clock, as well as off the Clock."
good,"The company itself is a good company to work for. Hard to advance, upper management is very harsh."
good,"Typical food service job, great system for advancement, but the general manager has no idea what he's doing"
good,I like coming to work because of my peers and coworkers. Thy really feel like family to me and they make the work day easir when handling rude guests or complaints.
good,This was my first job and it was a great way for me to start working.  Very poor management at times.
good,Its good starting out job to accumulated experience. They willing to be flexiable with your time but on the other hand that might affect how much hours you'll get.
good,This job is made for people just starting out. It has all the essentials you'll need and a structure that is for the most part enjoyable.
good,Working at Panera I learned how teamwork plays a roll in the success of the company. Even though I worked alone on most nights I still had to make sure that my managers put the right numbers in on my pan up sheet so that we had all the right products.
good,"Depending on the shift I was working, my day started out getting ready to greet and serve customers. Mornings consisted of getting everything started for the day from breads and pastries to soups and sandwiches. Lunch, which was the busiest part of the day so it was the time I most enjoyed, was more of a hectic time where everyone really had to work as a team in order to achieve accurate, prompt, and friendly service. Lastly was the evening shift were part of the time was focused on closing duties and the other was dinner rush. The closing duties were pretty much common sense, cleaning everything,  stocking what needed stocked, and getting rid of what was left at the end of the day. Everything is made fresh daily so we had to get rid of everything that we couldn't give to a donation."
good,It was a good environment to work in.   I loved getting to talk and to know every day customers.
good,"•	Performed customer service, cash handling, as well as daily associate duties"
good,Panera is a wonderful company to work at as a student or if you are someone looking to grow in the food service industry. They have a wonderful management team and they seem to care about their employees.
good,Enjoyed my time there... Franchises worry me... When they change hold times and spec on food to save money it is a problem...  Must hire more qualified people not just former walmart cashiers as managers.  Pay better and stop changing the bonus plan every few months so managers can be rewarded for the hard work.
good,My first job ever. Took it to receive additional funds while in high school
good,"Just like any other place to work, Panera has its good days and its bad days. Management has a mind of their own and 7 times out of 10 they get the job done on time the right way. Hardest part of the job is that its very demanding and during lunch or dinner rush you have to be efficient and be on your game. The best part of the job is all the people that work there."
good,"Daily operations of a Bakery/ Cafe. People management, food cost, cash control, and customer service."
good,Great place for a quick coffee or lunch. Great variety of food and knowledgeable staff.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of getting to work at 5 a.m.and  setting up the bakery display. At 6 a.m. the cafe opened to guests,  I  then greeted guests all day and took their orders, and gave back the appropriate amount of change at the end of the transaction. When we had slow times, I cleaned up the bakery and made it presentable to guests. I learned how to use a register, and how to always remain smiling and happy. MY coworkers were great, easy to get along with and kept the day productive. When any one of us had a question we could always count one another to help. My management team did great with keeping the day steady and fun, whenever there was a problem they jumped in and helped out. The hardest part would be on occasion we would get grumpy guests, but I leaned fairly quickly how to stay calm and do my best to calm them down. The most enjoyable part was getting to know regulars that came in, and helping someone to have a better day."
good,I have learned a lot from working here. I prep food so I know how to make their sandwiches and some salads.  I like working with my coworkers they are all pretty nice and easy going. Panera is always busy and that's great a lot of the customers are very nice also. Sometimes I also serve customers their food and I enjoy seeing people satisfied with our food. There's wasn't really anything hard about this job. You just have to focus on customer service thts the most important thing. Always make the customer smile.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"I mostly ran the register, and was put in charge of making sure everyone else was doing what they were supposed to. I learned teamwork and a lot of people skills. At Panera they have some really strong cultural values they want all of their workers to follow and in all honesty they teach you a lot. Our managers a lot of the time did whatever they could to help us make sure everything was running smoothly 100% of the time. The hardest part of the job there was probably the after hours extensive cleaning. The most enjoyable part was being able to work with a team that made you feel like you were family."
good,"A typical day at work was ringing up customers on a cash register and making their food in a fast and efficient way. I learned how to use their cash registers, how to correctly make the food, how to open and close the restaturant, how to have excellent customer service, and how to have great communication skills. Management at Panera could have been better. Everyone was so scattered around. My co-workers were the best part about my job! They all became my friends and I couldn't have asked for better coworkers. We all enjoyed working together which made the job easier. The hardest part of the job was learning new things and also trying to work when we were short staffed, but it wasn't impossible. I always got things done. The most enjoyable part about my job was the hours they gave me. They were very flexible with my schedule and were understanding with my school schedule."
good,a typical day was a little long only cause you are on your feet the whole time. i did learn alot from working there like taking charge and being a leader. the management was ok they didnt really care for the new people cause they already had there friendship but as far as runnig the company they where very good and did a great job. my co-workers where all great they had great personalitys and where hard working when on the job. the hardest part about the job was just gettig up at 5 in the morning. i enjoyed have some where to be every day in something to do. i learned so much and i enjoyed every moment i was there.
good,"Panera Bread is a great place to work for a first job, the management are both strict and flexible. However there is little corporate advancement for the employees. Just like any other corporation, in order to climb up the corporate ladder one must have connections within the company. Those without those connection maintain lower positions for extended lengths of time. "
good,"The company was great and worked with my school schedule. They paid me above minimum wage, which was great for a cashier. I mainly worked the cash register, and occasionally would work in the kitchen. I was always dealing with customers. The hardest part was putting up with rude customers, but the most enjoyable was being able to meet new people every day."
good,"Minus the fact that pay is on the low side, and they had a big management change during my employment that wasn't going so smoothly (To their credit, I was only there for two weeks of the change.), it's a great place to work."
good,I would arrive at work at 4:45 am to open up and set up the shop. Having to be at work so early was gruesome and it was really hard on my body because I didn't always get adequate sleep. Working the morning and into the early afternoon involved a lot of communicating not only with customers but also my co-workers because it was the busiest stretch of the day. I enjoyed seeing the regular customers because I was able to develop a relationship with them and I also really enjoy talking to people. It was difficult to get a customer who was cranky because I don't like confrontation but my patience helped me to help the customer.
good,"Overall, I lovee working at Panera. I have worked at three different cafes and I will be moving to a 4th one soon. I love that it is a good job, and if you work hard and do a good job, you will be first pick for hours. The food is amazing and the values held in the company are awesome. My co-workers are great and most of us get along really well at work and outside work. "
good,"Customer interaction is enjoyable. Current manager smokes, so he always came in with that smell. "
good,"Great customers, and associates. A few managers should not have been in management only because there managment skill lacked. Co-workers were great people. Alot of work for low compensation and one at a certain pay raises stop."
good,"I have enjoyed working at Panera Bread for nearly three years. The environment is very conducive to making on the stop decision in a fast pace climate.My interaction with customers have been helpful and rewarding. All of the staff is pleasant and cooperative.While I'm very content there, the availability of work hours need to be subsidized."
good,"Will discuss more on a one on one basis with employers, nothing bad to say."
good,Operating the cash register.
good,"I really liked this job and I was sad to see it go when I moved. I loved the atmosphere in which I worked, it got hectic at times during rushes but an overall peaceful place. I learned to handle money, to be quick and efficient. The hardest part was being on my feet for so long. The most enjoyable part was the food and the people."
good,"I would train new associates on the current standardized operating procedures and company policies. I was tasked with making sure everything was done to standard from cashiering, to cleaning, to making food. Here I learned and developed my people skills along with my leadership skills. Management was always changing, so there was always chaos in terms of higher management. My co-workers where great people, very easy to work with. the hardest part of the job was keeping up with the companies most current policies and procedure, as they where always changing. The most enjoyable part was teaching people new things and how to better their performance on the job."
good,Co-workers are great and fun to be around. The hardest part is the 3rd shift hours.
good,"Loved my customers, especially regulars. The environment was great and for the most part it was a great place to work. Most of my co-workers were really nice and made my experience there wonderful."
good,working as a team to get the job that is needed to be done the most-pleasing the customers.
good,"A typical day at Panera Bread is a busy one. It is our goal to serve fresh ingredients, develop lasting relationships with, and provide an everyday oasis to all of our customers and develop lasting relationships with customers. I have gained a great deal of management experience and knowledge in my years with the company. I have also gained many lasting relationships with many or my co-workers and employees. I would have to say that the hardest part of my job is trying to be where I am needed at all times. The most enjoyable part of my job is the relationships that I have built with customers and employees."
good,"Typically, Panera is always busy! This helps the work day go by pretty quickly. The degree of accuracy required when taking food orders has refined my listening and customer service skills even more. Management always looks out for the cashiers when it comes to changing large bills and scheduling according to school and other schedules. I am among the oldest of the cashiers here, although I would prefer to work with people my own age, or older. The hardest part of this job is standing up for hours on end. I have some back problems and long shifts on my feet take their toll on me and my energy level. I love the regular customers and the friendly interactions with them. I hope to eventually transfer to another Panera in a different city."
good,"Great people, great food! Very honorable place to work for. They donate all baked goods at the end of the day. Crazy busy all the time and open closes are frequent"
good,"If you want in with this company apply with a corporate location. The franchises are inconsistent. A typical day starts at 5 am which is nice if you get to go home on time. I learned a lunch based business, where most of my previous experience was dinner based. The management at my last location left much to be desired. As the G.M. of my location I did my best to provide an upbeat and positive environment, which was never provided to me from above. I was in charge of most of my co-workers and they loved working for me as long as we did not have hostile upper management visiting. The hardest part of the job was staying positive while constantly being bombarded with negativity. I enjoyed my team and loved the culture we as a team created within my 4 walls."
good,"Panera really is a great place to work, however, I do not feel that I am being compensated fairly. I respect everyone I work with but at times I feel I am doing more work that is required for one person."
good,"It is a great atmosphere for teenagers or college students attempting to make money during the summer break or while their taking courses. The management is wonderful at working around your schedule, however they lack consistency of full fill their management positions. This is not really a job for someone that is in need of a stable hours and pay since if it a great possibility that hours will fluxuate or be cut down randomly."
good,"Everyday is a new challenge, with the changes we are going through. The staff is dedicated. We have most of the longest term employees in the company. The hardest part of the job right now is balancing time in order to get all of the work done and run the shift giving the best above average customer service possible that every individual deserves."
good,"I really liked working at Panera when I graduated from high school, my fellow employees were really nice and while the management team was a MESS it was still tolerable and fun most of the time. I ended up quitting because one of the managers played favorites with the employees (and I wasn't one of her favorites), plus I also wanted a job closer to home. Overall, a fun place to work with not much stress at all. I also got ""promoted"" a few times so that was nice."
good,"very friendly and busy work place, i learned how they make there breads, and managment was productive,co-workers all worked togther.the hardest part of the job was taking garbage out. And the most pleasant was the customers!!"
good,The only problem is not a set amount of hours. The bosses had problems with favortism and never were sure about where you would work per day.
good,"I enjoyed working with my coworkers, there was always something to do while working."
good,There needed to have more staffing in the dining room for the amount of people who were eating in.
good,Great employees fun to work with friendly all was great except for general manager who smoked outside all day on her phone and yelled at employees for her mess ups and stuff she didn't handle
good,"Great place to work, pay isn't bad, and the people are fun and energetic. I like being a delivery driver, though I am not scheduled to work as much as I would like."
good,"I worked at the Panera in Bellevue, Nebraska and the management team and my coworkers made it one of the most enjoyable and memorable places I have ever worked. It was my first job and I loved it. I worked hard for my money. (You do a lot of work). Everyone was there to encourage each other and not tear each other down, we were one team. Although, I switched locations because I moved and went to a location on Maple and the management was terrrinle   Everyone ended up leaving and they only asked me to stay when I said there is no advancement and they don’t care about me as an employee  I would recommend anyone to work there if they want a good environment, but just make sure you pick the right location"
good,"Sometimes can be really busy and you need to call managers to help you if you are on line, sometimes managers can be a bit lazy and you may get stressed out but besides that the job itself is easy"
good,Good pay for positions and there are seasonal meetings that are mandatory. Coworkers are usually the best part. Management is either amazing or horrible no in between but my location had many issues with management so staff barely got promotions or raises
good,"The company actively tries different things to solve problems for employees and customers a like. The benefits for managers are great. Panera donates its unused baked products to local charities at the end of the day."
good,My experience at Panera was lovely i enjoyed it and made some good friends. The customers are amazing and i would recommend this job to anyone. However the general manager was a bit mean and nasty but she got fired. Also it could get a little frustrating because they managers can’t work under pressure very well here. other there than that i would love to go back.
good,"If you show dependability skill and act like you want to be more than an associate, you can and will move up quickly with this company other than that cool job flexible hours"
good,"A typical day at work includes managing several aspects of the business, delivery operation, catering operations, in house dine in or carry out production, and online order and packing. In addition I am still responsible for all the employees break executions, and cash handling including the deposits and notes to communicate any issues with other managers. During down time I manage the cleaning and equipment maintenance. The environment is very dynamic and fast pace. I always have to multitask and make snap decisions, while remaining proactive and identifying problems and counteracting them before they go full scale. "
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Panera has a good team behind it. The staff is really nice and we have open communication. Any problems are handled in house. The management team is relaxed but still working to accomplish Panera's goals. After working for them for almost 2 years I would say Panera is a good place to work at.
good,I love my GM and A.M . Many of the staff are kids and adults that act like kids. Many managers go through my Panera for training so as soon as you form bonds with them they leave.
good,I need to find a full time job if they don't change me to full time. I have been applying for full time jobs but to no avail! I will keep at it until I get a better paying job.
good,"Enjoyable,  fast-paced environment. Once the job learned environment was pleasant and  easy to earn money, The job is a tipped position so the earning potential is based on the services given"
good,Some coworkers had poor communication skills and their personalities clashed often. The employees brought a sense of security and friendship to everyday and I felt as if I was home when I clocked into work. Everyone got along and everything went smooth on most days.
good,"Clean environment"
good,"Good place to work for someone with little to no experience, but they are incredibly frugal and selfish, don't care much about the happiness of their customers. Only interested in making more money for those above them and replace employees easily."
good,I enjoyed working for my fellow employees and setting a great example for them.  I took great pride in training and promoting employees from within to fill available positions and rewarding them for their hard work and discipline.
good,"Working at Panera Bread has been the best job I have worked so far most of the management is on target, and they push us to always do and be the best."
good,"I learned several things while working at Panera such as what to look for in a career. While every job has its pros and cons, the one thing I learned most is that a manager can set a great example as a leader and inspire the workers or send them running for a new job and constantly have high turnover."
good,"Experience can vary greatly between corporate or franchise locations.  Tremendous growth in catering.   A mix of young staff working their first ever jobs and positions that require a higher level of skill (prep, baking, for example)."
good,Panera bread was my first job. It was a good environment to work in. I learned a lot working there. Even though it could be busy sometimes the job will always get done
good,always busy and always new people to hire. Management was always changing and mostly lazy.  The food was good and honestly fresh like the company says.
good,"My ex manager was extremely positive. The place always feel like home. I was so happy to work there. I knew the time I singed in but,  the time ran so fast that I did not know when was time to go home."
good,"A typical day at Panera Bread working there is always doing something whether it is stocking, providing service, etc... The work environment itself is calm and neat even though sometimes it might get a little crazy."
good,"I've mostly worked in a grocery store bakery, this is my first time in a bakery/restaurant atmosphere,I really love working here, but, some days it can be stressful."
good,"Panera was a good experience for me to learn more about food saftey  and work in a good environment. Although, I admit it wasn't a very good place to work. The pay is rather low."
good,"***I work for a Covelli owned Panera. The work is about the same- Im sure corporate pay and promotions are a bit different*** "
good,I like the working environment at Panera Bread. The team work was great and like everyone was genuine. The managers always made sure your were doing fine.
good,"Panera Bread is a good company to work for. However I have worked at 3 different cafes and it does depend on the management of the particular cafe. But my overall experience working for this company was good. However, I just need a change and it's time for me to move on to a bit more of a better paying job with better benefits. But there will always be a place in my heart for my Panera Family."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"I do believe working at panera is okay, it is not the best job, but there are a lot of tips that are made and mostly everyone there is enjoyable to be around."
good,"If you enjoy sales and are looking for a work from home job, this is fantastic.  The position is Enterprise Selling with Business to Business sales methods."
good,Working at Panera can be a rollercoaster. Some days will be hectic while others completely relaxed. Evaluations are bi annually and you get Team Tips added to your paycheck.
good,"Panera Bread is a good company to work for.  You do have to understand that the bottom line is making money first.  Customers and associates come second.  They were bought by a company JAB, and after that many upper management at corporate office has changed, including 3 different CEO&President the last two years."
good,It was a great job to gain experience and awesome way to start my working life. I really enjoyed the people I worked with and the actual job I was doing.
good,"I like Panera as a company. it has a great mission the only thing that killed it for me was the general manager. my specific manager was a narcissistic jerk. never in my life have I walked into the cooler to find a manager screaming and cussing at another employee over a freaking cookie,"
good,"Panera is a good company to work for...job security is a plus.."
good,"Panera is a good place to work, it has diferents position to work such as cahiers, prep, runners and food handlers. One of the hardest part of the job is the opening, you have to set up three lines, two of them are for sandwiches and one for salads. During your day of work as opener you have to do backups, cut breads and make sure  your team have all they are going  to need during the morning and lunch time and while your doing it you have to watch the screens."
good,"1. Good place to work."
good,I loved working here. The management was great at working with a flexible schedule for multiple jobs. The bad part was that you'll likely need more than 1 job because they pay very low. Barely minimum wage.
good,"Panera is a great place to start off for a first job as there are numerous areas for associates to learn at and gain new experience. For this who excel, they are provided with opportunities to move up in the company."
good,"Loved working here! Fun energy between associates. Got to learn other aspects of the job. Also got promoted to trianer pretty quickly. Hard work pays off. Would love to re apply, but i have tattoos now and thats out of the question to them 😕"
good,Panera was a good working experience overall. The management was on top of their game most days. There was a 30 minute break for any shift longer than 5 hours. They focussed heavily on team building and making sure there was a safe work environment.
good,"Working at Panera can be a good experience, it all depends on your management. The job isn't very hard, but there is a lot to do to close up. You have to clean the building and stock up and throw out the trash. Cash is a pretty easy job, the worst thing is the customers."
good,"Panera was my first job, i enjoyed everyone I worked with and for and it helped me gain good experience and how to really interact with coworkers and customers,"
good,"Very fast paced and busy. "
good,"Panera, like any other food place gets overwhelming because of how fast-paced you have to be. Not everyone is in a good mood almost every time I work, so it’s sometimes a negative environment. There’s decent pay! Starting at $9 an hour. After a year you don’t get a raise. Lots of training before getting the job."
good,"The individual Associates try hard to run the store well, however poor scheduling and poor inventory tend to make work much more chaotic then needed. My store kept running out of ingredients or not scheduling enough people to man the store."
good,Slow most of the time. not much to be stressed about. the pay was ok for a driver although underpaid hourly for sure. you do a lot for little hourly pay.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Very busy workplace, (because of specific location), but overall good environment if you're good under stress and if you're a good multi-tasker. Good place to get experience because of the multiple stations they put you in."
good,"Overall good job, not too hard. Good discount on food! But very low pay for all the work we do. Overall, managers are nice and understanding with your availability."
good,"Being in an environment surrounded by mostly women, Ive seemed to grow further with my multitasking due to some people not being able to preform tasks so I help. The management at Panera Bread are great and very kind, they have taught me a lot. Panera has helped me gain more experience and potential that I did not know was in me."
good,Our general manager isn’t the best people person but working there is fun and you meet greet people as long as you are nice and friendly. Also you do have to deal with customers at any position that you work.
good,"If you like working early they do have flexibility.  If you like to wk late they also have flexibility.  Okay job for college/high school students. You must really like the restaurant/retail business to wk here. You must really enjoy the jobs to work at Panera. Very fast pace location multi tasking. A regular day at Panera stocking,  cleaning, inventory serving, dishwasher baking,answer phone calls barista, always something to do"
good,"They aren't a bad company to work for, but they don't really listen to the costumers or the staff that they have. I can only speak for the cafe I work for. They are very flexible, they can work around your school or life schedule pretty well. Though they make you take breaks sometimes after making you wait almost an hour to even clock in. Overall not a bad company, I enjoy the management and the people I work with."
good,"The people are really nice, the managers are very understanding. The GM is rude and harsh but besides him everyone was great to work with. The work can be tiring but it can be worth it"
good,"A good team makes a wonderful shift. Flexible hours, decent benifits, and direct deposit on time or early. Panera walks the line between fast food and cafe`. The job does what it needs to."
good,"Panera Bread is an ideal first job for anyone looking to branch out and start from the bottom to rise up. Whether or not you actually do rise up will depend on your persistence with the managerial staff. They are kind people who do their jobs, but you really have to keep your hustle up in order to gain the in-work certifications necessary to advance. If your idea when applying to this job is gaining a managerial position, you may want to gain prior experience from another job and come in out the gate as a Manager Trainee. Otherwise, the work place benefits its younger workers because the atmosphere is generally friendly whilst tempering the associates to overcome preconceived anxieties related to customer relations. (Especially during lunch rush hours.) You will, however, have to deal with chronic understaffing."
good,"Busy work atmosphere "
good,"Panera Bread taught me a lot about being a team player which really help me in this field. Everyday coming to work was amazing learning something new everyday and having a connection with my co-workers & my managers. I would say the hardest part of the job was prepping the food all the measurments and potions had to be correct they are very strict on that food cost. I enjoyed the everyday customers that I met they consider me as family to them , I always made sure they left Panera with a smile everyday. Also I enjoyed my co-workers, they really made me feel welcome and comfortable and they were polite and kind to me."
good,"Like any franchisee-owned place, every Panera is different. Just before I started there, they changed the closing and opening process to cut down on a bunch of hours. Things are slow in the summer and my hours got cut down so badly (despite my having worked there for over a year and people with less experience than me getting more hours) I had to leave. A new manager made me want to leave too, even though there was the potential that I could've stuck that one out. Most of my other managers were cool and let us get away with a lot. It's a lot, especially for a closing shift, but ultimately each store is going to have a different working experience."
good,I gained some knowledge about how the food industry works. People can make or break having a good day. Remember to always keep a PMA. Going in with a positive attitude will always change your day.
good,My experience with Panera Bread over all was great. It was a fmaily like enviroment. I just didn't like how long it took to deal with complaints against mamagement abusing their power.
good,"I worked at Panera Bread over the summer before leaving for college and really enjoyed it. When hired I was primarily trained to work on the line with the possibility of being trained for the Bakery/ cash registers as needed. It's a fun, fast-paced work environment especially working on the line during the weekend lunch rush, it really demanded teamwork and communication. The management was very nice and friendly, very helpful and always ready to help with the flow of product on the line with new employees. They were very understanding with scheduling and requesting time off."
good,Can get very busy and there’s not much staff. The menu definitely takes some getting used. This particular store wasn’t cleaned properly. Needs more managers.
good,Working for Panera Bread definitely has its ups and downs. The overall experience is great with kind and knowledgeable staff and management. The pay is decent but just not reliable enough to sustain a healthy living on your own.
good,"Other than it being stressful from time to time, Panera is an awesome place to work at. I worked there for 2 years & I wish I could’ve stayed longer.."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Depending on when you work the store can be slow and overall the job isn't hard and can be a fun work environment. If you do your work in a timely manner you should have down time to relax (depending on time of day and position)
good,"busy most of the day"
good,"Working at Panera Bread was not a good experience for me because I was never scheduled. I was a young teenager at the time and was taken less seriously. In addition, the boss was unaccommodating and hard to work with. I figured I would be better suited taking my skills elsewhere."
good,"I really liked working there seeing that the management was very helpful and understanding during my pregnancy. However, some coworkers would skip shifts or cancel last minute making the whole experience very stressful and most of us would have to stay overtime"
good,It's a pretty good job but not live off of. It's really for younger people who are still living with parents or at school who want to make some money.
good,It was a good learning experience. I made the food and the coworkers were nice and helpful. I also was a server and would serve customers when the food was made. I did food prep when needed. I am willing to work as many hours as possible.
good,"Good place to start out to kickstart a career in the kitchen. Great management and awesome training program, we all worked as a team and finished the shift as a team."
good,"On my average day at Panera Bread, I start at 4 and close at 9 or 10. But keep in mind I'm also there for an hour and a half after we close to make sure everything is clean for the people who work on the next morning. Sometimes I receive very snobby customers who want what they want it. But they don't understand that I am the only one who is serving 3 different spaces at once."
good,"The environment is quick-paced depending on location. Everyone helps each other out and communicates with one another to help the customers needs. I've met most of my friends through working here, so I'd recommend this friendly environment to anyone."
good,"Work at Panera Bread is easy to understand, yet takes time to master. The managers and associates are willing to help to make the job easier on any of the associates working, and thus help them learn. However, rushes tend to be stressful as there can be incredibly large lines. All in all, a good first job experience."
good,Panera was a hectic work work environment that kept me on my toes. I learned how to multi-task and stay calm. The hardest part of the job was probably the initial learning curve but once I got the hang of it I liked interacting with so many people.
good,"I liked the job and the coworkers were mostly friendly. You run out of things to do pretty easily being a delivery driver so I found myself always doing others jobs just to keep myself busy. Food was great and fresh. Not too difficult of tasks to accomplish and they're always willing to work with you on moving to different areas (eventually). Only downfall of my experience was the managment. She wasn't willing to work with me on hours due to lack of drivers but that affected my college education and personal life. I still believe Panera is a great place to work, just not for me at the time."
good,I had to get there early in the mornings to set up the line for the day. Management was great and the other workers were ok. Some had bad attitudes most of the time. I loved being able to interact with the customers and meet some great people. The hardest part was being on my feet constantly.
good,I left panera after a few months because I was pursuing a career instead of staying in one job the rest of my life.I followed into a carpentry career which pays much better than panera. However I wouldn't chnage working there for absolutely anything. The time I worked there was absolutely what I needed to get from Panera as a company.
good,Some days I worked cashier and some days dining it was ok was. Really just couldn’t see myself working there any longer things was getting out of hand
good,"Many tasks to do daily, good to keep busy"
good,I have definitely enjoyed my time at Panera Bread. The management has always been accommodating with my schedule and are very understanding. The associate's are welcoming and I have not had a hard time forming relationships. I have learned the importance of teamwork and hard work.
good,"I enjoy working with my coworkers. I feel like I was strung along in being trained to be a manager, communication was not there, I can't wait around for a maybe better job position so I am looking elsewhere."
good,"Typically will work the dining room or bakery."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Easy laid back place to work. Great for students still in college they have no problems working with schedule. Can be stressful sometimes and if you are a good employee they take advantage. But overall a great place to work
good,Panera is a very fast paced environment. The workplace is great and the coworkers make it a lot better than it normally is. The hardest part of the job is some customer situations and the most enjoyable part of the job is the people you work with!
good,"Panera Bread is a fast-paced working environment that can be challenging some days, but rewarding as the Panera location I work at is surrounded by supportive and fun co-workers and friendly customers. The environment is always positive and easy-going."
good,"I love my job. But need flexible hours,  love working in a fast paced, organized environment. Food is my passion, and doing the right thing. Love to work but also spending time with family is a must. I love a fun environment to work, it makes people happy. Very productive and take pride in what I do."
good,"Panera takes pride in ""the customer is always right"" policy. They strive for every customer to have a pleasant experience while dining. This means feeling welcome from the moment you walk in to the time you leave. They also strive to give you your order within 3 - 5 minutes."
good,I really like most of the mangers. Almost all my coworkers are great people. One or 2 of the managers can be unnecessarily rude. They'll give you a hard time just because they dont like you or they'll correct a minuscule error in a condescending manner. The work is relatively easy. The pay isn't that great. Being a full grown adult making 12 dollars an hour is rough and you're not allowed to accept tips. My first raise after being there for about 15 or 16 months was 22 cents. But if you're just starting out in the work force or if you are not a native english speaker I highly recommend it because most of Panera is like one big family and the work itself isn't bad at all especially if you like working with people.
good,"Mellow to hectic days, learned tons, have had great and terrible management experiences. workplace culture is usually awesome. hardest part is usually the understaffed tendencies and most enjoyable is people you meet and rewarding experiences."
good,Panera bread taught me to expect the unexpected. Everyday could be different. Learned a great amount of customer service skills. Managment team could of been more up to par.
good,"Working at Panera was a great experience. I enjoyed many of my managers the the associates I had. They made working at Panera very pleasant. My one complaint with the company is the lack of help that many of the stores received from corporate. There was more time spent telling associates and management what they need to improve on rather than viewing each store as its own entity. While I understand that I was working under a corporation, I feel as if the company itself pretended to care about its employees while management did their best to show their appreciation. While I was employed, there was little to no room for anyone to receive a raise. While I would recommend working at Panera to anyone looking to work in a fast-paced environment and learn more about food safety, I feel as if it is not a good store to stay at long term."
good,"As catering coordinator, I had many responsibilities. Depending on the volume of catering that day, I would have to modify my schedule and start time. Start time 2AM-5AM, depending on that day. Very stressful and fast paced to make sure all orders were completed on time. My role was to produce, package and deliver all orders. Also to maintain relationships with clients, market to create new business and administrative duties."
good,"stock the shelves, greet customers, take money, sometimes make food"
good,"My typical day included anywhere from dishwashing, general cleaning, cashier, food runner, making food, prepping food, etc. "
good,"Team is great but customers suck. They give an amazing discount, which I love. Working there is fun because of my co workers and the food is great. Managers are very nice."
good,The manager was the best part of the job. She was very easy to approach and communicate with. Food service is stressful and not my most favorite part.
good,I worked downtown Nashville. It’s cool at night but it’s stressful in the morning . The only time when it gets stressful at night is when it’s a game going on
good,Great associates and warm atmosphere a place you can really grow and move up if given the opportunity the customers are friendly and very welcoming plus the food is very amazing
good,"Hours were good and very laid back about when you needed time off. Really great management. Delivery driving position made working there easy. Pay was minimum wage, but it's a minimum wage job anyway. Coworkers extremely friendly."
good,Good customer service experience and good experience learning how to work well if others and how to deal with difficult situations. Very flexible work schedule.
good,"Panera Bread can get very hectic at times, as all jobs do, but the managers were super fair and fun to work with! I loved every single one of my coworkers and the job was great!"
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,A typical day you would be assigned one job and keep stationed. I learned how to mange money and keep everything in the register tracked properly. The manager was very unprofessional and did not work with his employees.The hardest part of the job was to memorize the food allergies each food had. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people.
good,"If you enjoy baking, night baker is a GREAT job.  It's fun, challenging, and rewarding.  The only thing that has soured my experience if poor leadership in the Covelli franchise.  Like any other place, the quality of your leadership will influence your job satisfaction.  Job turnover is high in my market because new bakers get no support and end up getting frustrated and quit."
good,"Panera gives you a family like feel. They give you a lot of knowledge as far as management goes. A typical day includes running the shift and making sure all associates are completing their assigned tasks. Handling deposits is common as well as customer service. I was responsible for several different duties which gave me management experience. These duties include inventory, placing orders for supplies for the cafe, recruiting, and training specialist."
good,"I learned a whole lot during my time at Panera. The night shift was not for me, as I couldn't sleep during daylight hours. This is a great job for night owls that can work independently."
good,"If you are just starting out, than this is the place to be, especially if you are in school, they are willing to work with your schedule. I also like that they cross-train their employees."
good,I enjoy working at Panera Bread. They work well with me even when my schedule change request seemed unreasonable. They accommodated and made the necessary adjustments.
good,"A typical day started with lobby maintenance, beverage refills, and dish washing. I also learned to prep/ assemble food. "
good,"Always have a eager ready to work attitude "
good,A good day its crazy busy with a bit of order to maintain everything and keep people happy but moving. Depending on the job you do more than what your actual job entitled but that's almost every job so nothing new with that at all.
good,"A typical day working at Panera Bread can be very difficult and very fun at times. Usually I would have to deal with certain customers that were either in a bad or happy mood.  Although I actually enjoyed that part of the job because I got to meet new people and really know my customers. Most of them of course just wanted their food and others were delighted to have a quick conversation. I think the best way that made my job easier for me was definitely knowing my customers and who came in every time I came to work. Although the hardest part was having to be the only cashier up front and take order after order with at times no help from anyone else. The management in my opinion wasn't has great but I loved the fact that everyone was very keen with one another and we were working like a huge family. There were arguments and fights but at the end of the day we worked through it and learned from our mistakes. Overall, this job helped me learn that you have to really care and be passionate about what you do. There may be those days where you feel torn or don't want to work but seeing someone else be happy makes you feel like a better person. I love getting enjoyment from a job where I can make someone else's day more better than it is. When there's something new going on in the workplace it can always make everything a better experience because you don't know what to expect will happen."
good,I enjoyed my time there when I was going to college. They were very flexible with my schedule and extremely understanding on up coming events which I needed to attend. The only problem I experienced was my relationship with the general manager who was very unprofessional and rude to me from the day I started until the day I stopped working there.
good,"I enjoyed working at Panera and do enjoy working at Panera due to the customers who I become good friends of mine over the time, and the friendly workers at the restaurant help as well. A good plus to the restaurant is the hours Iv received, but the pay doesn't compensate enough, if I had bills to pay, I'd have to slave away to pay them if I only worked at Panera."
good,Not a bad job to have if you like working in the food industry not as dirty as fast food place and always can move up in position to make more money in the future
good,"I did closing shifts which was more relaxed than morning shifts.  My typical day would be working the cash register for a majority of the time.  Other responsibilities include cleaning the bakery area, organizing the pastries to make it presentable, and prepping the store for the next day morning shift."
good,"A fun place to work for teenagers and you g adults, fast paced and the hours aren’t too long. A casual environment compared to a full service restaurant. I enjoyed my time working here."
good,"Fun place to work at, as long as you don't let the miscues of the upper management get to you.  The District Managers don't have much of a function.  So many of the stores can't maintain acceptable employee turnover rate.  Many stores have too much stress on the employees, causing them to go elsewhere."
good,Good job to learn customer service and team building skills. Great leadership from management and flexible working hours and with staff willing to learn.
good,Great place to work if you want to manage people and learn new skills. Good opportunity to interact with customers face to face and provide fantastic customer service.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,I want to leave because the environment is slowly declining ever since the general manager came back.  A lot of co-workers either have left or planning on leaving.
good,Fun face to work very warm staff. Management needs improvement. All in all very good place customer service is okay. Staff needs to be more driven pertaining to work.
good,"Overall panera was a great job to me, it help me to grow in things i never imagined. I love the managers, coworkers, and the customers. But at the end of the day i was working way more than what i was getting paid, and then when id get sick i wouldnt have the money to actually take care of myself. And panera didnt really care about me getting better, they only cared if i could come in to work, which was unsafe because id try my best not to contaminate things but i was sick and had to walk to the back alpt of the time to breath. Because i was not okay to work."
good,"The discount was nice and the food was really good. The only issue is most of us, panera associates, believe we should be treated more fairly. The management was a little out of control and constant complaints were being made about our own manager talking bad on customers to other employees who were only trying to do their job."
good,"I enjoy working at Panera Bread. I enjoy the people I work with, and the managers. I enjoyed getting to know the customers that come in frequently. The only problem I'm having is that there is no overtime and no paid holidays. There is also no time and a half. other than that I do not have a problem with working at Panera Bread."
good,"I love what the company stands for as a whole, however, now that it is private again I feel the ROI is playing a greater role in district level management. The commitment of training and development of AM from GM's is declining."
good,"This is a good starting job for anybody moving out of high school and into college life. The managers can schedule most employees off for any time they request, but will not pay for it, and may slash your future hours for not being ""dependable""."
good,Productive workplace mainly caring about the bottom line. They stand for a lot of good thing but overall dont really care about employees safety and well being just the profit.
good,"Daily tasks are plentiful with only minimum wage. Most tasks needed to be done are done by associates with minimal help from managers. Hiring is frequent, which cuts existing employees hours down."
good,"Mornings and lunch are usually where the crowds are found, evening shifts are slower and perfect for new employees to train. Opening shifts starts at 5 am and scheduled for at least 10 hours. Working at Panera Bread teach's you to multitask and move quickly, avoid making to make mistakes when placing meals or the line will be frustrated with you as well as the customer."
good,"Benefits available almost immediately, 90 day wait period. Hot and Hard Work. You pretty much work until all work is done daily ( no end time!!) Very Diverse environment. You will lose weight. This place activated some allergies I didn't know I had"
good,I enjoyed working their and gain a lot of experience .The job is a fast paste and big on  accuracy. The environmental goal is welcoming and assist at any cause .
good,The people at the panera i worked at were super nice and always had fun no matter who was there we always managed to make work fun whether it be telling jokes or acting goofy.
good,"Panera Bread is a fast-paced, professional work atmosphere employing a fun, enthusiastic staff and a qualified, tight-knit management team. i would recommend employment with this corporation."
good,Great energetic company willing to work with your schedule and time off request.  The culture is always upbeat and lively experience for people looking to a team.
good,"I feel like Panera Bread is a great job for people just starting to join the work force. But it is not the best job for people who are trying to support a living due to the fact that they are constantly cutting hours, although sometimes they give you the hours that you need , you never know when they will cut your hours, or at least at the locations I've worked at . "
good,Working at Panera was my first job while I was in High School it was a great frist job. I would recommend Panera being anyones first time job. I gained knowledge when I left panera like anyone should from any job.
good,"I enjoy working here. I have no problem at all with panera bread. It’s a great job for kids at school or for a first job to be honest. Great managers, great employees as well."
good,"My employment @ Panera Bread is one of the best times of my life. If the company cared more about their employees & advancements I would retire there. The staff can feel like family but unfortunately, like most jobs, quite a bit of gossiping and back stabbing. The pay for what is expected of you IS NOT at all good.. If you can charge so much for the food why not allow the employees who excel be given the chance for advancement opportunities and/or higher pay. When the employees who don’t try and do not care about the quality of the food or service make as much as the ones who put their heart and soul into the company and the pay is the same shows how out of touch corporate is.. Seen some of the best employees leave due to this unfairness.."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Working as an associate at Panera bread can be very enjoyable with the right staff & management team. Worked at many different stores, truly vaires drastically between locations."
good,is nice place to work k but decently not for parents it takes a lot of your day land the schedule is not very flexible for parent of little kids that need to have day care
good,"Most of everyone I worked with was a team player, only a few bad apples here and there. Management was ok. More reactive than proactive management style by the GM. Difficult to move up."
good,The hardest part  of the job is when we get very busy and we don't have enough employees. I learned a lot working there such as communication skills and time management.
good,When I first started working at Panera I had great timing with my hours as a minor worker but overtime there was a change and I began getting less hours. I was upset because I feel as though I am a hard worker and with no work there’s no money.
good,My job at Panera bread has taught me patience and how to succeed in a fast pace environment. It has taught me the basics of the food and service industry. Managers seem to not have a very long shelf life as Panera has lots of rules and regulations. Overall it is always busy at all times of the day. You do not get any health benefits as you can work 40 hours a week and not be full time. Your depend on your co workers and when someone calls in it makes the day very stressful.
good,"It's a very fast paced environment, depending on the location. I learned a lot about being quick and efficient at everything I do. Management had a lot of fun people. The hardest part of the job was the weekend lunch and dinner rushes. The place would be packed, with constant movement."
good,"A typical workday is usually a steady flow. A lot of tasks to get done setting up for lunch rush than for the dinner shift."
good,"Nothing too bad about this job, if you work fast food you know how this one will go. Mangers can be fun and friendly. Customers are usually nice and it is a very fast pace job which makes the time fly"
good,"As working as a student or someone with multiple jobs, working at Penera is a great place to be. The hours are flexible and many people are willing to pick up shifts most of the time. I personally would not rely on the salary to support a family, but you got to do what  you got to do."
good,"- I would drive and give customers food."
good,"My time at Panera Bread was fine for the most part. It is a fast paced, but fun atmosphere. You have to know the menu and know how to make the items in a quick and precise manner,especially during the busy hours like lunch. Even though it is fast paced, you have fun because you are working with coworkers who are well trained, and know what they are doing. Coworkers would also come to your aid if you were getting backed up, but they were caught up on their station. The hardest part was that you weren't paid a lot, and associates do not get benefits, only the managers do. They do allow for advancement within the company, so if you needed or wanted benefits, and you think you would be able to handle a management position there is opportunity for you to advance to a management position."
good,"I like Panera bread, but I have been with the company for so long now and since I can only work part-time during the school year, there is no time for me to advance in the company, which is what I wanted to do. I do like my coworkers and management is okay, however; they can be very unfair at times."
good,Not all of the managers are difficult to speak to but they are sometimes not always understanding of our frustrations when it comes to certain things.
good,New ownership really changed things . People that weren’t really familiar with Panera and the way they do things took over . Making it a place that didn’t necessarily reward hard work
good,"Scheduling was always a bit rough with management, you couldn't count on consistent hours. The customers were enjoyable for the most part outside of the handful of stressful customers. The coworkers are a close and almost like a family, allowing a wholesome environment that is fun to thrive in as a individual. Job obligations were always a priority and you pretty much would never leave on time."
good,"At the beginning I loved my job, the work was new, fun, and exciting.  I loved learning new things, working hard, and interacting with customers and fellow teammates.  I felt that I was working for a company who was great and going places.  I am still currently employed by Panera but I feel as if the location where I work has changed under new management.  I still love my job and the people that I work with but the new general manager lets a lot of things slide and the work environment has become one of drama and arguments. I now finding myself dreading going to work because I feel like a highly paid babysitter not a manager.  I want to work with people who care about their job and want to make a difference that's how my career with Panera started but that has unfortunately fallen by the wayside lately."
good,"I loved the people that  I worked with, working so many hours a week allowed me to develop relationships with coworkers and advisors that became guides for me. Pay was modest, they can schedule you enough hours for you to make a good living. Some parts of the job are not fun to do, but if you're just there to make a paycheck it is a great company to work for."
good,The company has policies but they they seem to be followed only a case by case basis.  Pay is good and the environment is fast paced.  Hours are good for a restaurant.
good,I worked at Panera Bread when I was in high school. It was my first job and I enjoyed it at first. The longer I stayed there I realized that I had not been getting paid how much I should have.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Prepare and plate food in a timely manner. Keep work area clean and sanitized. Correctly total customers’ bills, collect money and give change. Have good customer service skills."
good,Panera was a good starter job. It showed you how to handle customers while providing satisfaction. It introduced a fast paced work environment where you had to be ready for anything and had to ensure that customers would be satisfied with the quality of the workplace.
good,"Id recommend having a beater car for the job. Tips are pretty decent, lighter but more frequent during lunch and usually heavier but more infrequent during dinner hours."
good,Panera Bread is an awesome environment to work in. The crew members and managers are fantastic. The wages are too low to live off of and there needs to be a drastic change.
good,"I had a great time at Panera because I was lucky to have a mostly consistent crew and good managers. The workload can become overwhelming like during  rush hours and such but they train very well and you will be prepared and always have help. I have a friend who started working at the same Panera I did after I left who was telling me how it’s been rough there recently because of the inconsistent crew and how they don’t put in as much work. The more focus you give this job the more you can get out of it, hard work really helps you climb up the ladder here, some of my friends have done it already. Teamwork is a big key in making your life easier at Panera."
good,"Panera Bread really helped me improve my customer service skills as well as how to work efficiently in a fast paced environment. For the most part the managers were very understanding, but the best part of the job was the friendships I made with my co-workers. Helps you build better team working skills."
good,The company changes and goes back and forth on many rules making it annoying or tedious to try adjusting to new systems when they either get changed or ignored less than a month in. They don't know how or what they want to treat the employees like and you sometimes get a few months of loving your jobs and many months of hating it since the higher ups give and take random things away for no reason.
good,"Deliver driver,  treated only as a driver. Asked multiple times to learn other roles and was mostly ignored. Did not originally apply for driver, but it was presented as my best chance to get a job, when they found out I had a vehicle. Above average management (Hoover, AL). Friendly employees."
good,"I learned a lot while being at Panera. I've worked there for 3 years. It's a good part-time job because they are pretty flexible. I can work a lot or as little as I want. The management is ok. I have met some of my best friends while working here. Some coworkers are amazing, some are not so great, but that's with any job. You're usually forced to take 30 minute breaks that you have to clock out for, which I find annoying. The customers can also be annoying."
good,"Great company to work for. Benefits are good and pay is decent for management, although it would be nice for management to be back on salary considering that they only get paid for working 45 hours a week, get paid hourly, but most managers average around 50 hours of work a week and do not get paid for those extra 5 hours."
good,"Job is fairly easy and straightforward.  However, management is lacking as well as the ability to communicate properly about any and all things.  If you do become a part of this company, I'd recommend you stay detached and don't get too close to anyone."
good,Everyone was friendly and made work fun but sometimes you just get tired of the same role everyday. It is important to change it up a bit and make it more exciting in the workplace. But I’m glad the associates were great and the friends I made are very special.
good,"A typical day at Panera Bread is good.  You will get a big rush during breakfast, lunch, and dinner hours, but besides that it is slow.  I've learned to use the system which is very self explanatory and easy.  My store is poorly managed and always runs out of the necessities.  The hardest part about the job is closing time.  If you work night shifts, expect to be there at least an hour and a half after the store actually closes.  A big plus is that you get half off of food."
good,"I've been with Panera for a year- I'm mainly in the drive thru, and the customers are fun/frustrating to deal with. It's a decent place to work, as far as I've experienced. I haven't been able to get promoted yet, unfortunately, which I would have liked to be at this point."
good,"This company is more about service and engaging people, making the place comfortable for staff and guess. maintaining a clean cafe, keeping the smile and talking to guess is one of the responsibility at Panera bread."
good,I very much enjoyed working at panera. my coworkers were all very helpful and very personable. getting hours was easy if you worked hard but sometimes they expected too much.
good,"If you're looking for flexibility for a busy school schedule this is a pretty good starting job. If working around 35-50 hours, benefits are offered such as paid time off. But if looking for advancement other than restaurant management or assistant management, not a great place to stick around."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"This job goes from fast-paced to dead within seconds, as most food-related businesses go. At times, it could be stressful and sometimes the workload was shifted to overwhelming amounts. On your feet constantly. Management was pretty good, but could be better. Getting a raise, unless part of a yearly raise, was near impossible. Received less play than brand new employees as an experienced employee. Coworkers were amazing and this job is very much about team work."
good,"overall pretty nice place to work, everyone is nice and easy to get along with. management and staff is fair, clean and organized place, very fast paced."
good,"The food is good there, I think it is healthier than most places you go to. I like to put this near a fast food area since you have to have that fast paste to work there."
good,Once I use to get there was to bake all the goods before the door open at 545. Then I had to start all the catering for that day . Which is 4 to 5 order a day .
good,"Started working at 5am to stock the bakery, but needed more than and hour to get ready.  Some times I was the only one up front when there was a line of customers waiting.  Had a problem finding the managers when they were needed. Never seemed to have enough people working first thing in the morning during the week when it was busy."
good,Nice place to work with fun people.  Some opportunities to switch positions. Weather can be a problem when you are a delivery driver. Fast paced environment during lunch and dinner hours.
good,It was usually quite stressful and we were always short staffed and super busy. But the workers usually all got along and most of the managers were good to work with.
good,"If you work hard you are generally going to be recognized, but sometimes the bosses do play favorites.  I did learn a lot with them, but don't know if they are they best long term company for me."
good,"I enjoyed working for Panera Bread. Shifts were very fast paced and you are always moving. Coworkers and Management were all pleasant to work with, everyone was very helpful with my training."
good,"Panera is a fun place to work, but does not pay well for the work done. At $9.75 an hour it is difficult to get my life going (im 19 years old). Upward mobility within this company is low. Benefits dont reach many levels. The job can become stressful during busy hours as attention to detail and quick hands are needed. If u are not adept to that environment is can be exceedingly stressful. During slow hours is is very very slow. Around lunch time (11-2) is the busiest. Doesnt really get busy outside of that. There are better locations to work."
good,Had fun working with the panera bread team.I learned lots of new skills while working in a great and fast paced enviormant. I provoded challange to help keep focus and stimulation.
good,"great atmosphere and food for general health and well being, prices are too high for most community members. customer service is usually outstanding and fast"
good,Great place to work  get to meet new people. At my cafe everyone works well together. Always have fun while working even when it's busy everyone is on the same page
good,"You'll get sick of the food here eventually, no matter how much you love it before you work here. Good job for students, pretty flexible. Managers were either absolutely excellent or abysmal, no real in-between. Very view consequences for rule-breaking, which led to generally unreliable coworkers."
good,"Though everyone except managers starts at minimum wage, you definitely have room to move up if you show with actions that you're a good employee and hours are there as long as your availability isn't too limited. Mornings are typically slow and laid-back though at lunch it picks up but even then it isn't too bad."
good,The work is easy to learn. Other employees are easy to get along with. Team work is necessary for the best performance. Having a flexible schedule is important.
good,At Panera bread all of the staff members were always on their feet running to do their next task. It wasn't a lot of mistakes Because everyone got along with one another.
good,Overall it's a good place to work. I knew basically everyone there and joked around with them a lot. It is a very welcoming store. There was one manager I just did not like. He would not let me do my job. He was a perfectionist.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"If management wasn't so strict, advancement was so hard to come-by, and work/life was a bit more balanced- the place would be great. Maybe more events outside the work environment should take place."
good,"This position would good for a college student or a young person starting their career, but not for someone already into their career or with a lot of experience."
good,The coworkers are really good with working with each other. Great benefits. Sometimes long hours. Been there for 12 year. Alot of training and good cultural values.
good,Working at Panera is fast paced and sometimes stressful. Shifts go by fast and you are able to make great customer connections in each cafe. Cross training is a big part of each cafe so you gain a lot of knowledge and there is usually room for career advancement.
good,"Good job to start off, room for growth and advancement in the company. Would highly recommend to someone first starting out in the work force. Panera offers good wages"
good,"Productive, varying tasks.Mostly non repetitive work ."
good,Be ready for the rush. Panera can take a lot out of you but they are always willing to train in different areas of the restaurant and give you new skills.
good,It was a good environment.  Fast paced and stressfull at times. Would have stayed if not for some un foreseen circumstances. Panera Bread is a cultural place.
good,I am constantly learning new skills and tools that will help me right now and later on in life. Everyone I work with is supportive and we work as a team to get things done.
good,"Interview was very short and easy. Great place as first job. Every season we do a ""bread-bash"" were we gather to taste upcoming new seasonal items. Co-workers are helpful and very easy going. Room for advancement."
good,"Panera Bread has been a really good place to work. If you are in school, they are very flexible with scheduling. Great Culture and an overall great company to work for."
good,"Overall, Panera is a great company to work for. There are various areas in which you can be trained in. It is definitely not fast-paced like Mcdonalds. You do get to kind of work at your own pace as long as you do your job, which is really nice. You never get rushed really. You do get free pastries and food occasionally. I do think the pay should definitely be 9.00/hour at the very least because we are asked to do more than we should for the pay we receive. Management is pretty good. There are some managers that are more relaxed and understand us regular associates better than others who are more strict. If the pay was more it would be worth staying their longer. I also wish the hours were more consistent because my paychecks are always a hit or miss."
good,The place is fast food. With that being said what you see is what you get. You need customer service skills. The work experience can be fast paced at time. That is all.
good,"Panera was my first real introduction into the job world. I got to see how your supposed to handle yourself in a professional setting, while having to keep a good pace of making food. I had a lot of good times working there, and I would definitely say to someone that they should go and work there if they like that kind of job."
good,"I absolutely loved working at Panera Bread. I got along very well with my managers and coworkers. However, it is no secret Panera hires on a regular basis. We were often overstaffed and because of this, toward the end of my time there, I only received up to one 4 hour shift each week. I was sad to leave but was forced to due to the lack of hours I was receiving."
good,I enjoyed working at Panera Bread.  I started as an associate and worked my way to becoming an associate trainer.  The environment itself was very friendly.
good,"Managers and coworkers were friendly. Typical food service environment, stressful during the busy hours and sometimes very long days and some weeks with very little time off. Willing to reward the people with a good work ethic and good speed of service with either promotions or raises as were fit. I would recommend this to younger people in search of a steady and competitive pay while either going through school or during the summers."
good,"Ive met so many cool people since working at Panera. Loved the upbeat environment but was not satisfied with the pay I was receiving. I had been due for multiple raises I did not receive. I was training many people when I was not being paid as a trainer. My managers also ""forgot"" to send me to the trainers class because they thought I already was a trainer???"
good,I find working for this company is a very great and fun job to work for. The customers and workiers are polite and respectful and freat to be around..
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"20 sales calls per day with a goal of 100-120 per week.  "
good,"start off my day by checking my online orders, create a delivery log, produce and build all orders. deliver any orders that have to be send out. close out all transactions, make follow up calls and market."
good,I enjoyed working at Panera. Fast paced but steady. Good environment. Friendly staff. Minimum wage. Not a lot of work hours. Great good . Full time...
good,"it gets crazy during the busy hours there but the staff is great and you all make it through the day together"
good,The work is easy and our store managers are great. Could be making better money and pretty much no benefits unless you move up in the company but that's pretty typical for a restuarnt job. The food is good but I wish it was free instead of discounted (65%). Overall better than your average resturant job but could definitely do better.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you will work with, the hardest part of the job is closing the store. There is a lot of detail cleaning that has to be done. Very fast paced."
good,"as a manager, much was expected of me, anything that went wrong while I was there was considered my fault. as a night baker work like balance was unattainable, with unrealistic standards and unfair treatment biased on the store you were located at."
good,"very laid back easy job, perfect for young people. good discount on food. good management for the most part. met some really good people that are still my friends after quitting there"
good,"A typical day working at Panera was slightly stressful, this being because this high class work place is very popular and slightly understaffed. when you arrive to work you immediately start working, often times you don't know of there is something that the store is out of or what you need to get to make an order that is one the screen. I learned that in this kind of work environment you need to be able to stay focused and keep your work area clean. The management staff was wonderful, they would start a conversation with you, teach you new cool things that can lead to promotions and you could even communicate to you on a personal level, not always a professional level. The hardest part of this job was beating the clock, when I worked with the food department I was constantly challenged with beating the three minute maximum time a customer should wait to get their meal, this often made customers angry and yell at us for the inconvenience. The most enjoyable part of this job was after hours, when the store was close and it was time to clean up, you got to know your associates more and this led to life-long friendships in most cases."
good,"- It's fast paced and stressful. You're never not busy, and if you aren't busy, you're doing something wrong."
good,"good place to work, but can be stressful. Often hard to obtain more hours though. I have learned how to multi task very well as you  are often asked to do multiple things in a short span of time"
good,"Panera is a great place for people to work who are looking for corporate culture and advancement. The management are overall, very well trained and easy to speak with. The typical work day can be completely overwhelming or barley anything at all in the catering business. That's the hardest part - you are paid hourly and it wholly depends on the orders that come in."
good,"a typical day would be refilling dining room with things I might need before the lunch rush begins. I think I learned to move faster, the importance of time management. Management is great, very easy to talk to, flexable with my schedule, and reliable.   my most enjoyable part of the job, was our loyal customers, I loved talking to them and developing a relationship with them. Hardest part of the job was sometimes things were unorganized."
good,"Nice place ... alot of different people come in from college students to church groups! Nice at home feeling but can be busy during rush hours, all depends in what you're willing to do."
good,Good place to work. The advancement opportunities were not as good as I had hoped. Overall the management did well and it was a fine place to be employed.
good,"A typical day includes stocking, maintaining the display of the store, assisting customers and their needs, and providing assistance to not only customers, but coworkers as well."
good,I have worked here for many years while I was attending college. It was a great job to help me earn money while also taking 5 college courses. Since working there I have watched this specific Panera have both low and high peaks. The coworkers I have met there have made me enjoy working there the most.
good,I think that panera bread is a great place to work with nice people but keeps you on your feet at times. The managers for the most part are amazing and will let you take your break at reasonable times. They aren't too strict and the pay is great.
good,"Really Enjoyed working here , made good money . just like any other job . Basically an upscale fast food place . except it isnt fast food , the food is fresh every day ."
good,"great people to work with, always enjoyed coming into work, great environment. No trouble with any co workers or managers, service is great, overall a great place to work at"
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Good job overall, just management keeps changing, management unorganized, rude and sometimes unprofessional but if you by pass that it's a okay job, fast paced and always have to be alert."
good,"Very stressful during peak hours , not enough staff. overall good easy clean up at night , overtime sometimes , easy to advance , discounts were great"
good,Overall Panera was a wonderful entry level job. It kept one busy while providing experience in the workforce. This job helped my to think on my feet to fix any problems that might pop up. They also were extremely understanding of my busy school schedule.
good,Their was no typical day at work. Each day you worked a different shift and each shift requires different things that need to be done. I loved working at here and i was great at my job. I would say the hardest part about this job was the crazy hours.
good,i loved working there for the tine i was there. i just didnt get along with the manager all to well but the enviroment and people working with me were great.
good,I enjoyed my time at Panera Bread. Personally I believe that Panera is a greedy company. The prices for our products were high and every time minimum wage went up the employees would suffer. benefits were only offered to full time workers after a year of employment. One good thing was that there was a lot of room for advancement and good employees would get the max pay raise at every review time.
good,"great place with great food, but I rather be a customer because the customers complain about the littlest things and calls the manager, they always want discounts"
good,"Great job at first, but after awhile the managers became a** holes. Everyone was quiting left and right because the management just sucked and they ruined it all."
good,I learn that s is necessary to keep your customers happy. It is important to remain calm because sometimes thing are difficult. You must work through it.
good,Great place to work. If you are btw 20s and 30s all of the workers hangout together. It can be very busy. Customers can be rude but every where you go can be like that
good,"Working here overall was a great experience and working with the people were great, management sometimes can be a little disorganized. An incident occurred in which it stressed me out, and I found it best for me to leave the job. I might not have done so very professionally, but I did remain nice and civil, because I did feel bad about suddenly leaving."
good,Working the cash registers and maintaining the front end was always expected. Coworkers were extremely friendly and helpful. The most enjoyable part of this job was meeting the needs of the customers.
good,"I loved working with the people in my cafe, but I had issues with upper management that wasn't on sight.  I was the lead baker and was required to be on call 24/7."
good,Not a job for the lazy by any means. Team based environment with fast paced lunches to give fast friendly service. Would recommend for anyone wanting to make fast money for the summer.
good,"I love the mission of this company, 100% clean food and any pastries, breads, bagels, etc. are donated at the end of the day instead of thrown out and wasted. Dealing with managers there is a little more difficult than it should be, as well as receiving amount of hours needed as an individual. Those struggles do also depend on the location I suppose."
good,It was a pretty decent job depending on what you like. My managers were cool and fun to work with. I loved all of my regular customers which we had a lot of.
good,"A typical day of work consisted of clocking in, checking the board as to what you would be doing for the day and putting on your apron, hat and name tag. Next you would report to where ever it is you were stationed for that day. I did everything from busing tables and cleaning bathrooms to working the cash register and cleaning/setting up and stocking for the next shift. I most enjoyed meeting new people and making total strangers feel welcome in the restaurant."
good,"Everything went well its just doing delivery and driving your personal car didn't work out well for me"
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"It is a nice place to work at with a friendly environment to which they provide. I would recommend working here part-time in the summer or in school. However, I would not recommend staying here for long as it may also become stressful."
good,My time with Panera Bread was a good experience teaching me to work at quick paces and under slight stress. I worked part time for a few months until I joined the military to pursue a different career.
good,A typical day at work consists of talking and being active throughout the day. Stocking is a need and repeating back orders. Accurate amount of money.
good,"A typical day would be opening up your register,followed by laying out the pastries. The franchise is busy from the moment it opens. The work place is very exciting and energetic."
good,"It's a great job for a while but they tend to overhire, and that means less hours and then less pay. It gets annoying to try and get hours because there are also many managers."
good,A typical day is not typical at all working there meaning it's always changing. How to make salads & sandwiches along with other things.  All the managers are great.
good,"The working environment is fun when it's not too busy, but it can get pretty stressful and fast-paced when there's a big line. Coworkers become great friends and most everyone works well together."
good,Every day is different with different challenges. I learned to be self sufficient and have confidence in myself. Your other co-workers become friends. The workplace culture can be hard at times because of the pay structure for incoming employees. They start the pay so low that it's hard to attract the best candidates.
good,"I would have to get the restaurant ready to open.  This included setting up the coffee station and checking the tables to make sure they were all cleaned.  Emptied out the trash when needed and also used the dishwasher. Assisted customer if needed and other duties that came up and needed attended to.  "
good,In the food industry I would definitely recommend Panera Bread. I got amazing training from others in the company that came from all across the state to our one location when first opening. You can really rely on your co-workers and managers to help you out as much as possible. the lunch and dinner rushes would sometimes get a little stressful but everyone helps each other out with anything they need to.
good,Panrea has fabulous food made with good ingredients and they donate what is left every night to people in need. When there are so many people whe need food and so much being thrown away i wish they would all donate like n panera.
good,"I worked at Panera Bread for a little over a year, I didn't receive any raises and, most of the time, employees did not show up for their shifts. I learned a lot about food preparation and health and safelty regulations for my state. I was always busy, which for me is a plus. Overall, it's a good first job to get you into the swing of the food business."
good,Great company to work for. Very busy and makes the day go by fast. I've learned to deal with difficult customers and fix sticky situations. I've learned how to do lots of things including inventory and food cost management.
good,some days can be very busy.always stay busy even when we are slow clean on our down time.very clean.good food.love meeting new people.love everyday costumers
good,Working at Panera requires a very fast pace. We can go from absolute dead silence to a line to the door in a better of 2 minutes. I am constantly running around doing a bit of everything to help everyone out.
good,It is a fast paced job with new challenges every day.  I spent 14 years with the company and wished to stay but could not due to personal reason.  Everyone becomes a family.
good,In this position I made all schedules for employees and wrote all orders for dry stock and product needed to function on a day to day basis. I ran customer service to ensure that guests were being treated with the utmost respect and I was incharge of the staff daily.
good,I for the most part enjoyed working at Panera Bread because everyone was friendly and worked well together. However the managers were often not on the same page and it made things difficult at times.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"I enjoyed working there, not much creativity but some structure is good once in a while. I liked my bosses, very understanding and passionate about providing a good service to our customers."
good,Working at Panera Bread has taught me patience and to be efficient. I learned to make sure bread and pastries were done at a certain time and working at tough hours. There was a great work environment and my co workers were friendly.
good,"Very easy to move up in this workplace - usually a bunch of high schoolers and college students as employees so its a fun workplace, but when that lunch rush hits you better be ready. Great about food safety regulations too"
good,I worked for the company for over 6 years.  I worked my way up to assistant manager in only a year.  I enjoyed my time there.  I love working with the public and learning how to run a successful cafe.
good,Which cafe you work at depends on how your typical day goes and your experience. Some cafes do crazy business so you'd always be moving and preparing food. I've also noticed that some cafes are more laid back than others. The cafe i work at tries to make us feel like family. We'll do things for each other or sometimes our bosses will buy us appreciation gifts. They hold meeting every couple of months to keep us up to date with new products and to give us recognitions. The recognitions can range from how many years you've been there to being the associate of the year or quarter. They also hold events for associates that want to participate. Some examples are The Panera Bread Olympics or the 5K walk/run for children.
good,"Panera Bread is a great entry-level job. Friendly environment and great co-workers.The management is great, but sometimes the hours are not. You may not get the desired hours you would like to work."
good,good place to work but would not give enough hours even though they were short staffed. good management for the most part. they worked with you and your outside life
good,I liked this job overall but the pay was not enough when I was working there. The management team at every location I traveled to was very understanding.
good,Loved the accuracy of portions for the salads and sandwiches. Typically I would come in the morning make the panini sandwiches. The already prepped and portion meats helped when it came to making a salad for an order. I loved racing against the clock and making sure I was very sufficient and fast.
good,"prep work, salad and sandwich making. this is one of the best fast food cultures to work for, i know.  I use to be a manager of several fast food places"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of making salads and sandwiches. There is a lot more to the job than that, but there are several different positions, each with their own set of guidelines, rules, and expectations."
good,"Managers are flexible and understanding, and the co-workers are upbeat and helpful. A normal day at work would be coming in and preparing for a big lunch rush, and after the rush passes, work usually consists of re-stocking food and product while cleaning one's work station."
good,"Everyone was very nice and easy going, job was very easy to learn and management was very nice for the most part. Would recommend this job to a friend or associate."
good,"Don't get me wrong, I love working at Panera as a manager, but being 18 and a manager really takes a lot of energy from me. I put 40+ hours in every week and I still live paycheck to paycheck. I have to micromanage almost all of our staff, help them close to get out at a reasonable time, and in charge of any money at the end of the night and paperwork, then I have to deal with any unhappy customer. I moved up pretty quick, which I'm glad I did, but I want out of the food industry unless I'm getting tips and able to actually communicate with a couple that comes in for a meal. The hardest part would be being 18 and managing my own peers. It got very hard when kids are constantly calling off or not showing up and its hard for us to find someone to work for them. The best part about it is that everyone is very lenient and will help you out as much as they can. I do not have any intentions of putting the company down, but I have worked there long enough."
good,This job was an easy but satisfying experience. I got to work in a rewarding environment. This job taught me many of the interpersonal skills I have now..
good,The Panera atmosphere and mission is amazing. It's a fun and fast paced place to work. Most of the managers are very fun and understanding. The employees are great as well.
good,"Can get very busy at times. Sometimes customers can make it stressful, but overall a great place to work. Fellow employees are easy to work with. You are able to learn good people skills and how to work hard."
good,this company was a step up from where I worked before. There were oppertunties to move up. however turnover was a little high at times. I would love to see this company forgive former employees
good,"I've met my best friends while working for Panera, but as a job, it is awful. Sure, you can move around all you want and have job security but management always sucks and the customers suck even more."
good,Hours can be very flexible to fit your schedule. Days will get very busy. Managers are usually very helpful and attentive to your needs. Customers can be very nice.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"I have worked my way up the ladder in this company, and will forever be grateful for all of the experience and opportunities they have given me. I wish I could continue on with the company, but the business is not coming in for my department, and there has been an onslaught of upper-level management changes that do not translate well on the cafe/every-day operations side of things. That being said, I couldn't give a better review of this job, and I think the feeling is mutual. I look forward to finding another company I can call home."
good,I learned a great deal about marketing and fast paced work. Overall a decent place to have worked and grown. Would recommend to any who search an honest place of employment.
good,"A typical day at Panera was always a fun one. The co-works became more like family then friends. Management cares a lot for their employees. The hardest part about my job was when we were short-handed. The most enjoyable part of my day was closing time. We went around the food line to collect breads for local woman and men shelters. We were aloud to listen to music, sing and dance. I learned that having a good team to work with makes all the difference."
good,I have made many friends at work and enjoy the atmosphere. It is close to campus so we get a lot of student guests like myself. Great benefits and flexible schedule.
good,The company ensures that you have what you need to be successful in your work day. Co-workers are friendly and work hours and as many as you want up to 40 hours.
good,"A typical day at work for me would be either working consolidation on the food production line or working on the cash registers. Often times, because I have more experience then the younger newer hires in the cafe, I had to do more work or exert myself more to compensate for their inexperience. I learned a lot about how to work well with customers to get them the most satisfying experience possible,and I learned how to work quickly and efficiently in a time based setting. Management is typically friendly, however, at times favoritism is pretty evident, and they reacted very harshly when anyone would request off for a certain date. Co-workers were typically very young, but friendly. The hardest part of the job is that you need to constantly push to get things out in a timely fashion, which can become very stressful in a high volume store. The most enjoyable part of the job was that, once you learned every position, the job became very easy since nothing would change and it was quite easy to establish consistency."
good,very Very busy constant work every single minute your there you are indeed doing something even cleaning toilets to making food to cleaning the panini presses
good,"needs improvement in management, I looked forward to work because of co-workers. the hardest part of the job was management issues and the speed."
good,"A typical day at Panera Bread is learning to love customers feedback of their food and our service. Management at my store, care about our customers and their employees. Best part of working for the company is seeing our regulars come back because of our service."
good,"Great place to work. High expectations, good management. Food is good, coworkers are fun to work with. Franchise restaurants are much better than corporate restaurants."
good,Panera is committed to its customers and offering the highest quality ingredients. Fast paced and fun filled everday with customers from every walk of life.
good,"I absolutely love working at Panera Bread. I usually work as a cashier, so I deal with customers every day that I work. From working at Panera, I've gained experience in the working field and I have Panera to thank for giving me a start and taking a chance on a teenager. My co-workers are so very nice and extremely helpful(with the selected few who aren't). The management that I have at the Panera Bread that I work at, is absolutely great. I love my managers, they are very understand and truly do care about each one of their employees. The Panera Bread that I work at it really is a family. We have so much fun working all together to have a ""loaf of bread in every arm"","
good,Panera is a good family restaurant and a good atmosphere to work for.  They are very understanding when it comes to school and personal matters.
good,Schedule flexibility closed Christmas and Thanksgiving shorter hours for other holidays. Employees are great. Great local following with wonderful customers.
good,fast paced environment with great people and customers. Healthy choices for all. environment is enjoyable.........................
good,I have recommended working at Panera Bread to many people for their first job because like I previously mentioned it is a great first job. The workers are really helpful on guiding you. It does get busy and can get hectic at time but is easy to pull through.
good,"Great place to work at with great people. A positive attitude throughout the store where the employees try their hardest to make Panera an everyday oasis for every customer that walks in. I enjoy working with my coworkers, we have fun but also get the job done. The managers also do a great job of helping out when things get busy. It is fairly busy on an average day."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Usually the day would start off slow since it was a higher end fast food restaurant, around lunch time of course we would get our lunch rush and it would start around 12 and end about 1:45. While working at Panera I learned a lot about different things from new foods to meeting all different kinds of people. The management was good but there is always good managers and those who slacked a little in their job, but overall the out of both stores I worked at they were ran very well by the general manager. The job was not a hard job overall but everyone has bad and good days. I got along with everyone I worked with and always tried to make the day enjoyable for everyone. I did my job to my fullest potential so i could never say ""I wish I would have done this and not that"" I always made sure to do everything correct and efficiently since I was a certified trainer and key associate. Giving the other employees someone to look up to and being there for any questions they had if they had trouble with anything made the job worth having."
good,"It was a great place to work, fast paced environment, I've learned a lot about customer service and gained experience working in a restaurant. Our managers was very understanding and professional, My co workers as confident and always willing to help new employees, the most enjoyable part of work was when we all work as a team to get stuff done"
good,Panera is a interesting place to work with a great chance to move up in management. A average day consist of constant motion and alot of happy faces.
good,Panera Bread is a competitive work environment with evolving policies and procedures. I gained many skills while working for this company and every day learned something new. This was the best job I've ever had the pleasure of working.
good,"Management was very professional gave great training , good hours and coworkers and I worked well as a team and met store goals daily."
good,The important and priceless part of my job at Panera is the joy I have with serving the customers and always with a smile and greeting.
good,"On a normal day, I'd show up early and get to work on the dishes. I learned that showing up early gave me plenty of time to organize and plan out my methodology for the day. The management did a pretty good job of keeping it all together, but occasionally instructions would get distorted between the 3 of them. My coworkers were mostly supportive, although I did see some tantrums thrown. The hardest part of the job, inducing such tantrums, was simply the overwhelming mess that customers are able to make sometimes, but I did get to meet many, very colorful people during my time working there."
good,"At panera I am a versitile employee I know hands down every position and how to close each station whether its cashier, table server, or food production. Such great teamwork most employees and managers are helpful! WIith my advancements at the company and me wanting to step up the ladder in terms of responsibilities and titles there has been a lack of effort and constant hindrance from the management team."
good,"This company has taught me much about customer service, the food industry, and the importance of bringing warmth and speed of service to every customer."
good,"Very busy environment, lots of guest interaction, very high turnover.  Working with the employees was the best part of my days.  Learned employee scheduling, inventory management, and lots of guest interaction."
good,"None stop customers come in for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I learn how to stay on my toes because there's no room for mistakes. The management work with you as long you can communicate with them. its a fun place working with other people that can do their job and have fun doing it. The hardest part of the job was sometimes unorganized. The most enjoyable part is that u have good benefits."
good,"always bringing new items to the menu and everything is so healthy, great working environment to work at, but the work life balance isn't there"
good,"Panera Bread in Oshkosh WI was a great place to work. There was always oppurtunities for growth. It was a new cafe, so they were still working some of the things out with the management, but over all it was a good place to work for long term. I would have stayed there longer if I would not have had to relocate for my family."
good,"During my few months at working at Panera Bread, I absolutely enjoyed it. I loved seeing the familiar faces and I loved assisting guests."
good,I did not have a typical day when it came to the hours. They bounced around every day. Most of the managers were good and helped out when they were needed. My co-workers were very helpful when it came to what was needed to be done for the customers. The hardest part of the job was getting the customers what they wanted and out in a timely manner. Especially when we were busy. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to make the customers happy and getting to know them.
good,"It was a fun experience in the food industry, I learned a lot about running a restaurant and communicating with coworkers and customers. The hardest part was waking up early for the 4:30am shifts, but it was very enjoyable servicing the customers and greeting regular guests."
good,Working at Panera consist of something different every day. i loved seeing my regular customers on the daily basis and having their order ready to go. When i had issues or concerns I needed to express the manager on duty or general manager listened to my concerns. Also understood that life happens and that there were things that i couldn't control that may at times effect my work. But not in a major way.
good,"Fast pace learning environment, fun to work with co workers makes working in peace easy. The most enjoyable part about working at Panera is the opportunities you get to learn in the kitchen."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Panera is a great place to work if you are a student or have another job. They will work around any schedule. Only problem is the management, they are so unorganized and unprofessional. As people outside of work, they are great but as managers, no."
good,The first job I really ever felt comfortable and felt like I belonged. Panera helped me grow as a person and as a professional. Panera definitely provides a good place for someone who is looking to start a career in management.
good,"Company has good vision and making great strides to improve food served to the public."
good,As trainer always had to look for the opportunities to improve workers skill which ultimately improves  the guest experience and increases the profit margin. i have learned that people need to be reminded that their work and efforts make a difference in prosperity of any business and business means the people who work there. therefore training matters for creating a better and more secure profitable business.
good,lots of room to move up very competitive job don't get caught up in drama. I would work there again just not looking to be in food service anymore!
good,"Good Potential but not enough money. I was also hoping to have a fast potential to go further in the company."
good,Good place to work. Pretty busy location.  I enjoyed the interaction with customers and the busyness of it.  Management was good.  There was the opportunity to learn new things and work different areas.
good,"Was a pretty fun place to work, nice co-workers and a great employee discount the environment was nice and inviting for families and children. Very health conscious"
good,I worked here while I attended college. I was fun to work and the job made it possible to afford the small necessities. Management worked with us to complete job tasks and interactions with the customers was always enjoyable.
good,"A typical day of work is greeting and welcoming customers into the Panera bread lifestyle. I learned how to properly handle food as well as adopt a different view and culture of food while working. Management is always there around you to help keep things moving at a steady constant pace throughout the day. Your co-workers are very bright, energetic and love the job that they do. Hardest part of the job is maintaining a warm welcoming demeanor even if you have a bad day as well as not being able to slack off. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting recognized by managers during company events and trying out the new foods before they start to sell them."
good,"baked goods. helped customers. check products to see if i have to bake more. ice, frost, prepare baked goodies down to spec"
good,"A typical day at work would be showing up at five in the morning to open your designated station for the day. It became frustrating when there was never a full staff to do this like there was supposed to be, but it all turned out ok it just took some extra work. My co-workers were always helpful, management during my time however was lacking. It was easier to go to a co-worker for help then to a manager. The most enjoyable part of this job was seeing the everyday customers and getting to know them and there orders by heart. I learned that there are two types of people in the work force, those who do and those who wait for things to be done, which helps while working with other people and finding out which one they are."
good,"Panera gives back to the local community.  There is a ""no jerks"" policy here.  There are so many levels of opportunity within the company."
good,A busy environment which was a struggle sometimes. But having some of the best co workers made a day so much easier.  Busy lunches and dinners sometimes under staffed.
good,"AT typical day at work, I greet customers as they walk in. I help new customers over the menu if they can not decide what they would like. I learn on a day to day basic how to control any situation I am put in by an upset or disappointed customer. Managers assist me on help I need to complete my job appropriately. I enjoy my co-workers we all get along if someone is in need of help or assistants with and customers, etc. I would say the hardest part if the job is having to help a customer who has had a really bad day and is not happy with their food items or drinks. The most enjoyable part of my day is talking to my customers especially the regular everyday customers, talking about their day new things going on in their life."
good,"I have nothing bad to say about Panera Bread. Great company, great food and great people. Some of the managers were tough to get along with because they were all business but that was okay. it was hard to get hours even though I had worked there for over a year. I was also promised raises, but never got one; I never complained I just wished they had more organization."
good,"Overall, I have enjoyed my time at Panera. I've learned that there can be jobs with a flexible schedule, competitive wages, wonderful coworkers and great management all in one place. I've also learned a lot about food culture which has been neat."
good,"A typical day at work would be, walking in getting ready in the back room and going to the station that i was assigned that day. Wether it be line cook for dish washer for the day. My time at Panera bread i learned how to make some of the food they serve there as well as washing several hundred dishes and cleaning everything beforre leaving. My co-workers were incredibly friendly and nice people always excited to see each other walk in for their shifts. The hardest part of my job was probably the washing several hundred dishes continuously within a certain time limit so you could leave. There were always more dishes coming in and sometimes during the rush hour of lunch there wasnt enough and you had to strain to go into over drive to get the dishes out there when needed. But the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to cook some of the food and get it to the people."
good,"Working during the meal rushes keeps you on your toes and challenges you to think fast in high stress situations. If you communicate well with your coworkers, a twenty person line is quickly dwindled down to a two person line. The hardest part is keeping a consistent pace and remaining friendly and welcoming to every customer who comes in, especially during a meal rush."
good,"must clock in no earlier then 5 minutes before scheduled start of shift, paperwork is already out for what area each employee is working in, usually I get right to work in my assigned area which is almost the same area everyday. There are a lot of younger employees so it is hard to focus because no one seems to care about the goals of the job and is more focused on making friends after work. Hardest part of the job is keeping up with the demands of the lunch rush and customer requests and trying to focus on doing what seems like 20 different things at once and trying to listen to each voice and making the customer happy. The only real enjoyable part of the job is making connections with the everyday and or regular customers that seem to have a realistic outlook on like and don't refer to the café as just a job as management and the coworkers do."
good,Overall I like working here. It would be a great first job. Flexible schedule. Fantastic managers. The worst part about the job would be closing and not getting out of the store until 10-11:30 pm.
good,"I enjoyed the position at first, baking overnight and taking pride in the amount of work that goes into the baking process.  It's a solid job that will teach you hard work with decent pay, however the hours are not set schedules and traveling is required.  Managers are overworked and under staffed, communication is lacking and most employees are negative despite their ""no jerks"" policy."
good,"I made sandwiches, and salads during lunch rush as part of a team. it was busy but efficient. The pay was decent, and the management and co-workers worked well as a team."
good,"Typical work week is scheduled 47.5 hours, generally worked actually 55+ hours. Hours vary between 5am and 12am depending upon store and staffing needs. The most enjoyable part of the job was our customer base, we have an amazing group of regular customers. Also I really do enjoy the people I work with."
good,"I have worked for Panera bread for eight years. While the job itself is extremely easy there are times that you will experience as rough passage. The benefits are minimal as it is a minimum wage company. However, you can advance yourself across the career lattice if you have a desire."
good,This kind of customer service taught me excellent multi-tasking skills and different ways of leadership. I took notice that I thrived in a fast paced environment.
good,"I would open the bakery by putting all the pastrys on the pans and making them all look presentable. Management wasn't too strict, strict enough to get the work done. CoWorkers were all cordial and worked together well. The hardest part is always during the lunch rush and when your shift is up. The most enjoyable part is just being around the happy people and working together without conflict and making everyones day that comes into the cafe."
good,Overall my time at panera bread gave me great customer service and let me see a variety of people. I loved the people I worked with and the regular customers who came in. the Management could have been improved
good,"- Know how much bake goods are in demand and added"
good,panera was a clean well managed work place with great workers but sadly poor management or hours.i learn to be a team player and that following codes every day saves you in the long run.
good,Very fast paced and must learn quick. Hardest part of the job is lunch time rushes and the most enjoyable is watching the satisfied customers.
good,"Working at cafe oasis can be a lot of hard work, but it is constantly with a fun and caring team. It is a family owned business and that family culture is great."
good,The work environment was great. Co-workers were amazing. Management could be better. The customers were swell and i and i formed many friendships while working at this establishment. Everyday was a new adventure and new products were constantly added.
good,"I go into work, I clock in and go to my manager so I can get a cash drawer for my cashier position. I greet our customers as they walk in and take there order.  In between of taking our customers orders, I sweep the floor, i wipe down the counters and just make sure everything is clean and presentable.  i like working with my coworkers they were great people to work with, I would always look forward to going into work because of my co workers. I would say the hardest part of my job was cleaning the bathroom and taking out the trash because I never look forward on doing that. I learned great customer service, working as a team and having group effort, being organized on everything I do and  i learned to have great communication skills because everything is about communication."
good,"A typical day working for Publix would be bagging the groceries for customers and stocking shelves in different aisles. I learned to be honest, respectful, being motivated to work and always getting there early before clocking in. All the managers were really nice and friendly to pretty much all coworkers. The hardest part of the job was focusing so much on detail rather than learning during the slow period  hours with some of the managers. The enjoyable time was helping customers out to there car with there groceries."
good,"Usually I come in five minutes before my shift begins. Pull my drawer, count it. Hop on register for 90% of my shift. I learn something new every day & there is never a dull moment. My co-workers are extremely helpful & positive & I enjoy just about all of them. The hardest part of the job would be dining room. You are responsible for so many different things that you are constantly running from task to task, but it does make the day go by much faster. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to deal with the public all day. You meet an array of people and you get used to your repeat customers."
good,"Work the cashier while running orders through to the kitchen and to the bakery."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"A typical day at Panera Bread involved me working the register, or working in the drive through. I usually was the person who talked over the speaker and took peoples orders, or was a cashier.  The management there was not very strong due to them picking favorites. My co-workers were fun to be around and we always worked off of each other. The most enjoyable part of the job was making customer connections."
good,Learned how to have stronger customer service skills and work as a team.
good,"Working as the opening cashier at Panera  Bread is a challenging and busy job.  Everything needs to be set up in the morning since everything is freshly baked and brewed.  The entire bakery needs to be set up in a pleasing manner, several flavors of coffee brewed and registers ready to go.  There is a morning rush and a lunch rush for the morning cashier that requires interaction with customers with efficiency and accuracy.  The hardest part of my job was keeping everything clean, presentable and restocked while handling customers efficiently.  I enjoyed it all!"
good,"Panera Bread has helped me learn so much about what it would be like to run a business. I worked at Taco Bell from the time that I was sixteen, but felt like I needed a better work environment. At Panera, I've not only grown professionally, but also as a better person outside of the workplace. Panera has great culture values and I am proud to be apart of the team. A typical day at work involves running an effective shift while delegating tasks to associates in order to manage the flow of business. My managers and co-workers are very friendly and easy to work with. I feel respected at Panera, and I respect my associates. The hardest part of my job is dealing with dissatisfied guests. The most enjoyable part of my job is the opportunity to be in charge and learning more about the business aspect of the company."
good,"its an okay place to work."
good,"I've worked at a couple of different Panera's and they were great. Good discounts, flexible hours and the atmosphere is great. Everyone works as a team which is very positive as far as food service goes i'd rather work here than anywhere else!"
good,"Arrive and keep are clean"
good,"Panera has been great, I am just looking for something new. Besides the long hours, Panera treats their employees very well."
good,"I enjoy working at Panera Bread. The company cares a lot about the community and do a great job helping people. My co-workers are great, we get along well and have created a family relationship. My favorite part are the challenges that come with working at a customer driven business."
good,"A general day at work can be depended on who opened that morning and what kind of mood the manager and opening crew have set. The moods of the employees usually sets the mood of the store. A stressed environment will lead to an overall stress of the store."
good,"Panera Bread can be a great company to work for, the always changing menu is always bring in guests to try new things and keeps the staff on its toes always learning something new. Most of the managers are great and always helpful. At my franchise the owner and co-owner stop in from time to time and I think that shows they care about their cafes. The guest are my favorite part of the job they make the day so much better, from  the regulars that feel more like family than guest at a place you work to the guest that have never come in before. Panera has also taught me so much about food safety, food prep, training, and customer service that will help me with bigger and better things."
good,"Come in, I would get assigned to a position in the restaurant, and do the best at it!"
good,"Duties are as followed Clean and detail kitchen, equipment, organize produce delivery , assist in consolidation of food handling , train new cooks and complete a nightly inventory."
good,"A typical work day for me is to come into work make sure everything is clean and stocked before and in between rushes. During rushes I make what ever product is ordered, and make sure it looks good and is to the customers liking. The co-workers are great, its a relaxing environment and upbeat. I enjoy talking to people so that is the best part about the job, whether its the co-workers or the customers I enjoy having a conversation with them."
good,"I had a great time while I was there. The best part of the job was that our number goal was to make customers happy. No matter what was going on, customers always came first. That friendliness towards the customers also went towards coworkers. Overall great experience."
good,"Working at Panera is not of course the worst job we do manage to have fun while working and the work isn't exactly what you would consider hard labor. It is however a very fast paced environment that consists of multitasking and attention to detail.The co-workers are mostly younger ( high school and college) not all have a great work ethic so there is a lot of ""slack"" to pick up but other than the occasional laziness everyone is great! The hardest part of the job is dealing with angry customers and trying to please them, I had no idea people get so upset over the smallest things when it comes to their food and that plays  a huge roll in attention to detail which you learn very early on. The most enjoyable part honestly are the perks of free beverages and highly discounted food along with the family esqu atmosphere created among employees and management."
good,Panera Bread is a wonderful place to work and I love the people I work with. I have learned a lot about myself while working here far as working independently and knowing my worthof the hard work I put forth. Our management team could be better there are jus times when they feel like they don't have to support the associates thru rush hour periods.
good,"Busy environment, active caring employees that truly care about performing at the top of their game."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"A typical work day would include fast pace work, accuracy, a high volume environment, and making the customers happy. The managers are pretty big on getting the orders out as fast as we can and in a timed order with being accurate. The co-workers are very easy to get along with and very outgoing. The hardest part of the job is being accurate all the time because everyone makes mistakes, but the key point is to always pay attention and stay focused so that less mistakes can be made. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people everyday and greeting my valued customers who may come in on a daily basis, and just keeping the customers satisfied."
good,"I started with Panera as a line/prep person. I worked my way up to a trainer, then supervisor and then promoted to assistant manager."
good,"Panera is a great place to work. The management staff in the stores all are helpful and friendly. Panera is focused on customer service-I love the fact that everyone I know says, ""I love Panera!"""
good,"Panera is a job in which one would learn every aspect of great customer service. Its friendly and oriented in a way that includes its customers as a part of the ""family"" instead of just people. You feel comfortable and cozy, between the workers, the atmosphere and the other customers its truly a warm and welcoming experience. I learned how to prepare food, I learned the absolute necessities in a food business, the prep, the creating, the maintaining. I learned of the management aspects, the numbers and paperwork necessary to run the business. Overall it was a very exciting, and amazing opportunity to work for Panera the many years I have. I learned a lot and will take everything to my next endeavor."
good,"Panera is a more relaxed environment than most food service establishments. In my opinion, the only hard part of the job would be the occasional upset customer. If you can maintain a positive attitude and good work ethic you will do fine."
good,"My typical day at work would be busy and fast paced. I learned how to work the machines. The hardest part of the job was cleaning the entire dining room area by myself, in a short amount of time. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers."
good,"Management team was the best!!!"
good,"I was the GM so I controlled all day to day operations in the store, and developed my team to be successful."
good,A typical day at Panera is similar to just about any other restaurant. You have an allotted time to complete an order and you are consistently on the move with something to do. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with orders if you receive a rush of customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know your co-workers and regular customers.
good,"I have worked for Panera for five years. During that time, I have had the opportunity to be involved in a large number of projects that are focused on increasing efficiency and scalability, relieving the field of manual, administrative work, while supporting high levels of growth."
good,"Not Enough Hours,some coworkers are nice some are rude, Gets Busy and Work load goes by quicker"
good,"There was your usuals and then your first timers. I learned about the diversity of the company and how the people really enjoy themselves. The management was somewhat unorganized a little and it sometimes threw me off. My co-workers is what made the job enjoyable and able to go along the day. The hardest part about the job was being able to understand some of the customers requests. The most enjoyable part, the food!"
good,"My typical day at work either closing or coming in mid shift i would always write a list of what I needed to restock or to close for the whole entire night. It was always very slow, but when it picked up it picked up, their was no room for you to walk away from the register. My managers all had a story to tell you that made you laugh for the day, and my co workers even though it was so many we all knew each other. The hardest part of the job was when the menus would change, and its always so much ingredients and products in the food it was hard kind of explaining, so you had to always grab a book with all the ingredients in case they were allergic to it. The most enjoyable part was having that freedom to interact with the customers, do sit with them for a few minutes laugh before its time to go back to work. Almost like your not working at all. "
good,"I start the day around 5 A.M  stocking the bakery, form there I take care of the guest until my end of the day at work. "
good,"Job was from 6am to 2:30pm,worked well with co-workers,the hardest part of job was being in the freezer for a certain amount of time. What i liked most about the job was when we had our busy days,love working at a fast pace."
good,Days at Panera are sometimes high pressure and hectic during sports seasons when we can run very quick tickets and service times. However our staff always pulls together like a team and helps each other out. Overall a good stable job for those with high energy and good people skills.
good,Fun and exciting work place. Great food and everyday is a new challenge. Customers are the number one focus and making sure they have a great experience is key. The food is fresh and offers many different varieties for everyone.
good,Management and co-workers are great understanding people. Love working with them. Most of my days are routine work and I normally stay until 4PM. Our lunch rush can be from 11AM-3PM. Between 3-4PM is our down time when we pick up slack and get things clean for the next shift.
good,"A typical day consists of everything from preping all of the meat and vegatables for the day, to serving the customer face to face"
good,Great place to start. The workers are very nice teach you everything you need to know and helps you out.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is working with those managers and co workers who want to work and at the same time make it a friendly place to work. As a trainer i learned that we need to step up in case we are working with someone that barely got in the company.
good,"I loved this job and if it had benefits I would have never left. Co-workers work hard together, and management is great. It is a fun environment as well as a busy environment to work in. With your co-workers aid and management help anything could easily be accomplished."
good,The management team is overall pretty decent but sometimes they put work before the needs of their employees.
good,"I would go to work and start ringing customers orders in and just have a good time. The management was pretty good. My co-workers were the best, we always laughed and had a good time while working. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers."
good,"I was the head of line so I had many people relying on me to be punctual and consistent each day. The leads on the floor each day were very helpful and considerate. They were understanding of certain task that i was unable to complete on my own. As with any work place you have the co-workers that you get along with and then some not so much but at the end of the day we all still worked together to get the job done. I can't say anything about my job was hard after awhile of working it all becomes routine, but i would say the best part about working for Panera was knowing that what i did made a difference each day."
good,"Multi tasking, productive, cash handling, customer wowing skills. A very friendly atmosphere."
good,good place to work i would tell everyone to go eat they because it is a goog place to chill and relax
good,"Work was always a blast! The workers were friendly and the management was great! If you had any issues, the management was always so supportive and tried to be understanding. I learned how to work in a drive thru and the pressure is 10 times worse than working in a regular cafe or resaurant setting. It didn't take much time at all to get up to standards. The hardest part of the job I think was during our brunch hour. We would get a rush sometimes 3-4 hrs long and be running around like chickens with our heads cut off. But, we always made the best of the situation even when we had something go wrong. There wasn't one moment in particular that I didn't find enjoyable, it was all very fun! I'm glad i had the opportunity to work at such a great company!"
good,"I typically worked as a cashier or in food preparation. I enjoyed being a cashier because of the opportunity to interact with the customers. At this particular location, we had several regular customers. It always made a day of work a little more enjoyable seeing a familiar face. When I first began working at Panera, the work environment was extremely fun. I worked with several of my friends from high school, and we all operated as a team. Management changed frequently as the restaurant started losing business, and the work ethic of new employees slowly decreased as well. After three years, I decided I needed a change of scenery and welcomed a new job as a home health aide."
good,"Overall not a bad place to work. Decent starting pay for just a cashier, and they do offer affordable benefits. Not a lot of opportunity to grow. In the full year I worked there, not once was I offered advancement although I expressed interest."
good,Panera is a good company to work for. Their training program was very in depth and they really set you up for success. My co-workers were really supportive and great to work with. The hardest part of the job for me was learning the quick service aspect of the restaurant. I have a fine dining background so it took a little time to adjust. I think the most enjoyable part of my job was managing the staff. I had a great group of people underneath me that worked realy hard.
good,Good company with some hard working individuals.
good,"It's nice and busy. It's a good place to work, we all work together to get the job done and help the guest."
good,Prep for the morning and lunch. Make sandwichs and also worked as a cashier.
good,I have learned how to be more independent at work and how to communicate with customers. The management is good and very friendly. They are easy to get along with. The co-workers are also friendly and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job is making sure I have all my cleaning duities done by the end of the week. Sometimes it is busy I cannot find time to get them done. What I like the most is that it is a very independent job. I do not need a lot of assistance from others.
good,I oh ok place work. I think need training people little bit better. Always told thing different by people at Panera bread. Panera find pretty nice people. Few people that can be mean. You get that everywhere.
good,"it wasnt a bad work place. was my first job was there for 2 years, pretty demanding, they kept changing everything kept coming out with new rules. fast pace"
good,You have a clear understandign of what is expected of you to do your job. customer Serivice orientated.
good,"There are two pathways in this company, service or production. The work is easy when you are trained properly, but there is some issues in management."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,A hard working company that strives on greatness. Some days can be tougher than others due to customers but it is an easy place to work up to a manager position pretty quickly if you do your job correctly and well.
good,"Panera was a great experience to start with customer service. It’s pretty expensive but during my time working there we got around 60% off the food, but as I was leaving to go to college they dropped it down to 30%."
good,"Employees go out of their way to make it right for the customers. Any complaint was fixed and made correct right away. If a product wasn't to the satisfaction of the guest, the item would be remade."
good,"No complaints, did what I was told and had no problems  Few slip ups here and there but most jobs are like that. Environment was health and fun, overall had a great experience"
good,"Love my team, we're a little family at Panera. we all get along well and always have a good time while still having a productive workday! the customers are usally very friendly and respectable."
good,"Very great job with a warming enviroment, people love the place everyone is respectable and caring towards eachother, confrontations are handled respectfully and no one is passive about confrontation"
good,Management need to take care of staff. Very stressful place to work. Staff are less taken care of. Management is only interested in meeting daily timelines at the disadvantage of staff.
good,"While employed here, I was quite literally thrown into the fire. I was expected to lead, teach, and flourish shortly after being shown the basics. While I did achieve these things, at times it would indeed be overwhelming, not just for myself, but for all employed. However, our levels of customer satisfaction never dropped. And this was always key."
good,Good place for a first job.Flexable hours. Taught me how to be a team player and help my co workers when they could not finish their job on time. I would still be working there if I didnt get laid off forbeing too young
good,I learn good and bad things like how important is the right way to work as a team and how it could be for everyone and maybe everything is easier and more efficient
good,The beginning was amazing but once management started changing things went down hill but for the most part it was pretty fun very flexible with work life balance
good,"Working as an associate is a great job especially if you are in school as there is a ton of schedule flexibility."
good,Panera is a great place to be. The work can be aggravating at times. The customers are what keeps the work flow going and time moving. Just make your money and have a fun doing it
good,As a worker I feel this job is good enough for a teen is a bit stressful sometimes but you always have coworkers or managers helping you relieve it so you always feel in a great place.
good,Would be better if they pay people what they deserve. We’re just Overworked and underpaid. Also would recommend if some of the managers actually help when we’re backed up.
good,"Panera bread has taught me a lot about communication with costumers, costumer satisfaction, organizational skills, the need to stay away from drama and the need for good management. I have been at this company for a short year and a half and I have seen six managers come and go in that short time. An employee always has some drama with another employee. For the most part it is an amazing place to work and everyone is very friendly and willing to teach."
good,It’s a good job just wish management would care more. I like working their bc you meet a lot of new people and the customers is so nice learning how to make new foods is amazing to but some reason we have to wait awhile before we learn knew things and I don’t like that
good,enjoyed working there. the other associates were pleasant enough. Store management could definitely use an overhaul. there were times that i was scheduled to work outside of my availability.
good,I feel like they need help with management skills. The job culture is laid back and easy going but productivity is shot. Our management team needs work
good,Interact with the customers when busing the tables cooking the food and taking their orders. Cleaning and prepping the food as well as cooking the food.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Panera is a great company to work for, the product is outstanding and the people I work with are team oriented. The hours are flexible to a degree and there’s opportunity for advancement."
good,"Overnight delivery independent people apply only. Schedule can change, new drivers are effected first but not a bad place to work overall. I'd give them a shot."
good,"A typical day consists of greeting fellow employees, then begin cleaning and maintaining station while making product until shift is over. I learned how to cooperate and coordinate with team members, be more open to other perspectives, and how to handle a fast paced work environment. The culture is friendly and unifying, with management working to mediate and guide employees as much as possible, while maintaining the restaurant. The hardest part of the job would be during rush hour when there are multiple orders that every station needs to complete all at once. The most enjoyable part of the job is the friendly atmosphere and accepting associates and managers, and the discounted food."
good,"Working on line or register keeps you busy and is decent work, dish and dining room are less enjoyable. GM is great but some of the asst. managers are distracted and take associates for granted. Closing shifts typically gets out around 11-11:30 (closing at 10). It can also get stressful when it is understaffed or busy/impatient customers. Pay is minimum wage and only half off meals, but overall a good environment."
good,"A typical day at work would start off in the morning, usually, it gets busy there's a line we have to minimize either someone backs getting pastries or someone is rining. I transition to the production line to help them out making food. Continuing going back and forth from cash or production."
good,This job had flexible hours and I learned cleaning skills and how to restock. I liked working here but needed more hours to save up for a car. I think the most difficult part was carrying the heavy coffee makers into the back to refill them.
good,"good, just a delivery driver but the people were nice and a fun place to work, seems like there were to many managers compared to the amount of people working there."
good,Panera offered flexible hours which was nice being a student. The management was great for handling their employee's and customers. It was a healthy and clean environment to work in.
good,"great management, excellent team working, very professional and productive work environment, great staff and great communication between manager and employees"
good,It was a good first job. I was able to learn how to attend to customers and make sure they were satisfied with their experience at the store. I learned how to stay calm when a customer was not satisfied with their order.
good,well at panera i was emaculant & organized. The Panera Day emoyees were so disgusting. They would use and trash my stuff & i always had to clean up after them. Otherwise My Product Was Gold Standard
good,"I enjoyed working at Panera, the only reason I left was that I didn't want to be stuck in food service and I need to make more money since I was moving."
good,Professional work environment with opportunities to move up in the company from any level. Building a solid team is something that Panera holds in high regard.
good,"This counted technically as my second job, but I met people there that worked there for their first job. They encouraged me to try applying, but then I actually got the job. Had to leave since my arm wasn't doing so well with the new job."
good,"Overall, the job is easy and if you don't like it, you won't like any other food service jobs. The people are great and the managers were OK at my position, they offer opportunity for raises not by time but by how well you do your job, so if you are a good worker, you will get raises."
good,panera bread is a great place to work. great team and helpful managers. love the food and i feel like there's always someone to help if you have work related questions.
good,"Not a set schedule and long hours. Good food, fun people to work with. Highs and lows like any job. Customers make it hard some time, Never a dull day."
good,Panera Bread has been a good company to work for. I do sometimes wish there was a better work life balance but that would really be my biggest complaint.
good,When coming in the afternoon you need to stock everything up and clean up what the morning people did when they were there. Making sure that everything is ready for a dinner rush
good,"I enjoy working for Panera.  I wanted to retire with them,  but being relocated with 1 day notice is not ideal for my financial standing.  Driving 2 hours"
good,Great place tor work and amazing people with great work ethic.Very thorough when doing everything for ecosure i loved making sure everything was rotated and in the correct placement.
good,Started here as my second job lasted about 4 and a half years so not that bad but it was time for me to move on great place to start in a restaurant field
good,Panera is a great company to work for. They have extensive training. The promote a fun work environment. It is a great opportunity to meet new people everyday. There are many different aspects of a Panera store so there is always something different to do. They have plenty of room for advancement in many different fields.
good,"I would still be employed there if I didn’t recently have a baby and was very sick during my pregnancy, I wanted to work out a notice and go back but became sick again and was out of work until I had my son"
good,Fun workplace for average employee. They work with your school schedule or family schedule. They could work on caring about their managers more though.
good,"Working at Panera was not too hard, and everything was pretty nice. A normal day at work was never too stressful and we had time to relax and calm down after a rush. Management was chill about pretty much everything and would let us take small breaks from the line to do whatever, as long as we still did our job"
good,Great first job. They really work with your schedule if they like you as a worker. However management is hit or miss. Some mangers are really good and others are really bad. It is pretty stressful and very fast pace. The environment can also be hit or miss depending your crew. It’s a lot less stressful when you have good employees around you. But I’ve have a very good experience with Panera the past 4 years I’ve worked here.
good,"Its a great job if your the baker. you come in at nights and talk with the closing manager about what is needed for catering(because they cant project that a week out). my manager does check  up with me regularly but others may not. The only downside is that some people try to take advantage of anything they can because they know its the night shift and there arent many eyes on them so they act out knowing that the day shift will have to take their word for it. also, its female dominated field now, at least here, and I have had a couple of occasions where they try to gang up against me. luckily my baker manager knows them and the mess they try to start but it still feels like its a woman dominated area and they are trying to ""keep their sisterhood""."
good,good company to work for. learned a lot within the 5 years of experience that i have. continuing to learn as i am now a manager at this company. lack of benefits though. franchise only offers health insurance and paid time off that is accumulated every year you are a manager.
good,"My job at Panera was a fun one surrounded by coworkers I adored and a welcoming environment. Though things can sometimes be kicked into high gear and patience can wear thin with some of the people I worked with, it was overall a good job with very good pay for a food job."
good,"Good team, gets busy during lunch and finding trackers can be frustrating at times. Delivery is okay. Good for a part time job, hours are limited. Decent training, but it takes a while."
good,"Panera Bread is no easy job. You will be running your butt off all day. If you work line, or in a management position, it will sucks ALL DAY LONG. Not really worth the stress and damage to your body"
good,"I've received pretty good treatment from my managers working at Panera, and although the pay isn't fantastic, it's better than other delivery jobs I've worked, and just fine for a part time job. The management is friendly and easy to work with, as are most of the other employees."
good,The job was very easy once you got the hang of it. At the time I worked there management was very poor. Management often pressured you in to taking a shift or staying extra hours. I would recommend this job to people who are still in high school
good,"Working at Panera definitely had it's benefits, pretty good pay and a good amount of hours. I was a Sophomore in high school and it was my first job. Altogether it was a good experience."
good,"Overall, working at Panera was not a bad experience. The staff is very sweet and helpful, and the management can be a bit tough, but nothing horrible. You also have to know at least three fields, meaning if you're a cashier, you can be expected to work on the floor, cash, dishing, or making the food. It is quite a loaded job, but nothing impossible There are benefits within this job as well. The only negative thing I can say is the customers can be extremely frustrating. For some reason, there is no respect."
good,"The thing that i loved most about working at panera was the people. It’s not a difficult job but after working at three locations, you learn that the managers have a lot to say about how good the work environment is."
good,I liked working at panera because of the customers and because of the workers also they were nice and helped when i first started . key word at the job is team work !
good,Work is very fast but the employees are nice and management understanding. If i hadn't moved I'd if Deffinatly stayed at Panera. Plus the food is pretty good and you get good benefits.
good,"Very clean and hold high standards. Everything is fresh and delicious. Employees hold their product to a very high standard, and management is right on top of everything."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,It's a great place to work all you got to id avoid certain people because they will get you fired for petty stuff and the management will side with those certain people so beware
good,"I've worked here for almost five years and my experience has been good, but moving up in the company can be difficult. I started working here with the idea I could move up within 3-4 years in time but that goal never panned out the way I hoped."
good,"The people there are awesome, as far as the workers, the customers... not so much.The typical workday was very face paced, and you would have to really be an excellent mulitask. Other besides that, food was great, and overall was an amazing experience."
good,"Pay isn’t the best out there, but if you can find the right cafe to fit into its a fun place to work. They do make a lot of changes within the company and can be frustrating at times. Management pays decent. Drivers actually make pretty good money, depending on the area I guess. I would go back if I needed to."
good,"My experience working at Panera was that you have to be responsible and precise about your duties. Although my days there were long and sometimes difficult, I still managed to build relationships with the customers there and that made working there a lot better. This Panera is located in the Hingham shipyard which is a wonderful location with the ocean and beautiful settings around the area."
good,I learned a lot like how to work in a fast paced environment and to be respectful. The job helped me but able to work as a team to get things done like when it was closing time.
good,"My overall job experience was stressful but fun, it was and is a good working environment not only for me but for everybody that works there.  As an overall company I recomend working for Panera Bread."
good,"There was a lot of change in management while I was there. My cafe was busy, so it was often fast-paced and sometimes stressful, especially during lunch rush. No benefits, steady hours."
good,A typical day would be going in to prep all the food I would need to get through the day/night. Reading and making customers food orders. I learned a lot about working inside of the kitchen and really enjoy it as opposed to working up front as a cashier. Very disappointed in the management and would still be working there if they were better at communication. The most enjoyable part of the job was working as a team and getting the chance to try something new that I absolutely love!
good,"this place was a nice place to teach and learn about new things, I was learning new thing because where I used to work it was super busy and a mix of spanish and american cusine, but this job was super chill nice management and great co-workers."
good,The interview process was easy. Panera is always looking for employees. The training is good and you learn your job fast. The managers are cool and laid back. Panera also highers managers from within.
good,"I have worked at my cafe for almost 7 years and have enjoyed my time there. My particular cafe has a nice balance of fast pace service and lower sales periods that allow me and the staff to not only provide a comfortable, quick meal but chances to get to know our guests at a one on one level."
good,"I started as an associate after being an assistant store manager for 4 years. It was a hard step down for me because I always had to watch things happen with no say. I quickly proved myself and slowly moved up the ladder starting with associate trainer, then catering, and now shift manager. The opportunity for advancement is there it is just a slow moving pace. I do recommend Panera as a company to work for."
good,"A typical day at work involves me clocking in anytime between 4 AM and 6 AM and clocking out anytime between 8 AM and 2 PM. Catering at Panera is full time, requires an extremely flexible lifestyle, and top-grade organization and time management. "
good,Was fast paced and had to keep up. Managers were great and the food was alright. The customers were great. They barely complained and when they did we would fix it on the spot to assure the customer is having a good experience and will want to come back
good,"Overall, Panera is a good place to work for, I have room for advancement, but it is not what im looking to advance in. I am satisfied working there, though the hours are strict and slim, I am also a new hire so I expected that."
good,Great place to work part time. Very fast paced if you’re working on the line! Great first job or great for college students who need work. The low pay ($9) is the only con
good,"I enjoy working at Panera and it helped me gain job experience.  I like helping with food preparation, however there is not much room there for advancement."
good,"Its just like what you would imagine it to be. You either run the cash register, are a line worker, or wash dishes. Pretty simple on what to expect..."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"great people. love the regular  customers "
good,Pretty good place to work. Management is okay. Not a lot of flexibility. Made great friends here. Lifelong ones. It's a good start for your career. Great food.
good,I had a good time working there. It was somewhat stressful when other workers had attitude and keep talking to other workers. The nightshift was fun. They cleaned everything at night.
good,"It was a great place to work until I requested a transfer when I had to move, then I started to get hours I had stated I couldn't work. As well as never ended up being transferred."
good,"I enjoyed working for this awesome company .I made friends with employees and customers..Management was very confusing at times..never worked in a place with so many managers on shift before..Didn't quite know who was my go to person everyday.."
good,"Lind of a stressful job, always busy, always moving and completing tasks for customers. Everyone was always friendly though and was happy working there."
good,"This was my first job, I was hired at 16 and worked there for 4 years, until I went away to school. I really enjoyed this job, It allowed me to  learn many different aspects of restaurant work. Throughout my time there, I learned Cashier and Customer Service, Line cook, Food runner, Dishwasher, Cleaning the restaurant and Light prep Work. The restaurant is very busy and fast paced, I learned to work well under pressure and deal with customer problems. I'm able adapt to many work environments, and can work well in groups due to the many different employees I was able to work with at my time at Panera."
good,"A great place to work a teen many great co-workers, good part time salary, you will not know your schedule until Tuesday so it is hard to make weekend plans,"
good,"A typical day at work is good, a little stressful during our rushes. "
good,I loved working there but management needs serious change. It's very fast paced and stressful at times. I loved my coworkers and we were a good team..
good,"A typical day is very busy in the day time and slow at night, great management and a very fun work environment. Everyone works hard to give the customers the best food we can produce."
good,Workplace is a fun place to work if you like retail and sales. The customer base is exceptional and managers are rewarding towards employees that work hard.
good,"Panera Bread is a good company and good job to work at, but it have it's own problems need to be resolved like making sure pre list is not long and have more then one pre personal."
good,"A typical day at the job was that you were expected to be on time and ready to work. My area of work was mostly in the cash area. We were expected to provide a good experience for the customers while taking their orders accurately. I learned how to make drinks, prepare granola parfaits, fruit cups, etc. I also learned how to be efficient at my job, and to do well enough I was asked to train other new workers. It would get very busy at a normal day at work, especially in the morning time when people would come for breakfast and expect fast service. I would toast and slice multiple bagels, package bread and pastries, blend or prepare espresso or smoothie drinks, all while keeping in mind what work I have to do when there are no customers to take care of. I disliked the management after a while of working at this location because they weren’t very helpful, weren’t very fair, and wouldn’t give an honest effort to improve and keep consistency in the work environment for their employees sake. Other than that issue, I enjoyed the job and the comradery and friendship that care with working with other employees. Most of the employees would go out of their way to cheer others up, and help when it’s needed. I always have given an honest effort at this job, and I can forsee myself giving this tremendous effort to any other company I choose to join."
good,"Some days would be really stressful, while others were slow and relaxed. I made a lot of friends while working here and it was a good first job to have. The management was pretty good and on top of things."
good,"Fun place to work and gain experience especially for students in school. I would recommend this job to my friends for sure. It is more of a demanding company, due to Planet Bread and Bread Bash meetings, etc. but I believe its worth it and it makes you value the job more."
good,Overall it is a good place to work. The franchisee for Iowa runs a good organization. The culture is sometimes followed. I would recommend my child to work there.
good,"I love how the company is becoming more empathetic to their employees' learning style/ accommodations. The location I where I worked, wasn't the most team orientated influenced environment."
good,I worked at panera as a production associate. I helped prepare meals and clean the store from time to time I worked here while also being a full time student the company was very flexible.
good,"Overall management was great, they worked closely with your availability and reward hard work. Would definitely work for these managers again in a different setting."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,A very fast-paced environment! Be prepared to work hard and know that the work day will fly by the more you keep busy! There is ALWAYS something to clean/prep!
good,"I love the people I work with but the customers and pace that I work at does make the place very draining. Time goes by very fast when we are in a rush but there is no real time to slow down so if you think it would be a chill job, it isn't, or at least my location isn't. other wise I like my managers and love my coworkers."
good,"Great company, worked with the franchise for over 12 years, just looking to advance further given my extensive work ethic and knowledge of business. My experience in management includes onboarding and terminations, budgeting monthly, forecasting sales and reacting to trends. More information/details on what I oversee can be provided if requested."
good,working on the production line was the funnest position I have ever worked. It's challenging and fast paced. My days went by so fast I couldn't believe it was time for me to go home some days.
good,not a bad place to work the pay just wasn't good for me. If you dont have very many bills then its a great place to work with flexible hours and it isnt a hard job either.
good,"It was great, had much fun with my co worker , met some cool people , vibes are good most of the time , definitely would recommend if it’s your first job."
good,I have worked at Panera bread for almost a year now. I started when I was 16 and am now 17 and I couldn’t have asked for better managers or a more fun work environment. There are good and bad days like with any job. The managers are cool and genuine and most of the co workers are fun. As long as you do your job you should be fine.
good,"Fantastic company to work for, unfortunately you will never get rich working at Panera. THe management was decent enough, and the coworkers were great, but you can not raise a family on their benefits."
good,"I was fired wrongly , I took a picture of the wrong schedule once and came in late like 3 hours and they fired me no questions ask, or answered. I feel like I was wrongly fired and I was never asked about it again. Zandale center sucks"
good,"Panera is a great company. This was one of the best jobs I had while attending college. The hours were set, but you could work over if they  needed you. You get an amazing discount on food, the people are generally always happy, and you get to interact with people all day. It is a lot of moving around and making sure things are up to par to keep the restaurant running and looking amazing. The food is delicious and the atmosphere is wonderful as well."
good,Good management that knows how to communicate with there staff. If something would ever go wrong with a customer they did all they can to fix the situation. Enjoyed the staff that worked here!
good,A good place to work for a first job if you can handle working as a team in a very fast-paced environment. Can be stressful but helped gain skills in time management as well as being cooperative with a team. Lots of skills to gain through this job.
good,"great company to work for, was a baker and hours were overnight which effects outside work life a lot. management of the store struggles but the manager of the bakers was great."
good,"i learned quickly at Panera, i was taught how to work in a fast paced environment and Panera helped me realize i am good under pressure i enjoyed working there"
good,It’s a nice and energetic place to work with plenty of friendly faces on customers and employees alike. The only problem is the head management has a superiority complex but overall it’s easy enough to overlook it.
good,"I have been at the Panera I currently work at for quite a few years now, and it became my second home. I love the people there, and I have made countless friends. I started out as an associate, and then got promoted to a shift supervisor. There are always opportunities to advance to those who work hard and show they can handle the promotion."
good,not Some of the managers I believe were not qualified or professional enough to lead a team. Not enough pay. One of the mangers had favoritism other managers were good. If pay was increased I would consider working for this company again. Also like the organic high quality of the food.
good,"Great company, taught me a lot about managing people, and setting goals. Truly helped me develop in my career and gave me tremendous opportunities. I enjoyed my time working for this company."
good,"Panera Bread was my first job, it was good work and paid well for someone who was in high school or college. Very flexible hours and worked well with students."
good,"Working at Panera was especially fun because the work environment allowed us to work within close proximity of each other. Because of this, everything was a team effort. However, it was very fast paced and stressful."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,I love the people I work with and most of the guest that come in. It gets hard and stressful but overall its a great job to have and it really helped build my customer service skills.
good,Great place to work just not paid enough for all the work you do. Its a fun friendly team work environment. Its alot of work but you have fun if you can keep up and everyone is so nice and youre customers are nice except for the few who think its a 5 star restaurant.
good,The culture at Panera was like a family away from family. You work together to make sure the customer is pleased with their service. It was really easy to bond with my co-workers even though we were all different.
good,This job is relaxing Everybody is super nice to you even the mangers if you don’t know what your doing they’ll try to help you and the food is delicious good place to work at
good,"Provided excellent customer service"
good,A busy place to work.  Time went by quickly.  There were times when there wasn't enough staff to meet the needs of the customers in a timely fashion.  I would work for them again if I could have a set schedule.
good,"Nice place, good food, managers and co-works most most of the time. However, Panera Bread needs some improvements as a company and better benefits for the employees."
good,Gave me great hours and fit very well with both my school and family life. Management was not the best however. Very demanding and relationship with them is not their priority. Managers tended to undermine much of what was given to them as feedback from workers and even some customers.
good,"People were nice. "
good,a typical day at Panera is not really any typical day. You experience a new crowd of people every hour and some that are familiar. The management team is a success as they maintain order and a smooth flow of the workplace.The hardest part of the job would likely be closing shift. The area that employers are assigned to is an abundance and should be helped alongside with another employer to speed up the closing process.
good,I enjoyed working at Panera as my first job and it has taught me so much about customer service and what it is like to work in a public setting. It has also enlightened me to appreciate public services
good,"Panera was my first job. I only had the job for a summer, however in the time I worked there, I was treated very well by all of my coworkers. It was a fast-paced job however it was made better by the people I worked with."
good,"the manager was good with me, i liked the place it was always clean and welcoming i just didnt like the hours i was giving and how rude the coworkers were to me."
good,This job is a good first job to have. The culture of the job is fun and the people are nice. I have no regrets working at Panera Bread. The hardest part of the job is being on your feet all day.
good,A typical day at work would be depending on the day of the week. If we were slow then it would be relaxed and could detail clean. If we were busy we would be very quicked paced and would have to be in times.
good,Working at panera was a fun job. I enjoyed most of the people I worked with. It is definitely a fast paced environment and you need to be ready to jump in and get moving.
good,I loved working at Panera for most of my tenure. I got jaded toward the end which eventually led me to leave. For me the management was great and I got along well with them. Toward the end however I felt stifled and felt I was losing hours and opportunity.
good,"Fast workplace where you need to work quick during peak hours , get orders correct or it’ll mess up the flow of orders coming out. Know when to chill and joke around and went to become serious and efficiently get yours orders done without any distractions."
good,the is job is great if you are looking for a first job. You gain experience in customer service throughout all positions in the business. all in all a good job.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,This is a great company to work for! Pleasant work environment. Flexible schedules and management is good at working around your schedules. The other associates are warm and inviting and it is an overall friendly place to work.
good,great for a first time job. always smells really well in there. hopefully get to work with some great people. you also get too meet new people every day
good,"Café to spend family time or as a business meeting place, working time or just to get a good and relax time. Free WiFi. Good and healthy food, pastries & coffee. Coffee and drinks are free refill."
good,"Loved working for stores outside the Houston metro area. Some great managers, wonderful employees, and loyal guests will brighten anyone's day. Worked for a franchise, and loved most of the upper management. Payrates for management varied greatly, with the internally promoted management getting the short end of the stick."
good,A Typical work day would be a friendly atmosphere. Hardest part of the job would have to be when we are short staffed and everyone is stressing out and everything is disorganized. Management could use some work but it is not make a bad work experience.
good,"Panera is a great place for your first job. The staff is loving and it's easy to make friends there. The hardest part of the job is that on the busy days, you have to stay on task or the job at hand can become stressful."
good,Overall Panera Bread was a friendly yet busy environment. Everyday there would be floods of customers coming in so one would definitely always have to excel in customer service.
good,"Enjoyed working there,the energy there is great.Its fast paced during rush hour times.But really chilled.The people I worked with we're great and patient with me during the training process.They we're like my second family"
good,"i enjoyed working here while i was going to school, however i wasn't able to live alone due to not making enough money. the hours are long and hard on your feet."
good,Days go quickly at Panera Bread. Can be a fun environment when the day is organized and ready to go. Food is 50% off as an associate and free when you're a manager.
good,Working at Panera Bread gave me the flexibility to go to school and work at the same time. They offered management support to new hires and supervisors making a great learning environment.
good,"I loved and hated working at Panera. Loved the team so much. Hated the stress. It was just me though, not the company in my opinion. As far as food service goes, it really was above average I think."
good,Baking overnight was something that I enjoyed doing due to the family like environment. The only con was working in the freezer for about  hours. Overall it was a great experience and a nice opportunity.
good,If you have worked Fast Food before this is an awesome change of scene.  Its fast food restaurant style. Easy close and friendly environment.  Lots of training to ensure the knowledge and expertise expected from each employee.
good,"underpaid staff, scheduling difficulties, quick environment. the management is great though and everyone gets along very well. coworkers are open and friendly."
good,Panera was great at working with my schedule as a student. I was able to get the hours I wanted and enough pay for what I was doing. I would recommend this job to any student who doesn't want late nights and can work lunch shifts.
good,I enjoyed my time at Panera.  I started as a cashier and moved up to the Kitchen Manager within 6 months.  I like the position just wasn't making enough money to support my family.
good,Was hired to open a new store within three months I was promoted to associate Trainer with a raise I didn’t stay in one module i learned how to do everything in the store
good,Everyone is respectful. I liked the hours because you can chose if you want full time or part time almost every week. The food is good and every thing is always clean.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,It is definitely work that will keep you on your toes. The customers and co workers are wondeeful to be around. You have to able to be on your feet for long periods of time
good,"They promote within the store, and very quickly as well, more or less on how long you have been there and prior experience. Management is fair and considerate based upon wants and needs out of the job."
good,"Typical day included set up of cafe, organizing catering orders, creating and delivering them. Management was always cooperative and ready to step in when help was needed. Hardest part of the job was doing drive through and catering coordination and sometimes management at the same time. Lots of job juggling. Consistent morning schedule was the best part."
good,"I like it here a lot. I had good training and the days go by fast."
good,"Discount on healthy food, free drinks on the job and free pastries. Panera's 'healthy' environment created an ambiance that made working there less stressful than it should have been. And that's saying something since I used to work during Lunch hours. The managers and supervisors made it fun to work at Panera. Every day you got to learn something new on the job."
good,I had this job my senior year of high school. the hours and pay are great but the management was pretty bad for how young everyone is. Once you pass that its pretty cool until you get rushes and people complain for waiting 2 minutes.
good,"The only problem I had with this job is the management. After learning and getting certified in many positions, I was never given the raise that I was promised. There were also many times I requested time off and confirmed with managers in advance, but was still scheduled to work."
good,Nice family/buisness oriented cafe style  place. Food is great and healthy.  Wide variety of options for people of all ages.  Work load is ok.  Managers are polite.
good,"I enjoyed working at Panera, the work wasn't bad and the hours were there if you needed them. There was a problem with advancement though. I was training employees 3 weeks after I started and it took over a year of requests to finally receive the official title and pay of an Associate Trainer even though I had been doing the same work the entire time. The people were great, they provided a fantastic work environment."
good,"It was a fast paced work environment in which the goal was to provide excellent customer service and accurate orders. The pay is low for the amount of work done per day, but it is the food industry."
good,"Over my 3 years working at Panera it has been a great 'first job', the staff are very friendly and management as well. The only problem I have had there are the rude cutomers. Though all resturants have these types of customers, Panera seems to have them a lot more frequently then most."
good,You get 65% up to 36 dollars of food (before discount) on each day you have a shift. They have guarenteed raises every six months. (If you don't do well it may only be a couple cents)
good,The company tries to balance its fast paced food instrustry goals with it's high quality sit down healthy restaurant ones. In doing so it is constantly making minute adjustments sometimes difficult to keep up with. Lots of resources available for employees to learn and grow in this shifting environment though!
good,"A typical work day at Panera I would normally start off by putting items in the proper place. Next I would start preparing the the store for customers, such as brewing coffee. The majority of my responsibilities at Panera was a cashier or a cook. I am able to cook sandwiches and salads in addition to operating the register."
good,Very nice place to work people are nice but very busy and stressful at times if you are looking for a temp job panera is great place to start for barista skills
good,"Panera Bread is honestly a great company to work for. Things are extremely fast-paced, so if you can’t keep up, you’re out of luck with the job. Management is friendly, but upper management is not very attentive. The values and culture that Panera surrounds itself in is amazing, and great for anyone wanting their first job. Lots of advancement opportunities, when you can prove to your boss that you’re better than outside competition."
good,Good management and co workers it is just a lot of physical work. It is very draining work and lots of lifting. On the up the atmosphere is nice it is like one big family there.
good,The only reason y i ended up at Panera is cause i left my other job for better pay but less hours. I really dont like how Panera wont give you hours but is always hiring.
good,Great people! Panera is very well known for their healthy food and back it up. I left  just because I had my daughter and couldn't work weekends or nights anymore. Fast paced environment days go by quicker!
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,I have been pleased with the flexibility and ability to grow within the company. My managers are great and the people I work with are nice. I enjoy the customer interaction so much.
good,"Stressful In the  kitchen. Management isn't really the best. Good employees, great food and good menus options. Poor hours and opportunities to move forward"
good,Panera is a very busy place. You need to know how to work as a team. You have to be fast paced and have knowledge of your position. Management is great and they are understanding in life out of work situations.
good,The people were great to work with. Fast-paced environment. The only real downside was when they started hiring more people during summer/winter breaks and they cut everyone's hours to the point where it just was impossible to continue to work there.
good,"Mostly everyone is really nice. You may get a lot of rude middle aged ladies, but everyone who visits are usually nice. Management is nice and understanding if there are any problems"
good,Nice place to work and pays well. Would recommend it to someone looking for a job. Management needs some work but there is a few who really care about the place. Discount is great since the food is so expensive.
good,"A typical day is different depending which section you are in. I usually work cashier so a usual day include taking orders, restocking, and cleaning. I learned a lot about time management, working with others, and of course a lot about Panera. Management differs between cafes but personally in Simi Valley, managers are funny, some are sassy (in a good way), and i've always felt like we were a family. The hardest part of the job is definitely the people. Anytime you work in customer service, specifically food service, you will have busy, stressful, ad hard days and unhappy people add to that. The best part of the job is your coworkers. I have worked at Panera around 10 months and I feel like I am part of a family. Everytime I come in, whether I am just going to eat or coming in for a shift, everyone is excited to see you and super sweet."
good,"I enjoy working here recommend it highly for motivated people looking to get their foot in the door for management experience, however there is a limited window of advancement once you get right below the district level."
good,"i like all the staff and managers, i just did not like when it was time to sell gift card for Christmas you had to ask customer and if you didn't, you would get fired!"
good,"It’s a really good job to start off at you learn a lot , build skills and knowledge . Full of lots of opportunities ,  dedication,  and interacting  With many different people ."
good,"Overall, it is a wonderful place to work. You're able to build a relationship with so many people and that is something you can hold on to. Working there taught me many things in which I might never get this somewhere else. I learned that it is very easy to do something you think is far out of your league if you just have dedication and put in hard work. The management there is awesome for the most part everyone is on the same page and they treat their employees very well."
good,"Panera Bread EP is a small, but very fast paced cafe. Managers & staff treat each other like family. Although, managers are flexible they could work on helping out the staff a bit more. It is very easy to learn here at panera. Trainers are picked & specialized to train new hires in service & production tracks to their 100%. Setting everyone for success provides a good flow. Sure, there will be times when we're understaffed or going through a stressful shift. Yet, we always try our hardest to do our best job possible to ""wow"" our customers. Working here we not only build relationships with each other, but with our customers as well. We strive to provide an everyday oasis with our values & high quality standards. It's amazing to know that we have regular customers who come in & enjoy our panera food & warming staff. I love working here. However, Panera as a whole could work on providing more benefits to their staff. Such as, paid sick days, vacation time, higher wages & more discounts."
good,"I started working here when I turned 16 and I honestly love everything about my job. I started off doing dining room for 3 months straight which involved changing coffees, cleaning tables and taking out the trash which to some people may sound like the worst job ever but in reality, it isn't so bad. Over the past year,  I've learned how to make salads, sandwiches, drinks and how to be a great cashier. The cafe I work at has friendly staff and the coolest managers. Although one problem about the cafe I work at is that we are usually understaff since we don't have many workers and therefore we struggle trying to get everyone's order on time. Overall this job is a great job for someone who will hustle during the lunch rush and help their team out when they need help because in Panera Bread, WE WORK AS A TEAM!"
good,Mostly work solos if you have a bake between 1200 and 2400 for the cafe projections of sales. The job really isn't hard if you manage your time wisely you can get done on time.
good,"This motto makes for a great workplace environment, but its rigidity makes little room for people who aren't as talented with recalling details. Also, the training process wasn't great."
good,Me gusta tengo muchos años trabajando para esta empresa solo que no dan aumentos de sueldo tengo años ganando lo mismos es por eso solamente
good,Depends which Panera you work at but a lot of job opportunities for advancement. If your lazy this is not the job for you. Good company just a lot of hard work.
good,Like every job there is ups and downs so being in the food industry it can be very daunting but we can prevail thur it and make it something worth the time
good,"everybody can be friendly, they try their hardest to keep customers satisfied, "
good,Great place to work and flexible if you are a college student. The management could use some work. It is one of the better fast food chains to work for.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Panera Bread is a great starter job, it gives employees experiences with customers and allows employees to discover what they are good at in order to succeed in their job."
good,Working at Panera is good as a first job. It gives you a taste of what restaurants and working is like and it allows to gain necessary skills needed for other jobs.
good,"As as college student, I work part time. The atmosphere is decent, and not one will blow up on you for a mistake. The only down fall is that customers are always considered right, even if you clearly see they are lying, or scheming for free food or a refund."
good,"I really enjoyed my 15 plus years there. I had the opportunity to work in 4 different departments with several promotions and increasing responsibility. It can be stressful as most growing business are, and managers can be hit or miss just like at all jobs.  "
good,"Was easily able to move up in the company during the short time I was there, all while attending college full time. Higher up positions do not pay nearly as much as they deserve."
good,"Interesting environment, because it has an artful taste to the interior decorating. Food is good and available at a discount to employees. At times busy, but not unmanageable."
good,"Panera Bread team members really treat you like family. Every couple months they have after-shift meetings that we get to try out the new menu items that are coming to the restaurant, we get awards for great service and helping people. During the work day, when food ""expires"" (is no longer to Panera quality standards, but isn't actually bad), team members can actually take food home. This is great during breakfast, as the eggs only have 45 minutes in the heat tray before getting tossed. The worst thing are entitled people, but what customer service job doesn't have that?"
good,"Customer or guest are great, typically they're some good ""regulars"". Hours are flexible, options to switch shifts with your fellow co-workers are available"
good,"Overall, each day at Panera is fairly repetitive. It is fairly easy to move up in management if the associate shows interest. The job itself is not difficult but lack of communication within the management is somewhat frustrating."
good,"Great starting job. relaxed environment; can be fast paced at times but never too stressful. Wide range of employees makes for a diverse atmosphere, company very socially conscious."
good,My experience working at panera was a good one. I had a chance to meet new people of different cultures as well as make new friends. Panera taught me how to multitask with helping others in a fast paced environment.
good,This is a fun job if you like talking to customers . The management was very understanding with wanting days off & they were helpful with customer issues
good,As a delivery driver for panera the best times to work were always around lunch time (12pm - 4pm) and during the week day (mon-fri). A lot of deliveries and the tips were pretty decent. The management team at the location were great and my co workers were pretty cool.
good,Panera was not promoting any of their employees but rather bring in second parties for higher positions. I’ve kearned how to balance my work life with my job.
good,Fun place to work but not enough room for growth. The company management salary is pretty low compared to other companies. Long hours but friendly fast paced cafe.
good,Working at Panera was an exciting job. Everyday held something new and it kept me on my feet. It was very fast paced because of our location. It taught me a great deal of responsibility and leadership.
good,"It feels like the Corporation needs to spend some time in the cafes, to see how best to implement the changes they want to see take place. Their goals are nearly impossible to reach, when presenting new challenges in customer connection (delivery and RPU) and recipe builds..."
good,there very strick when it comes to tattoos and history. People are great to work with just stuck in the same spot no room to move up. they got a new owner since ive worked last and it was very hard to cover up my tattoos
good,If you want a fast paced job that pushes you to your limits this is the one. You are treated like family which makes it very enjoyable to start your day!
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"A relaxed and joyful place to work, very busy at certain times like most restaurants. Laid back but also strict. Benefits are discounts on every meal you buy while working."
good,The staff at the Panera was excellent to work with. Each person worked together to accomplish task. Friendly environment. I enjoyed the fast paced work environment.
good,Its a normal part time food service job. No real benefits besides cheep food. The pay is minimum wage but with a good crew the environment could be fun.
good,"I made 15 bucks an hour from 11-2 during the week. 8 bucks every other hour. You get 8 during cafe time and 5 during driving do you have to force customers to tip you. Dishes and cafe cleaning during non driving times. Managers paid little attention to you so that was nice. Occasionally had to deliver to unhappy customers who didn't want to tip and managers do not care about delivery customers. For example, one lady wanted a gluten free cookie but we were out,  and I was told to tell her to come in to get her two dollars back. She did not tip of course. Another time I had to deliver an order that got canceled by the computer system and didn't get mileage pay."
good,"When I started Panera, it was as a cashier in the front. After mastering that role in a matter of days, I was moved to the kitchen to learn those tasks. I was a cook for a few weeks, before being trained to be the Prep person. This means I was responsible for all produce being organized, accounted for, and prepared for the next day. This part of the job taught me amazing time management, yet was physically draining. Being still in high school, it was a lot of pressure for the whole restaurant to be relying on you to be successful. Ultimately it was personal reasons that made me leave the company, but the experience was appreciated. With each advancement, I was also given a 25 cent raise which seemed fair to me."
good,Its a fast paced environment and healthy work culture. You have to keep yourself updated with new technology and implement in day-to-day activities. Helps grow yourself as a technically strong developer.
good,"I work in the Catering hub, not a cafe."
good,"Panera is a good job, with decent hours, and a flexible schedule. It is quick paced, and often high stressed. It really depends on how busy that panera is."
good,"It’s okay, only for people who are outgoing and willing to get along with everybody. There’s always something to do. There’s no fryer. The management is all over the place. But the managers are cool though. We fixed hundreds of salads, soups and sandwiches a day. The work culture isn’t bad unless you get frustrated by a rush. I love that it’s a easy job to do."
good,I love working at Panera because I meet a lot of people and learn so much and it get me out my comfort zone. I feel like some of the managers at my panera could act or react to somethings in a different way and not be so stressed out all the time! The hardest part of my job is trying to get the food ready in five minutes when we have rush hour or so.
good,"Management played favoritism, pay was low, the work wasn't too much, was very fast paced and usually busy. Holidays were the slowest. Some employees who did not deserve to move up have and only because of personal relationships"
good,"Pretty good management with burdens for you to succeed. Though when you are there a while the new people get all the hours so they will stay. The culture was very rich, many people there who had an interest in your life. Great inside jokes. There is a few things you don't like doing like soups in the morning or taking out the trash, especially when people single bag the trash, but you fight through of course because the management is always there to help and the co workers are always willing to be there for moral support. The most enjoyable part is the cross-training, I am well trained on all the positions at work, if I could create a clones of myself I feel confident that I could run the whole store."
good,It was a good place to work for many years. I gained a lot of skills that I use in my jobs now. Good food and good discounts as well while you are an employee.
good,panera is always clean. The food is always fresh and sent out very quick. I loved working with my co workers they were very helpful and supportive. I️ knew a lot of people by name. We had a lot of regulars. It felt more like home then a cafe. The culture is lade back but with a healthy vibe to it. I love panera. And the managers were awesome!!!!!
good,Fun and exciting place to work. The upper management includes all employees in on what is going on in the company from top to bottom. Panera makes sure that they make time for fun and engaging activities.
good,job was fun when you got the right people to work with. the manager at the time was very strict so we had a lot of employees leave. but if you could get around him the job was fine.
good,"I love working here, it's a productive but relaxed job with great co-workers and customers. I love the type of work I do here, I just wish there were more hours and more opportunities."
good,I really like panera bread great people their awesome managers. Lovley and outgoing customers. The hardest part of the job is when we start to run out of bread and we have to start telling the customers to use different bread.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Panera continues to innovate in the casual dining space, offering nutritious and tasty breakfast, dinner, and snack menu items that are true to the company’s commitment of offering food that everyone can feel good about eating. They are committed to clean eating, a transparent menu, and positive impact. Panera offers a generous loyalty program and online ordering so guests can avoid the lines at the register and pickup counters, and meals are packed well for those on the go. With a mix of booths, tables, and comfortable seats by the fireplace, Panera makes a perfect meeting spot for friends, small social groups, and even employee interviews."
good,"I was a barista, so I was expected to make drinks in under two minutes for customers. I did not know how to make all of the drinks, but if I looked at the packet showing how to make it, then it would take longer than two minutes, so it was a bit stressful. After that I started working as a cashier instead and that was much better and less stress packed."
good,"I enjoyed my co-workers. They really supported me during my health situation. The work load was not overly difficult. It is a fast pace environment during early morning and lunch, but not stressful."
good,Panera Bread is fast paced environment with great coworkers that are willing to help you when needed. Not only do coworkers try their best to help you when needed but also the mangers that are working the shift with you. There is not a day where there wont be someone their to help you when needed.
good,"I started working for Panera in August, 2017. I'm a college student nearby and it's a great fit. They're willing to work around my class schedule and when I asked for them to give me fewer hours they were very good about it. I'm paid 8.50 per hour plus extra from the tip pool (usually averages to about an extra dollar an hour or so). I love it. Management is helpful and I love my regular customers. Won't lie though, there's never a shortage of things to do and lunch rush is always insanely stressful for everyone. Also, on Tuesday's there's a bagel special and it makes for a completely insane morning. They also have a pretty high turn over so they're understaffed a bit and everyone has to pull a little extra weight from time to time. All in all I think it's a great place to work. I really enjoy it"
good,"I worked as an associate and a night baker. With both experiences I can say that the managers will take care of you and be flexible as long as you do the job correctly and take pride. Great pay, really care"
good,"quick paced environment with lots of chance to move up with the company but expect to work more then your fair share, i ended up working more then my fair share for being and underpaid employee"
good,Some managers where good some weren't same as employees depends who you work with. The job is fast paced a lot of people go. You get half of food so you don't have to waste a lot of money on food
good,"Although it was busy on weekends, it was a great first job. I learned register, food running and even barista. There are a lot of places to advance at Panera."
good,"I learned a lot on this job. I learned essentially how to be a leader, how to motivate a team, and learned how to manage stress. My favorite part is the culture. At Panera they create an environment of family and respect. It is a wholesome company you can believe in and all the resources are there to aid anything you could possibly need to do as a manager."
good,The environment was very comfortable to work in and the people i worked with were always very friendly as well as the customers. i would recommend working at Panera Bread to anyone
good,Working in Panera bread was a pretty good experience. I learned to be a cashier and learned costurmer service. The work there could be hard some days but most of the time it is easy. One thing i didn't liked about Panera was that they changed my schedule very often and played around with my hours.
good,"Fast past. very friendly,productive and diverse. Easy to get along with everyone and have little to no problems with customers and employees. Perfect job for new people in the work force."
good,This was a good place to work for college/high school students. They try to work around your hours and really are helpful if you are just learning out. It can be stressful most days with unsatisfied customers.
good,"Working at Panera Bread was a very fun experience. The employees there were friendly and we all worked together as a team. During the rush hours we would all run around like a chicken with our heads cut off, while pitching in to help each other to assure that customers were given the best service."
good,Great family work environment. Very demanding for hours alotted. They said a 45 hour work week but it turned out to be 50 to 60 hours. Weekends off was almosts a never.
good,This was a good first job. The work environment was clean and had a good learning atmosphere. I was able to learn a lot while in school and advance into a trainer.
good,"Decent job, I only left because I wasn't getting enough hours."
good,"Working at Panera Bread is really productive. "
good,"Fast paced job, on your feet most of the night but can take breaks as you need to. Great managers, flexible schedules, great pay, paid vacation, health benefits."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"when I worked there it was easy to get through the busy times because we were all on the same level as far as attitude goes. however, I did feel that the managers played the favorites game and that made it hard to have good connections with the managers."
good,I liked it here. The managers were something else. But the employees were so diverse. Panera kept me on my toes always changing things right when you get used to it.
good,"Very fast pace the greatest time was the staff I was able to hires great people with a very good Customer service mentality "
good,"Other than the slightly over minimum wage pay, I didn't have many problems with Panera. I enjoyed working with most of the other employees and mangers, and it wasn't a job that left you with too much free time to where you would get bored."
good,"Panera is the job for you If you enjoy fast paced and a busy schedule. At times it would be so busy that we would have't to stay past our leave time, but it was worth it because the pay is excellent."
good,"I have worked at Panera Bread for over three years and I love everything about it. The people are amazing which makes coming into work every day enjoyable. There are opportunities to advance within the company, such as becoming an Associate Trainer (which I did after about six months). As an employee, you get the chance to interact with and build relationships with customers and coworkers on a daily basis. The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers, although the number of good customers far outweighs the bad. There are always new employees, especially in the summer when kids are out of school. Employees come and go frequently and it can sometimes be tricky to learn the names of all the new people."
good,"There is no ""typical day at work"" when working with the public. Every day is a new adventure. I can however, say that I have a great team dynamic in my store that I'm proud of. The hardest part is not leaving everyday with a freshly baked Chocolate Chipper! :)"
good,"It is a team-type atmosphere, where everyone one of the associates and management help each other with their job and if needed move over to different areas of the work to help out"
good,Panera bread is an excellent place to work. The managers are very helpful and organized. There was a lot of paid training involved. The environment was peaceful and comfortable.
good,Excellent place to work if you have another job or are in school. Good hours and discount on food when on the clock. They do over-price most items and tell you  not to tell customers unless they get really upset which I believe is ludicrous but that is the only negative aspect about working here.
good,Through out the last ten months of working at Panera bread I have learned the high amounts of team work needed to get a job done. Alone with team work communication had a huge role as well. Management is very understanding. I got very sick with a kidney infection and they really helped me with getting everything covered since I wouldn't work. A flaw in the management would be there communication. Some times I would come into work and they would throw me in places I haven't been trained on because other managers hadn't given me the knowledge need to get the job done correctly. the hardest part of this job is getting everyone on the same speed to make things go through smoothly and quickly. Not everyone is super excited to be there. The best part about my job is the people I work with and work for. They all are very caring people and very supportive. I would consider everyone I work with as family.
good,"Plan for and prepare bread and pastry items daily."
good,"Very fast paced, work area can be very stressful. Problem with not getting enough hours for pay. But environment was great and other associates were very nice and communicative."
good,"I started a couple weeks ago, and I really enjoy working there. I am a customer service/cashier. I work by myself in the morning, opening the bakery and preparing food."
good,"I loved all of my co-workers. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. Managers were always there to help and make the day go smoother. There are always busy points in the day that make the job very stressful, and being understaffed during a rush is more common then it should be."
good,Working at Panera Bread has been a learning experience. I never thought that I would learn the power of just being organized until I worked there. I also learned the basics of being a leader.
good,Okay company. Get discounts. Good hours. Very busy.  Nothing else really. Need more workers. Good food. Overly priced. Just a few things. Good hours. Okay
good,i enjoyed the job itself but couldn't manage it with being a new mom.really fun environment and we were moved around a lot which i liked. i never got bored
good,"When times got tough while working, the environment helped keep you calm. This job was very tricky at the beginning. Management was helpful at times, but often got irritated if you couldn't do something right, despite trying your best. They also promised a bunch of hours and some weeks workers only had 4 hour shifts."
good,"I liked the job, I really enjoyed the environment I was in. I had really awesome co-workers who always tried to help me. Just didn't work out due to commute issues."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"I enjoyed working for Panera Breade except the management team weren't my favorite people. I broke my arm in a car accident and was still forced to ""run"" food with one arm.  This lead me to quit."
good,This was a great place to learn to work with many other people. You have many more coworkers with all different personalities and you learn to work in a team to get the job accomplished and make the guest happy. I also learned how to build a relationship with the guests and got to see many different people.
good,"Panera bread is a nice start job. Decent hours for decent pay, the co workers are nice but the store itself was very understaffed. Hours can be very shifty and unexpected."
good,"I come in and get right to work. It's a busy work environment that requires attention detail and energy to be successful. The customers can be pretty neat at times, so that makes it cool."
good,"I enjoyed working at Panera! It's a fast paced environment as you could imagine. The customers that tend to go there know exactly what they want and how they want it. Just like everyone else they like accuracy. In my opinion the customers complain more their than any other place I've worked. I personally  didn't think the job was hard what so ever. It can be frustrating during rush times though because it's non-stop and you have those co-workers who seem to sit on their butts and do nothing. I could say the same for a manager or two their also. Other than that, I like going in."
good,I like the company and would recommend it to any one looking for an entry-level job. You learn the basics of hard work ethic in an environment that if fun and exciting.
good,"this was a great place to work for! I enjoyed learning what types of bread I was supposed to deliver, how to handle my routes and other things. The management did not mess with you at all and if I had any questions there was some one to speak too."
good,"no complaints really, i always liked the people there well enough, usually a tight knit group, management was nice, i enjoyed eating there, so working there was easier"
good,"Usually at Panera the day goes by relatively quickly because of the upbeat work environment that the employees give off, the job itself is pretty enjoyable as the customers that come to Panera are always friendly. The management does their job as far as making sure everything in the store is in line but scheduling wise they're horrible. They hire more people than they can handle and assign only a select few hours regularly. The hardest part of the job is closin dining room and dish but only because those take the most labor."
good,"kind workers"
good,"Shifts varied between the different positions, but there was opportunity to learn all positions and find one you worked best in. This job is great for learning how to interact with customers in a friendly environment. The management often was adequate, and favored different people, making competing for shifts difficult. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the rushes and making sure that everyone worked efficiently, but overall it usually worked out."
good,Everyone had similar personalities it was easy to get along with everyone. Most of the customers are regulars so you learn names fast and what they like. Be ready for change and to learn. There are plenty of opportunities for growth and raises.
good,"A typical day would start out with me stocking the lines, preparing for dinner rush, leading the team through the dinner rush, and then delegating the closing tasks."
good,where the process begins at the FDF great people solid organization it was a pleasure to work there. The problem for me was compensation was not at industry par level.
good,"it was okay, not too bad, sometimes rude customers to deal with but overall it was not hard to understand what was going on with the menu and rules at work"
good,"This is a great start for someone looking for their first job. one of the only cons is the pay and the constant change of management. Other than the low pay, Panera Bread is a great first job,"
good,I learned a lot of useful things working at Panera. It helped me develop even  better customer service skills. I love the concept essence and culture values of the company.
good,We all worked well together and helped out where we were needed. Managers stepped in when we got busy to assist. Everyone got along with each other. Enjoyable even when busy.
good,During my time working as a dishwasher at Panera Bread I feel I had an overall enjoyable experienced and that I worked with solid management. My hours were fair and the work was manageable.
good,"At my location, it is very fast paced. As a cashier, I am constantly busy. If I'm not helping a guest, I'm making drinks, stocking the bakery, making coffee, or cleaning up the dining room and work station. With the ""No Jerks"" policy, we're always there to help the guests. The managers are extremely helpful. Not only do they supervise the store and assist guests, they also help the staff in the bakery, on the line, in back of house, or on expo. Overall, I have a great time at work and the culture is great. The only issue I've come across so far is it is hard to get the amount of hours I need."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at panera. It was a very clean, well managed, company. I got along with everyone I worked with. Great work environment with lots of benefits."
good,A very monotonous work day.  Same duties and responsibilities day in and out.  Definite room for promotions and advancement based solely on your work ethic.  A very professional and fair management team.
good,I have been fortunate to work with a great group of people at both locations. Panera has really improved my communication and people skills. It has also given be the experience of a fast paced environment.
good,"Decent work place. If you want to find growth in a company, probably not the place to work. It's hard for advancement and only will give you the minimum about for a raise."
good,"Panera bread has a Fast pace environment. the pay rate and the hours wasn't bad for a high school student, management sucked at that time. Panera have pretty good food."
good,"Depending on the time of day the demand to get things done varies, no two days were similar so it always keeps you on your toes. The environment of Panera is a great place to start for this reason as you are able to learn and experience a great number of different situations."
good,Panera is a relaxed and nice place to be at. The food is great and the peoplr are good company. The discount that they give you is really good considering their food is expensive.
good,"This was my first job and as an associate I was given to many opportunities to advance, by 6 months I was an associate trainer. The job culture is great and really supports employee interaction."
good,"good times good food good people, the management was cool. learned lots of skills. people can be mean but everyone needs to work in food and retail at least once"
good,This was a good job while it lasted. The company is working to provide all customers with a great quality of comfort food. It was nice to feel confident in the product being sold.
good,"Kentlands is fun to work at. Beltsville is fun to work at. Dobbin square is a challenge but if your hard working and dedicated you might get far. the job itself isn't hard but its the customers. some are nice some are racist to be honest, but you can just ignore those few select people."
good,Serving the costmers the food. Greeting the costmers as they walk in taking orders smiling. Always keeping up with the store apprance as well. Cleaning the rest room too.
good,"Panera Bread/St. Louis Bread Company is an excellent brand to work for. I am thankful for the many skills I learned and the knowledge I acquired while employed at Panera Bread. Many opportunities for advancement, and their compensation is (mostly) fair."
good,"Low pay, good for high school and college students. "
good,This Job is not recommended for a first job. Make sure you have the natural or learning ability to be able work efficiently and expediently. I am more of a social outgoing worker and it was simply not needed here.
good,I went to school full-time and traveled a lot due to family while working here. My management was very considerate with time off and leaves of absence.
good,"Overall, I had a nice time working here. The food was good, the people are very nice, and I learned a lot. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to customers and the hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers."
good,Panera Bread has a good culture they have systems in place that if ran properly makes it easier for the overall operations.  They have a really big catering aspect of the business.
good,"There were definelty times when working here was"
good,"Typically a day would start with cleaning up the dining area, and doing a few dishes in the back. A large majority of my time would  be spent taking and making orders."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"I enjoy my coworkers, and the people I work with. Sometimes management is off and there a communications issues with them. Every manager does something different. A typical workday varies from day to day. It could be a good day or a bad day. Most employees are not dedicated to their job or don't care."
good,Its a good company to work for. My co worker are fun and friendly. You get to work a flexible schedule. You can enjoy the laughter and humor in the work environment.
good,"Just like most restaurants management can make or break it. I do not recommend moving upwards past trainer here unless you're serious about making headway into a salaried position, Shift Management is a sub-par in-between spot for anyone who's not a twenty-something."
good,There are many different positions and they help you find where you fit best and keep you there. That being said there is little to no job growth opportunity so this company is not the best place to look for long term employment.
good,I liked working for this company. I did find a better paying job but i didn't leave this company they would call me when they were short staffed i didn't want to leave this company. i did move to a different state so i did have to quit but not a bad company to work for.
good,"Whenever I had worked her I was still in high school, and as a high school student I had limited hours. After the first month I had only learned how to clean dishes and be a busser and after asking to be moved up the had refused to give me advancement so I had quit."
good,I would receive praise often for good work.  They made me feel appreciated at all times.  They also offered several incentives to employees to strive for greatness.
good,"Work at Panera is fast paced and often stressful. Sometimes its not too bad, but I usually hate myself by the time I'm done. 8/10 the food is pretty good."
good,"At Panera, my co-workers are great. We get busy often and very fast, and the team dose a awesome job overtime to pull through. The hardest part of my job ere I think is the speed that is needed to work in such a busy place, and he lack of interaction with the costumers I get. I have learned so much at this job, despite the frustrations, and person obstacles it is truly a over all great place to be."
good,"At Panera bread is always fun to make sandwich salad as a production line associate. What I learned from Panera bread is being kind to customer everyday is what brings them back to the store at all times. Management at Panera bread is not very well management, scheduled are not gave out fairly to each associates. Co-workers at Panera bread are not as productive as it seem, they all seem to be spoiled. There is not such thing hard at Panera bread but to deal with rude customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting 65% off on your lunch everyday."
good,"Overall Panera Bread is a good company to work for as they provide competitive pay and potential for upward mobility. I enjoy the many options for healthy eating as well as their charitable donations of leftover food to those in need at the end of each day. The hours can be difficult at times, as I was a store opener many days a week beginning at 5am, however the overall atmosphere of Panera Bread is positive through the efforts of dedicated managers and considerate coworkers."
good,"Had a good experience but the management wouldn't pay me much more than minimum wage. Also, the new manager started to hire high school age workers instead of young adults, had to move on."
good,Panera was a good company. The biggest plus side of it was the management I had the pleasure of working under. They were fantastic.
good,"Panera was a perfect fit for a first job. I really enjoyed the people around me and the environment that I was in. I learned a lot about customer service and food production. I usually would be making food but some days I'd be on drive-thru taking orders and/or cashing people out. Other days I'd be out in the dinning room serving people their food,cleaning tables, dry stalking and helping people with whatever they need. Working with the management and my fellow coworkers was probably the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,A typical day at work is calm and easy for me . I learned how to multitask and work at a fast pace. The managers and co-workers were nice and helpful.
good,"A typical day at Panera Bread for me was to make sure all tables in the dining area were clear while attending to any cutomer in need."
good,You will have to wake up very early to be a manager at Panera Bread. Overall it is a fairly easy job with the biggest problem being short staffed. I would suggest this job for anyone looking to get into food management.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"The job itself was not complicated. Most of it is just memory and knowing how to do everything but it was not too demanding. Management was ok, one manager was very mean and hateful but that's just my personal experience. Though get ready for a lot of menu changes and always having to explain those changes to customers. The customers are very snobby, for the most part. Many come in and behave like they're royalty so be prepared to deal with that stuck up ness. Very fast paced environment due to it gets extremely busy often. Also make sure you're great at multitasking."
good,A fun place to work. People are warm and welcoming. Food is always good and fun to make. Management very encouraging and help full. Management looks for the best to move upwards in the company.
good,I loved my job at Panera Bread !!! I learned a lot about time management. A typical day started at 4 or 5am and ended around 1pm. the hardest part of the job was the time crunch to get out the door with your delivery. The most enjoyable part of this job was knowing that I made somebody very happy by being on time with their delivery!
good,"A day at Panera is a day of fast-paced retail. Expect to sweat. But, once you get the hang of the job it's a lot of fun, most times. Panera is it's own little world."
good,It is an excellent world field for those that are going to college and need a part-time job. They are excellent people with a mix variety people you would never have thought to meet. A life experience you would not want to miss.
good,"Panera has a high turn over rate. This is both good and bad. If you stay you are more likely to get a promotion. However, since every one around you will be new to the job you will be caught up training everyone and it can be very hectic when rush hour comes. All in all there are good people there and the management is very helpful."
good,"Fun place to work with great opportunity to grow. Hard working staff with management that stays with the company. When I become the GM, the balance of family life and work went south. I did work for the company for many years, and they allowed me to move up through the company while going through school."
good,"The vision this company has is really something you can get behind. Even when we are not fully staffed the day to day is great! I really enjoy the work I do. Building relationships with our guests, and making their visit something they want to come back to everyday is what drives me."
good,"Panera was a very stable job for me, I would have continued to work there if I didn't have to move away for school. Fellow employees were great, job was very hectic but manageable."
good,Standard Food Establishment but a fun and healthy environment. The Staff and Management are a wholehearted and pleasant group.
good,"Panera bread was a fun work place somewhat fast paced "
good,"typical day involves serving guests, prep work, cleaning and fulfilling orders. Management needs to be worked on. Very strict about company policies."
good,Panera Bread is a great company to work for with great work life balance. They give back to the community and donate a lot! I am proud to say that I work for them. A typical day at work is very fulfilling.
good,a good place for high school and college kids to make some cash. repetition got pretty annoying though.not a bad job at all though
good,Great experience. My co-workers were amazing and I am so greatful for meeting the people I have through Panera. There are several oppurtunites to move up in your position. Management varies via each Panera Bread location. Very fast paced environment.
good,"Enjoyable workplace but high paced and stress job. Store was very tiny, and provided a limited work space. At specific store, amount of customer volume, and amount of inventory space do not correlate. Provides various benefits and programs, geared towards providing for employees."
good,"My coworkers are all very nice and a pleasure to work with.  The newly remodeled cafe is beautiful and an inspiring place to work in."
good,Prepping products before I baked them. I learned the art of baking Artisan Bread. Management was professional. I worked alone and overnight. The ten hour shifts was the hardest part but I adapted and the enjoyable part was the finish product. I love things to be perfect or as perfect as I can get things.
good,"A work day consists of a third shift, 10 hour schedule, usually starting at 9pm until 7am. My duties were to travel the 5 stores within the district to coach, supervise and support. During my time as a baker I was promoted to a supervisor, where I learned many skills in management and evaluation of employees. We communicated with mangers by phone on a regular basis, as the shift usually consists of 1 baker per store. I worked closely with coworkers as we communicated needs to get a bake done smoothly. The hardest part of the job is when last minute catering orders are added on to our pan-up sheets, in which we are sometimes challenged to reevaluate our initial plan for the shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to drive around to different stores to help with the needs of my bakers."
good,"Everyday I would come in and take my position as zone leader. Prepare what needs to be done for the upcoming rush, stock an do some cleaning duties. I worked at Panera Bread for almost two years and it only became worse and worse. The team usually has a good relationship, but I went through a phase where one of my associates hated me because i didn't take her shift, so as a result she bullied me at work for months. She had all of her friends hired and they would bully me at work and distract me from completing ticket times and be very disrespectful. The management found out about it and gave her a slap on the wrist, but when it continued we were both threatened to be fired when it was not my fault. I was training to become a shift supervisor so the negative attention hurt my work life. After that Panera Bread was less fun for me. I do think that most workers here are very dedicated, the ones that last. A lot of workers come and go very quickly, but the ones that stay are die hard Panera workers. We got through a lot of stress together then rejoice and cool off together when it's over. I enjoyed the team work that it taught me. I enjoyed training. The best part of this job has to be the down moments when we were able to bond and laugh with the management and other associates. Everyone was able to appreciate each other for our work. The job pays too low for all the hard work in my opinion. The management should take time to understand how hard some associates may work for the store."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Pretty Good Company"
good,"Sometimes we get rude nasty customers, but luckily that has taught me to better deal with ridiculous people and smile in the face of adversity."
good,"Very fun work place, its very fast paste being that it's on a college campus. The General Manger is great at being an great influence to the crew."
good,"Very enjoyable place to work, all of the employees where new being a new store, loved it, hardest part of the job was having people wait for tables being we were so busy but the comments from the customers at the end was fantastic"
good,"Panera gave me the experience of working with people in a role were I was not always spoken to in the best way. I learned the full capacity of my patience and learned how to manage a situation, such as an angry customer. I worked with colleagues to ensure that we could together provide quality care to the customer."
good,"I enjoy every day i come in to work. The pace is sometimes hectic, but there is always someone willing to lend a hand. The management  is great. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the pace sometimes, and being able to multi-task at a fast pace. Sometimes the days are busy and sometimes they're slow."
good,"Nice work place, clean, reliable staff, and decent food."
good,"A typical day at work is good for the most part. While I have been working here my communication skills have excelled and are still growing. I have learned many things on quality customer service and how to handle those not so nice guests that come in every once in awhile. The management there is good. They treat with you respect and dignity. The co-workers there are fine, everywhere you go there are going to be people that you don't to work with. The hardest part of the job I would day is the fast pace environment it is. It is a food place. trying to keep up while keeping times low is hard especially when people are telling you to go faster. What I like the most about this job is that it is helping me experience where I want to be in life and that I to interact with interesting people everyday."
good,"This job is recommended as a first job for High School Students who are wanting experience and learning what the job world is like.  You get discounts as being an employee of Panera bread. Also, you learn how to work different job settings such as being an Barista, Cashier, Line etc. It's a fun job for someone who needs experience.  You learn a lot of stuff while working for  this company and it's a great way to get out and give out great customer service!"
good,"My coworkers were mostly friendly and willing to help. Expectations for associates are high but certainly doable, and actually really helped to improve my time management and multitasking abilities. I also gained experience with cashiering, making different kinds of coffee drinks and smoothies, and how to maintain a positive and welcoming atmosphere. Most days I would work a 5 to 8 hour shift with a half hour break for lunch. The best part about this job was working barista - no heavy lifting and a lot of fun, even when the place gets busy."
good,"Working at Panera Bread is amazing! It has taught me so much being my first management opportunity. It gave me tons of challenges. Although, once you begin to move up, upper authority is bad about communicating any further growth. They were talking about promoting me to an Assistant manager, but when I am not reminded that this is in my future it is hard not to look for a better paying job. "
good,This job is preferably best for students that are in college or in high school that wanting little hours and focus on school. It's a great way to build experience and learn different ethic working skills.
good,"Panera itself is a wonderful company to work for. I would say that the issues that I have had in my positions have resulted out of some of the choice individuals in upper management chosen to run the cafes. The way that issues are dealt with within the cafe are somewhat troublesome and I feel that this would only deter potentially long-term employees from wanting to advance within the company. I feel that the corporate division should be more ""tuned-in"" associate needs on the individual cafe level. Pay is comparable to the amount of work and effort and you are willing to put in."
good,"Panera Bread was absolutely a prolific experience in my workforce history. Constant excitement, great sense of teamwork Panera has it all for new comers and seasoned veterans in the working world."
good,"Great place to work, clean environment, friendly people, clean and good food. I currently still work there and enjoy it very much."
good,"I worked for one of the Panera Bread franchises, not the main corporation. Although the job didn't have the best backing from the higher-ups, I was given freedom to create programs and activities to inspire development and growth from the employees, at my location. I actually started as a part time dishwasher, having just moved to the area, with no intention of staying. However, the GM I worked for was absolutely amazing and I felt there was much I could learn from her. Every couple of weeks, she would transfer me to a different position until I had learned them all. She then approached me to become part of the management team, which had been her goal all along. It was a pleasure working along side her and I am forever grateful for that experience. I was also presented with new challenges, such as supervising teenagers, which was something I had not done before. I really loved getting to help develop and cultivate them and they helped me develop new skills, as well."
good,This was a great company to work for. I believe Panera as a whole is a wonderful company with many programs to help it's associates and the community around them. Management helped employees during high traffic moments and provided a wonderful atmosphere. I worked with this company for 4.5 years and the only concern I had was the advancement opportunity. 3 times out of 10 they hired someone outside of the company to hire as supervisor.
good,"I have worked at Panera Bread for almost 4 years now.  The one I work at while home, is 5 minutes from my house.  While at school, Philadelphia University, I work at a Panera Bread that is 20 minutes away.  Both Panera Breads have similar workplaces, with good coworkers and management.  Since I have been there for so long, I am skilled in everything at the store such as register, dining room/dish, sandwiches, salads, and prep.  The most enjoyable part of my job is working with good people, while the hardest part is making food during lunch time.  Since I have been there for so long, I do enjoy the job."
good,Panera Bread is a great place for college age people to work. You don't get a lot of hours and they will try to flex around your schedule. Working at panera you actually do learn a lot of culinary skills. One thing that I do not understand at Panera is their system of advancing people. Some people would only be working their for a few months and get promoted to manager with no previous experience. Hardest part of the job was the long lines that never seemed to end and the snobbiness of the customers. Also not getting a free meal is lame.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,It was a really good company to work for . I worked there for five years but the problem is they always changing the managers.
good,"my daily routine,show up to work and clock in. I learned how manage time and make decisions based on dead line. the management is well organized and understanding if schedules need to be adjusted. the co-worker are very supportive when it comes to our daily goals. the most challenging part of the job is to perfect very goal in a timely matter . the most enjoyable part of the job is when goals are meet with accuracy the employees are awarded."
good,"Everyday the orders are different we could be slammed or dead. Delivery or in store pick up. Everyday is unpredictable. Management's trying to come together, kinda split. The most enjoyable part of my job is making the customers happy."
good,"Overall, Panera is a fairly great place to work. The managers are pretty flexible so your schedule can easily accommodate your individual life. Sometimes, customers can be ridiculous with their requests because they come in with the mindset that they are dealing with ""fast food"" employees. The Managers aren't always on the same page with each other so sometimes there is multiple ideas on what is the ""right"" way to do things. You get a lot of benefits and your wage steadily increases while working there. There are many opportunities to advance at Panera."
good,started out on the line and worked my way to catering coordinator before I left. there was a good work environment with positive attitudes.
good,"*A typical day at work was being a cashier and taking customer's order's. If it wasn't too busy I would help the food runner run the food to assigned table's and help them clean up the dirty table's"
good,"I did enjoy my time at Panera, but life got in the way and I just had to quit.  I was starting school and I had an unaddressed wheat allergy that kept me from doing the job to the best of my ability. It was a good introduction into working for a larger organization, and if I wasn't so head strong at the time I might have enjoyed the job more."
good,It was a great place to work. people are friendly and inviting. the employees were helpful at teaching me the procedures of the job. they were very detailed about how things were done. the management wad excellence and very understanding in all situations.
good,"Panera Bread is a leader in the casual dining area!  Working for them was an honor!  Learning to work with a different Cafes bakers was an experience as each have different personality and work flow!  Managing to adapt from Baking Operations to Retail Operations was the hardest part of this position,  due to the different shifts worked by all.  But had good relations with everyone involved! I directed Team leaders in Cafes, area or State."
good,"a great Menu!  They strive to be creative and really good flavor!  "
good,I learned how to deal with customers and satisfy their needs. My co-workers have been some of the most caring and nicest people I've meet in and out of the workplace. It gets a little hectic sometimes because of how fast-paced we have to be most times but it taught me how to multi-task and keep up with work.
good,"Heavy workload but able to work with good coworkers. Everyone is nice and willing to assist with new people. General manager and shift supervisor are awesome. "
good,"A typical day at Panera Bread includes customer interaction from the second I walk in until I leave. If I'm working in the morning, I'm almost always on register, interacting with customers, taking down their orders and constantly cleaning. When I work at night, I'm usually on the 'line' where I prepare and make the food, sometimes run the food to the customers. The most enjoyable part of my job is the customers. We have several customers that come in every single day,they know my name and I know theirs, and interacting with them every day is the best part of my job. The hardest part of my job is the hours I work, my schedule is never the same every week, and is often sporadic. I have a broad range of co workers, from people in high school, to grown adults with grandchildren. I've developed many friendships from work and enjoy my coworkers immensely."
good,"management didnt really give the good employees enough credit then we would have liked to see"
good,"I had great co-workers while working here, we all worked together and shared lots of laughs. The management was very attentive to the customers needs as well as the employees."
good,"Great job, easy work, long hours. Management is friendly but strict. Great constant customer care and service. I began to apply to colleges and once I began school I left."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job are the co-workers. Everyone gets along well and will help each other out. The hardest part is that the store is very busy so it can be stressful.Learning all the positions was easy and didn't take long. There are quick promotions, which is nice for people who want to climb the ladder."
good,"A typical day at Panera would be, I come into work get uniform ready and clock in. After i clock in i sign into a register and proceeds to take order from  my guest or answer any questions they have for me. I learned at Panera, especially in a restaurant environment that cleanliness is very vital to guest and it also help me perfect my communicative skills with guest. The management at Panera Bread was all in all good management, they took necessary steps to building the company. Hardest part of the job sometimes was to balance a very busy work environment, due to me having to switch positions sometimes for ex: being a cashier then switching off to be a server for guest. The most enjoyable part working at Panera Bread was interacting with the guest and rarely ever having bad day at work."
good,"For a chain/franchise place it is well run. I came from full service restaurants and there were some things that I was not used to and some standards that were, in my opinion, sub par. The product is good and some of it is amazing. The breads are fresh and what ever is not used that day is donated, in many locations."
good,"Mornings are slow and good if you want to just want to sip on coffee and read a book, as the day progresses it gets really busy and hard to find a place to sit and eat. Plan on taking the food home or back to the office."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,I love working for this company I can have fun at work and be myself. We always work together as a team and were more like a  family we work great together and show the true meaning of teamwork.
good,"Making food, washing dishes, greeter."
good,"Working at Panera was like working in the kitchen with family, everyone always willingly to pitched in to get the job done. This job would have been impossible without a fluent team. The hardest about this job was keeping up with the demands during our rush hours."
good,Very friendly people to work with and very welcoming. Respectful and a very clean environment. I learned how to be more patient and care for the customers needs. Management was very helpful and friendly when it came to the workers. The hardest part of the job was trying to remember the customers names the come in on a day to day basis. The most enjoyable part was developing a relationship with the customers.
good,Panera was pretty much an internet cafe where people would come to eat and hang out for a little bit maybe to study or to relax.This was my first customer service experience where i learned to help customers in a orderly and timely fashion and also how to work in a kitchen and food line. I liked the job because i worked with mostly young people around my age group and i got to meet alot of different types of people. The hardest part was probably at the end of the day trying to close the store in a short amount of time.
good,"Fast paced, need to stay focused and help where needed. Pay attention to customers and make sure they're happy. Co-workers are great, everyone is easy to get along with. Management is good, they're very understanding about the importance of work/life balance and hours are flexible."
good,"Great company, good product, only thing is you give up your life and other obligations many times. Compensation could have been better, as the bonus program didn't always let you bonus very well."
good,"Working at Panera bread teaches you everyday about different customers needs, wants, and overall attitudes. Its never to much to go out of your way to help someone and make their day better. Co-workers constantly try to make sure one another are taken care of and don't need help. We always make sure the customer come first. If something is wrong we try to fix it immediately. The managers always ask if help is needed to effectively get food out to the customers quickly and to also beat our own set time goals."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed the job itself, catering to the customers as well as making orders, running food, and closing the dining room. however, they hired a significant amount of people at once and I was one of the few that fell through the cracks. I was only working 1 to 2 days a week and decided to resign so I could be a full time student. The hardest part was that I really loved working there and hoped it could be a full time job for me, but it didn't work out that way. Managers were as helpful as they could be, but like I said they had way to many employees which made it difficult to get help when needed."
good,Hardest part of the job was working the hours and the distance traveled once they relocated me. The training program is very off and I believe that it could have been done alot differently and that more time could have been put into proper training especially with management.
good,"Its a very fun workplace. All employees get along and laugh, including the management. Very nice place to work if their was more growth."
good,"Each day was always new when meeting people. I learned how to manage a cash register, make and cook sandwiches, professionally greet customers. The management team is always on point and co-workers are great to work with. Rushes can be stressful but working as a team, the lunch rush wasn't a problem. Meeting new people and getting to know them."
good,This Panera is a fun place to work a lot of great workers and managers but the hours that you receive are very spontaneous at best. i have had a pay period were i received 32 hours one week and 12 the next.
good,The hardest part of the job is the fact that it is an overnight position but I love the freedom. I have learned tons throughout my experience and the manager is one of the best I have ever had.
good,"This job gave me experience working customer service, related to food. I employed cashier requirements and developed skills in the bakery and barista businesses."
good,I would recommend Panera Bread to all job seekers. Positive work environment. Free meals while working. development and advancement opportunities.
good,"Preparing and constructing orders efficiently at rush hour times such as lunch and dinner"
good,"Panera Bread was in my field of study since I do have a BA in Management.  I felt after working for the company over the course of 2 years, it was not a good fit for me long-term.  Management was very good, but I found working in a fast-paced restaurant was indeed something I could handle, but would not be fulfilled with."
good,"Company was willing to work with school schedule "
good,Panera is a great workplace with great people.  I learned a great deal about customer service as well as working in teams.  I didn't feel as though I was reaching my potential.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Panera has a very open and inviting atmosphere and is good to it's employees, has a focus on providing an environment of 'Panera Warmth' to customers and employees alike. The only reason I left was because of issues at home."
good,"Lots of people to meet and become familiar with. It becomes easy to do daily tasks and meet expectations, along with greeting and producing a great food experience."
good,"I worked as an overnight baker for a few years. I enjoyed the work that I did because it allowed me a chance to do something I was truly interested in, baking. Along the way I was able to train a few new bakers into the district for a short time."
good,"productive, fast paced working area, with great music. Most customers are nice. Management can be better. employees are very nice."
good,"Panera Bread is a great company to work for. Depending on your position you will eventually be cross trained to perform other tasks in an effort to groom you for later management advancement. This can lead to a very busy work shift, but it isn't something that is overwhelming."
good,"A typical day at work when I open the store would be putting every bakery item out.  I would then make sure the correct tags are in front of every bakery item. Next, as the store opens I ring up customer's orders. I fill their bakery orders, and make their drinks. A typical day when I close, would be similar. I would ring for the majority of the time. But I also have to stock everything up before I leave, including paper goods and foods. Then I am in charge of cleaning my assigned area. Some days I train a newer employee, and I teach them how to do all of these things. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the many different personalities and attitudes that the customers have. However, I learned to deal with it and treat everyone kindly. My coworkers are supportive for the most part. We all work as a team. The management is great. My only complaint would be that sometimes the scheduling was not right. They would schedule me on days that I had school. What I learned from this job is that when dealing with people, you have to leave your attitude at the door! No matter what I am personally going through, when I walk through those doors I must treat everyone respectfully."
good,"A typical work day includes me counting the money in my drawer, taking customer's orders, and filling out the order. I've learned to work quickly and to double check everything for accuracy. My management all recently changed. However, all the new managers are really nice. I get along with all my coworkers. The hardest part about the job is when there's a line out the door, and we have to get through the line as quickly as possible. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with my little sister."
good,"it seems like not only the people you work with but the company itself cares for you in some way. Although they pay is not ideal, its still better than the same position at some other company. They also love to teach you about new products and service techniques in order to not only help further your knowledge but to help their company succeed."
good,"Good, relatively relaxing place to work with quiet customers. The company is big about making sure customers have a good ""Escape"", if you will. A place to relax and enjoy good food and drink."
good,"a typical day at work is a lot of work theres never down time."
good,"punch in work in the area I was told to take a 30 minute lunch when i am told to. take bathroom breaks whenever. clock-out late and go home. I learned how to make drinks, clean tables, dishes and my hands thoroughly to pass inspection and keep people from getting sick, my managers were nice and supportive. My co- workers  were okay but many of them slacked off. the hardest part of my job was trying to decide what to do first out of all of my tasks but the best part was when my co-workers would make me laugh and say I was doing good even if everything was going horribly wrong just to help us make it through the day."
good,Had a great time there. I love how clean mgmt kept the store. Always got about 40 hours. I really cant complain about this company
good,Panera is the perfect job for a student. The work schedule is flexible.  The job is fast paced with much opportunity for advancement.
good,"Very fast paced environment, a lot of multi-tasking."
good,"A typical day at work consists of breakfast rush, lunch rush, and a lot of cleaning and cooking throughout the day. Everything from serving dishes to washing them after personally picking them up from tables."
good,"All in all Panera is a great place, its a happy environment to be in the  people are nice the food is great the area is clean and everything I mean every place has its flaws."
good,"Great management, most enjoyable part of the job were the customers. Co-workers very friendly and hard workers."
good,"I dealt with the huge crowds that Union Square commands, so that meant there were always ways to keep busy as well as tasks that came up constantly. The management didn't get along too well on both sides, with employees and corporate. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the high pace of the store."
good,"- Assisted diners with seating as needed"
good,"A typical night would be me by myself after 10 pm preparing all the breads and sweets before i go to bake them. I learned that certain foods need different kinds of preparations and if you don't prepare them the right way they will turn out bad. The management was kind of bad no one was willing to transfer me when i needed to be transferred, also they were never organized when we had to look back at paperwork. All my co-workers were nice when i worked with them most of the time I was alone working. The hardest part of the job is timing with everything, if I slacked I would leave a lot later then my original schedule. The best part of the job was seeing the customers enjoying your product that you have made."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,I loved the food and the experience but I prefer to work where the pay is at least livable
good,A typical day at Panera Bread includes taking orders and delivering food to tables. I have learned to deal with a variety of personalities in both fellow employees and customers. The management team does what ever needs to be done to help the whole team ensure the customers have a great experience. The hardest part of the job is being on your feet for hours on the hard floor and carrying the heavy food trays. The most enjoyable part of working at Panera Bread is interacting with the customers and getting to know them. I have met quite a few very interesting and fun people while working at Panera Bread.
good,I loved working at Panera the atmosphere was great and i enjoyed everyone who i worked with. The only reason i left is new management came in and wasn't accepting with my school schedule so i had to choose school over my job.
good,"Panera is always a step ahead of its competitors.  They have a great employee culture, and fun atmosphere.  Always new and exciting things to learn.  As a Restaurant manager you get to learn the whole business over time, as you play different roles in the restaurant."
good,"busy stocking and prep"
good,"A typical day of work is not a difficult one, as long as the team of employees that are scheduled that day are willing to work together as a team to help the customer. If co-corkers are present physically and mentally, then the process can work efficiently. The willingness of managers to jump into the mix and help is also a good thing to have, as long as they do not start to micromanage the employees."
good,It is an overall great environment to work in but after a while you get tired of being there. The typical day is very busy and fast-paced. Some of the managers are nice while others are just rude. The hardest part of the job would be all the responsibility and tasks that are put on just one individual that you have to get done. I mostly go to work just to be with my co-workers.
good,"Panera Bread has taught me a lot about the overall workplace and myself. Although the peak hours can be extremely hectic and stressful, the atmosphere and people you work with give you a sense of stability. The intense training sets you up for success and can lead to advancement within the company such as becoming a certified trainer or supervisor. I am happy to say that this company noticed my hard work and promoted me after only a month of working with the company. I then became and third shift baker and was promoted to assistant general manager. I know every aspect of the company and continue to keep learning."
good,"Work is divided up so everyone has a role. Teamwork and communication naturally develop as the day goes on in order to keep up with the flow of business. I learned that you have to communicate well and stay positive each day in order to make it through those rough rushes. Co-workers make it easy to stay positive and unite to make a strong team. Management is always willing to help at the drop of a dime. Hardest part of the job is keeping up with the busy rushes, but the most enjoyable part is getting to talk to regular customers who share friendly conversations."
good,I loved working at Panera. The only problem with the job was the little hours I was given. I would still be working there if it had been a full time job. I loved my co-workers and my bosses. The customers that came in were always very nice and patient with me when I first started out. This is a great job in food service!
good,"I was a cashier and I would always close the dining area.  I closed the bakery once or twice while I was working there too, but that seemed to take me longer to do than the dining room.  When I wasn't cashiering, I would be out in the dining room sweeping and cleaning until close.  Some of my other tasks were restocking and cleaning the bathrooms and floors.  That always took a toll on my back. I never had any issues with any of my coworkers at Panera.  They were all extremely friendly, though not always willing to help me out when I needed a shift covered.  There weren't that many cashiers and I only worked three days a week so it felt a little silly for it to be so impossible to get someone to take a shift for me.  The job was easy, and I think the hardest part was scrubbing the floors every night.  But for the most part I enjoyed working there and I never had any hang ups.  They even let me take vacation time off, albeit unpaid time off."
good,"Great Place to Work"
good,"Typical bakery job, good food and good people.Liked the job, working nights got to me eventually and i couldnt do it anymore."
good,"Panera not only has great food, but great employees, management, and customers!"
good,"Delivered excellent customer service"
good,"Lunch rush is pretty busy, most other parts of the day are pretty uneventful. I find myself looking for more stuff to do rather than needing stuff to be done."
good,"A typical day involved anything and everything, from customer interaction to inventory management to cashiering to cleaning. There wasn't really anything that wasn't your job, even for management. The work day always went by fast because it was always so busy. You could make lifelong friends not only with your co-workers but with the genuine customers who came to visit everyday."
good,"I started working here as a suplement to school funds due to the Post 9/11 GI-Bill. I've stayed because of the interactions between the customers, and co-workers. Its not easy to work in a fast food industry that is trying to push itself from that image into its own area of food. But the work and energy I put into ""my"" store comes back to me in the smiles of children and their parents and the thanks from co-workers. Its not a perfect company, but it does try its best to take care of everyone. Just trying to be good people all the time is hard, as the Air Force core values stated, Integrity first doing the right thing even when no one notices."
good,"A typical day at work I log the food temperatures to ensure food safety. I make sure all associates are in their positions, so the restaurant runs well. I make sure we have all the products to sell. All products are prepped that morning. The bake good are bake at night, but if we need more bake goods I will bake more product such as cookies, muffins, scones, and pastries. I do the end of day cash deposit. I have learned to manage my associate to be productive. Some co-worker are hard workers and others are not as productive as I would like them to be. The hardest part of the job is when an associates call off their shift and I have to find a associate who will be willing to come in to work. The most enjoyable part of work is taking care of the customers and see the associates grow in the knowledge they have learned."
good,The management is pretty nice and the coworkers are great. The hardest part is just dealing with the customers.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"I have been with Panera Bread for more than a year, I have learned to work every aspect of the establishment. I could not have asked for better management. Because I am a college student and live in two different towns throughout the year, Panera Bread has been extremely accommodating to my needs. They allow me to transfer to different locations based on where I need to be for my schooling. They are also extremely flexible with hours, as they cater greatly to college students like myself. My only qualm with the company is that, though I have been with Panera Bread for a year and believe myself to be an exceptional employee, I have not yet been promoted. The main reason this upsets me is that during training, the managers make such a big deal about how they promote from within. However, in my experience, I have seen countless people come in as supervisors and managers with no experience as to how Panera Bread really works. This aside, I have had an overall exceptional experience with my time at Panera."
good,preparing and serving breakfasts and lunches for all students and staff. Snack bar attendant. Cashing handling.
good,Best part was getting lunch breaks and food for a discount. It is a very nice place to work you just have to keep busy.
good,"Great Concept"
good,Panera Bread is a nice company that gives me the opportunity to work there. I like it so much. I love their company culture. However I think that is time for me to look for new experiences.
good,The workplace is a really fun environment. The general manager is really nice.
good,"Working within Panera bread is very rewarding and encouraging. Some of the people we meet have a smile that can change anyone's day! My usual day includes clocking in and helping my co workers to exceed our daily company goals. I float from each side of the store giving anyone including managers a hand in all of their duties of the day. I've learned to manage happy and concerned customers. Also, I've learned what it truly means to work as a team. The hardest part of my job would probably be maintaining multiple positions during our busy lunch hours. The most enjoyable part of my job is making my regulars favorite foods with a little love each day!"
good,"Came in to work every day with a smile and warm attitude. Worked with customers for the entirety of my shift explaining menu items and ensuring customer satisfaction."
good,"A typical day at work would be hectic and busy because I worked at one of the biggest and busiest Panera Breads. My co-workers were friendly and worked well with others and ensured I knew exactly what to do and how to do it. The hardest part of my job was dealing with the amount of customers, one of the busiest environments I've dealt with. The most enjoyable part of my day was seeing how satisfied every customer was that walked in and made sure they were to come back."
good,"I started at Panera Bread in Hamden while I was a sophomore in college.  I chose Panera because I was familiar with the restaurant and I liked the atmosphere.  After my first two months, my managers asked me to become an associate trainer.  I was excited because I knew that I stood out as a leader and a knowledgable employee.  In 2012, the Regional Training Manager asked if I would travel to New York City to help open a cafe with her and a team of other associate trainers.  I was proud because I could share my skills and do something new.  After that I helped open 6 other cafes throughout Connecticut. I have been crossed trained in all areas and I have recently graduated from college, so my availability for full time employment opened up.  My current position is the Catering Coordinator.  I spend my days organizing, planning, executing and selling which is very fast paced.  I like the new position Panera has offered me because it challenges me and helps me focus on my strengths while developing my weaknesses so when I do find the career of my dreams I will be prepared. I am proud to have worked with a company that has allowed me to travel, challenge myself and develop my skills."
good,"A typical day at work is constantly busy. From the time we open the doors in the morning until the time we close at night there is always something to do. We have great customers who comes in everyday,  who we have gotten to know personally."
good,"Panera was the best place i've worked. Great people, good management, overall production was smooth and enjoyable. Was lied to for months about raise and position training."
good,Typical day included helping customers and producing food and following company procedures
good,"From making sandwiches to customer interaction this job can really encompass a person. I come in at 4:45 in the morning to get the day started and make sure the customers coming in have their best experience at our every day oasis. You are what you bring to this job, if you want to experience a good day then the customers see that and it will be, if you bring unwanted drama then you will see yourself falling into a spiral of dissatisfaction. I have been here for 2+ years and have enjoyed it and have been given the respect from both management and customers to reach a shift supervisor. Though it can be tough to deal with and some days seem like the day before, I enjoy knowing that I work for a company that helps give back to the community through donations and community events."
good,"A typical day at work would very on and off to being very busy or very slow. I learned to make specialty drinks. The management team was amazing. I loved my manager. The co-workers were all friendly and we all got along. The hardest part of the job wa finding things to do if it was very slow, but the moest enjoyable part of the job was providing great customer skills and making the specialty drinks for the guests."
good,Working at panera was not easy. But it was fun to an extent. I learned alot of skills working with food. And about customer service. Management wasnt so great. But they worked with the employees on scheduels daily.
good,"a lot of work. some employees are not as efficient as others but they get pay the same. good flexibility on schedules, since they are open everyday and lots of shifts to cover."
good,The work staff was great. The mangers were fair and stayed on top of quality of there product. I enjoyed working there for long hours without interuption or running into any problems.
good,"I enjoyed working nights there, creating my own time table.  I learned a lot about time management."
good,"Some days are hectic and some are slow days. The management is okay, they're very picky at times."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Panera Bread has a lot of growth opportunities and room for advancement,"
good,"I enjoyed working at Panera Bread about a decade ago even though it was short term: ( I was looking to climb the financial ladder). It was a nice place to work- in the morning I would push giant carts of bagels into a big oven, make coffee throughout the day, have good laughs with my co-workers while packing small prepared items like cream cheese into individual cups. The lunch hours between 12-2 were the busiest times, I was one of the fastest cashiers so I was happily obliged to be in the middle of those big rushes. When I wasn't busy behind the register I could walk around the dining room to wipe down tables, greet the customers, and offer to take their trays for them. All in all it was a good job."
good,"Managers were always very involved within the workplace."
good,my co-workers are very helpful. I learned about barista. the hardest part about the job was keeping up with lunch rush.
good,"- May have came in on a rush or very slow."
good,Start work at 5am. Learned how to set up the line.  Management was knowledgeable and friendly.  Hardest part of the job was getting the hours you want.  Most enjoyable part of my job was the teamwork.
good,"A typical day consists of Hands on work of all aspects of the operation. To include money handling, food preperation, and customer service."
good,"Fast paced work environment. Organized, and the people there were very likable."
good,"It's a great first job for the pay, and where I worked the managers were super nice as well as most of the employees. However my issue was, I never got more than a 10 cent raise the year and a half I was there. I had also been promised up to 50-75 cents in raises, however it has now been 8 months and I have never received anything. It is also hard earned money. If you're someone who is lazy, you won't last at Panera for very long. However my overall experience was very good. My only reason for looking elsewhere is the lack of pay at this point."
good,Working for Panera Bread I have learned a lot about management and how to become a better leader.  I like the fact that it was a different task on a day to day basis.  I did not like the long hours  (4:30 A.M - 3) 
good,A typical day at Panera consists of managing day to day operations and giving the best customer experience possible. Management and associates are all easy to work with. Maintaining the high excellence of customer comments is one of the hardest parts of the job. Most customers only want to complain than send in a complement.
good,Panera has a strong view on their cultures and values. And they know how to pass it along to each customer that comes in. Go into any Panera in the morning and you can see what makes this place so special.
good,It is a fun atmosphere to be whereas you work with many associates at your age. You are given an opportunity to learn from each other and help each other to achieve goals and satisfy the customers.
good,friendly environment. very clean and strict on safety rules. customers are always polite for the most part. working can get stressful during busy hours. 
good,"I trained all new associates on prepping food, cashiering, and dining room."
good,The management was very good. They helped the other associates train the new ones. The managers understood if we had a problem in the workplace. Overall Panera is a good company to work for. Its also a very simple job just need some basic costumer service skills.
good,"Working for Panera Bread had its pros and cons as with any job. If you perform well and make a constant effort, you have no problems. If you are ""lazy"", don't expect to be there long. Lunches can be busy and stressful, but only last a few hours so it isn't bad. The most enjoyable aspect of the job is creating lasting relationships with the regulars customers."
good, 
good,"They provided training the moment you're hired, so you'll be ready wherever you are needed. The customers are usually regulars so they are often friendly very friendly. The managers and coworkers are really great to work  with. But it is important to really let them what's going on with your schedule so they can compromise with you."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,The mangement was wonderful. They would work around everyones schedule making sure that every employee got the hours they needed and when they needed them. The most enjoyable part of the job was the daily customers. There bright faces always made the day better. My co workers became some of my best friends in the city i worked in.
good,Working for this company is a fun experience but its has its up and downs like any other company
good,"It was a good job with an average starting pay. It was fun to engage with people, with the opportunity to do lots of jobs and not just one."
good,"I typically work as a cashier and in the bakery, My duties include ringing up customers, preparing bagels and pastries from the bakery, and making smoothies and espresso drinks. Occasionally, I will also work in the dining room, where I brew drip coffee, bus tables, and wash dishes. Working here, I've learned that great customer service is what keeps customers coming back. The management at Panera works pretty well, but I think it would benefit from more specific job assignments. The hardest part of my job would have to be working quickly and efficiently to get through our high-volume lunch rushes. The part I love most about my job is talking to customers and forming connections."
good,"I am cross-trained in three of the four positions at Panera,(Dining, The Line, Dish, and Cash/Barista. Each day is different according to the position I work in."
good,"As far as restaurant jobs go, it's has the similar pros and cons to any restaurant jobs. Definitely a step up from your typical fast food."
good,"I only worked mornings, so a typical day at work started busy. Almost before even clocking in there is a line of people in a hurry to get their coffee, morning pastry and/or a box of items to take to the office. The morning flies by with constant brewing of coffee, toasting bagels, and slicing bread. There is a light lull around ten thirty and then breakfast rush is immediately followed by the lunch rush; which is even more chaotic than the mornings. By two pm, lunch rush is pretty much over and there is a few minutes left to clean up and switch over from am to pm crew. The hardest part of the job is helping undecided people make a decision while the mile-long line glares at you. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the familiar faces of the regulars."
good,"As an associate primarily in the bakery portion of Panera Bread, I serve customers quickly and efficiently, while providing a friendly and personable experience. I also train other associates in the bakery area. With this, Panera Bread has provided various opportunities for me; as a result, I have gained various customer service and leadership skills."
good,"Work was as usual, come in and clean or make food for consumers. I found out that I'm not a guy that likes working in a food setting. Co-workers were usually fun to be around, and the hardest part about the job was making sure the people who came there were happy and pleased with my service."
good,I work a morning shift through the end of lunch.
good,i really like this job and the company everyone is nice and friendly to me and other co-worker. They good at teaching new employee about the job duties and the work. The hardest part about the job is keep up with the bread. I learn so much about panera bread i never knew about panera bread.
good,"Typical day included ringing orders, fulfilling special request, maintaning a claean envirinment"
good,"It was great working in a fast paced environment, yet some other employees did not have a great work ethic. It's very difficult to accomplish things as a team when others aren't completing their tasks per management. Great managers, yet they seem stressed out. I was hoping to advance within this company, yet moved to a different state."
good,Job was fun people were great there everyone i worked with was easy to get along with and everyone helped everyone if you needed it.
good,"A typical day at work consists of lots of customers. We are always busy and sometimes it's overwhelming but we stick together as a team and get the job done. My coworkers at Panera are great. I've made great friends and enjoy working there. The food, benefits, and people are awesome, my only complaint would be management. Some of the managers are not fit for the job and look at it as a paid vacation of doing nothing. The managers are not held to the same standards and get away with things that the employees would be written up for. The hardest part of the job is staying caught up with the flow of customers. There's never just one order, there's several and if you get behind just a little bit"
good,8 hour shifts with 30 minute breaks
good,Training was well done. My only issue was that hours were inconsistent. One week I was scheduled 32 hours and the next only 12. It made it hard to budget for expenses when you never knew what your check would be from week to week.
good,The associates are the most important thing at Panera. The company makes fresh product daily and the management staff is very solid. The most enjoyable part of the job was providing quality product in a safe environment.
good,I really enjoyed working at panera bread the discount was awesome just like the people i worked with. Management was great and very helpful. The hardest part of the job was when we were running out of food at the end of the night. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people and the personal name tags that we created.
good,"I typically go into work at 6 a.m. slice bread for the sandwich line, and take customer's orders."
good,"As the Training Specialist I'm in charge of the daily management of labor hours, which entails calculating labor hours used with actual sales. Each week I make the associate schedule, my goal is to stay within the allowance of labor hours, which is to be under 35 hours. This is a very obtainable goal and I hit this goal 90% of the time. I also narrow down the applicants and hire new employees, and complete all paper work that goes along with the new hire process. Not only do I do administrative work but I also interact with customers, I form bonds with regulars and love mingling with new customers. Being a social person makes it very easy to make relationships with them. Finally, I have formed great relationships with co-assistant mangers and co-workers. Being involved with the associates creates a great base for a good running café to insure good attitudes and performance."
good,"I cleaned all the tables and got all the dishes together. Overall, the people I worked with were nice and friendly. The place was ran well. One thing that was hard was that there was only one person cleaning dishes, tables, taking out trash, making coffee and cleaning everything else. That did get a little overwhelming at times but overall it was a great place to work!"
good,"fun job hectic at busy hours like any other place, not a job for a lazy person"
good,"I learned an abundant amount of information regarding inventory and also, acquired experience in a high volume setting. Management was very professional and overall helpful in the time that i belonged to the company. My fellow staff members were very conducive in teaching me the skills to perform my job adequately. The more difficult part of my experience was learning to adjust to a high volume setting. My favorite part of my job was my co workers and all the new people i had the pleasure of meeting."
good,Panera bread is very focused on serving a high quality product while retaining the speed of a fast food restaurant. All breads and pastries are baked daily. Running a shift can be tough work and requires the manager to be extremely organized.
good,"Good first job, things are ran well and it is a clean kitchen."
good,"Good for people fresh on the job hunt, not much to offer after that. Workplace drama exists, but where does it not. Good management, but its exactly what it is: a fast food job."
good,Keeping customers happy with the great service we provide throughout the year training our staff to reciprocate the process by acknowledging our repeat customers everyday.
good,"A typical day at work:"
good,Everyone keeps each other in check as well as making sure to support one another with any personal emotional dilemmas. The managers always try to lend an ear and listen to fellow employees problems.
good,the work was ok nothing to bad we handle lunch rushes very nicely but some manager hated the some of us coworkers so they become mean and I didn’t like how they treated there employee so I left
good,Most days there were enough staff and organization to run smoothly and have little stress. Management was very trusting of employee's and most days you can bring left over baked goods home.
good,Management was fairly good. Could move up in the company as long as you worked hard at what you did. unfortunately have to deal with not such great workers but you have that everywhere.
good,"It’s a great job , you’ll definitely get a learning experience , room to grow and learn the basics the people in there is very friendly you’ll feel very welcomed"
good,all of the other employees at Panera were very nice and helpful when needed. The coworkers are very nice and helpful when you need your shift covered. The managers were also very understanding about you not being able to come in.
good,"I had a great time working for Panera bread. I never had a problem with anyone. My managers were great, and good and fair to me. I never had an problem with management at all. My experience with the company was great."
good,I am looking for a job that gives me benefits. I am looking for a job to give me weekends off or two days in a row in a week I am willing to work and able to start asap
good,So far so good for the most part. I make good tips driving most days but sometimes it can be really slow especially the weekends. But you can make in store wages on those days. Management is ok. Asked if i could move from delivery to in store and was kinda blown off so idk but we’ll see.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Panera had a lot of heart in their store and managed the employees really well but as an adult the pay for the work you were doing was not enough.  Would recommend to teens
good,"Hardest part is the job is very quick paced depending on the location. "
good,"While working at Panera Bread, I learned so many things, and one of them is the team work. I learned how to work together as a team to get the work done. Secondly, the culture of Panera Bread is so good. The managers are friendly."
good,"At Panera, you'll get rushes at expected times, so more often than not, your prepared. Although, it's recently been understaffed (2019), making the rushes more difficult, but the people and environment make up for it."
good,"Fast paced, multiple areas to focus on during the course of the day, good balance for quality of life with work versus home, ability to fix problems with little issue"
good,"Work part time during college as a delivery driver."
good,"Working at Panera is not bad at all. Everyone is very friendly and nice, and will always be there if you need help. It's also something you would expect if you have worked in ""fast food"" before, the only difference is that the food has to be handled a little differently since we don't work with burger or fries. Other than that, I'd say it's pretty nice."
good,Panera bread is a good place to work at for a starter position. If you do not plan on moving up to management or catering than there is not much money to be made.
good,I want to quite because I don’t get paid as much as I want. I worked all my free time 30-35 hours per week. I really like my coworkers and to be a main prepper.
good,"Typical day of work for me was always during closing hours and consisted of taking customer orders at a register, keeping the the bathrooms and cafe area clean and assisting my co-workers if they needed it. I learned to work with other people productively in a fast paced environment. Management there were very friendly, helpful and understanding and I very much enjoyed working there because of it. The hardest part of the job was handling miscommunications with orders taken. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with people I consider my friends."
good,"Panera bread is nice if you can stay working there for longer than a year. I find that most people quit within the first six months. They think the management is unfair, but it isn't that bad. Sometimes it is uncoordinated. If you can stick with the company, though, the food discounts are nice and the coworkers you meet are lifelong friends. Easy to transfer to a new panera if you move. Customers are a pain to deal with sometimes."
good,"Received great training/on boarding at a different cafe so when I got to my home cafe I had plenty of Panera knowledge and could more easily gain the trust of associates. Training was done at a certified ""training cafe"" so everything is done by the book and with ease. Non-training cafes tend to have a lot more issues and less attention to detail than training cafes so coming in, you might get a false sense of what every Panera is truly like. Overall, great experience."
good,Panera is a good place to work and I’ve had a pleasant time working there. Other associates are helpful in training and the management is friendly and encouraging.
good,"Strugglers kept their jobs until they made large mistakes, when they should've been fired for still being slow months after being hired on. Moving up was difficult due to a recent company transition."
good,"A typical day envolved monotoring labor and food cost, managing associates and customer complaints, leading the team through a fast and efficient service, counting drawers, monotoring sales, and helping associates in their roles on the registers, the line, in the dining room, or on prep."
good,"I liked the people I worked with, the work itself was pretty mindless. Management has been great. People do rotate in and out pretty quickly. The discount is nice."
good,If you have passion for customer service and food service Panera is a great place to build your career.  Great team members! Great Customer! Amazing food!
good,Panera Bread is a very customer centric company that's main goal is to make sure that every customer leaves with not only a pleasant experience but one that is consistent regardless of what cafe you visit.
good,"It's quick service.   Of course it's stressful.  Adapt.  Corporate & franchises all differ in application of core values.   Scout the franchise, identify management, try to get honest assessment on the side from an asst mgr.  I've worked with corporate and 2 different franchises.   Corp was aggravating expecting 65 1 minute tasks done in an hour."
good,"Panera was my first real job, that taught me customer service, and how to be respectful to customers. Being a food runner, made me have to memorize 60 tables, which wasn't even that difficult."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Days can be stressful and very busy. lots of room for growth. regular turnover as it is a first time job for many. managers are not the most consistent.
good,Worked here at Panera for a little over a year. Got great treatment and was glad to be apart of a great comunity. I hate that I had to move on but I come by to visit from time to time when I can.
good,I am a fast learner. I have cooking experience. Have good consumer service the most fun at had at panera is when the evening was happening and i loved that they donated all there food
good,"* Clocked-in and began my duties setting up my usual spot on salads, checked stickers were up to date if not change them, portioned dressings, stocked up plastic containers if they needed to be stocked up."
good,"It is an overall good job, Although i am looking for higher pay. I have had a good experience there. We teach kids how to have responsibilities and Meet the time goals."
good,"Working at Panera gave me a good opportunity to learn customer service skills and improve those skills. Depending on the time and day, it was not boring to work there. Something always needed to be done."
good,Normally came in at 2p.m in the middle of the rush but with the help from my co-workers it was very smooth. Everyone was quick with closing down the store and very open to helping when needed.
good,"Work life was good, the corporation side was really truly and honestly bad. A typical day at work was i did the work i was assigned, it was really cool."
good,It was an ok job. I just worked there to make some extra money but did not enjoy working. It is a very repetitive job and I do not think the food industry is my cup of tea.
good,"Good place to work.   Great place when fully staffed.   Constantly covering for open positions gets old.   Management sometimes seems a bit disconnected,  However,  Panera seems to find genuinely nice people to fill supervisory positions.   I wish they would react quicker to problems.  When we have a full staff this is a good company to work for."
good,"Panera is a nice place to work, especially if you’re in college or need to work part-time. They’re good with hours. Although, there aren’t a lot of benefits."
good,Its honestly a well run establishment and if you learn fast you'll do fine. You're encouraged to be nice and accommodating so if you're naturally that way you'l fit right in.
good,"Work is not difficult, as long as you follow directions and focus on ensuring what you're doing is correct than it's great. Management could be better."
good,"Panera Bread is a very laid back and easy going job. Everyone works together and cooperates to the managers needs. However, the management at Panera Bread isnt spectacular."
good,I worked for Panera bread in Charlotte for over 7 years so I seen alot and I learned a lot... I encounter opening new stores... Talking to people from corporate office and I worked in a place that was mainly non-stop business... I met great people...
good,"- it gets pretty busy at work"
good,If you are struggling to find a job then Panera bread delivery driving is mostly likely going to always have availability. The only flaw is there's a chance you are extremely busy with deliverys all shift or you're just standing there the whole shift getting maybe 2 deliverys. But overall the job is fairly easy and the people you work with including management are nice people who will greet you everytime you come in to work.
good,"Team members are really nice and help each other, payment was not the best there. It is a good starter job, but not a full-time job. learned the core mechanics of customer service."
good,"A typical day for any employee at Panera Bread includes serving customers, cleaning, and stocking inventory for use. Many employee positions prepare food as well. The culture is a collaborative one where generally everyone is comfortable working in a fast-paced environment."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,It was never the same never really knew what the day would bring. The environment was great. The customers where nice. some of the management was great.
good,i like panera its pretty cool theres not a lot of business for delivery drivers though so there isnt  a lot of money in that articular area but it would be worth checking out if you wanted a different positioin
good,"The people that work here are super friendly and nice. Don't get a lot of hours at all, certainly not a living wage at least. Get called to have days of work a lot"
good,"Certain hours got really busy during the morning shifts & night shifts, work is steady & consistent, you’re usually busy even if its just a slow day. There’s always something to be cleaned or put away or refilled, wiped down, or just prepping stuff. All thestaff is sweet & helpful. Managers are always kind & always helping out. The hardest part is getting through the busy hours but other than that its a fun place to work."
good,It is nice working at Panera. Everyone stays on task and does there job. The cleaning tasks and closing tasks are simple and easy. We always have nice understanding costumers.
good,working in a restaurant such as Panera Bread Was very fast pace work. The people around you are very friendly and the job is simple . To make coffee or make and serve the food to the customers at the highest quality. The hours garanteed are fairly decent. The only problem I have encountered are management wise.
good,"Very good place to start off as a first job. The employees were very welcoming and close knit. When coming in for my interview, everyone greeted me as if I was already an employee. All of the staff seemed to have a good knowledge of the products being sold and were very quick to point out their favorites. After I was hired, the environment was still the same. Everyone made sure I felt comfortable and secure with what tasks were handed to me."
good,"working was very slow with random bursts of energy during lunch hours. there wasn't anything super enjoyable or difficult since it was a simple minimum wage job. but it was good in that regard simple, minimum wage job."
good,"This was my first job and I was hired on the initial start up of a location near me.  I was trained before opening in all areas.  Upon opening, I worked as cashier at the front as well as the drive thru along with doing food prep and consolidation for in house and pickup orders."
good,Really engaging work. Very respectful and fun managers that will always make sure to help their employees. All employees are good people that you can have a pleasant time being around.
good,"I couldn't have asked for a better job while I attended college.  My managers worked with me on my schedule, providing flexibility when I needed it.  They developed me as much as they could in my role and I was promoted to a trainer position. My team was supportive and postitive.  Panera was a great place to work!"
good,"I usually worked nights or days approx 20 to 25 hours a week, I learned how to make certain line cook items, loved management for the most part, hardest part of my job was after I got hurt they took things away from me."
good,It was a good work learning experience. it was my first job so of course i was just learning the ropes but after that i got the hang of the real world
good,"The insurance (while limited) was great to have as someone who worked there part-time. Worked at one of the busiest locations; when management was doing well, the team was doing well, but I worked with a lot of people way younger or older than me so the socializing was okay. Being able to get my teeth cleaned for a small amount was the true highlight of working here. But it was really corporate."
good,Most of the people that work there are great and it makes coming in a lot more enjoyable. The pay is just barely enough for me to want to work there. I believe it was $8.50 while you were in the store and $5.00 + tips while you were on delivery. I probably averaged like $10/hour. The other big benefit is the food. I love Panera's for and having a discount was definitely a bonus.
good,"Really loved my finance team at Panera. Worked there for 5 years and outgrew the opportunities that were available."
good,"I learned that you can't please everyone but a smile and polite attitude can go a long way. "
good,I was able to work in different areas of the store and progress throughout my time. I enjoyed the work culture and was able to make life long friends.
good,Working in the food industry is truly not for everyone. Many times customers will yell at you for simple things and there's nothing you can do about it as an employee. THe managers were pretty friendly and tried to be helpful but they could only do so much since we were severely understaffed most of the time. Panera puts the customers first always but they should really take care of their employees too.
good,"A typical day at work, I immediately get started brewing coffee to set out for customers to pour themselves, and proceed to sweep and mop the floors in the back before the bakers arrive. After mopping, I begin cleaning dishes and consider what needs to be done next. It's a very fast-paced job that requires a quick analysis of the situations at hand, which can change day-to-day. Management was very kind, maybe sometimes too kind. Coworkers are all around my age (20-somethings) and there is a sense that we all have similar experiences in life, so there was little we couldn't joke about. The most enjoyable part of the job was definitely the satisfaction I get from finishing my job before my coworkers."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Panera Bread workers are extremely welcoming and friendly. "
good,"I worked there for about a year, the staff was great, as well as the managers, they worked with your schedule if you needed time off for something they generally had a way to help you out. Got a nice consistent schedule as needed too."
good,"The associates and managers here are typically nice, but the store is very tight on hours. It often feels like we are understaffed and the managers are either helping or just sitting down. The upstairs regional managers are always rude and have unrealistic expectations."
good,"Typical day at work..clock in...count register..make sure bread is in the oven, make sure dessert is setup nicely. May work drive thru or dining room."
good,working at panera the customer is awlays right was policy. this is where i learned most of my great customer service skills.we served and prepared food to the community. we were friendly and helpful to others.
good,A typical day starts with an associate walking in and clocking in after getting into uniform or a hat and apron. Then going into position and cleaning or stocking and preparing for customers to come in and order.
good,"Ive worked with the company for 6 years.  Ive worked in 5 different cafes.  the culture is greatly dependent upon the cafe and the general manager.  I was fortunate enough to work at 3 manager training cafes, where the standards for food and customer service were high and the staff were reasonably happy.  My team of associates and I maintained the fast speed of service in the district.  recently, I've rewarded for my success by being transferred (forcibly, with no warning) to a different cafe due to this cafe being extremely short staffed, as most cafes are.  Many cafes are poorly run and so short staffed there is no way to properly train a manager for the situation they throw you into.  managers are trained over the course of 3 weeks, then sent to there actual cafe.  overall the training covers the basics and is adequate for normal staffing situations, however, due to the critical staffing situation in many cafes, both associates and managers have given up on upholding standards.  its difficult to review Panera as whole due to the extreme variance of the cafes.  I've been extremely happy with the cafe I was at for 1.5 years I liked my GM and I was learning food cost and ordering from AMs who took great pride in there work, but after 2 weeks at this new cafe, I'm done, there is no way to grow at this cafe."
good,I really enjoyed their culture and team member mentality. I also enjoyed the focus on farm to fork measures that ensured that the customer had a great experience.
good,My store had management issues but when they were not directly involved everything ran smoothly. Really enjoyed that they donated all their unsold food to food banks in the area every night.
good,Very busy work pace. There's always something that needs to be done. Overnight Baker's usually work alone. Manager is down in the south market. Communication between managers Bakers is fair. Baker's work with Cafe members to make sure customers quality products. overall great workplace.
good,"I did not like being in the store all night alone. I feel it is unsafe.  I think there should be at 2 people in the store in case an accident happens."
good,Panera Bread was a fast paced environment with a lot of fun people to work with! The store manager is always fair and has anyone's back who needs her to be! She advocates for her people.
good,"It was pretty cool working at Panera because compared to other restaurants I’ve worked at, this has been the easiest if I can say. Not as busy as other popular restaurants but it does get busy sometimes where you need all hands on deck. Workers are super friendly and you can’t help not loving them. Managers are pretty laid back and actually talk to you and conversate. My hours were pretty decent, but not as much as I’d like to have."
good,I started in March of 2013 in Chicago. I was trained correctly on how handle the daily tasks at hand. Training for my position was three to four weeks and my supervisors were very supportive after the training which helped me greatly.
good,"i enjoyed my time here but found it was a little disorganized, the customers are a pleasure to be around always, good food good people, i would definitely recommend as a first time job for a teen"
good,Great place to learn what face-paced food service it like and enjoy teamwork! There’s always drama in every job but it depends on how you deal with it. Everyone has their own life to handle and doesn’t need more stress. The managers are great to work with and there’s always room for improvement. Definitely recommend this Panera Bread Location to work! I’ve been to other panera bread and this location seems to be better since they emphasizes on teamwork which makes the dream work! Also honesty is the key.
good,As a first job it is good as you will get a good view of how other jobs will go. Recommend to always apply to your local Panera Bread. Very good work environment.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of food prep for the main dishes.  The most enjoyable part of working at Panera Bread was learning how to make each dish."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Panera was a fun and nice place to work.You got to meet different people every day “friendly people”.Great environment  to work I would truly recommend to friends n family.
good,Panera Bread has a lot of great advancement opportunities if you are willing to work for them and possibly travel to a new store. I love the company's donation program to local church groups/food pantries.
good,"I enjoyed working at Panera as a food production associate and associate trainer. At the beginning of each shift, the manager in charge always was very specific of what was to be expected of me for the duration of my shift. Working in food service, you should expect for sudden problems to arise, and therefore the necessity to think on your feet. I enjoyed the fact that management felt comfortable delegating tasks for me and knew I would be able to carry them out successfully without supervision. It created a good sense of trust between management and associates. However, Panera is always working to be the innovators in the ""fast casual"" dining experience, and this comes with many rules and regulations to follow in order to meet food safety and company standards. The issue is, corporate doesn't seem tot understand that as a result, labor capital should also increase to accomodate for the changes. However, corporate didnt' seem to understand this and were often harsh towards managment and associates."
good,"had unfortunate experience with some management, overall it was fast past , an fun to work at , food was great , good discount's. friendly staff.. good pay check"
good,"The worst part for me was the short shifts, other than that management is usually really good (but sometimes uncooperative with one another), culture is fun, and it's really not a hard job to do either."
good,"In my experience with Panera, I found that hard work and dedication will get you promoted quickly, however the  compensation does not necessarily match the commitment required to be successful as a GM."
good,A typical work day is to get to work grab an apron and help anyone and anywhere that needs it. The hardest part of the job is the fact you almost never have down time.
good,"My managers and coworkers were great to work with; I just disliked the overall environment and certain rude customers. Being a delivery team member in my location was not so great since there was a lot of competition and very few people who wanted food delivered to them. Tips were mediocre at best. However, it was nice to actually work in a cafe."
good,I loved working for this company and was sad when I had to leave my position there. There are great managers and the owner is understanding and actually cares about his employees.
good,"I enjoyed working here but had to quit due to health reasons."
good,Panera Is a nice place to work at but some times the work that you put in the pay of it doesn't add up so that what makes some employees slack and call out some time be cause there isn't really paid Vacation
good,Panera really shaped and molded me to the worker I am now. I was constantly looked at and encouraged by my managers to be the best worker I can be. The hardest part was how much responsibility I had at a young age but I learned how to take responsibility and work as hard and diligently as I can.
good,"It was a fast-paced well organized job. I enjoyed the lunch and dinner crowd, and the various responsibilities I had as an associate cashier. The food was also very good."
good,"They are pretty flexible with the schedule and hours. The pay is pretty good for what you do. It was a pretty friendly place to work, but could get stressful at times, like any restaurant."
good,"A typical shift at the location I worked at consisted of a major dinner rush and closing down the store. I usually found myself tasked with breaking down the barista station after we obtained the new drink bubblers. The hardest part of working there was balancing my closing responsibilities with attending to straggling customers that came in minutes before closing. But, the most enjoyable part was manning the barista station."
good,"I enjoy working with the customers and enjoy what I do,  I go to the manager in charge to find out what I will be doing the day,  Cashier, food runner or drive up"
good,"Pretty typical environment for a food establishment. Management was pretty easy to work with, and the co-workers weren't bad either. Pay was okay for the job you had to do."
good,"Working there I would clock in on the our dispatch system then sign in on the corresponding app. it would be typically slow at the late morning when I would come in, so I would help the café when needed. Then I would get my deliveries out for lunch and late afternoon cash out my tips and go home. Management was really helpful and was willing to work with me to make sure the job was as easy as possible. I learned how to keep moral up with a team while still being efficient with my work."
good,"Its a normal job for a bakery/cafe."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Panera was my first job and I wish I didn’t quit. The only thing that’s bad is the closes because you don’t get off till late. The managers and people there were friendly tho and I love them all.
good,"Having worked in multiple bakery cafes over the years, each one is typically run in a different manner, with everything driving towards the same goals. Everyone has their own way of managing and this is very apparent within the company. This can cause conflicts between new and old managers, as well as people coming from the outside. Unfortunately, due to a recent company acquisition, manager support has dropped dramatically."
good,Working at Panera can be stressful and fun debending on how busy it is. I would recommend the job because of it’s flexible hours and they work with your availability.
good,I enjoy my time at Panera Bread. We live in a small town so its nice to see all the regular customers coming in on a daily basis. Menu is always changing so that keeps it exciting as well.
good,"I like working at Panera, except for the fact that I didn't get enough hours. The environment of my co-workers is nice, they were sweet. Some of the managers were not nice and the discriminated against me, but otherwise I would recommend it anywhere to anyone."
good,Panera helped me learn more about the restaurant business and helped me buil skill in my career. The managers are very caring and understanding people.
good,"I learned a lot from my time at Panera Bread: time management, the importance of having a team, the joy of connecting with co-workers and guests/ customers alike. I started with a slow-paced job as a prep cook in the back of house since this was my first job out of high school."
good,Panera has been a great company to work for. They have helped me grow in leadership. My immediate manager always worked with me on everything from scheduling conflicts to helping me grow as a manager.
good,Panera is a great place to work with a friendly work environment. It is also a pleasure to go to work everyday with friendly co-workers.I have learned the importance of working as a team.
good,Change in manager only a few weeks in was very new for all of us but brought all new structure and management to strengthen what we already had for the better.
good,"I didn’t get much money from working at Panera due to the hours they had available, and also due to minimum wage. But it was an easy non stressful job overall"
good,"This management team is the best I've had the chance to work with. They are all spontaneous personalities that make your shift 10x better. Overall, a very welcoming work environment."
good,"As it being my first job, I couldn't of been happier with this opportunity. It helped me learn new things about having a job, working in food, and working with others."
good,"Panera Bread is a great place to become a manager. You get vacations, health insurance, and a 401k. Lots of room for advancements, and great pay from the start."
good,Panera is a fast paced work environment that requires many hours on your feet. The work is not really hard at all as long as you can keep moving. Management was really friendly and fair. Defiantly room to grow and move up in the company.
good,Its a very good job for people who are starting out in the work force. Teaches them customer service and how to interact with others. Decent pay. I would recommend this job to many people.
good,panera bread was an okay job while it lasted l. the reason why i left was because i was only geting paid 8.15 which was probably one of the lowest wages out of alot of the workers and i had be there for a year and a half
good,Panera has been a good option for me for a part-time job.  I enjoy the clientele and the discount is a nice perk.  The flexibility with my availability has been outstanding.
good,Everyone is great it's a fun place to work. Management is mostly good and they know what they are doing. It is very easy to move up in the company. We're always hiring.
good,Panera was a great place to work for someone who wanted to move up and make it a career to high school students who wanted to make some gas money.  It was  a job who started you off paying well.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,I loved working there it was as a good place nice people... very clean environment people are very nice to work with all the time from open to close ..
good,Panera bread was a great first job. I always got along with the management and associates very well. Hours are not good at times and are never steady.
good,Good Place to work but I'm not cut out for the food industry. Great Management and the works are great. One of the hardest things is remembering where everything is on the register.
good,"A typical day at work for me was accepting orders, making sure they were correct once given, and delivering them to the customers. While there were no deliveries, I worked the barista station and at the cash register, I wiped down tables, did dishes, restocked, and prepping food. I got a few skills from this job, and I think it was a great first job for me. Most of the management was very supportive and patient with me. The hardest part of the job was lunch and dinner rushes having to deliver 7 or 8 orders at one time. The most enjoyable part of the job was making sure orders were perfect and getting the food to the customer quickly and safely."
good,"A typical day at Panera varies depending on the time of day. In the morning, customers are concentrated around the bagels/bakery and coffee. At lunch-time. it is easier to proceed with the orders as a cashier because you don't have to personally make sure everyone gets their bagel toasted just right, i.e., the excellent food line people will ensure what needs to happen happens. "
good,i worked at panera for  8 months within that time i became very adaptable to my surroundings learning quickly and understanding my tasks and objectives that must be completed when i enter the work place.As for example i'm very good at keeping my cool under pressure and making sure that all the guest are severed with hospitality and honest service.
good,"I like that I'm working for a good company that keeps the health and preferences of their customers in mind. For the most part, there's a good work ethic among my coworkers and we have a supportive management team; it's easy to move up if you do the job well. Overall a good place to work"
good,I just loved working with this company i wish i still could right now. The people were amazing to work with and the manager that i had in the beginning of my employment Hanna was an amazing woman she loved her job and truly cared about her employees as well.
good,"I was an opener so a lot of prep time was put in.  Fun place to work, but there was no career advancement there.  Loved the people I worked with.  Management was fair."
good,"The Panera Bread location I worked for was filled with fun loving people who liked to joke and laugh while still being productive. I really enjoyed working here most of the time. While there were fallbacks, which there are in every job, for the most part my time here was well spent. I would recommend this job for those who are having trouble finding jobs elsewhere as they are usually very understanding and hire, within reason, most people who apply."
good,Panera Bread consisted of your every day duties of cleaning and preparing meals. You also must deal with customers and complaints and know how to manage it. Management was great and worked well to help you figure any problems out. Hardest part of the job would be keeping up on times during rushes. Most enjoyable part is communicating with other employees and the customers as well. I've learned to manage time efficiently and how to handle issues with any customers or other employees.
good,"Team members are the heart of this concept."
good,"Panera is an excellent job. It can be quite fast paced and stressful at times, but it is a great beginner job. The pay is good for a high school student, but there is also a lot of work that is required of you. Mostly everyone is very kind, accommodating, and respectful. This job teaches you discipline, respect, time management, and teamwork."
good,Crazy work days due top us being one of the busiest locations in the country. Managers were reasonable for the most part. Requires you to be able to multitask due  to the fast paced environment.
good,"I worked cashier which could get busy at time but I enjoyed when we got buys, at night I closed up the bakery and packed up left overs for donations. We also got to take home some bakery goods at night."
good,Panera Bread was my first job when I was in high school. They taught me a lot about learning how to conduct my self professionally in a work environment.
good,"A typical day would start with replacing and relabeling the ingredients needed to assemble each salad, then to clean the station.  The environment was somewhat fast paced to make sure your station was clean, while also making the order.  The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be the other workers.  They were always reliable to answer any questions I had and many the work environment that much more enjoyable."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Fast paced environment, stocking the bagels and desserts, baking cookies, changing coffee and teas, semi dish washing, working with co workers to get the job done, managers are great some need to step up their game and attitudes but otherwise a good environment"
good,"While working at Panera bread LLC I learned slot about cleaning and food safety. The food is phenomenal and quarterly bread bashes make for a fun team experience. After a year receiving paid vacation benefits and insurance options, it's refreshing knowing they care at a corporate level."
good,"Mostly enjoyed working here; the community was great, the free/discounted food was a plus, and it was nice and relaxing if you worked in the back (except of course on rushes where with every job it's a little stressful)"
good,It was great working at panera bread. I enjoyed the customers time and my co-workers. Everybody was welcoming and down to earth and when i needed help i was never afraid to ask a coworker.
good,"A typical day of working at the Panera Catering Hub would include making/preparing catering orders and delivering them to their respective customers on time, preparing ingredients for sandwiches and salads for tomorrow's orders, cleaning/sanitizing the floors, counters, and anywhere food comes in contact with a work surface.  The management at the Maple Grove Panera Catering Hub was mostly great and professional with only occasional issues/mistakes that all were eventually settled.  The hardest part of the job I would have to say was getting up very early on Saturdays to cater early morning orders and having to deal with a very flexible/not consistent scheduling due to the ever-changing nature of the catering business."
good,"•	Greeted and assisted customers"
good,The workplace is pleasant the workers really focus on working together and help each other when needed. There's a bond between employees and the managers aren't intimidating at all.
good,"I wish the person who does scheduling would give me hours last time I worked was 7 weeks ago, haven't seen a paycheck since. I barely get any hours, Panera Bread needs to do better with giving employees more hours."
good,Working for Panera is a good first job. The pay is acceptable and the job culture is very nice. There's always room for job advancements if you are ambitious enough.
good,"I enjoy the baking and the coworkers at my current job, Panera. "
good,"Good Company. I like the values and I like the motto. We serve great food and have really good managers. We pay well. As a contract employee, I don't get benefits."
good,"Managers and associates are fantastic and become like family.  Long hours but very rewarding. "
good,"If you can work fast, be friendly with your coworkers, you'll fit right in with this company. Management is understanding and willing to work with you."
good,"I really enjoy working at Panera but there are not a lot of promising hours for Associates. A typical day for me at Panera consist of cashiering, maybe helping in the dinning room when they need help, or helping on the production line, preparing food when they need help as well."
good,Panera was a layed back but fast paced environment that i enjoyed because of me being highly energetic and a fast paced worker. It wasnt my dream job but i enjoyed how the structure of the envirnment was.
good,I worked at panera for a couple months for my Le Cordon Bleu externship. It was a great experience in an inside view of a franchised bakery. I enjoyed the quality of the food and the employees while I was there.
good,Its an ok place to work fast paced decent pay management isn't always the greatest though schedule issue always arise here they will cut your im a heartbeat if you have any kind of mishap
good,"Working with Panera has taught me a lot about customer service and appreciating the customers and their business. It also makes you realize that when you go out, to appreciate those serving you because they do work hard to make sure your experience it great! I've learned a great deal of how to manage my time wisely and planning ahead of time as well as preparing to get a better outcome of my day. Working as a team has shown me that things went a lot smoother in getting things done correctly in a timely manner. Work smarter not harder. My favorite part of my job was building those relationships with my customers. I really enjoy interacting with people and knowing that you can help make their day in some way."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Worst management staff I've worked with by far. Rude, insulting, poor management skills and often have no clue what they are doing. I'm unsure of how this location is actually successful"
good,It is very fast paced on busy days like the weekends. The hardest part of the job was having your hours cut out of nowhere. The work environment was amazing. The whole crew was very welcoming.
good,"Good company but long hours, no breaks, good pay.  The managers were good and treated everyone great.  Work life balance was the reason for leaving.  Not enough time with family."
good,Overall good job because of good management and balancing school and work. The pay wasn't that great but it was good because they were very flexible on schedules
good,"good work environment, busy periods and slow times, drive thru always busy, good management, easy to learn processes, easy to learn for newcomers in the food business"
good,I was in charge of dining. Serving customers there food. Wiping down the tables. Making sure the floor was swept and moped. Changed the coffee every hour. Cleaned the bathroom.
good,I unloaded the truck each week. The truck drivers were hardly ever on time. It was frustrating when I'd come in to work and I would get sent home because the truck was a day behind schedule.
good,"Panera Bread was a great place to work, healthy food with free lunches (for managers) strong culture that corporate made sure employees learned. Panera made it clear that communication was important to them from Corporate, to management, all the way down to the employees. This was done by the regular meetings called ""bread bashes"" where new concepts were introduced and new ideas from employees actually encouraged (cash prizes offered if the idea benefited the company)"
good,Large employee food allowance while working. Delicious food. Like what the company stands for who gives back to charities and distributes food to local kitchens to needy.
good,Working at panera was a great experience. I learned many things about for and food prep as well as some barista. I gained knowledge of different pastries. How to make many different sandwiches and salads.
good,"Working at Panera Bread during morning shifts started quite warm. I enjoyed the fresh baked breads, sweets, and setting up the display for advertisement purposes. Moments when I worked at the register required competence in money handling. Management was quite friendly yet assertive which is necessary in work environment. The culture of the workplace was respectful with a few glitches here and there but nothing too serious. The hardest part of the job was the rate that people had to quit. It is also the enjoyable part because Panera created space for their employers to reach their goals whether it be school or career advancement"
good,"I loved working for Panera Bread. The only reason I left was due to being hired as a manager at another company. "
good,I liked working at Panera because I got to be a barista and I got to work in the bakery. If I wasn't feeling like being around a lot of people they would let me wash dishes .
good,"The job itself is quite easy, and usually the coworkers are helpful. However, the customers that come in make it difficult to be there. The customers that come in are more often than not rude, messy, snobbish, demanding, and absolutely unbearable. The nicer ones are far and few between. They are what make the job hard and almost miserable at times. The culture at this workplace is generally good and almost everyone gets along, however coworkers are able to get away with more than what would be tolerated elsewhere. Such as, in example, no call no show but still works there. Otherwise, it is a good job. Cross training is encouraged and most employees are willing to help each other."
good,I loved working at Panera because of the people. They job was a place where I could focus on increasing my skills. I did achieve of becoming a team trainer in less then eight months.
good,A typical shift at Panera typically goes by fast and it's filled with many goals to accomplish. All the employees act as a team and it causes the shift to go by fast and smoothly.
good,"I worked while I was in college and it was great with my school schedule. I was able to work almost 40 hours a week and go to class while still being able to complete class work. Corporate is a joke and the menu changes too often, but store management is different at every store. I love my manager at 601511, and the store ran smoothly. It was a good job for what I needed it for at the time."
good,"I cleaned, made drinks, took peoples orders, and put together bakery items and bagels. I also learned to open and close the bakery and restock items and drinks."
good,There is more and more things coming down from corporate that is unrealistic for certain cafes I worked in. A lot of good people that work in management.
good,"A typical day would be having coffee ready and bagels glistening.  I learned that I never want to work in a drive thru. EVER. AGAIN. The easiest part of the job is planning. "
good,"I Like working at Panera because everyone is friendly and outgoing. You’ll enjoy 65% off of Panera food while at work.Health benefits are available for part-time associates, too. Lastly, you get to have Employee Discount Mall"
good,"I was the catering coordinator at Panera, so a typical day at work for me would be me going in and get started on working on my online/phone-ins orders, have everything ready so they can be delivered on time. Working at Panera helped me get better at multitasking and working with a fast paste. The hardest part of my job was having 5-6 really big orders that all have to be ready around the same time and be delivered 10-15 mins apart. The most enjoyable part is coming back from all of your deliveries and knowing I did a good job throughout the day."
good,It is a very busy cafe. The managers are very relaxed. The staff is very nice. This company gives you an opportunity to grow. I truly enjoy working here.
good,It was a nice experience I learned a lot on how to deal with customers. I did something different everyday. I enjoyed making the food because I didn't really have to be worried about being mixed with everyone.
good,i enjoyed working here and being a part of the panera bread family. they have a great discount 65 percent off and most of my managers were laid back. there is lots of room for advancement as well.
good,"I would arrive at Panera and make an effort to create a stable and progressive environment for both the store itself, the people I worked with, and the customers who came in.  I enjoyed working with the people I would see on a day to day basis.  The work load was never too much to interfere with my home life and would give me paid time off after one year of service."
good,This job is the best if your looking to improve your way of handeling stress. It’s a fast paced environment that’s constantly busy and that’s a great way to learn how to handle pressure.
good,It was managed very well. I never had to work for more than they required.  They were very good at helping out when you needed it.  Everyone was very affable and friendly.
good,Panera was a great job to work at and everyone at the establishment were the nicest people that you could imagine if there werent family problems at the time i would still be working there to this day!
good,"Working at Panera was a good experience for the short amount of time I was there. I learned how to move quickly, interact with people, and many other skills. The management was good, they were on top of everything and managers would even help you out when necessary. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the amount of people coming in and the amount of responsibility each person had. The most enjoyable would have to be working with a great team."
good,"It was a cool job for that moment in time. I learned how to work with people more. I love the pastries the most . The hardest part of the job is taking a order on the headset while my coworkers would listen on theirs , it kind of made me nervous in a way but I know it was part of their job too so I got used to it ."
good,"A typical day at work can range from great to mediocre. It all depends on the management that is available during the day. If management isn't doing their job, it becomes very hard for the associates to do what they need to in order to have a productive day."
good,It was a fun place to work at. the staff were always helpful and worked well together. I learned a great deal while there and would recommend it as a good part time job for many. One draw back was the high turnover rate and the unsteady flux in hours.
good,"A cafe and shifts are normally setup to serve high volumes of customers in the morning and afternoon time frames. Having the meal preparation area clean, stocked, and ready for a rush is a key importance."
good,"Early start to the day. "
good,This company provides great training and opportunities to advance to the top. It's a fast paced-environment with rich culture values. Building relationships with customers is a must since there are many regulars.
good,"This is a great place for a starter job, work culture is pretty good, benefits are great, and pay could be a little better. Management works well with employees and food quality is great."
good,"This job gives anyone a good start, especially in food business. I know all the basics about food quality and safety. It teaches customer service, food presentation, and overall professionality. I enjoyed my time here."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Very negative upper management.  Was like pulling teeth to get them to say a positive thing about you.  Brought it up to him and he acted like he didn't care,"
good,The company treats you very well and will always accommodate your time off or schedule. Very friendly place to work at and I would recommend it to anyone whos just starting out or wants to work their way up the corporate ladder.
good,Good Environment...too many changes by upper management to stay competitive in a market that they dominate. New tech and procedures and programs are introduced before previous rollouts even have the kinks worked out. Sometimes changing too fast can be harmful and create stress.
good,"Management treated the workforce with respect and understanding."
good,new owner new stuff. I liked the environment however I wasn't a fan of the new way that they tracked labor. There is a lot of red tape that comes with every compoany. Besides the labor tracking it was pretty solid.
good,a typical day at work would include starting my shift with my happy positive crew. I enjoyed every second of my time working for a great company. grateful.
good,"Not entirely awesome, But if you want an easier job that has awesome co-workers, I highly recommend Panera Bread. It's the type of job you go to, and at the end of the day you feel content and happy."
good,its a nice place to work if you can deal with a fast pace and keep up. the people are great. i personally felt i wasn't getting paid for enough work i was putting into the company.
good,"a typical day at Panera Bread varies everyday. It can be busy one day, and the very slow the next. everyone gets their work done in a timely manner, the hardest part about the job was getting things done at a certain time after closing hours. the most enjoyable part of the job,  there is always someone  to help out when needed."
good,"It was a great first job, It was a very fast paced work environment, My coworkers are all very hard working and nice. The management is great as well. I highly recommend it."
good,"Panera breads are very intimate places to work despite possibly having a steady flow of customers. Working here you'd get to know your coworkers very well. If that interests you, then this is an excellent job."
good,It is a good place for those in school to work. They do their best to work around your schedule and are understanding if you can't work due to school obligations
good,"After moving and hearing stories from other managers relocating, the quality of cafe managers and AOP (area operating partners/ DMs) varies widely. Also from franchise to corporate cafes. I got very lucky with most of my supervisors and very disappointed at the end."
good,"I loved the fast paced atmosphere of my cafe. Lunch and dinner rush was really my time to shine. My coworkers were fairly easy to get along with and most would help out where they could with little to no instruction. Customers were lovely, we had many regulars that I would talk with when they came in on my shift. I learned a lot about myself as well as what it truly takes to make it all work. The culture of Panera really is it's own culture aside from the others. It nurtures the idea of family and wellness. The hardest thing for me to let go of, was being undermined and patronized. I looked past it for 14 months until I came across information that was ultimately the factor in me leaving. My general manager was getting away with things because the district manager would look the other way. My progression with the company wasn't being honored, and thus led to a newer employee climbing the ladder ahead of me. I had also found out the onboarding employees were starting out at a rate that was close to what I was making at the time."
good,Great job for college students. Fast paced and great work environment even though at times it can get stressful it still creates great bonds with your coworkers
good,"My experiencing working at Panera Bread has been a great experience. It was my very first job and I learned a lot about having responsibility's and taking initiative. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to work side by side with other coworkers especially during lunch rushes. During that time, you really get a chance to build up leadership skills as well as strategic and multitasking skills. These skills are always useful during a typical day at work"
good,Now i know not all panera's are the same but the one i work at is very relaxed and easy going and the atmosphere is great. The managers are genuinely good and help when needed. They are stingy on the pay and raises though.
good,"-Willing to work under pressure"
good,"Enjoyed baking for them, but it could be stressful at times due to them not having enough help. as a baker you work overnight so that the product is fresh in the mornings. you are given reviews every thirty days. they give you extensive training no matter what your position is. there are some awesome people to work with, hardworking and fun."
good,"As a baker, I knew multiple store settings so I replaced the amount of 2 bakers for 2 different bakeries. I would start in one store and bake the entire amount needed for the day then cleaned and sanitize my workstation, then go to the other store and do the same."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Panera is a great company.  Panera is all about bread so your day will consist of selling bread, cafe treats, sandwiches and salads.  Management is okay.  I really think our culture is very welcoming and diverse."
good,"Panera is a great place to work, its a fast pace environment And very friendly workers. You will love the place from day one. I will recommend this to tenegers and adults of age 18-70+"
good,Panera bread is an ok company to work for but not to grow  give opportunities to everyone that's the best part about working for panera bread the diversity
good,"Busy location so be prepared to be constantly moving."
good,"Panera has great soups, bagels, sandwiches, pastries, coffee drinks, everything you could want for lunch, dinner or a snack.  Always busy, lots of customers, who doesn't love Panera??"
good,I always loved my time at panera. We had long shifts but they were always well run and managed. I loved the people I worked with and they were a big reason I stuck around for as long as I did.
good,"Very easy and simple job, and you can advance super fast if you have the skills. The management was easy to talk to and always made me feel like an individual and not just an employee"
good,"A typical day at Panera Bread begins slow and you may feel that you have nothing to do, but as the day progresses more people come in. This can be stressful as well as exciting. You must ensure that all customers get their order within 5 minutes as well as accommodate to any needs of the customer."
good,"I have worked at Panera as a Baker for seven months now. A typical night of work is two bakers, one on production and one on baking working a 10PM-5AM shift. Two times a week, I bake all by myself from 8-5. I have learned that it isn't a hard job once you have enough experience and you get 6 weeks of paid training before you start for real. I do like my managers and get along with them well. Once you are trained and have solo baked a few times, the hardest part of the job is preparing for work that day. If you have experience working nights like me, then this won't be an issue. Overall I like my job but I am looking to leave soon to get back to working days. If you have a good, reliable second baker, then this job becomes a lot less stressful."
good,I was worried I would be getting a fast food job. Yet the place is fast casual. You really get to open up with your customers and make it an every day oasis. When lunch rush comes though it is down to business and becomes incredible fast paced. I have defiantly enjoyed the balance of hard work and down times to relax and stock. Plus getting to know your regulars is an enjoyable experience. I do not know if I can say its the best job in the world but without a doubt I have enjoyed my experiences there and would work there again.
good,"Nice place to work. Can get frustrating with working with food and drive thru. Not the best place to balance 2 jobs, tried it and had to leave because of horrible scheduling."
good,Overall my experience at panera was good.  I wish i stayed there but i had to move on.  Leadership in the company truly cares about its employees.  its a good place be.
good,Good environment selling fresh clean food. Fast paced especially for lunch. It was fun to learn how to be fast casual and also uphold a above normal standard as far as restaurant service goes.
good,Great environment for meeting hard working individuals. Teamwork and friendship was a regular occurrence. Relationships were formed through training and teamwork.
good,"I really enjoyed this job.  I got along well with my co-workers and managers.  It was a lot of hard work though, and it takes a long time to get anywhere."
good,"A typical day is interacting with customers and preparing/ filling orders. The management tended to play favorites. The culture was fun, slow at times, crazy busy at times and unpredictable. The hardest part of the job was keeping items stocked on the crazy busy days. The most enjoyable part was before we opened and seeing the team work together to get things set up."
good,"Fast-paced environment, you really had to keep up whether it was working the register, running food, or making the actual food. Management was nice but strict, but it wasn't anything that bothered the associates. For the most part you met great people, you have to be patient with customers that would come in because many did have allergies and would request certain ingredients to NOT be put in their food."
good,"Worked here a few times. If you have a good manager, then you should have a decent shift. It's a pretty fast paced job. I enjoyed each store I worked at  it's nice when  a store works quickly and effectively."
good,typical day at work is full of laughs and joking between coworkers while working hard to ensure the customers receive great accurate and speedy service. Customers come in and look in the back to see if their favorite employee is working that day so that person could make their food. Management takes pride in their staff and their staffs ability to handle things even when managements hands are full.
good,Panera bread is up and coming but it seems they relay on over working associates and constantly put pressure to work faster by recording the speed of service. The job culture however is welcoming and informative about new products.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Working at Panera is great if you are looking for a fast paced job. Everyone is family. It can be stressful when there are not enough people working to get through lunch.
good,It's a decent place with good pay not a lot of employee acknowledgement managers will over work you if you let them and take the credit for all of it and if you work catering you can make the company atleast 15k a week with no thanks gratitude or even a high five while the corporate catering manager takes credit and bonuses for all the clients you pass on to them
good,"Workplace was very sanitary. Other workers sometimes did not put in the effort needed. Management was decent, tried to work with you the best they could. Alot of the time it was super busy and stressful."
good,easy job and would highly recommend as an a good entry level position for those trying to find their first job. I had a good experienc working at panera
good,shifts are fun and relaxed while you get stuff done. management is good. coworkers are a lot of fun and a lot of great people. customers are great people and great to meet.
good,Panera is a good beginner job for anyone who's looking for employment for the first time. The most important thing to remember is to keep a positive attitude at all times even when things get hectic.
good,"It's a great work environment overall.  There is room for advancement.  Management has it's usual problems of a restaurant, but they normally hold it together very well.  The education programs from within the company could be updated a little more."
good,The experience is so warming and wonderful. Everyone treats you like an actual human being that has a life. If the pay was better I'd stay at Panera forever but unfortunately minimum wage isn't much
good,"I was a baker overnight, it was a good job, i was able to pick it up pretty quickly. but the overnight hours just became too much for me after a year. Other than that it was a good job"
good,"I loved the structure of Panera, I loved the food being antibiotic free and never frozen, I loved the freshly baked bread daily but with that all being said since it is corporate/franchise some of the people they hired just to be staffed weren't the most amazing to work with/for.  "
good,I learned how to work with customers and to problem solve when they did not get exactly what they wanted or were expecting. My experience of working at Panera Bread was overall enjoyable and I would definitely work there again. The management treated me like family and was very professional.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working for this franchise and my GM, however, the owner needs to understand the demands of the business and the ever-changing reality of the restaurant marketplace in Austin.  His pay scale for associates is not on par with other restaurants in Austin which creates a higher rate of turnover.  This results in a continuous rotation of employees and a never ending hiring process.  In the span of 18 months as the GM, I went through 10 assistant managers.  This was due to movement within the district more than people being fired or leaving, but consistency is key to a successful store."
good,Panera could get hectic at times like during rush hour's but the environment was pretty relaxed for the most part. Co-workers tend to be really cool and real friendly people. Drivers get paid out cash for tips and gas everyday which is nice.
good,I loved it. Everybody that I actually worked with were fun and got the job done. They worked together to provide the best  customer service. It was a good work experince.
good,"There is always something new to do at Panera, and a new position to learn. They are always willing to accommodate days off, wages, and shift changes when needed."
good,"You have a mix of slow days and extremely busy days. Most managers work on your level and help, otherwise some don't think they need to help or put in much effort, and same goes for coworkers. Even with the menu changing slighty with the seasons, all foods are easy to learn."
good,"The people are great.  The customers can be a bit much but most of them are really nice.  Benefits and Vacation are pretty good...After a year, you earn a decent amount of paid time off and our Benefits are thru BCBS.  "
good,"Everyone is really nice and accepting at Panera's corporate office.  They emphasize a sense of individuality but insist on brand continuity in their customer service, which is understandable.  The managers are great and helpful, they always have team leads available to help in customer service in case a manager is not available.  Everyone is really accommodating!"
good,"At Panera bread, i learned how to properly make a salad, prep food, and stock stations. A typical day at work would be stocking my station, having a rush for a hour or two and making both salads and panini's. The management is pretty strict but is always willing to help. The hardest part of the job is trying to keep up with the rush and stock at the same time. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with customers and meeting new people."
good,loved it good people friendly atmosphere everybody worked together good management very positive work enviornment well run it was like a family would reccomend it
good,"It's a great flexible job for anyone looking to work full time or part time. They constantly change and evolve with the times which is a major plus, overall a great company to work for.  Would recommend to someone as a first job or someone that is in college or someone looking for an easy second job for more income."
good,This place is fun and pretty chill. some managers can be rude and cut your hours for no reason but overall the place is a fun place to work. they open really early which can be annoying.
good,"I enjoyed working at Panera the people were nice and it was a relaxed yet up beat environment. You didn't need much experience so it was a great place to learn, some great core values for any job. Like customers service and importance of systems in any work environment."
good,"Panera at times can be stressful to get food out at correct times and it gets very busy, but I enjoyed almost every second that I worked at Panera and the work family that I made. You work closely with people and you rely heavily on others to pull their weight during lunch and dinner hours so you have to be able to work with other people, but when the management team works well, the whole staff team works well."
good,this was my home for many many years.i learned everything i know from this olace. it was a hard wave to ride but it taught me so so so much about restaurant work.
good,"A typical day of work consisted of going through the routine of cooking and preparing food, learning more how to communicate with the coworkers, and taking pride in my work."
good,"I enjoyed working there,and got good hours. The people I worked with were very nice and flexible with my school schedule. I would definitely recommend it to a friend."
good,"This job had a fun environment because I worked with the right people, but the management was very poor and played favorites. I did not have any benefits because I only worked part time, and there were a lot of opportunities to advance within. The employee turn over rate was very high as well."
good,I would manage up to 20 associates a day for lunchtime. I was food cost specialist. I did weekly inventory every tuesday night. I would do truck orders twice a week. I did interviews and helped in the hiring process.
good,"The managers were very friendly and understanding with many things. They made me feel comfortable in the work place and always gave me assistance when ever I needed help."
good,The best part about working here was the management staff. They were always very supportive and understanding. They really understood the concept of being a leader rather than a boss and it created a great atmosphere to work at.
good,"The Panera Bread I worked for was a lively bunch. It was during the grand opening of the bakery in Texas. Panera provides strong trainers, and fresh product."
good,I have been here for two years and it gets pretty boring. I have learned a lot and became an Associate Trainer in less then a year of working their. My worse problem with working here is when we are understaffed all the time and the managers just think that the ones that have been there the longest will just have to figure it out which puts more stress on us. The positive thing about working here is that our cafe is very very clean.
good,Working here is easy. Sometime the manager can be unprofessional. The pay is decent for starters. It is a fun place to work at and it is enjoyable if you make it. it can be stressful with high volume of customers but overall its enjoyable.
good,"I have enjoyed my time at Panera. They are very flexible with their schedules. However, as is the case with most jobs like this, your experience will depend upon your managers. They are always hiring and the company is undergoing explosive growth. However, their breaks are not up to industry standard, and their meal plans are poor. The employee discount still means that going across the road to a competing restaurant will still be cheaper. If you're not on the clock, you (officially) don't even receive a discount, which in the food service industry is practically unheard of. I would strongly suggest NOT giving open availability, unless you like working at 5 AM 6 days per week."
good,The job is very laid back and easy to do and learn. the pay gets better the longer you are there but that's also the case with most employers now. the management at my current employer could use a little work but as far as the job as a whole its a good place to work.
good,"It's a great place to work, friendly and outgoing employees. It's very busy.  The hardest part working there would have to be trying to keep up with all the people who come in daily."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"This job is pretty labor intensive but well worth the effort you put in. All of the management that I dealt with were caring, helpful, and all around great people to work for. I had excellent benefits and steady hours. If you want 40 hours a week, you can get it here. They do reward people who go the extra mile. Promotions are few and far between but they usually always promote from within."
good,"I've worked at several other jobs before Panera, all good learning lessons. Panera's management is definitely better than the other places I've worked at, and they give you opportunities to advance in different aspects of the cafe, especially if you show your a hard worker and are reliable. Sometimes though, it seems if everyone has their own agenda, including the managers and management, and don't give props to everyone who deserves it. Brought me a lot of learning lessons and learned good work ethic and what it means to do hard, reliable work."
good,It was a decent place to work for the most part. The reason I left was I want to focus on school full time. The atmosphere was friendly and area were always clean and organized.
good,"Clean up cafe after guests stock products as needed help make food on the line fill coffee, tea, and lemonade. clean cafe and do dishes help others where needed."
good,"Really busy when it's busy, but great teamwork helps get everything done. Management is as understanding as you make them. Early morning shift is not enjoyable"
good,"Easy job for the pay and easy to learn.  The job itself isn't bad or difficult, mostly mindless work.  Management is week and wont fire the horrible employees."
good,"Panera Bread is a great place to work at. It gets pretty busy around 11-1 PM (Lunch Time) I'm not sure about night time though I only work in the mornings. It's a pretty easy job to follow; have to make sure everything that the person ordered is there in the bag(s) (if they order pick up and make sure all the food that the person ordered is on the plate from the receipts. Have to go around a few minutes to make sure no plates/ dishes are on tables, if so, clean them off and make sure tables are wiped off with no crumbs or stains on them. Also have to restock (Straws, lids, cups, Tea, Coffee, Sanitizer Bucket, Milk etc.) Only thing bad is I'm part time and they don't really give you much hours (At least the one I work at) Every other week I'm working 2 days so far (Been there a month now) maybe they'll give me more hours but right now it's not steady hours which is why I'm looking for another job."
good,"Good working place, management often changed around."
good,"Work at Panera Bread was an amazing experience. Co-Workers were friendly, supervisors were helpful and customers were polite."
good,"Panera was such a fun place to work due to all the inviting and friendly coworkers and management, the ability to a flexible schedule, and the overall movement in the job was great!"
good,Most enjoyable part was getting paid and getting off work at a decent time. Customers was nice and polite.Felt like home nice soft music cleaniness was good and work with my fellow employees.
good,decent place overall to work. there is growth potential if your willing to move.  i would stay below a gm level or you are pretty much going to live there to get the job done.
good,"This is a great job, but very difficult. Not that the tasks themselves are difficult, but working overnight can be very exhausting. lifting all of the screens, pans, and boxes from the freezer can put a lot of strain on you, but overall it is very enjoyable and pleasant to work there. The people are kind and very generous and forgiving of mistakes. I would recommend it anyone, with a side of caution of how difficult the job as a whole is."
good,Panera Bread was my first job. It was fun an came interesting to see all the work going into a bakery/cafe. I know the company has grown so much bigger after I left over the years. It was a great and demanding environment. The hardest part is customer service.
good,"Panera Bread is a great place to dine, but an even greater place to work. The staff is great, and it causes you make friends with people of different back ground than you. The customers are great too."
good,The workload is kinda heavy but manageable. Management is friendly and easy going for the most part. Coworkers were all super friendly and easy to get along with.
good,"Panera Bread taught me lessons not only about the job but about myself. This job takes patience and motivation to get through any situation. ""We get the tough stuff done through optimism and mastery"" is often said throughout the day. Management is great and always available to answer associate and customer questions. Room for career growth and advancement."
good,"A typical work day includes assisting customers, tracking labor, filling out deployment charts, writing the schedule, and building relationships with staff and customers."
good,"Panera Bread was very different, the co workers and managers were very relaxed. The food was very delicious and I loved their No Jerk policy."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Panera is a very calm place to work. Its mainly a hangout spot for old folks coming to relax and college students looking to study. The coworkers are good people as well.
good,"In San Antonio there aren't enough good managers to go around, so they take turns passing around the bad ones. Other than that"
good,Working at Panera is a fun place to work. Everyone around is like family. There is not one person that doesn't get along there . We cherish our customers and respect one another. There are strict rules we follow but managers don't oppose to having a little fun.
good,"Overnight shifts are difficult on their own but doing one as labor intensive as baking is even harder. Panera does a good job (sometimes) of taking care of their bakers. Working in cafes owned by a franchise is much more worthwhile, bonuses are often guaranteed."
good,"- The hardest part of the job is when some people do not try their best at their jobs"
good,very great company to work for just looking to relocate to another state. Great Ceo and franchise president. great staff to work with and train.
good,"Good place to work, flexible hours and decent pay. Overtime available depending on the cafes needs.  Good place to work for but they seem to be going in a wierd direction with company standards anymore and I don't agree with what they let go of sometimes."
good,"I really did like Panera. The associates, the management and the job were all great but I felt like I needed to move forward and get into something that was going to help my future career."
good,"Co-workers were wonderful and the main reason I stayed so long. General Manager had a poor personality and made it difficult to work. There was not a whole lot of room for advancement. Catering needs were often overlooked, but for the most part it was a decent job."
good,"Panera Bread is overall a great company to work for as a college student, flexible hours and good starting pay for the kind of job it is."
good,"This was my first job coming out to Denver, CO, and what a great job to kick off my new life. I worked with a fantastic group of people who were all focused on one thing: providing exceptional service and food. If you don't mind food service, the Panera Bread on 16th Street Mall has a great management staff and great employees."
good,Fast pace makes time go by quickly.  Loyal customers make providing the utmost service enjoyable and easy.  My customer service and hospitality skills absolutely improved with this job.
good,"As with most retail/food service positions, a lot of how much you'll like this job is dependent on the personnel already in place -- if you have a good management team, if you are walking into a well-oiled machine of a restaurant that maintains standards, and a culture that rewards hard work."
good,I definitely loved working for Panera. I thoroughly enjoyed going to work and interacting with the customers. My co-worker were very fun to be around
good,"My typical day at work would usually be up in the registers assisting customers, taking their orders and helping them with any questions they have about Panera. My co-workers were pretty cool, great to work with."
good,"My time here way actually enjoyable, I met nice people, I was treated well, you could really talk to the managers like any other co-worker and try to get any issues that may be resolved. My only reason for leaving is for a full-time position and a job with benefits."
good,"Probably one of the best jobs I worked YET!!! Plus the Management Team and Crew are nice, and the benefits are AWESOME. I learned so much in such little time because the Associate Trainers were great trainers. They knew everything, which made it easier for me to learn more. The hardest part of the job is the lunch rushes. This may be because I'm knew to the company, but I know once I constantly make sandwiches and take the orders, I will be great at the job."
good,Baking is a very fast paced job with little time for socialization or breaks. The pay is acceptable and most of the management is very open to suggestions and will work with you to improve the cafe.
good,"I really enjoy working with Panera Bread, they are a great company that have great values. They really value the customers that help build their company by giving them a everyday oasis that they could feel comfortable in. I enjoy the management and the co-workers that work by my side. It feels like they are my second family. Overall I believe that Panera Bread is a great company with great tasting food and also workers with great work ethics that help make the company stronger."
good,"Given I've only been working here for a short amount of time, I like the experience so far. I left another job for this one because the pay was better here and the last job had me working as a manager without the pay. The staff is nice, at least from who I've met on the morning crew. And the hours aren't bad if you tell them your exact availability. My manager is already talking to me about moving up to being a supervisor once I'm trained in all the areas. Overall, its a good job and a good opportunity to move up if you work hard and show you want to grow with the company."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"a typical day at work - good"
good,"panera bread is a great place to start working because working there you learn a lot. you learn about client service, working under pressure, and you become a great team player."
good,management was very friendly and amiable. did their best to work around everyone's individual needs and schedules. did their best to be supportive of me in times of personal turmoil.
good,I enjoy baking at Panera Bread.Management is pretty cool.Make sure to be on time and prepared to work hard.You'll need a car.
good,"A typical day at work is very easy, many customers who are very friendly. I learned new skills, like working with a bigger and more diverse group of people. Management was mostly friendly and happy to help with everything. Co-workers are very happy and pleasant to be around. The hardest part of job would have to be lack of things for the drivers to do when it is a slow time. When there are no deliveries, drivers do not have much to do which makes them look lazy or bored. The most enjoyable part of the job was the compensation in tips and mileage at the end of the day for drivers."
good,This is one of the coolest job in the restaurant industry that I love I had a good time night baking all the night because it's really awesome although manages the baker trainer was awesome
good,"Working for panels has been an experience not to be forgotten. I enjoy the people I've come to know and work beside, but the pay and management leaves much to be desired. Food cost is slightly outrageous even though Panera is supposed to be a healthy place to eat, and leaves associates with little more than minimum wages have to offer. I'm grateful for the skills I've learned here, but I could see a lot more improvement with employees benefits and definitely better scheduling and allowance of PTO. It's a good starter job, but I don't think it deserves a better score than any other restaurant or retail business."
good,"I love working at Panera because you meet so many new people, everyone is nice, and everything needed to be done is fun to do. Never a dull moment while working. Co-workers are always helpful, and kind, and if they aren't, you can always help them to better themselves. It's a whole learning environment, and I really enjoy that. Everyday, you can do something new, or learn something new. And there is always something to do."
good,"I would open the bakery and start my morning at 5AM, I learned every part of running that store. Very busy job but very stressful environment"
good,"if you're interested in working at a food place, this place and I'm sure in'n'out are the best to work at. great environment and happy welcoming co-workers. fast pace but easy to catch on to things and makes time fly by, GREAT FOOD!!"
good,"great place to work while going to school or continuing education "
good,"Panera Bread has taught me numerous traits that I value in a good employee. I have learned how to detail clean, handle stress, how to stay productive during down time, how to be a leader, how to work fast and effective. I always loved my co workers and management, the hardest part of the job was probably working with someone with a bad attitude. They most enjoyable part of the job was when everyone had good energy."
good,"A typical day at work at Panera was usually the same routine for me, never got switched around, always cutting fruit and bread, taking the orders, bit boring."
good,Its a very face paced job. You are always moving. The hardest part is when you don't have enough people working a morning and a lunch shift.
good,"I loved the panera I worked in. Management was great to me and so was my co-workers. However, this job is meant for younger people (such as myself). This job could only be part-time. I left because of that."
good,"This company wasn't the easiest to get hired, there are online courses and workshops to attend before being accepted. Panera takes the comfort of their customers seriously, providing a home environment and cafe to eat and socialize with friendly, helpful employees."
good,"On a typical day you'd receive your position for your shift and set up your station. There is a lot of prep that goes along with setting up for the estimated sales for that day. The week days are a lot more busier than the weekends, but it is also unpredictable. It is a very fast paced environment because of its location. Time management is one of the most emphasized skills as well as catering to a customer to keep them satisfied."
good,"great place to work especially as a first job, good pay, and great employee discount and easy work. very easy going management at portland airport location"
good,"Panera Bread has allowed me many opportunities. I have been able to work my way up the ladder and could continue to do so, if I so choose; however, I find it is time to move on to something else in my life."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Greet customers, and have a friendly conversation with customers and recommend them certain items that they may like."
good,"I bake breads, cookies, muffins etc. I learned a lot like time management and working with other people. I'm a travelling baker so I work on different stores. Hardest part of the job is when someone is calling in sick and no one is available to cover so the schedule will be change."
good,"They didnt give enough hours, even though they were understaffed. Pay was not very good, especially when i had worked there for years, never paid me for my vacation after i left."
good,"A fine place to work with available benefits such as medical, dental, and 401k plans. Lots of customers, can be very fast paced but does not pay enough. Management are involved in helping production but the quantity of assistance will depend on the manager on duty."
good,"There was a small issue receiving enough hours to support myself while attending Culinary School but overall not a bad place to work. Structured, corporate cafe. Management was limited on their ability to work with my availability as much as they or I would have liked. High turnover rate, minimum wage jobs, part timers mostly."
good,It was a very easy place to get along with just about everyone. The hours were very flexible.The team work and team members were outstanding.
good,"Great environment to work in. Can adjust to schedule with school as needed. Positive vibes flow through all employees. Everyone is committed to keeping everything functioning as one machine, so nothing is out of line all times."
good,"meeting people."
good,"A typical day at work would be coming in as early as 5am opening the food lines, setting up the tables, organizing, sanitizing, stocking and making sure everything was ready to go for lunch. half of your co-workers don't come in til noon."
good,"At Panera Bread the members of the team were some of the most amazing people i have interacted with. However the GM at this particular cafe was very authoritative and unwilling to help out, which made some days more stressful than they should have been."
good,"Extreme work environment with rushes of customers heading out the door.  The employees are great and fun to work with. The management can be annoying sometimes, but they can also be very good friends."
good,"The work environment was very laid back, everyone was always willing to pitch in, loved working in the fast paced business."
good,The management was excellent. They did all they could to ensure a quality experience.My coworkers were also very professional and hardworking.One thing I really respected at Panera was they really make sure that things get done the right way
good,"The Company is a leader in the restaurant industry.  A great place to gain experience and learn. Was able to train others, learn about opening new stores and advance myself there."
good,"An enjoyable company to work for. A day as a Panera Manager involves touching all aspects of the business. Writing schedules, controlling day to day labor, product ordering, food safety oversight, guest interaction, store cleanliness, and quality control of products served to customer are all parts of the daily routine"
good,It was a great place to work. Staff was great> Management were nice and helpful. Hardest part is dealing with the fast paced environment.
good,"I enjoy opening the restaurant and being able to communicate with the employees as well as the customers. Coming to work I see people with smiles on their faces, which makes me feel good about my job because I work in front of the line and I have the opportunity to speak to almost every customer. Sometimes they come in sad or happy, and I believe smile is key and helping out a customer to get their needs is important."
good,"While incredibly busy at lunch hours, a majority of the time spent at work was engaging with customers and fun employees. It was incredibly worth it."
good,"Working at Panera was a great experience in customer service. Things are always changing so you are always on your toes, but in a good way. My only knock for the company was that I was not informed about the company's benefits program when I was first hired and did not know they would provide me benefits until I was 4 months in and was having the conversation with a co worker."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"While working at Panera Bread i have developed positive relationships with my management team and co-workers. I enjoy working with them day in and day out. They have taught me much about the expectations of their company as well as enforced expectations of their own in a relaxed manor. I have worked in several areas of Panera Bread; cashier, barista backer, food preparation, as well as back of house. I believe each job at Panera is difficult in its own way and takes employees who care about their job enough to put forward extra effort to uphold Panera standards in customer relations and quality assurance. Overall I have and still am enjoying my experience at Panera, but I know it is time for me to start working towards gaining experience in fields more related to my future career plans for after graduation. After all, I have over  40 credits in my major, Business Administration at Rockingham Community College and I transferring to University of North Carolina Greensboro, to continue my education and obtain a Bachelors Degree in Business Administration."
good,"I have worked at Panera Bread for 4 years, while at Panera I have improved my team work and communication skills, I am now setting the example for other associates thru being a trainer. Most days i handle cash, take orders , prepare food and set up the bakery display. I see there needs to be some improvements made on associate and manager level. The hardest part of my job is dealing with rude and disrespectful costumers, but I always maintain my composure. I have enjoyed my time working at Panera."
good,"Set up for breakfast, got everything ready for dinner. Managment was kind of sucky but over all it was a great work experience"
good,Good place to work. Good pay and a lot of extra hours available. You can move up in the company quickly.  It is a nice place to work.
good,"As an associate this company was very supportive in my training and allowing me to advance. They fast tracked most of goals to become manager, in which I succeeded. It's was a job I appreciated and respected for ten years and I am able to look back on it fondly."
good,very great environment great management great employees among other things great first job for high school and college students
good,"I open the store, pushing out all the pastry goods and getting the bakery set up for the day, I keep the bakery clean and stocked up in the morning and have it ready for the closing associates. I am on register and ring people up, providing efficient and friendly customer service."
good,"Throughout my experience at Panera, I have developed a strong networking basis with regular customers and co-workers.  I have sen the company grow and develop over the years."
good,Panera Bread is a pretty good place to work for. They have benefits for the employees. Everyone is really nice. My co-workers and managers make it enjoyable to work for. I would say the hardest part of my job is just taking food to the table when it gets busy and keeping up on clean tables when it's busy. My job is really fast paced so that's what I love about it.
good,"Its a fun and great atmospher to work and is very fast-pace, Its all about customer service and the way you work witha other."
good,Panera Bread is a wonderful company that has taught me a lot and allowed me to use the catering skills I have learned over the years.
good,"Working at Panera is great! I had friendly coworkers, and we all worked hard to keep the work place clean, comfortable, and enjoyable. Because of the location, the job keeps you on your toes, as there is always a task to be done (which is great because boredom is rarely an option)! However, hours became limited and with school so scheduling became difficult."
good,"A typical day of work is greeting and welcoming customers into the Panera bread lifestyle. I've learned how to properly handle food as well as adopt a different view and culture of food while working. Management is always there around you to help keep things moving at a steady constant pace throughout the day. Your co-workers are very bright, energetic and love the job that they do. Hardest part of the job is maintaining a warm welcoming demeanor  even if you have a bad day as well as not being able to slack off. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting recognized by managers during company events and trying out the new foods before they start to sell them."
good,Fast paced environment with room for advancement.  Day to day duties could change very quickly depending on business.  Semi-quick turnover of employees due to it being a food service job.  This made getting to know new co workers and working well with different types of people a very important skill.  Management was competent.
good,"Worked for 2 years in total. Easy job being a cashier and barista. Know everything about the sandwiches, salads, drinks and pastries."
good,I loved the employees and management. I was here for 3 years and moved up pretty quickly. I only left for better pay that was needed for myself.
good,"The Panera I worked at was inside of the South Park mall in Charlotte, NC. It was one of maybe three in the country that had a location actually in a food court. Most of my co-workers were high school, and college students. A few of them knew our GMs from working at other Paneras. The hardest part of the job, for me was making sure I stuck to a precise form of conduct. Our superiors want  a customer to have the same experience at all of our locations. The easiest part of the job was making sure each customer felt what we called ""Panera Warmth""."
good,"Panera is a good company to work for, especially if you are looking for advancement opportunities. If you put in  the time with the company, you will have good chances for promotions and pay raises. Customer service skills are a must for this job, but you will definitely learn a lot about customer service while working there."
good,"A typical day at Panera Bread  included coming in at 10:00 pm and baking, icing all product, and cleaning. before 5:00 am."
good,"In the year that I've worked at Panera, there have certainly been ups and downs. My coworkers were always fantastic, and over time have grown to become some of my closest friends. Every few months or so we have team meetings where we all talk about the new items and new policies while joking around and having a good time. I wouldn't trade some of the times I've had with my coworkers for the world."
good,"Great management, great coworkers. There are different types of work that can be done in Panera Bread, so if you don't like what you're doing you can always get cross-trained and learn something new."
good,I absolutely loved working for Panera. Growth was minimal but overall it was a very fun experience. Very family oriented work enviornment. Also very professional.
good,"Its not bad for a food place, one of the best ones ive worked at. Its all common sense and pretty easy. Of course the work place is only as good as its managers... and all of ours are pretty good. They have good attitude and sense of humor which is great honestly especially when we deal with food and customers not to mention when the customer is always right. The workers ... we have some good and some annoying but you learn that its just work and to put a smile on your face. The best part about panera to me honestly is the fact that they donate all the bread, bagels, and pastries EVERY night instead of throwing it away they give it to people who need it."
good,I was not sure about working in food service when I started here but once the job got going I really enjoyed it. The management and people I work with make the job fun. The customers tend to be pleasant and the food is always amazing.
good,"The staff was very friendly, and made everyone feel welcomed. The management seemed to have very poor communication skills. The job kept me busy, and on my feet which made the hours pass quickly."
good,"I was trained in every position so my days were usually different, very rarely did I have a typical day. Working there taught me how to multi task in a more efficient way. I got along with almost everyone there, management and coworkers, the only complaint I had would be that the schedule was messy and I never knew what I was going to be doing until my shift started. the most enjoyable part of the job would have to be the people, coworkers and customers where all mostly college aged so it was easy to meet people."
good,great staff. great food. its very busy at times but that also teaches you time management skills which I would say ive gotten better with
good,Panera Bread was my high school senior job. It was my first job ever and I enjoyed it. My coworkers were very encouraging. The management was very helpful and encouraged you to do your best.
good,"I really enjoyed my job at Panera Bread. Unfortunately, I felt like there was little room for opportunity, which is what I am looking for. Working for this company has taught me many things about management and customer service."
good,"I spent the better part of 4 1/2 yrs. at Panera and built numerous friendships with coworkers. They're the ones that kept me sane most days. Because of the customer base (mostly suburban), some of them were rather difficult to deal with. Most of them had a very pleasant demeanor- most of them asked for me by name. I listened to their concerns as best I could and either referred it to a mgr (rare) or dealt with it myself. It's a very fast-paced environment & I needed a change of pace. I wish Panera nothing but the very best for the near future. It looks bright! :)"
good,"Everyday at Panera Bread was a hard day of work.  Everyone had a certain amount of jobs that they had to complete by the end of their shift, which made the day go by faster.  Some days were more difficult because of how busy we got, but everyone I worked with made it a great job to go to."
good,"Ultimately, management and the coworkers are dependable people. I've learned how to multitask in this job between working at the cashier, attending the bakery, making smoothies and espresso drinks at the barista section, and lastly keeping the cafe at it's tip top shape. Nothing was challenging to me in this job; I'm a quick learner which is why I feel that I can overcome anything I set myself to do. The most enjoyable part of the job is building a connection with customers who come often and even those that don't."
good,"I loved working at Panera Bread! My coworkers were awesome, the regular visiting customers were always sweet, the food is delicious and fun to prepare"
good,The people who work there are not clean the place has come along way but they really need to get rid of some of the trash that is working there..
good,"A typical day at work would be helping customers with the menu, cashing out their food orders, serving the food to the tables for the people who choose to dine in, cleaning the dining room (wiping down tables, clearing tables, spot sweeping the area, stocking), merchandising products such as pastries, bagels, breads. I learned to take responsibility for my actions, I've grown to love serving customers and have encountered different types of people and customers. I learned to work with my coworkers as a team and it has come to the point where Panera is my second home because whenever I come to work, it is so productive and fun, it doesn't feel like we're at work and the staff really are my second family. The hardest part of the job would probably be the cleaning duties at the end of the night during closing shifts since it requires intense cleaning to avoid food or crumbs to be leftover during night and to prevent the attraction of bugs. Management are very appreciative and they honour their staff. The most enjoyable part of the job is bonding with different people and creating a customer connection with each and every different customer by letting them have a positive experience at Panera and making their day."
good,"I loved working here and being around food"
good,"A typical day at work consists of working side by side with the rest of the management team to ensure service goals are being met and labor and food cost goals are also met.  In doing all of this, we provide our customers with the best possible experience we strive to give."
good,"All of the previous orders are laid out and prepped for and ready to be made. Additional phone calls and internet orders come in and prepped immediately. If there are too many for myself then I add on another driver to send out some while I stay in the store and manage the customers. After all the orders are delivered or picked up I close out all the orders and restock everything. Right before I leave I prestage the orders for the next day, collect my tips, and clock out. Any other orders that are placed after I leave or are sent to me."
good,"Working at Panera Bread, has been a great oppurtunity. I learned alot and also had the upmost pleasure to be involved with customers and even knowing them on a day to day base."
good,"Great Brand! Great Company! Strong People Culture, focus on internal development of managers and team members. C.E.O is a real visionary who is passionate about restaurant operations and people."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"The Management was okay, certain managers were extremely immature. For example they would gossip about certain employees to other employees. One manager was always nice never unprofessional. The hardest part of the job was being the youngest one there and not being from the state it was located. I'm glad I went through what I went through; It taught me how to have patience and not to respond or react to every negative comment some of my co-workers gave me."
good,"Management is friendly, and treats you with respect. Pay is nice for a job, for earning extra cash."
good,"The best things about Panera Bread were my guests and my managers."
good,"I had just moved to the area and needed to earn some income.  I applied and was immediately hired by the General Manager.  I have a Bachelor's degree and management experience.  After working there for 3 months, I was offered a promotion to management.   "
good,"At Panera, the management was wonderful, always there to help when needed and very professional. Work environment was top-notch and professional."
good,family orientated business with a fun environment a typical work day is very fast paced.  I have learned a lot about customer service and how to adhere to customer needs.   Management are all down to earth people with each having their own area of expertise.  Their is nothing really hard about the it is explained and layed out as simple as it can be.  I enjoy the interaction among the people at work.
good,"i learned how to handle myself in a professional manor and how to be responsible with money and do transactions with cash, credit and check"
good,"typical day was always busy and had something to do, i really enjoyed the staff i worked with except the managers would never communicate which one another, so this made work difficult sometimes. All in all the company always treated me well, never had a serious problem here at panera"
good,"On a typical day, I was put on register, where I would greet the customers and take their orders. If they needed anything from bakery or barista, it was also my job to ready the drinks and package bakery items. During a rush, if needed, I would also run into dining room and bring out the food when the counter was backed up."
good,"Panera bread is arguably the best place i have worked at so far, great co workers, great supervisors. It was all great until the General Manager and i did not get along. It all j ust went downhill"
good,Preparing the food before hand is the most important skill needed for this job.
good,I learned how to manage my time at this job. A typical morning starts out fast here. When you work on the line you have to have things set up for lunch while making breakfast for customers. Everyone is so friendly.
good,"Good place to work in. Friendly co-workers, a lot of support if you're just starting. Overall good place and GREAT food."
good,Learned how to work in a fast-paced environment and attend to the orders of each customer in a timely manner. Interacted with a team of associates in an efficient way.
good,i love the atmosphere that it set we work hard but still manage to have fun and enjoy our job.
good,"It is a good place to work, but job security is kind of tight. They take high regard in the work you do, but can be stressful at times."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of deploying all of the associates to their perspective roles. Assign tasks, keep employees on task. focus on guest interaction and speed of service, handle any guest complaints. Complete inventory and cash management counts. "
good,"As the catering assistant coordinator my mornings started early getting orders put together. The work load was variable some days bordering on overwhelming but there was a lot of support from management and the rest of the crew. There were great managers, and friendly staff."
good,"Working at Panera Bread on a typical day starts out pretty fast as people rush in for their hearty Breakfasts.  Fellow employess assist with all work needing to be done.  Lunch arrives with a fury of hungry people, and then as the day comes to a standstill near dinner, we come together to help make the cleaning and closing of the cafe a cinch."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Management team is great as well as co-workers.  'Teamwork makes the dream work' atmosphere..
good,"Typical day would include either being on the cash register and assisting guests, making food on line, or training in any of the positions. I have learned that places like Friends exist and that working as a team is very helpful. My co-workers are great they care about each other and our guests. The hardest part of this job is making sure all the guests are happy and that they are served in a timely manner. My favorite part of my job is the guests. Getting to know them and take care of their orders has been great."
good,"Panera Bread is a great atmosphere with great food, however getting out of work by the end of your shift is usually rare. When the work stops thats when you are able to leave."
good,I loved working for Panera Bread.  A healthy environment to work and grow.  Early mornings but there was a great quality of life working there.  Co workers were great and the concept has proven itself in a tough market by increasing sales every year for 5 years.
good,"Performed customer service in a fast-paced, high pressured environment."
good,Cafes differ depending on location. Mine was always busy. You're constantly moving. Fun job overall
good,Its a nice and fast paced environment to work in .  It is great for those whose primary concern isn't working full time.  The people are generally nice to work with and the customer base is repeating so a great chance to interact with them on reoccurring basis
good,"make good baking goods makes me happy.every night we have panup for the next day.my job is to bake bread bagels,sweets cookies.selg management is very important because we work without managers,lead person ant etc.3 of us working like bakers.hardest part is everything must be done in 8 hrs doesent matter if you have to bake 3000 $ worth of baking goods or 5000$.what makes me happy is very good product that I make"
good,"A typical day at work consists of me coming in and panning up for the next day loafs of bread and making up focaccias (cheese and sea salt). Next I stretch about 200 bagels and place them back into the refrigerator.(Prepping all for the next day). I set up a rack with sweet pastries and cookies all to be baked off later in the day. Since working here I learned that I really have important role within the company as a baker because if there isn't any bread then the other side of production would definitely be in a bind. Management could always tighten up in certain areas as well as other establishments but the people behind the title and the other fellow co-workers are amazing; we all help each other. The hardest part of my job is indeed the freezer not the work but the cold!!! But its all worth it when you create your product and that customer purchases your product and then say that they love it, that's what I love the most!!!!"
good,"Up-sold additional menu items, beverages and desserts to increase restaurant profits."
good,"Panera is a fun place to work and let's one represent a great product.  A typical day consists on a heavy workload and multiple rushes. Management is not consistent in leading a team of employee's. There is job security, but the hours given are never consistent, which doesn't allow for much stability for employee's."
good,"As a company, Panera Bread is great place to work. They genuinely care about the people that work there and about the community."
good,"My day at Panera Bread would consist of waiting on customers, cashiering, preparing sandwiches, salads and coffee drinks, cleaning, stocking and dishes.  Management was very friendly and co-workers always came together to get the job done.  The best thing about my job was opening the bakery and getting to know our customers.  The hardest part of the job was quitting, having to leave all good times at Panera and move on to better things."
good,"Open and close the bakery. Greet customers. Manage your team. Solid management training program. Pretty positive environment, but when you work there for an extended period of time... it feels kinda cultish."
good,i learned a lot at Panera Bread. I learned to manage my time very well.  I liked my bosses very much and they were very understanding for the most part.  the most difficult part of working were the hours.  what i liked most were the people i worked with.
good,"on a good 8 hour day a hard worker can go home happy about working there, nice customers, co-workers, and mangers."
good,"Culture is good and FDF operations is a great place to work."
good,"Working here is nice and generally pretty easy no matter what position your put it. The management isn't always great however. They tend to play favorites with their associates. The ""favorite"" associates tend to be very pretentious and rarely offer to help the less skilled associates. Ironically enough, I am one of the ""favorites"", but I choose to never be like the rest of the pretentious associates."
good,assisting customers is great along with the great co workers how were team players
good,"At the time the management, the crew, the work load, it was all great."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Panera Bread is a place where you can create a second family. If you do what you need to do and how you have to do it, it makes the job ten times easier. No doubt there are days you want to pull your hair out, but what job doesn't have those days?"
good,"I answered phones, made catering orders, coordinated orders, packaged orders, delivered orders, provided customer service to clients. kissed the GM's feet because she micromanaged EVERYTHING!  She made my life a living hell.  She had no respect for me, yet expected me to respect her.  I respected every manager except the GM who treated everyone like trash!"
good,"It is a fun place to work as long as you have good management.  The company as a whole is a really great company, especially with the culture and values."
good,"A typical day at work consists of drive-thru, line production, register, or barista. I am always there to help the customers when they need help. The hardest part of the job is working wth the public. Staying postive is my job, so that's what I enjoyed the most."
good,I had a lot of fun as well working for this company and I wouldn't trade it for the world. I actually left this job to move here and go to school. I would of never left this job otherwise. The management team was amazing and we all enjoyed working here.
good,"Enjoyed working with doughs and being able to create food stuffs  that people would buy."
good,"I would wash dishes and keep entire restaurant clean as well as bus tables. My work environment was very steady and fast paced. I always had something to keep me occupied. Overall, It was a good job with benefits and comfortable workplace."
good,"I loved working for Panera I met many different people and enjoyed my job greatly. The days went by fast, you are always busy and have things to do. I was able to build great customer relationships and had full support from staff and management. "
good,I loved my job at Panera Bread but this is not the work I wanted to continue my career with. I want to eventually become a physical therapist and I went to school for it and had to ultimately leave. 
good,"A typical day would be, working as a cashier and cleaning the store. Always smiling! I learned how to be a team player. I loved my managers there, they taught me how to do my job right, and love it."
good,Nice people fun place just expected too much after only 3 weeks of training
good,I had a great time working there. It was good for me to work there while I was in High School. Everyone was super nice and great to work with.
good,I was a student when I worked there.schedule was flexible for me to attend school.
good,"As an associate I worked cash registers, prepared food, managed sanitation, performed customer service duties and prepped the store for the next shift."
good,a typical day would start with great customers service and alot of sandwichs
good,The atmosphere is light and friendly. Not a bad job but not much room for advancement.
good,Worked on the food prep line. Making food for customers and taking orders.
good,"A typical night at Panera is very fast paced. First sepearate the breads from the pastries and bagels.Place your bread and pastries into the proofbox.Throughout the night you have different task. Icing the cinnamon rolls, scones, bearclaws, etc.At the end of the shift you make sure that your baking area is clean for the morning shift.I learned time managment.All products are proof and bake for a certain amount of time and you have make sure to be very careful not to under or overproof the products. Most of the nights you are working by yourself.Every now and again a your baker trainer or manager would come by to make sure that everything is running smoothe or if you would need some assistance. The hardesst part of the job job is making sure that you dont loose track of time throughout the night.The most enjoyable part i honestly would say is the $10.00 limit."
good,"there was always something to do at panera bread. most of the customers came on a daily basis and were friendly. Panera bread taught me the value of diversity in any type of environment. Everyone there was friendly and fun. I dont remember anything being hard, but I loved meeting new customers that came in."
good,A typical day at work included:
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Every day at work I come in to contact with great friends and great customer clientele. I have learned how to keep great clients and how to find the right ones and form relationships on a more personal level. The management is knowledgeable and helps where needed. The hardest part of my job particularly is having to make all of the orders and deliver them myself, and on busier days there is no help. I absolutely love everything else about my job, I have no other complaints."
good,"pay sucks can get rough and fast moving but the work life for a typical college student, its phenomenal. from making lattes, salads to hanging out with my co-workers and joking with management."
good,"Working at Panera bread was a very full filling and stressful job. I felt like I had a second family with my customers who I saw mostly everyday and interacted with. I felt stressed a lot because the cafe I worked at was such low volume that we were short staffed. This created conflict with getting breaks and having enough people to cover shifts. I felt like I was unable to move up in the company because I was trained to open the bakery and was very good at it. I kind of got stuck in something I was good at and it was good and bad. I enjoyed doing it but I wanted to become a manager and was unable to be trained on other spots in the cafe. The hardest part of the job was getting everything done in a timely manner. As an opener you have an hour to get the bakery set up and get things put together before the first customer walks in. Sometimes that can be trying but for the most part it was challenging in a way that I enjoyed and in turn I worked harder. The most enjoyable part of my job was my customers. I enjoyed my customers funny, warm, awesome, and friendly personalities. I keep in contact with a lot of my customers out side of work and they have become like a second family. I learned from this job that you get what you give. If you do not give 100 percent than the day is going to be not so great. If you try your hardest it rubs off on your co-workers. If you come in with a positive attitude and work hard then in turn your co-workers seem happier and seem to want to work harder also. I typical day at work begins at 5am. Setting up the bakery by placing all the pastries on correct"
good,"I started at Panera Bread (aka St. Louis Bread Co) in 1999 in my home town of Kirkwood Mo. I worked there a while learning the majority of the positions there. I left in 2001. In 2006 I worked at a Panera in Rolla, Mo. I only did sandwich line there. In 2007 I transfred to another store in St. Louis where again I worked the majority of the positions there. I left there 6 months later. In 2010 I was hired at Panera in Paducah, Ky. The General Manager at the time seemed impressed by my knowlege of the place and hired me right away. But instead of moving up I kept getting kicked around. Some Storeds where a blast to work at, others it was not so much."
good,"A typical day at Panera Bread was based with Productivity and great moral values coming from us, the employees. No one ever slacked on there work, only occasionally.I could say there were one or two people that would do so within the time-period i was working there. The hardest part of the job I would have to say was closing down the restaurant at the end of the night. Mostly, I enjoyed the out-going attitudes that the employee's had and never did it once interfere with store regulations."
good,"I have held several positions in Customer Service; either as a Sale Associate or Cashier but no place that I have ever worked was as fun of an environment. I hate when you walk-in to a place of business and the atmosphere is dull and boring and you feel like you just want to get out of there because the employees act like they don't even want to be there; but Panera is not like that at all. I had the best co-workers I ever had and overall; it was a very fun, enthusiastic environment. If it wasn't for the lack of hours that I was assigned; I would love to have stayed there. But you can't sucessfully raise both yourself and a child on 16 hours per week."
good,"A typical day isn't too bad, work is steady. Some people have a higher work drive than others. You learn to laugh at common mistakes you make. Hardest part is probably keeping your cool when customers lose their heads."
good,"Panera was going to be successful. I knew that from the first time I started there back in 2000. Nine years later when I left I had unfortunately become somewhat disenfranchised by some poor experiences with mid and upper level management in addition to what I perceived as an imbalance in people investment versus operational/promotional investment, but it seemed to have worked out well in the past year or two. That being said, they have made a lot of smart investments in systems and tools that has allowed them continued growth and success beyond what I thought was possible especially in an established market like Chicago. The people that I still know working there all seem to be very happy."
good,This was a great company to work for I wish I would of stayed there. The management that work there was very nice and had npo problems.
good,"Very clean and productive place to work. Every one is get a long and good together. Helping each other. I was happy and learn a lot from the manger and the team member,"
good,"Panera does a fantastic job of catering to families and children in terms of guest hospitality. However the culture of the company needs some fine-tuning. In my four years with the company there have been four different presidents of Panera and each time something different or radical is changed and all the cafés, including me, have to quickly adapt and change our standard operating Procedures in order to accommodate the changes. Additionally the culture of Panera, specifically our franchise, needs to do a better job at praising and uplifting its employees as that is a big area of opportunity."
good,Very flexible and fun team oriented environment. Panera gives back to the surrounding communities and is constantly working on more ways to be environmentally friendly through their food and packaging.
good,a typical day working at panera bread fun and enjoyable. I was able to get my servesafe certification. Management was easy to work with. the job overall was a good job and i would not mind going back to work for this company
good,Have learned quite a lot during my 6 years with Panera. Most of my managers taught me how to better myself as an employee and exceed expectations as well. Met different sorts of people throughout my customers and through co workers. Great first job.
good,A good starter job for those out of high-school and going to college as it makes it easy to balance both with the flexible schedule. Pay is decent starting and the job itself is easy.
good,My Panera cafe always needs new hires because it's in a college town with a lot of college kids employed. No drug testing and people keep their jobs unless they do something really bad!
good,"They were very understanding of my school schedule. Also, while my husband was deployed there were times I “no call no showed” just due to overbearing stress and I needed to take time off during summer, 5 months, and they completely understood my need. The breaks were a little iffy and if you work in the front, bathroom breaks are hard to come by. Otherwise a great place."
good,A typical day at work for me consisted of cleaning the cooking line multiple times throughout my shift. I also made all the food and set it up for the servers. The management is really helpful during rushes of people.
good,Its a good company to work for the benefits are great. Most of the co-work will help teach/show you the right way things are supposed to be done. But you can't trust anyone. Don't tell anyone there about your personal life they will use it to bring u down. Just do your job and go home.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,i liked my job at panera and if i was not so badly needed by my family i would have retired there. i liked the overnight bakers job. helmut was a good boss and i truly hated leaving
good,"Panera Bread is a great start job, all you have to do is show up and do your job right and you’ll be on the roster until the end of time. Management varies between locations but corporate usually weeds out the bad apples. If you need a secure job whilst searching for something more long term, Panera is great and very flexible. "
good,"My take on Panera bread is, The staff worked well as a team, they gave people opportunities to work, they pay minimum wage  its a great place to work its a productive environment"
good,"good work place have a good upclose relshipe like people who are "
good,"I really enjoyed doing deliveries and helping customers. I felt most of the management was interested in making the customer experience great every time they would come in. I feel that if you fit in, and worked hard, you could have a great future with them."
good,I enjoyed spending time with a lot of people that I worked with. Most made the job easier to handle but some made it so much worse. At first I was recognized for my work but near the end it seemed to not matter.
good,"Being a catering coordinator with panera bread is like being your own boss. You control everything, and take care of it all on your own. Every day is different and there's always room to improve."
good,Typical day at Panera is waiting on customers and keeping the cafe clean. Providing menu details to customers. Training new associates on best practices on maintaining company standards.
good,"There are opportunities to advance to higher positions within the company for regular retail associates. Everyone has an opportunity to advance in this company depending on their skills, and work ethic."
good,"Very busy. restaraunt setting, especially for breakfast and lunch. Very fast paced, not easy to keep  up with. Most of the managers treat us very well, and most of us work well together as a team. The benefits are excellent and not too expensive for this kind of work. The pay may not be the greatest, but at least you do end up bringing home most of your paycheck, and they hire based on experience. The shared tip program does increase our wages by about one dollar per hour, and if they take you on as a driver, you bring home cash tips for both mileage and tips. There is plenty of opportunity to move up and around, although it may happen slowly.  The best thing is that they will work with you so you can find the position that you are most comforortable with."
good,Got to learn a new craft as Baker.. took pride in the training program they offered .got 2 pay evaluations a year.. great benefits .and paid vacation s
good,Panera was a very productive place to work . It allowed me to earn but not enough hours were given to support me financially. Going forward I am looking for work with more hours
good,"This was a good job to be my first; I learned the importance of teamwork and diligence. There was quite a bit of drama, but that’s okay. It was pretty simple to pick up on and my bourse were flexible"
good,My time at panera lasted years long but towards the end it got a little hard to be excited about going to work every day while managers came and gone and so did employees it was hard to balance life and work with having to pick up other people's slack. At the end of my career with panera bread in 2019 I left on sort of bad terms with my manager because she was upset with me that I decided to leave because I had to take care of my daughter that got very sick in the beginning of 2019. It sucked that we left on bad terms but I had to do what was best for my famil.
good,"Nice place to work. Family friendly environment. Donates leftover baked goods to charity. Offer flexible work schedules. Delicious, fresh foods prepared daily."
good,People you work with are nice and fun to be around. Makes the day go by quicker. They’re open to answer any questions and will help you through any situation going on outside of work
good,The job is pretty good. There is room to grow. And to advance money wise.  Management is very dedicated to company. Employees are also inclusive and nice to work with.
good,Panera Bread was a great first job. This job taught me so much about the right way to interact with customers. I enjoyed working with my teammates everyday.
good,"i honestly miss working at panera , they all were so nice and friendly but they didn’t schedule me much so i had to leave  , but if i could i’d work there again and hope for more hours"
good,"While the shift crossovers between overnight and day can be problematic due to available space and access to resources needed to due your job, it can be fast paced to the point that the time really goes by quickly. Granted, you need to really be okay with working nights and if you're a morning person (I'm not) then it may be a longer adjustment but so far the cons are under shadowed by the benefits. "
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Great first job, worked as a cashier never had any complaints. Awesome co workers and chill environment. I left for better pay at the time no other reason"
good,Keep up with the work you always have fun people's Friendly at time I enjoy working there is lots to do you can advance here at Panera okay that's about it
good,"I received my raise for becoming a trainer when i was supposed to, bit many of my coworkers did not. I did not recieve any of my promised semi-anually review and earned raises, nor did most of my associates. Upper management can't seem to figure out how to keep good employees."
good,i did alot of duties at panera bread. i was dine and then dish then after dish i was line cook. all positions there you have to manage your time with being fluid with your work.
good,I’m first job was here at Panera it’s pretty nice I work with grate people and the managers on the clock are always ready to help whenever it’s needed
good,"I loved working at Panera I really a family working there the only reason I had to leave was because of the pay, which really sucked they couldn’t raise the pay from 7.50 so I really couldn’t stay"
good,Fun place to work. Great people to work with great work environment great management just an overall fun place to work. Would tell any of my friends to work here again a great place to work.
good,"I enjoyed the two months or so that I worked at Panera Bread. My managers helped me succeed in all the positions that I placed in. I left because of scheduling problem, but I would definitely recommend this job to everyone."
good,I learned so much of my job experiences at Panera. I made sure I kept my surroundings very clean. I built so many friendships with costumers. I enjoyed being at work everyday.
good,"I recently quit but I had worked there for a few years. I had worked at multiple locations and unfortunately the last one ended up being my least favorite. Almost never any free meals for hard work, not enough workers, bad GM but overall Panera itself is a good company. They try to move you up in your positions fast if they notice a hard worker. Pay is pretty decent and the scheduling is flexible!"
good,going into work and clock in and start you job such as cleaning dish and take out the garbage and etc... cleaning the table and mop the floor and then at the end of the day clock out
good,"My time at Panera taught me many things. It was a great job to start my leadership skills. Anyone wanting to get on to management, this would be a good start."
good,"I was hired when the delivery program was rolling out in a few weeks after.  When there are no deliveries, you help in the dining room.  At the store I was at we ran food out to tables (not all Panera's do this), and all drivers helped keeping the dining room clean, wash dishes, make coffee, etc.  You get the full wage while in the store, and a reduced driver's wage when on deliveries.  You get your tips and mileage in cash each day you work.  Panera promotes individuality and allows you to communicate your own natural way as long as it's appropriate. You get a big discount on food and can have ""mistakes"" if no one else gets to them first.  When I worked there and ate a lot of clean food my health improved a lot.  Liked most of the coworkers."
good,"Puedes spender muchas cosas en este lugar, lo único es que el personal joven no asume con responsabilidad la realización de sus tareas. Y las normas de higiene no son suficientemente supervisadas, se desperdicia muchos alimentos"
good,"Although their raises are small, you do get the opportunity for quarterly raises. The management was decent, while sometimes petty, they did look out for their employees and were understanding at most times. Career advancement is slim, they rarely need more shift supervisors or managers. Some associates remain entry level associates for more than 5 years."
good,"Liked Panera a lot!"
good,"Work professional, good hours for restaurant business. No grease or alcohol to deal with on a daily basis. You manage a multi unit within four walls. Bakery , catering  and Cafe"
good,"Not a bad place to work. good team! Fast busy work work work!! Lots of customers and got meal discounts, Was trained to work in different areas of the restaurant."
good,"Great first job, from 16 and cashiering to just graduated from college and need to get into the restaurant/ hospitality career field. Great teaching managers and overall great experience. I personally learned from my 5+yrs with Panera and use that knowledge to this day."
good,"Great First Job Experience,Staff Is Very Professional and Friendly ! Typically 5-8 hour shifts with another person. The most enjoyable part of the job was the 50% off of food ."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Working at Panera Bread taught me a lot on the importance of being more social, guests at Panera were very kind and seemed genuine, stepping out of my comfort zone is what Panera taught me"
good,"A great first successful job , I worked here since February and I'm enjoying it.  I have a learning disability and the staff and management is very accepting towards it.  Had a lot of success with the technology they used during shifts."
good,Quick paced environment worked there when first opened so it was not as organized as it currently is. I loved the managers but system was a little stressful with a busy flow of customers.
good,"A VERY BAD WORK ENVIRONMENT THEY HAVE NO communication between management and staff  "
good,"Panera was a very active place and you never really got time to sit down. Very busy and fast paced, it was fun but when it was time to get serious you have to stay focused."
good,Only a moment i didn't like. It is that sometimes when it is not busy it can be boring. But everyting was good. Everyone was friendly and everywhere were cleaned.
good,I thought over all the place was a great place to work. All the employees were nice and the bosses were nice. the place was peaceful and not stressful to work at.
good,"I loved customer interaction, making sure customers were happy and satisfied with service provided.  Being a trainer was a challenge as some individuals could not follow directions. I learned a great deal from following and observing management.  I enjoyed bakery set up, making items look appealing and fresh."
good,"Work was nice and consistent, and the bosses were very understanding of any issues that I had. Not only was I allowed, but even encouraged to work outside my space and learn something new. I left knowing a lot more than I knew coming in."
good,I just started but the people there are great. We’re like a little family. It’s quick paced but not stressful. They are very flexible and understanding. Great place to work temporarily. The only con is the pay of 9:25
good,I gained the skill of memory with all my repeat customers in order to create a personal experience for them. The job was enjoyable however nearing the end the employees created an uncomfortable environment that reminded me of cliches in highschool.
good,"Honestly, it’s a good place to work at. And they promote within. But, there’s not enough hours to train people well. So you have to be the type of person that learns by being hands on. And does well with face paced environments."
good,The company is full of great people who are motivated to feed their customers. The job can be frustrating at times but that does not stop the team from bonding and getting work done.
good,I've learned so much while working at Panera. Taking those lessons and applying them to life is my next step. mostt of the food that Panera serves are health friendly.
good,its fast paced. you have to be able to work under pressure and keep the same pace when you wokr. some days its would be dezd and slow but some days it would be nonstop working.
good,"It was a good part time job while I was still in school. It was the type of place that I would make a career out of. It is fast paced, especially during the rush times."
good,Low is generally a solid and versatile shoe. The upper is guaranteed to be durable and breathable. Versatility is not a problem as the midsole setup is good for both bigger and lighter wearers. Stability is ensured because the shoe model has outriggers to provide balance upon landing. These  low-top athletic performance shoes receives so much love from sneaker fanatics.
good,I found panera to be a very fast paced but also very enjoyable place to work and grow your customer service skills. They usually encourage a great work environment and also attract very kind customers in general.
good,It’s been years since I’ve worked for one but it’s a very decent place. I worked for one for just about five years. I definitely recommend cross training as much as possible because you’ll learn a lot for future careers and you’ll get a lot more hours of work.
good,I loved the staff I originally worked with and formed great friendships. I could have fun depending on if we were understaffed and how strict management was feeling.
good,i felt very out of place in the environment. im not really sure what i was supposed to be doing but they all just kind of left me out of everything and i didnt get much hours being the new girl.
good,"Panera bread was a good productive job with good team members. Flexible shifts with with good benefits such as discounts on food.  Panera team members include food preparation, sanitation, and customer service. Panera Bread crew members operate cash registers, as well."
good,It’s an ok place to work. Above par on the usual things a part-time fast food place could offer. It’s really simple so none of the time I work im in a rushed environment
good,It’s extremely fast pace downtown. Workers were very nice. They’re bad at training. They didn’t teach me the proper way to do certain things at first. There will be slow times where there are no orders.
good,"As long as you're assertive, and don't let people run over you, it's a good job. Make sure your customer service skills are good, or you wont last very long."
good,"There was the usual slow times but it was a pretty easy job. I learned how to make drinks, cashier and work drive thru.  The management  was nice. The workplace culture was cool, had a very consistent standard. The hardest part of the job was dealing with coworkers not doing their job right then having to redo it for them. The most enjoyable was the food."
good,I like Panera it’s a good work environment the food is good and good benefits like free drinks or half off food they work well with students to have a flexible schedule
good,"This is a pretty decent place to work and the best when it comes to “fast food”. There is no worrying about fryer grease or slippery areas. The workers keep it clean and we’re all a team. There is some bickering between employees as there is anywhere. The management is pretty efficient and fair. There are some faves when it comes down to it but it’s that way anywhere. As a driver, you do get the short end of the stick but the working hours aren’t bad. Just take into consideration, the wear and tear on your vehicle and if you’re involved in an accident (fault or not) they won’t compensate you for depreciation or your insurance and deductibles or your maintenance as needed. Therefore, I had to look for other work. "
good,"I personally have enjoyed my time working at Panera. However, management as well as coworkers are different at each location and I feel that really makes a difference on how much you enjoy this job. Otherwise amazing :)"
good,"Panera is a great place to work.  My issue is that my commute is over an hour each way!!  I love the flexibility that they allow to help me with the traffic, but regardless - it still results in a 2+hr commute each day."
good,I have stayed at Panera because I enjoy the staff and environment despite being neglected raises after completing training/ years of work that were previously said to earn me a raise. I commonly train new employees who are hired at $2 or $3 more than I currently make after several years of full-time employment. I am one of the most valuable employees yet am not paid accordingly and all my managers know it.
good,Easy going and fun workplace that is accepting of everyone. Management is great for the most part and everyone is kind to each other. Flexible and willing to work with you.
good,"The hardest part of my job is the standing"
good,"My time at Panera taught me a lot about having a job. It was a great learning experience that showed me that working at most jobs is not supposed to be fun, but it can still help you grow as a person. The money I made was more than enough to make up for any complaints I had."
good,the food here is healthy fresh and really good to eat. along with prepping the food. there is no grease to worry about working with. your always busy.
good,Customer service focused in a fast paced work environment. With a strong focus on budgets. Employee training and development is a big part of the everyday culture.
good,"The  should even our workers on every shift. "
good,Cool place to work if you are a student. Relaxed enviroment sometimes customers can be very rude but its all a days work..........................................
good,"As a bakery chef at Panera my job required consistency, in order to make sure all of Panera’s pastries and breads are identical every day. I worked for Panera Bread for one year and got promoted to bakery trainer. While I was a bakery trainer, I would have to instruct the new hires on how to properly prepare the breads and pastries.  This took patience, good communication skills and organization in order to develop an efficient baker."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"The average day involved 3 very hectic and daily rushes at 8am-930am, 10:30am-2pm and 5pm-7:30pm with times of both heavy and slow business scattered in between to complete stocking, run breaks and have meetings with management if needed. Oddly enough the hardest part of the job and best part of it is your co-workers. They are always in the thick of things with you but hiring from such a younger group (high school, early college), especially for late shifts, many don't feel the need or the urge to actually work and spend much of the time either talking or on their phone."
good,"The workplace at panera was generally inviting overall; however, the closing shift were quite demanding as a certain amount of work must be completed."
good,"It was a clean and honest facility with fish and healthy food , my coworkers were hard working and reliable. They also had the best brownies ever I'd eat like one a day it's a good thing I stopped working there or I'd be on an episode  of my 600 pound life I'm sure"
good,"Stay focused at all times. You have to be flexible . It can be very fast paste. In order to get your daily tasks done in timely manner, I suggest making a list so you can get it all done in a timely manner ."
good,One of the best jobs I ever had and I loved going to work every day when I worked there I enjoyed working there and wouldn’t mind going back there if I had the opportunity to work for them again.
good,Training is available for you to participate and advance in areas that interest you. the staff is hard working but at times very short staffed. Very common to come in on days off or to stay over your shift.
good,"I worked here because I needed to put food in my stomach while at college. It was great because as I worked, I would get a discount on my meal during my break, so when I worked, I knew I was going to eat well that day."
good,"It was a very cool job overall. The environment is nice, the work wasn’t too complicated. I really loved working with the customers and being friendly!"
good,"Working at Panera Bread really taught me customer service and taught me how to expand on my speaking and language. The most enjoyable part was speaking to customers and getting to know them, as well as making friends and always making sure the day was a success."
good,"I had trouble balancing my position with my day to day life but I was consistently supported, offered advice, and given great feedback. I learned how to collect and present pertinent sales info and I ultimately came away understanding how to work with many different personality types."
good,"Overall the management is pretty good, the staff is friendly and they are usually good about working with your schedule. Can be stressful at times but what job isn't."
good,Panera was a fun place to work! the people were nice the food is good and the pay is acceptable. The managers take into account your hours of availibility and work with you.
good,"The job was simple, and ok. The hire manager was a bit disrespectful, and rude. But the other managers were cool, eased, and polite. The job was fun with some coworkers on the job. Was never too hard, too easy, it was just right."
good,At Panera Cares I would open Tuesdays and Thursdays. This inolved stalking the bagels and the bakery. I would take customer's orders and send it for the cooks to make. I toasted bagels made drinks and helped cleaning the dining area and the rest of the Panera. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people. The people who worked there were easy going and the friendliest work environment I've ever been apart of.
good,"I started this job in high school, and overall it was a good place to work. I never had to worry about having enough hours. The overall environment was pleasant."
good,"Welcome customers and help determine their orders"
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Preparing food, ensuring food safety, customer service, consolidation, dish washing, cashiering, answering phones, and efficiently distributing tasks."
good,"I enjoyed working at Panera bread, the management was very nice and always willing to work with me and my schedule. The hours are a little difficult where sometimes one may have to stay past midnight and seeing I had the job in high school it wasn't exactly ideal."
good,"When I worked at Panera Bread, there was hardly any down time. From the minute I clocked in to the minute I clocked out, I was always doing something, whether it was making the sandwiches (or salads), cleaning my station, cutting the bread, or prepping the other food. Because I was a line cook, I worked in the back of the house, and it would get very hectic there, especially during lunch hour when I had many orders thrown at me. Everybody in the back of the house was on a time crunch to make the food and hand it off to the servers who, in turn, gave it to the customers. If we could not meet our times making the food, the managers would help us out. While I was at Panera Bread, I learned how to organize my station properly so I would have all of the ingredients I need, when I need them, and where I need them. I also learned how to be efficient. Overall, working at Panera Bread was a good experience which helped me earn some money and interact with people."
good,"typical day at work was fine , good pace of work , nothing to really complain about. Customers are nice most of the time, nothing anyone couldn't handle on their own"
good,"It's a very welcoming environment, managers are very kind to workers. Very flexible with hours for workers, managers are very open to worker's needs. The hardest part of the job would be the dining position. Usually a day at Panera Bread is calm until 9-12 am and 4-6pm."
good,"Panera Bread is competitive company to work for that promotes from within. Goal and career orientated individuals strive in this work environment as the expectations are high but the experience is incredible. The hardest part of this job, as with any other job would be  the turnover with employees and management. Each store has its own challenges that are difficult to face but are worth the effort to commit. I was able to learn a lot from this company, not only about the business side of it but as well as myself and how I fit in on a team. This job isn't easy, but if it was anyone can do it. Within the company there are many areas to learn from as well as different avenues to follow."
good,I worked from the opening of a panera and it wasnt a bad start and i busted my butt and got offered many of promotions but i had found a better job by this point.
good,Panera is a good company over all with lots of room for growth.  The company average of hours worked per week for management is 45 which is great for a restaurant. Micro management is becoming more prevalent.
good,I love the work environment. Everyone is able to work together and keep each other going throughout the work day. I enjoy what I do when I either do dining or I am on the register. I am flexible to do whatever the managers ask me to do.
good,Great place to work. I would like to  take the time to explain how good the company is and how I enjoyed working there. I also enjoyed the pay that was  given.
good,We are able to mess around and work at the same time. All the managers are understanding. The are able to work around your schedule so you can still spend time with family.
good,"I've never had any issues with management and the training is usually very direct and helpful. The most difficult part of the job is learning each food item, if that says anything."
good,Working at Panera bread helped improve my teamwork skills and allowed me to work alongside my coworkers. I learned to incorporate all the strengths each person possessed to make each day a successful day.
good,Working at panera is interesting. Management tend to be easy going during non-peak hours but get rather aggressive during peak hours. A lot of yelling occurred which made the overall experience lackluster.
good,"Panera Bread is quick paced, but the people you'll be surrounded by will make pushing out orders in a timely manner a fun task. The managers are forgiving and helpful, just don't be afraid to ask questions and seek help when needed; they are there for you."
good,It's fun to work at Panera. They give desired hours to people who need it. They care about their employees which is important because most of us are in a college town.
good,Working for Panera Bread was an experience that improved my social skills and work ethics. I was able to create a bond with many customers which lead to great reviews along with a mass amount of returning customers.
good,As a first job it was a good place to start. Customers were very friendly and it was nice to have some regulars. Weekends were the busiest but it was manageable
good,Working at Panera Bread can be really fun. Team work and cooperation are highly valued at our cafes and it is a really great first job. I would recommend working here.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,I like working at Panera Bread the team is awesome and management it does get hectic at times but what job doesn't overall I have no complaints. They open at 6am and close at 9pm so it is a great company just doesn't offer opportunities for you to move up in the company
good,just like any other job just do your job thats a typical day at work.i learned everything.the work place culture is beautiful you need to experience it to understand it.there was no part of the job that was hard.the most enjoyable part of the job is they make you feel welcomed comfortable like if your part of their family.
good,"Panera bread has a mission statement and are well driven by it. They stick to their training promises and love to promote from within, It is a good company to grow with."
good,panera bread is agreat job the people and the company are very friendly and will take great care of you and your family and flexible when you need them.
good,"opportunities for advancement provided"
good,a typical day at work consisted of completing orders for customers and keeping the work place clean for ourselves and the numerous groups of people that entered Panera
good,"I worked 4 years at Panera - which were full of ups and downs.  I was noted highly there, as ""employee of the month"", which I do believe I earned.  I was s trained in all of my areas of expertise: Cashier, Dining, Back of house, and Line (making food).  It was a nice place to work - The atmosphere and people I worked with and that came in were all very pleasant.  Especially during the beginning years.  I learned a lot about how to deal with difficult customers/people and still remain calm and pleasant.  I also learned (more) how to train people.  "
good,Panera bread was a wonderful job experience I like the environment and the culture of people that gravitates to the food and pastries I also like receiving tips.
good,"Worked graveyard shifts for Panera Bread I was a night Baker which means, I would bake everything on my own for when the café would open in the morning the next day. The job can be hard and stressful at time for it is a night shift on your own with little to no help."
good,"Panera was a fast paced working environment with a high level of business. It provided many challenges and required quick thinking and patience. While employed I learned all aspects of the business including food management, scheduling, and administrative work."
good,My typical day at work is engaging with the customers and helping them pick out items from the menu. I learned how to stock the fridge. The management is OK. The hardest part about the job is dealing with rude customers. The most enjoyable part is eating food for half off.
good,"El ambiente de trabajo muy respetuoso, y positivo."
good,"Worked at Panera for 8 months. It was an overnight job so I would usually begin work at 10 PM and be done at 5 AM. I made 12 dollars per hour, enough to pay my bills but not enough to afford a place to live."
good,People and atmosphere were good. Fast paced and always moving. I learned how to communicate with customers and give the right feedback. Best part was getting 50% off my food.
good,Fun place to work at. Amazing employees and good pay. The hardest part about the job was standing/ moving for long hours at a time. The most enjoyable thing about the job was making the food and the atmosphere.
good,"Panera bread is a very fun place to work, even when it can get stressful. The people that work there are also so kind and you get what you put into it. I enjoy my time there."
good,"not a good salary but flexible hours"
good,The management team is great. They have their own individual job along with the normal job of being a manager and they do an excellent job balancing all that. The GM trusts his managers when he isn't in the store because he knows how how employees with and that the managers follow the guidelines. The crew is always respectful and fun to work with. I try my hardest to stay there even one shift a week because i have so much respect for the staff and they have the same level of respect for me.
good,"You will be tested, but you will find out what you are made of. The company does not offer too much variety as far as career opportunities. Almost all positions funnel into a managerial role over the subordinate positions. Great people for sure! A pleasure to work there."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"do not apply in panera bread distribution in ontario ca, terrible place to work do not give breaks and they are racism with the latin people "
good,Working for the Panera company allowed me to expand my work interactions with coworkers and customers. Some days were more challenging than others but overall the working environment was safe and everyone was very cooperative.
good,"A typical day starts with a list of items that need to be prepped and baked for the day, I learned to enhance my already organized skills. The management team was hands on and pleasant. The workplace culture being conscious of preparing wholesome food for the customers. The most enjoyable part the food was familiarizing myself with all food I prepared."
good,Everyone was pretty nice. They worked around my schedule. A lot of people called off. Very busy during rush hour. Very Clean and Safe place to work. would recommend.
good,"Panera was a quick-paced job, especially on certain days. Many of the coworkers worked together in order to get orders out quickly and accurately. I had to make sandwiches sometimes with certain ingredients left out. Also, I would wash the dishes and make sure working areas were clean and sanitary for customers."
good,"I was a trainer and certified in cash, dining room, barista, and bakery. I worked along with my manager to make sure our store was run properly, whether it was coming into work hours before or staying after to properly clean the store. I created relationships with regular customers and they enjoy their time because of our aim to provide great customer service."
good,"A typical day at Panera is when you would come in and clock in like at any normal job and start working. You would say hello to your co-workers and they would greet you back. Find out where you were working such as the line or drive thru. Start there and work toward the end of the day. It was a fun and cheerful place and everyone had good vibes, well most did that is."
good,I enjoyed my time at Panera I worked there for 4 years. They were well organized and the perks of food discounts and flexible hours were great. Yeah Panera
good,"I really enjoyed the management here, which can obviously make or break a job. The environment is fun and self paced. I really enjoy how clean and safe we are required to keep everything; it shows we really do care about the workers and the customers."
good,"I believe the Panera work environment would be a great place to learn what kind of work ethic you have. Its soups, salads , and sandwiches so its not that difficult but overall it was fast paced fun"
good,Panera bread has a great mission behind their company and provide a organized and structured environment. Although it is fast paced and can be over whelming. I would still recommend others to work here.
good,the food makes it  worth it! It's good and healthy as well as affordable. they pay good and the work isn't that hard . There management plays favorites and there training isn't good. It is however one of the cleanest restaurants I've worked at.
good,"I enjoy my job here. 90% of my shifts are closing shifts, and i'm usually on my own when it comes to my position so sometimes I will be the last person to leave that night, which is a bit frustrating. They do work around my schedule and sometimes I get to pick up extra shifts, which is nice. Overall, this isn't a bad start. I had a rough first few weeks before I felt comfortable. But my co workers are friendly and the job is doable. For being a busy student, I appreciate this."
good,"I have been working with Panera for over 7 years. I typically come in at  5:00 or 5:30 am and setup either the bakery, drive thru or up front line, all the shifts vary. We open at 6 am and the sole focus is on customers at that point. The work overall is not hard at all, if you manage your time wisely, instead of standing around doing nothing. It also helps if your coworkers are willing to help. The menu can be intimidating at first glance, but it won't take long for you to memorize things and become familiar with certain favorites among the customers. You do get free drinks and a big discount on food. The hours are very flexible for all employees. You do get one 30 minute unpaid break per 6 hour shift. Pay isn't the greatest, but don't be afraid to ask for more than what they have listed during the initial interview. Raises are now quarterly, so  that's a big plus. After a year of being employed you will notice that if you work full time on a regular basis you will earn paid time off and it adds up quickly. They also have insurance plans and 401k plans, if interested. Honestly, the hardest part of the job is covering for other employees when they call off, but other than that the job isn't difficult. If interested they will offer advancement, such as shift supervisor, assistant manager, and even general manager. It is fairly easy to move up pretty quickly if you show interest in wanting to advance."
good,you can really have a career as a baker with panera thats cool. they pay well. i would like to see some merging in management like for there to be a kind of field day for associates of all times of day and positions to mingle to fully understand where each person is coming from.for example if all of the bakers went to the fdf fresh dough facility  they might not be so upset to fine an overfilled transport. or a day associate sees how a baker prepares pastries and is therefore less likely to be inclined to drop one once he realizes the work put into each product. i would also like to see managers not having to clopen thats just wrong. and i would like to see the hours for night shifters be adjusted a little. good place to work though.
good,Productive and fun workplace. Great people to work with. Good management and supervisors. Great customer service. Great clean store. Fun environment for the workers
good,I really enjoyed baking for this company. I was able to focus on my work and made pretty decent money. It required a lot of heavy lifting of bread pans and some frozen products.
good,nice place to work. I love the people I work with. I learned a lot of things in the past years. good benefits healthcare and a lot of pto. I very nice environment
