rating,review
bad,Worst place I have every worked. Did not provide sufficient training. understaffed in facilities maintenance and cut throat management. Upper management is horrible as well.
bad,"1st 7years of service extremely pleasant, stressful, but rewarding. Last 1 1/2 extremely unpleasant environment and under different management."
bad,"Working in that office was like going back to high school. All the woman talked about me. Whenever I walked into the back office for anything conversations stopped. A customer came in and verbally harassed me and I was blamed, and I was the one who called for security."
bad,"I loved working with the field marketing managers across 120 malls.  They simply were the best talent to work with as they worked hard to meet customer expectations and generate repeat spending.   I managed full service development and execution requests from the field marketing managers to facilitate an average of 50 live creative projects for B2B marketing, interactive - social media, out of home, digital billboards and animation videos, in store collateral and barricades."
bad,Everybody is scared of the CEO whose behavior and reactions to things are erratic.  He makes decisions despite what those around him recommend.  This leads to a toxic work environment.
bad,"Many years ago, this company was actually known as a great place to work.  A bankruptcy and multiple management changes has made that a thing of the past.  Now morale is at a low, layoffs have become a part of the culture, and stress levels are peaking.  Meanwhile, the company makes changes to its organizational structure, only to revert back to the original organizational structure later, and then back again some time after that.   It's like ping pong and leaves the rank and file scratching their heads.  There's a lot of grumbling in the trenches, that's for sure."
bad,"No longer exists so there's not much point in reviewing it, is there.  But the alg is making me type filler, so that's what I'll do...Perhaps this is enough?  Let's check and see."
bad,"It would be a good place to work if you had the right management that was fair to there employees. Treated them with respect, the most enjoyable part was making friends with the mall employees."
bad,"Its all fake.  They act like they want to be team oriented but they really aren't.  They have some sort of training team, but its  just fake."
bad,"my first year there was mind blowing & fun. our operations group was hard working & productive but after my boss was throne under the bus & force out of the company. buy the time i found out, he was gone. this new operations guy from Texas senior operation manager was like night & day. talk alot of game but, he did not respect the island culture back stab every chance he had to keep his rep. when i saw what kind of person he was, our relationship fell. after i'd showed him all i knew, i became next to be cut out."
bad,the company culture as a whole do not honor a hard-working dedicated employee instead they want someone that's going to kiss butt and allow themselves to be treated any type of way from their employer
bad,They had horrible mangers and very horrible hours. hours were either 8 am - 3 pm or 3 pm - 11 pm Monday- Saturday only Sunday is smallest set of hours you'll get. customers are very rude and they have no respect for your job.
bad,"i was a groundskeeper job varied depending on the time of the year"
bad,Nice place to work though advancement and good pay is hard to come by.  So great for people who do not mind being in the same spot for a long time or in search of stability...
bad,"It seems  to have a high turnaround.  Everyone seems to like working there, but they don't have a great model for measuring performance.  You can do twice the amount of work, at triple the quality of anyone  else, but you might still get sacked because of the tight knit  politics in the office.  Subsequently, you need to make some very high connections to stay employed past your first rookie mistakes.  The IS department seems to be the most disorganized."
bad,"During my time with GGP, I realized that the only thing I'll miss about the job is the pay. "
bad,"At the time I worked at one of GGPs properties, it had just acquired the property. There was a mix of old and new management so that created a tough environment with an us vs. them result. I really can't speak to the corporate culture today as this was more than 15 years ago."
bad,This company was in transition and struggling except for those at the top. Many layoffs and firings during my years there. Just unacceptable behavior for a large corporation.
bad,"General Growth Properties, also known as GGP, owns and operates many mall properties in the United States.  The malls range in size and diversity and house many well known stores."
bad,Lack of respect of personal life and responsibilities therein. Would have not worked there as long if I had been aware of their practices.
bad,For the moment I do enjoy working for this company in the sense that it does provide financial assistance for my family until I can find better employment. The environment is okay in that hardly any problems are encountered during my shift. But I do enjoy the amount of time alloted to be with my family.
good,Your are treated like a slave though the office staff are not required to actually work. Most of the office staff spend their days killing time on Facebook and YouTube.
good,"New management ruined this company.  Through bankruptcy protection and successful emergence, the founding family was booted and new managment cleared house."
good,"Company benefits and salary are comparable apart from that, don't expect much in training or advancement. I was very lucky to have common sense & be super experenced if not the ""no training just do it culture"" i would not have lasted. The sexist and bias situations I experienced and rudeness from bosses is unheard. The arrogance to clients, vendors and the dogmatic attitude was the norm."
good,"This company was great to work with for a while but they changed to an outside company. While working there I was happy to be a part of their growth. Most days was light work for me and short hours to do."
good,Lack of support for field employees. Concern only for C-class and what they can accomplish. Do not listen and assist with employee/employer issues. Disappointed in track they take.
good,Most enjoyable part of job is working with immediate managers as well as co-workers.
good,"There could be improvements in the organization but when I was an employee there was a lot of change to the culture, management and overall environment."
good,Large group of hard working people with a diverse background. Core goals are strong and room for personal growth and development.
good,"Friendly, helpful co-workers.  Good workplace culture.  Casual dress every day.  Lack of mentoring and direction to advance your career.  Upper level supervisors often not available to provide direction with work.  Lack of positive work recognition.  Poor communication of information to relevant parties.  Employees are often overloaded with work."
good,Good company to work at if you want to work in Chicago. The culture is great and many different activities. They allow you to volunteer and get paid for 8 hours per quarter. Lots of young people so it's a good place to start a career in property accounting.
good,"I loved the people I worked with, but it is very hard to advance within the company and to get an acceptable raise/bonus. The CEO does not care about any of his employees."
good,clean up drawings to scale and make sure that they were legible
good,"Heavy workload, poor management, very little training for accountants.  Managers are poorly trained. Processes are constantly changing without thorough debugging."
good,"This was prior to merger with Brookfield.  Passive aggressive culture with a ""boys club"" environment."
good,"I worked at GGP full-time for nearly two years. No problems with GGP as a whole. They are a great company with great benefits."
good,"It can feel like you are working with people from Mean Girls if you aren't in the ""know"". Certain groups back stab. Other groups get away with anything. Favoritism runs high here."
good,"Day to day work was uninspiring, with little empowerment to make local decisions.  Budget was reduced by more than half in the five years that I was in the position.  The marketing department was forced to justify our jobs on a daily basis."
good,"Supervision of five technicians, responsible for daily operations and oversee contractors.  Appraise staff. Train staff for safety.  Oversee HVAC operations."
good,"Managers play favorites are are unnecessarily harsh on those they don't like. Also, people spread rumors about others and HR doesn't step up. VP's see a problem and won't address it."
good,"Your experience will heavily depend on what department you work in. In general, there isn't a lot of growth. If you're early on in your career, that's ok, it's a great name to have on your resume. If you're mid-career it is hit or miss as to whether you will have any opportunities to grow or advance."
good,I enjoy working with the Salesforce software and the leasing reps I work with.  Typical day is a lot of data entry and running reports.  I have worked on budgets for 16 centers and developed spreadsheets to track information.
good,"GGP has a great culture to work in. The 2 years that I have been here going on 3, I have learned so much about the shopping mall industry and so glad to be a part of the GGP team of staff."
good,"Lot of changes, management changes very frequently and it is not a stable work environment"
good,"Organization is constantly changing, very little room to advance"
good,"General Growth Properties, Inc. is an American real estate investment trust, headquartered at 110 North Wacker Drive in Chicago, Illinois, a historic building designed by architectural firm Graham, Anderson, Probst & White. It owns and manages shopping malls throughout the United States."
good,Enjoyed working for this property management. Learned alot from my previous mentor and would like to return working here.
good,Provided office support for 5 leasing representative. Learned many tools to retail leasing. Understanding and providing tenants wants
good,"A typical day at work for me is applying cash, and trying to find out where unapplied cash should be applied. I've learned how to navigate JD edwards, which is an accounting software I've never used. My co-workers and previous manager are fantastic, we help each other out and learn short cuts around the system from one another. Over the past year their have been a lot of changes, which to me is a little unsettling. As of tomorrow, I will have my 3rd manager since i've been there. The hardest part of the job is knowing that more changes are coming, but i don't know if i'll have a job. The most enjoyable are the people."
good,General Growth was very good in allowing their employees to attend training classes.  They offer mentors for their new employees.  Learned to do budgeting and how to report variances.
good,GGP is a great company to work for because they provide a lot of different opportunities. GGP provides a lot of healthy outreach programs to ensure employees are healthy. Small working environment.
good,It's a very productive and fast paced job  which requires you to be physically fit. People  that come to the mall are really  friendly  some even give me tips for cleaning tables.
good,"Typical day at work was Cash deposit applications, review of sales, GL Entries.  I learned how to use various systems, Co-Workers were friendly and helpful.  Hardest part of the job was the commute, most enjoyable part was my co-workers."
good,"I love being an Administrative Assistant/Receptionist. At GGP I interacted  with customers and tenants. I would open the office in the am and close the office at the end of the day. Answered phones, handled customer issues. Accepted and processed rent payments. Ordered supplies for the office. Worked with the Security team, Maintenance and housekeeping team, helping with the support that was needed."
good,"I really enjoy working at GGP, although the Marketing department has constant reorganization. It is somewhat unstable, unfortunately."
good,My team was small and close knit. The upper management respected family life and understood those needs. Building was old so always had alot to do. Enjoyed working here and the experience.
good,"The company provided great benefits, but training was lacking. Typical day included servicing calls and emails from over 1,700 employees from 150 locations all over the united states with a wide variety of tech support issues."
good,"The local mall employees were exemplary. The corporate staff was dirty. So much attitude. Park in no parking zones, carry on affairs in the office, and down right arrogant."
good,"I do like the variety of my job along with the social contact of customers and tenants.  I have been here over 18 years with a few different job titles.  This has been great for learning how to handle people, negotiate deals, and each day is different.  I work with a great team, we all compliment each other. I am just looking for a change.  This job had gotten a bit more physical and that can be challenging."
good,"Asset Management manages projects created by Business Development.  I worked collaboratively with center management, business development and asset management in meeting the design & construction requirements."
good,Worked in the leasing department supporting the sales and growth of the company. I enjoyed the friendly environment and participated in company supported social events that brought employees together as a team.
good,The only reason I left was because I couldn't be promoted because I didn't have a degree. Other than that prior to their BK the benefits and time off were more than fair and the company was a good place to work.
good,"This job has been a very long time ago I must say, so from what I can remember it seemed to have been okay. I worked in the Management Office across from the Security Office. Everyone seemed to get along well and had laughs"
good,Fun place to work and interact with new people every day.  Always something new to do.  Very friendly place.  Gave time off when needed.  Enjoyed my time there.
good,Company has great vision and outperforms competition. Has successfully risen from bankruptcy in 2008. Great properties and primary focus has been to be the leader in the market.
good,"Enjoyable work environment at a company that takes the time to focus on core values and build the culture of the team.  Forward thinking with constant change, good for some and for others it may be a nuisance."
good,I worked here as a short term contract (5 months) but I liked the environment here. Everyone here has a business mind and work together to get the job done. From my short time here I would recommend it.
good,GGP is a good company to work for.  The benefits are wonderful.   I would love the company to invest in me or give me opportunities to advance. I want to know my company wants to invest in my growth as much as I invest my time in doing the best job possible.
good,General Growth Properties is a great company with wonderful people.
good,"I was working at General Growth while working my other full time job."
good,"Great place to work, the schedule is annoying and the management don't listen but a great place other than that. I think there is alot of improvements but they treat you well"
good,"Fast paced, fun and exciting. Great culture, good people. Rewarding."
good,"I went through three General Managers at my location during the 10+ years I was there. One was an absolute horror and made the whole job practically unbearable. The first one GM was good, but the last one was the best, and I do miss working for him. "
good,"Great Culture"
good,GGP was a great place to work but there was always a little uncertainity about how long your job would last.  GGP likes to try new business types which is great but can lead to a lot of reorganizations.
good,"Work load is fairly easy and work life balance is great.  Preach a lot about culture, but does not seem to be changing much."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of assisting the Executives with preparing various financial documentation, along with scheduling meetings, making travel arrangements, preparing expense reports for the team, etc."
good,"Loved working at GGP, though I left the company pre-bankruptcy.  I was given a lot of autonomy and trust to do a great job at all times.  There was a purchase of another company while I worked there and that confused management.  I had 3 bosses in less than 3 years."
good,"Was a great company and more family orientated before the bankruptcy.     now management is out of touch with staff and there is very little loyalty.   Benefits are great, work/life balance is good."
good,"GGP is a great company and I've enjoyed working for them, I'm just curious to see other  opportunities that are available to me. May god bless you and your family"
good,"Responsible for managing and providing aid/ training on quality customer service to mall retail employees in order to increase mall traffic and generate larger sales."
good,"Each day brings on a new adventure. Fun! Fast paced! A great work atmosphere, along with a great team to work with. I have had the opportunity to work in a few of GGP's properties and each are unique in their own way."
good,I enjoy working for GGP. At this time the majority of advancement opportunities are in the Chicago headquarters. In my time here I have learned about balancing multiple projects and coming up with creative solutions.
good,I enjoyed my work. I enjoyed working independently with everyone. The work was challenging and rewarding.  I made lifelong friends. I learned a lot about the property management industry.
good,"A lively organization which provides growth opportunities for professionals that lean in, work hard supporting the enterprise mission."
good,Good company to work for with lots of training and support. Usually work with a very diverse group of people. Good benefits.
good,"Typical day at GGP involves managing a group of people who review and approve design and final drawings, keeping track of each project's current status up to opening, and following up with those tenants / retailers who fall behind schedule... all in attempt to get them open on time and paying rent.  The most satisfyinig part of the position is reporting a large amount of openings that beat schedule and within design parameters."
good,Great company! Possibilities of advancement within the company.
good,Serious environment. Everyone was always busy. I learned to process W-9's. Management could have been better. Culture was fun. I really enjoyed my co workers and their activities. Hardest part was getting let go because of the position being eliminated. I feel there was a place for me to grow. Just needed the change.
good,The company leased commercial space.  I worked with many Leasing Reps and Leasing Managers that caused a small problem because there were not enough assistants.
good,"Great mall in New England"
good,"Realizava a parte administrativa, pagamentos de fornecedores, cotação, controle de estoque, fechamento de agenda mensal de shows, contatos com artistas e produtores, limpeza, atendimento ao cliente."
good,"Good place to work, friendly staff to work with, plenty of overtime to go round, had a lot of fun working for them & building lawnmowers & ride on tractors."
good,Management were fair and knowledgeable. Many perks to the jobs like special outings to celebrate accomplished company goals. The job workload was heavy but doable. Much support in meeting established dead lines.
good,"The world of shopping centers is continually evolving.  It is a demanding business with challenges that has bricks & mortar yet competes with the online world and still is relevant. The company's mission statement is accurate.  Management is demanding yet open to suggestions and not ""stuck in the mud mind-set.""  You are expected to do the best you can, to strive for the highest benchmarks, hit them and keep on going!  You may have periods of time that require some killer hours but as part of a team you pull you part until the job is done.  The best part of the job...is the people."
good,es bueno los los daba cafe pan y el amuerso y teniamos  muy buen traton con los jefes
good,"Handled month-end close duties. This involved account recs, bank recs, journal entries, and review of the general ledger. Also assisted in special projects as needed."
good,The company owned and managed shopping centers and office properties and is based out of Chicago.  This company purchased the Rouse Company in 2004.  They decided to outsource a lot of their work so in 2011 I was being laid off.
good,My job was challenging and fun.  I loved working with the team we had.  I was responsible for the accounting for 2-3 regional shopping centers.
good,Management has grown the company to be competitive in the REIT market.
good,I truly enjoyed working at GGP. I experienced a daily learning process and ethics. I was also blessed with the best managers in my career at GGP.
good,"I enjoy meeting new people, especially from foreign countries."
good,"Starting a new job in a new company has its streses all in itself. As a new employee it is encourgared to make a ""work friend"". This practice was very helpful and made the transition a more pleasant one."
good,I had a challenging and unique position that possibly only a dozen people in the U.S. occupied. It allowed me to travel semi monthly Apr-Oct to perform sales audits of tenants as part of a greater sales audit program which netted +$1.5mil/yr in added revenues for the company.
good,I've never work with a dedicated group of people.  Everybody knows their jobs and the company runs like an uninteruppted machine.  Compensation packages are great.
good,"As a 2.4 million sq/ft retail shopping center with almost another 1 million sq/ft of office space, the Ala Moana Center is a unique property. As such, the requirements to contain such a large operation are equally unique. There is a sense of urgency to the day-to-day and often a hustle to address the demands of the facility, but the management team is remarkably calm, approachable, and positive. They navigate the storm with a sense of confidence and expertise. The general manager and associate general manager maintain an open door policy and treat their team with compassion and respect. They are also very good at sharing their knowledge. As an employee, you really feel as though they care about you as an individual. GGP as a whole is also this way. They are committed to the advancement of their staff. If you are interested in growth, a position with Ala Moana Center is a master class in property management. While the fast-paced environment can get a little overwhelming at times, there is a great support network in place and so much to learn."
good,they do a good job when life happens in allowing you to take care of any issues. Their priorities are in the right place. Only concern is the ability to advance within the company.
good,"ok benefits, no advancement, good work environment.  Be wary of spinoffs--they will happen again in an ever-changing retail landscape especially when they have properties for sale."
good,"Was a great place to work in the Columbia Md regional office.  I was there for 23 years.  Unfortunately, my position relocated to the home office in Chicago, and I did not wish to relocate to Chicago."
good,"During my time at GGP, this was a great place to work with high performing team members and great leadership.  There were opportunities for high level of achievement and reward."
good,"-bueno el día normal de trabajo era ahitado"
good,Good leadership training from a company that is one of the best shopping center owners and management companies.
good,Facing challenges
good,"Employees in Maintenance Department were great, yet the policies of the company changed from when I was there before."
good,Buen hambiente entre compañeros y trabajadores un 7
good,"Enjoyable place to work with a vibrant culture. With ownership of some of the most prestigious malls in the nation (Water Tower Place, Oakbrook, and Hawaii) they are moving forward to a great future."
good,"This has been the best job I've had thus far."
good,Love this job and the company.  They have unbelievable benefits and great place to work.  Totally enjoyable.
good,Manage operations and construction for a one million square foot enclosed shopping center located on 100 landscaped acres.  Ensure that contracted work meets or exceeds shopping center standards.
good,"Project Administration team lead by great leader."
good,Busy work day that included multi-tasking. Worked with a variety of people and cross trained in many departments.
good,General Growth Properties delivers a rare combination of creative conceptualization while providing exceptional customer service.
good,What began as a merger ended up with a lot of changes including a new CEO.
good,Great atmosphere and good culture amongst the workplace. It is a very fast paced position and at time tasks cram together before being able to move on to the next you must assure the step is complete.
good,"Day to day office management. Calendar balancing for Sr GM of mall property. Collections. Note taking, letter writing, follow up GM schedules. Create conf calls for internal and external calls."
good,"The Law/Leasing Department has leased over 1 million square feet of retail space in each of the last two years. The volume of work in the department is high, and varied. Deadlines are often shortened so that deals are processed faster. There are variables related to negotiation with tenants that sometimes complicates the process."
good,Positive work group and environment. Flexible work week hours. Numerous opportunities to increase income. Core group of experienced and positive personalities.
good,"I loved this job for many reasons.  It was a small team and we felt like a family.  Although there was drama sometimes, it was not excessive.  My boss was an open book.  He taught me everything he knew.  I also received tuition reimbursement for my bachelors degree."
good,"A typical day for me would be to create ideas for prospective and existing clients to offer a partnership that would provide awareness to their brand through high-impact marketing via in-mall advertising, event activiation, sponsorship opportunities, and most recently digital media, ultimately developing long-term business relationships resulting in meeting / exceeding financial goals.  Last minute out-of-town travel was always expected so that I could canvass the markets to meet the financial expectations of each of the (9) malls through Alternative Revenue.  I learned that my ability to multi-task utilizing my organizational skills was key in doing my job well while managing client expectations and working closely and well with internal departments.  I can't say that I really thought there was anything hard, so to speak, about my job, but would rather position that question as maybe a challenge would be when each of us as a sales team were given a stretch goal towards the end of the year, in order to meet a financial goal as a whole, but I always accomplished that task, or exceeded the goal.  The most enjoyable part of my job was working closely with my new and existing clients and building relationships with them, which many times resulted in long-term multi-million dollar contracts."
good,"From running fashion events to updating social media pages to networking with all the retailers, this job changed from to day. My co-workers were very uplifting and go getters, which helped to get things done and on time."
good,"On a typical work day at Mayfair's Management Office, it is normal to greet and be greeted by co-workers. The kitchen is a frequent meeting area; located in the back of the office across from the Accounting Department. Our accounting team was the largest department in our underground office, with 4 co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job, was tied between the satisfaction of resolving an outstanding tenant account and experiencing the comraderie amongst the team. Our General Manager enjoyed teasing fellow team members, thus maintaining a light, infectious mood. The accounting department is typically quiet except for the occasional laughter due to a joke or comical experience. Thus, our accounting department rarely experienced a dull, monotonous day."
good,"My time with General Growth Properties was well spent , but short lived as Maintenance was contracted out. I meet alot of good people that  worked for GGP. And will remember all of them . Some of them are still there and others have moved on . God Bless all the ones i had the privilege to meet ."
good,"Great Company when I worked there "
good,"Great for self-reliant or driven individuals. Never and end to the work but always keeps you on your toes and is great if you can keep up with it. I learned quite a bit about the legal issues of maintaining retail spaces. Management was par for the course and my co-workers a hole in one. Great people working here. Hardest part was where I would be called to fix something I had never touched before but would figure it out like a puzzle. This job requires a lot of imagination and attention to detail. However, if these are things you excel at then it is what makes the job so enjoyable."
good,"As a leasing rep for two Regional indoor mall properties, I have the pleasure of working in a multi-cultural environment. "
good,Good management and leadership.  Strong foundation of educating and involving local management in long term planning.
good,"*Greet my co-workers, break the ice of being @ work. Juggling work, helping various departments stay ahead."
good,I enjoyed my job very much. Sadly the CEO decided to cut back drastically in Marketing. I had to move on and decided to make the move before my position was eliminated.
good,"It was a good place to work, and the work was pretty mundane and easy. The staff and management was pleasant to work with and made working there easier at times."
good,"Great place to work.  I learned a great deal working with Representatives,  preparing leases, attending Board meetings.  Speaking with clients.  Day to day activities."
good,"its really a no brainer just  scrubbing floors on for night shift"
good,"The whole company does practice the principles of HADTO. "
good,"everyone is friendly"
good,Great internship program. Well organized internship that gave a great well rounded experience. Interns learned a lot over the summer and were able to gain great insight into mall REITs.
good,This organization is a firm that exemplifies IT supporting the business and utilizing technology efficiently and effectively to further the focus and vision of their business.
good,Started as an Administrative Assistant and learned the skills to promote to an Associate Mall Accountant when General Growth took over the management of multiple properties
good,"Completed A/P, A/R, collections, sales reporting and training incoming staff. General Growth gave me the opportunity to promote and excel in every position."
good,"Loved working for GGP, cash applications, working with mall properties and the other workers.  Great atmosphere to work in, great location as well.  If not for relocating would have loved to stay."
good,great job. i was a GSA  for the entire mall. we did gift wrapping and gave direction to stores in the property. I reallt enoyed working for the company
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was keeping busy while typing answering the phone on the third ring, keeping papers filed, making photocopies, and preparing mail and FedEx's and UPS boxes at the end of the day.  The job was always busy."
good,I have referred a few friends to work for the company and regularly recommend it to connections on LinkedIn.  Any time I see a job posting for GGP on LinkedIn I share it and comment.
good,I would love to work with General Growth Properties again they had good management and the co-workers were all hands on.  Everyone was always helping others.  Great team work!
good,"At General Growth at Laurel Mall I began as a receptionist. I was then promoted as a Customer Service Manager and Accountant Assistant.  I enjoyed meeting the mall customers and working with the tenants. I facilitated and aided in promoting mall marketing and promotional events. I worked intently as the AR/AP clerk and provided monthly income reports and spreadsheets. Working with the tenants, I collected and deposited daily income. I submitted payroll. This was a great place to work. There was never a dull moment."
good,"La cercania de los jefes a sus trabajadores,el buen trato, el compañerismo."
good,"I worked under the marketing manager part time while attending high school.  I was able to make brochures for the marketing manager that were used for events that were held at the Montclair Plaza.  I worked after school every day until the Montclair Plaza closed at 9:00, as they needed someone in the office until closing.  I answered phones for the marketing manager and worked the switchboard for security after hours.  I was the means of communication between the stores and the marketing manager whenever there were events to plan for."
good,GGP is a great company which has an amazing culture of teamwork which is embodied throughout the organization. Every associates is truly focused on driving the company in a positive direction.
good,Excellent place to work.  Walk around the shopping mall to check tenants and foot traffic.  Team work is excellent.   Hardest part of the job is that sometimes we need to deal with difficult tenants.
good,"Enjoyed leasing major malls for many years.  In more recent years, I worked out of my home in Kaufman.  I received many awards for leasing and was the best leasing agent of the year twice.  Got along well with fellow workers.  In previous years, I was director of leasing for three major shopping center companies.  Oversaw their work and motivated the leasing agents to perform."
good,"I learned a lot from working at General Growth Properties. I was responsible for doing the accounting for a large Mall in New Jersey , and my job was a challenge but I loved it."
good,"Overall a fun, exciting place to work with great team work and leaders"
good,I loved it it was fun. It paid the bills it was downtown. It had people there.  It paid me money
good,Received and processed all travel vouchers for 150 malls and employees for the Corporate office.  Code all travel and expenses to get all employees paid in a timely fashion. I took what was a normal six week turn around for expense checks to be paid and got it down to two weeks.  I also reviewed the American Express Credit Card report every month to get it paid in a timely fashion.
good,"I love working here but looking for more challenging role. The company is constantly growing and getting better by every passing day. But in my case, I feel like I am not getting any challenges and I do not see any potential to grow. Also, commute to downtown is taking its toll on me so I have decided to look outside the company and hopefully find something more challenging and in the Chicago northwest suburbia."
good,"My co-workers are very friendly and understanding. My typical day at work is that I plan my day according to the assignments given to me by my supervisor. I follow through the tasks that are needed to be done that day, as well as anything that my supervisor asks me to do. I have good time management. I complete my task in a timely manner. By the end of the day, I make up a to-do list for tomorrow, check-in with my supervisor and tidy up my mess."
good,"It is a great place to work. I would recommend it to anyone. Standard hours, management is helpful, co-workers are excellent."
good,Amazing company to work for.  Had great resources and support.
good,"Excellent management, training opportunities, challenging tasks were the most enjoyable and rewarding."
good,"GGP is a striving company to work for, with many opportunities for advancement and wonderful supervisors to work for and many co-workers who are always available when assistance is needed."
