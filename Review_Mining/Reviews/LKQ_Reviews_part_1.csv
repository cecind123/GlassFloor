bad,Management is out to get their employees rather than uplifting and encouraging them. Poor pay and absolutely no room for growth. Management is lacking serious integrity and basic work ethics.
bad,"low pay brings in wrong people, promotes people with out training.people constantly missing work with departments not fully staffed. core group of around 15 people that have been there in the 3 years i have worked there out of 100 + employees"
bad,They are not very organized and they make up rules as they go. They have now moved to commission based pay and they work to do is to much for what they are offering
bad,"Upper mgnt doesn’t work, they just believe in some fairy tail of a past like they once had. welcome to corporate cool aid drinking. If upper mgnt had a clue it maybe the most successful junk sale on earth"
bad,no communication no help when needed the managers are out to get you constantly if your not moving your wrong managements really screwed up there I did not enjoy my time working there
bad,Management is horrible. Nobody knew their jobs and everyone was everywhere doing everything. No actually set job duties and expected to do 3 people's jobs and not get paid for doing that. No appreciation at this place Omaha Ne Location at least. Operated by a druggie and when doesn't have his dose starts firing everyone.
bad,"Was fired, because I was African American. They didn't want to pay me when I was eligible for a raise. I work for lkq for three years. I got wrote up just to lose my job"
bad,"My experience with this company after working for them for two years was the worst. I get injured the process was  slow and at the end I did not get any help.  Management was never in the same page, one supervisor said something the other one something else, employees were always confuse."
bad,"Don't waste your time. Management is awful, the regional sales manager is a moron. No quality control in their products. And blame reps for everything going wrong even when its not their fault."
bad,"I worked at the Exeter, pa location as a level 2 tech and all they care about is the service desk call q. They would drop me in the call q at a whim and never have time to do my L2 tickets. Management is Terrible and no promotions offered."
bad,I am really disappointed with the way this company is managing the associate's and everything is disorganized. This is the main reason the company has a high turnover rate.
bad,"Warehouse was in horrible shape."
bad,"Transitioned to sales rep was promised a $2 raise. After 4 months I reviewed my pay stub and noticed I had only been given a $1 raise. When I brought this to their attention they would not let me contest it. Also was informed they had been paying me incorrect for 4 months and that I owed the company $11,000. After working her for 3 years I was astounded at my treatment. WOULD NOT TECOMMEND TO ANYONE."
bad,"Management sucks."
bad,"I was told I would be getting my own accounts after "
bad,"Wasted 5 years working here. No advancement. Love the job, customers! Don't want to go to work anymore.  Dreadful environment.  Only Managers and Accounting recieve Bonuses. Thats why they push you every day. What a disappointment.  Learned my lesson. Moving on to a better Company!"
bad,"Poor manangment."
bad,"Worst job in the world, management sucks and if you don’t have personal relationships with them it’s a problem or you’re a target. Working conditions a horrible!"
bad,Working here has its perks. But working here also drains you of your positivity and drive. If you love being micromanaged and having NO control over your actual job then this is the place to work. They say we go through workers like crazy and we need to find people with a drive to work here. When it's not the people it's the management. If they would let go of the manager
bad,It was a very slow job and the management was awful. The management has no care. The management played favorites. The employees were so mean to each other.
bad,Not enough money not enough safety  to much work for the pay. Manager doesn't care about you employee's not friendly at all. They do not give raises. That's not good
bad,Too many employee cliques. Everything there is political. You got to fit in where you get in. Half the employees are drunks or drug attics. If you are a decent person do not work there.
bad,"Horrible place to work. Managers treat you awfully and you get lied to all the time."
bad,"Stroke your boss’s ego and you might get supervisor! Don’t forget to always throw your coworkers under the bus since remember it’s not your fault as long as you point the finger. No real benefits, job pretty much cost me my marriage and not one manager no matter how persistent you are and ask for advancement they would rather you quit since you don’t fit their clique."
bad,"it’s a cool temp job if you don’t plan staying long "
bad,Poor management and leadership left you stressed an miserable behind a five line phone constantly ringing with no real guidance or development.  Outdated systems and no SOP to facilitate issues or concerns left me with constantly chasing my own tail. Total chaos and madness.
bad,Lkq in Lakewood is a corrupt company and do not care about their employees. Warehouse management will harass you insult you so just think do you want to work for this horrible company
bad,"Abusive Bosses not paid attention when you had a emergency in your family they don't care about .If got sick they don't give a break  to  resolve the problem, especially when you ask  for a day off for appointment"
bad,"Yard 383 the ernies salvage yard in martinsburg is a big joke they take all ur money including no overtime. No bounus, no pto and then mess with your regular hours. When asked about this or if you report it its not their fault its someone elses and never gets fixed multiple people have this issue. Now When they call u in the office for something trivial they have thrown pens and papper at us. And have talked down on our families and home life they try to tell us jow to run our life and tell us tgat the job is more important then haveing a place to sleep next day and more important then. Your kids getting to school. Now me and about four others have come close to putting themthrew the wall. When you call them out on what they said or did they call you a liar they are like 5 year olds hate being wrong. My dog has more respect. A cocroach cares more about people then the morons at yard 383. Come join us at the beautiful and wonderful scrap yard. Oh and if you like paying 3x times as much for parts then other places wellhere u go come on down."
bad,Horrible place to work very low pay raise. Inexperienced night shift lead. the bathroom stay dirty the lunch room is dirty to  you can find a much better place then LKQ ILL NEVER GO BACK
bad,"Going to work not wanting to be there, but must pay your bills."
bad,working at lqk   have allfull bosses play favorites  and discriminating against other. let other employes assault you a they blame you. I cant and wont work a place that blames the guy how got assaulted that a horrible company.
bad,i never worked at a place where employees would be new everyday.parts were always damaged.the manager didnt really care for you it was all about numbers.your forced 2 do 2 routes and they expect you to fly from delivery to delivery.
bad,Slave drivers. Don't waste your time you won't make anything and they change the rules daily without telling anyone. They won't fix pay issues and have favoritism with a select few employees. Don't expect heat inside in the winter either half the time it don't work.
bad,"Starting with the top Saint P and his incredibly sales minors, down to his female HR department who just fallow their male counterparts is a joke!"
bad,"Time for a review from last year 2018 ex staff, (van/warehouse),glad I left best day of my life :)."
bad,"Lazy managment, low wages, careless employees, hazardous conditions.  "
bad,"The ceo and management walk all over the workers, If you  speak up, you are fired. "
bad,the commission rate was so low and others could and did steal your sales and management did not care the place sucks do not wast your time. Management is horrible and the customer service is horrible they do not care about their customers at all.
bad,Management sucks They overwork you for Low pay they always giving people the run around with the parts and over tax on the parts that you get also them new parts are cheaper then a use parts
bad,Dans fond ter un soldat qui cour cour cour pour un salaire de creve faim
bad,"All they do is yell at you,nag,criticize, and put you down and the managers are so disrespectful most employees quit because of that they cut back on overtime and they always move the times up"
bad,"Yeah you just have to be pushy to get a position you want, open your mouth if you dont wanna buff, place still sucks, dont be a sand blaster, OT is a must"
bad,The location I worked at was purchased by LKQ several years ago and had previous employees with bad habits. Poor upper management. Very low pay scale. I worked in outside car buying with no incentives or training.
bad,The stars speak for themselves. Very poor management and racism. Human resources is friends with the managers and takes their sides when you try to file a complaint.
bad,"If you enjoy working 50+ hours a week, then read no further.  Working 50-60 hrs per week, delivering the wrong or broken parts to customers. Management is clueless.  The warehouse is filthy, and unorganized."
bad,"This job has horrible communication your over worked and over looked by guys who are friends there is no advancement no raises or opportunity to grow with this company you have 25-30 stops to make with and overloaded truck to the point you cant secure you load and you are still accountable for damages and missing stops you have 6 or more mechanicals (engines,transmissions) and still must make a way to pick more up with an loaded truck this is also an blame the driver company even if they know you have sales,dipatch,supervisors,and also upper management giving orders which can be confusing during deliveries overall this is a place to get by while you look for a job you can really gain success and grow with this also is a company who give raises due to who they like not how hard they work people call off you get stuck woth their route plus yours and no one will appreciate the effort you put in for that day or even acknowledge what you did raises are 10 to 30 cent max some people didnt get one at all hopefully you will be the chosen one and receive one i give it 10 thumbs down!!!"
bad,I worked at LKQ for a couple of months the management was awful doesnt care about their employees always trying to pass the buck down onto the little guys if the messed up something upstairs which makes the employees cut throat nobody is willing to help each other out and they are ready to sell each other out in a heart beat also they pay biweekly which isn't bad the bad thing is in my time working with this company I was never able to get 80 hours on my pay check and when I brought it up to management  I was basically told tough luck
bad,"I worked there 9 yrs,Really liked my job.New management came in and changed everything.No raises,more work and changed everyones attitude.my job was elimated and had to take pt-time or nothing.I was given 1hr to deciede.Im still there pt-time but need something closer.working there pt-time just dont pay the bills."
bad,One of the most stressful environments you can work in. Bad management. Huge turnover. Been here almost a year and can't even count how many different people I've worked with. Parts always going missing or are damaged. Everybody lacks training. Corporate involvement is a joke. Would not recommend this place to anybody. You can work 100 hours plus in a two week pay period and still be told you're not doing enough.
bad,"Awful, straight commission rate in cut throat, dishonest business.   Management was equally awful and dishonest."
bad,Completely unprofessional company none of the High Reps or managers know how to run the department there in charge of it's just another buddy system where the bosses hire their friends and treat their employees like garbage if you do not agree with the way you are treated you'll be told you can quit or they were look for whatever they can to fire you
bad,"Horrible moral, no feedback or encouragement from management unless mistakes are made. Management has bad attitudes towards the drivers and most of all no respect. Old school mentality and family run, extremely unprofessional. Management also will not hesitate to throw ppl under the bus or lie straight to your face intentionally. Seems like a legit company from the outside but this is not the case, unfortunately."
bad,"The job would actually be enjoyable if the management were worth more than squat.  No direction, leadership, incentive, raises. Nothing. The end. Do not recommend."
bad,"The GM has no people skills, he doesn't communicate well at all, very sarcastic and rude. The turn-over at this location is becoming more realistic. No growth opportunities, your work goes unnoticed, you cannot move up at all, literally sweat shop work. It takes strong leadership to lead and build a company and this company lacks alot of that. Corporate and employees are all for self, no training. If issues arise and you email management before hand numerous times it's only when the customer calls then maybe it will be resolved, work at your own risk. Strickly a pay check. No yearly raise as promised in interview, if you work there 5 years you might get .30 cent raise."
bad,"Long tedious hours,  little compensation for those hours.  ""good ole boy"" mindset.  One or two sales people will make decent money,  but everybody else will be below poverty income.  Managers make great money,  but there is no trickle down.  If you are a good employee,  the more you do,  the more you may do.  Never any thanks or positive reinforcement, but mess up and you are called in to be berated.  Thank goodness I no longer work there.  It was the longest few years of my life.  Have never been so happy to know I no longer had to go to that horrible  job!"
bad,Horrible place to work and horrible people to work with. Everyone comes in intoxicated crashing into thing and nothing is done about it. Managment belittles you and treats you like youre an outcast along with the crew members.
bad,Not a very good place to work at all . Very long hours with poor pay and management. Upper management doesnt seem to care about employees or customers at all
bad,I wake up and thank God every morning I left this place.    Management is sorely lacking.  Driver came in smelling of booze most days yet nothing was done about it.  Bi-polar woman in warehouse is never let go due to management being fearful. Unless your house is about to be foreclosed on.....stay far away from this place
bad,this place is terrible no team work and way under paid to put up with all the bs that goes on here. can never ask for pto day because we r way under staff and none of the workers have any experience
bad,"Company is ran by unexperienced and rude managers who operate on a duoble standard. Employees act just as rude. Too much street like attitudes, very unprofessional  ."
bad,"Terrible management"
bad,"Took a pay cut to work here, because Sales manager & Plant manager boast about making 6 figures, great work environment, Fortune 500 company. But, this work place is hostile. Commission reps, take your head off if you try to take care of their customers, on their days off. Everyone is for themselves. Every employee makes the company over 50k a month, but they don't even make 10% of what they make the company. Call system is jacked up, calls come from all over the world. DON'T WORK FOR THIS COMPANY, IT'S A DEAD END JOB."
bad,Hires family members to work for the company and in turn favors them over other employees.  Culture of nepotism abounds here with little chance for advancement
bad,Manager is always on your back. Down talk you because he thinks he's better than you. Expects you to run when he says so. Except you not to take any breaks.
bad,"Tough place to work. Very disorganized company. Not customer oriented, consistent shift in management. I dont know anyone who has enjoyed working for this company. Prison work environment!"
bad,"""optional"" friday overtimes are actually mandatory and if you don't work you are pretty much fired.  Not worth it at all especially with terrible benefits, attendance policy, work environment, and absolutely no chance of advancement."
bad,"LKQ typically tries to keep you in a box. They don't like to have people advance and a lot of the progression bookmarks you would like to know they keep in the dark. I worked there for 6 months and was never told how you accumulate PTO or if I'm not mistaken you have to work there a year to receive 5 days of vacation. I may be wrong because no one ever gave me clarity on that. And I became sick and the manager asked me while I'm in the hospital, ""when are you coming back in"" not a get well or nothing. I wouldn't recommend that job to anyone."
bad,Micromanaged..Work is very repetitive and gets boring fast! If you don't kiss managements you know what your days will be numbered. Lots of fake people.
bad,Raises and comission was promised many times. but was never given. LKQ breached a FMLA contract after two days. MAnagement was swapped over 4 times during one year. You are never supported by management.
bad,Is not a fair place to work if you're not in a management clique. Also they treat their employees unfair and cheat you out your hours that you work they change your time they really need to close the place down
bad,Not worth your time or effort. They will work you to the bone and not even care one bit. Once you start making some good money they change the pay structure and you make less money.
bad,"The management team lies every chance they get. They want you to work 15 hour of work in a 9 hour shift. They don't care if you get hurt. They do NOT have workman comp. They will lie to get out of paying the bill. "
bad,"Every morning starts at 5:30 am. Drivers come in and verify car parts to be loaded on truck and load the truck. Car parts include anything as small as a fog lamp or window trim to large drivetrain parts such as engines, transmissions, or front and rear axles, and you are given a fifth wheel puller (that is a metal hook about 3 feet long with a handle on one end for those who don't know) to move these parts off your truck throughout the day. Management consistently runs around with no clue of what to do, and if a driver calls in to work you are very likely to get your workload doubled for that day if you come in and show that you are good at what you do, because management has no backup plan to help fill in the holes that are made when a driver calls on or quits (which happens a lot, terrible turnover rate). Nobody wants to stay here to work, very negative environment and no room for moving up. You come in at $12/hr and you will leave at 12/hr. Veteran drivers, who have been there for 5 plus years (there aren't very many of those) are still making the same as when they started. Plus you earn PTO time, that means if you get sick and need to call in just once or twice in a 1 year period then there is no such thing as a week long paid vacation for you, because they take that time you were off and take it out of your vacation. This place may be great for some people but I for one would like to do something with myself and no feel shafted every day at work."
bad,"LKQ Corporation is an extremely poorly manged, poorly run, company. They treat both their customers and employees like total garbage, and are of little consideration to the company."
bad,Expects to much from employees. Treats their customers like they should only buy their products no matter what the cost.
bad,"day shift managers treat you like something on your shoe"
bad,very time consuming and no organization the employees under paid and made to things they did not originally apply for would recommend for  young single guys
bad,They start you out on a hourly wage then after your 90 dys they put you on this commission program that suspose to make you more money but in general your maken the same amount as if you were on hourly. They put you on a route and they dnt tell you whts really going on the ideal as a driver is for you to deliver part s to cust then the cust turn around a day later makes u pick up the same part u delivered and now u have to take a hit on your commission so u end up not making alot of money because of that my word of advice dnt work for lkq its by far the worst company ive work for no raised after ur ninety dys n the manager only think about themselves and they dnt care about there employees.
bad,"Assist co workers on standard day to day tasks with their positions."
bad,Deliver replacement car parts to body shops all over New Jersey. Responsible for handling large amounts of money tendered. Responsible for the company vehicle. Interact with staff and customers on a daily basis
bad,This is a small company too big for its shoes. It has promoted based on amount of time worked there rather than merit. 
bad,"Management for inside sales is very unstable. The manager himself at the Renton, Wa office has a very difficult time with communication issues. They bring you in feed lies and out the door."
bad,Management is all about themselves...they do not care about their employees...they will act like it is all about team work but there is no such thing as team work at this location worst company I have ever worked for in my life....it's all about the management getting their bonus...and the employees get the shaft
bad,For the three months that i Worked At LkQ they had no safety and no way of moving up the lader. Each Day Management was confused on what they wanted there employees to do.
bad,"Commission only salary with no base selling used auto parts that are pulled and delivered by minimum-waged yard workers and delivery personel that do not care if the product arrives damaged, meaning: when the parts arrived to customer damaged it comes out of your end even though you have no control over it. Absolutely no quality control and the products are over-priced so you can't compete with competing salvage yards. You're also constantly having to compete with other salesmen and having to make sure they don't steal your sales. Anytime you get a phone call for a potential sale you have to check their account to make sure they don't have a dedicated salesman and if they do you have to ""pass the call"" to them. In my opinion, this is the absolute worst job I've ever had - I would flip burgers in McDonalds than work there again"
bad,Very poor management and no leadership what's so ever. They stay focus on the people that have been there for 10 years plus. Turn over was  like the weather.
bad,"The pay is no good ,,,and the boss in Lubbock don't care about you ,,they drop our pay right before the holidays and then he laughed about it ,,all they care about is you being there slaves,,,."
bad,The pay is only 14/hr for driver.. you could work 10+ hours daily. They aren’t very fond of African Americans. They will lie on you to make the company look good. They will not stand behind their employees.
bad,They make promises about job advancements and regular wage increases but don’t follow through and the company is the worst company I have ever worked for. Management is totally clueless and over paid and the more you do for them the more they expect
bad,Terrible place to work along with the management. They were never understanding about  problems you may had on your route. They expected you to do thing that was impossible.
bad,Awful place to work . Driver do all the paperwork for accounting.. ppl in accounting is very lazy ...........  that’s all I have to say about this awfully place of business
bad,HArcellement psychologique au boutte fait toi pas mal car tu va vivre l enfer  ressources humaines pas là pour t aider une belle gang d hypocrite te flatte dans le dos et quand tu te tourne c'est un coup de bat de baseball en gang  toujours a faire des commentaires non constructif les personnes qui ont un poste clef abuse de leurs pouvoirs et Power trip accoté.ils te mettent a terre pour que tu abandonne et ensuite continue à te pourrir la vie. Veulent avoir l air de ce qu'ils seront jamais.va travailler au ciné parc c'est mieux que la succursale de sainte Sophie.
bad,"I was replaced by someone at half my salary that did not have the skills or experience to do the job. Incompetent Regional and local management. The management focus is to work the employees as hard as possible and give them as little as possible, including respect. At one point all pay raises were eliminated for seven years in order to increase profits."
bad,"Temp to hire and it was great. Was fun, all the overtime you could want, but as soon as I accepted a permanent position, everything changed. No more overtime, 4 direct bosses over you who did not communicate with each other. I got fired more than once for taking a day off that they lost the paperwork for, or called and said i was late for car trouble but that boss didnt tell the other 3. No pay increases... ever. Tell me how valuable I am, and speak of total job security, and 2 days later, we gotta let you go. Terminations started March 1st when they shut down the Q1 department, and by May, two thirds of the employees were terminated, and filled with temps and day laborers. If you work there, you're not even a number."
bad,"Well, I'm not sure where to start. Compensation got 2 stars only because they are competitive with pay, but they offer no salary increases and benefits are good. I worked for a micromanager so was not allowed to make my job my own. I also had to put up with constant complaining about other employees until the plant manager got tired of listening and fired him or her. As for the plant manager, he doesn't do anything but what his office manager says. All staff walk on eggshells around her because they know once she starts complaining about you,you are gone. They are going to a new process eliminating the functions of my job eventually. They decided to terminate me early. I had taken time off (which they made me use PTO even though I hadn't earned it yet so now I owe them $$) to get teeth pulled and in have no top teeth. Have an appointment in two weeks to get dentures. They wouldn't give me two more weeks, so now I have no insurance and no income to get the dentures. If the management is not worthless because they don't know their jobs, this really makes them worthless. I had a good performance review (not sure why I had one anyways, they don't give raises). I now have to interview for a new job with no top teeth. Awesome. The fact that they couldn't keep me until I got my dentures really shows what kind of people are running the show. Also when they told me they were eliminating my job, the conversation was full of hostility and the slanty-eye look the office manager gives when she disproves of you or something you did. The office manager felt the need to control every aspect:"
bad,"I currently work at the Santa Fe Springs loctaion(LakeNor)."
bad,"Incompetent management at Lakewood NJ location. They blame everything on the drivers, including sales numbers being down, which has nothing to do with drivers. Do not work here!"
bad,"Upper level management is entirely clueless. Run like a good old boy network, advancement is based not on what you know, but by who you know. It’s a multi-billion dollar Fortune 500 company yet middle management is filled with hopelessly inadequate people. The company could be so much better."
bad,"not worth $15 an hour to dismantle a car,  if you work at here expect to be working with drunks and pot heads.  Office people have an attitude problem , they are unprofessional about talking to their employees.  they celebrate your birthday and give you a cake , thats the most they care thats it.  raises are not worth staying here. bust your balls and only get cents for a raise, no room for advancement.  to many chiefs and not enough indians  the worst place I have ever work cant believe I wasted 1 year of my life there."
bad,"the company is not concerned about the employees needs there more focused on the customers, company doesn’t care if you have to take care of your kids when there sick."
bad,Horrible management. No advancement. Compensation is horrible and will always been thrown in your face if you make more than your manager.  Will not pay middle management enough to get good managers to teach new employees to continue good work ethic wich leads to badly trained employee and horrible decision making. Management doesn’t listen to any concerns. My way or highway mentality. Company as a whole is more concerned with stocks than wit those who make the money happen.  Company has forgotten its roots. Company fights with itself internally instead of coming together and working together. When it buys a new company it doesn’t actually take it over it puts those people in charge and lets them make horrible decisions till they get fired. Horrible business plan when it comes to buying new companies and how to take over. Moral is horrible in every location no unity.
bad,"They have there favorites that make them more money,but they also hand them customers so they can make that money.They have everyone on a different pay scale.If you started out hourly,they will take you off and make you commission only @ a low percentage,but yet they have other people on high percentage commission.NOT a  fair place to work at."
bad,The worst management known to the planet. Zero room for advancement. Job is a joke. Can not complain enough about how poorly management attempts to operate this company. They force good workers out by not treating them decent AT ALL.
bad,"Very unorganized would not reccomended to my worst enemy to work here, poor mgt very cut throat with isr's Poor Mgt no training and road net is joke not good"
bad,"I would not work there again. I was injured twice on the job. Reported immediately to supervisor and treating my injury was not a priority. "
bad,"Employee harassment is a common problem hidden by management with poor directional ability. Human Resources is a nightmare in this company, that passes off responsibility to those who simply don't have time to care about employees or their safety."
bad,By far the worst place I have work at you get reprimanded if you go above your job mangment lol mangment that's a joke I worked in Wayland mi for 7mos everyone there has a knife and it don't matter who it is they all have it in everyone else's back starting out is $9.50 wow  right the only way to make it is putting junk yard gas in your car or truck and mangment gives that our like crazy oh but make sure you run your a** off and fix the sales floor an clean up when the big boss comes in bc your plant manger will play sick and hid at home tell he leaves oh I could go on an on go head an apply you will see it all corruption drunks druggies laziness ect ect
bad,I am expected to do a management's job at an internship pay. They do not appreciate their employees and think that everyone is replaceable. I would not recommend this company to anyone.
bad,"Warehouse atmosphere, management lacked in true and loyal leadership skills."
bad,"Employees unload semi-truck trailers filled with car bumpers, radiators and other vehicle parts by hand. They are packed tight front to back and top to bottom. "
bad,When i first started in this bisiness with the original company ( keystone auto) it was a great job with advancement and great culture. It all went downhill when lkq bought keystone out and since then the job sucks.  Lkq doesnt pay good and works their employees to death .
bad,BeforeI was hired at LKQ I informed my supervisor that I was only able to work 10 hours a day do to my sleeping disorder 5 months of working where how was doing inventory on November 11th and after 10 hours of work I informed my boss that I had to leave we argued about it and I ended up leaving I was then fired for insubordination
bad,"worset company ever i relocated and told then gm when i would be there and they refused to do it til i got there and i told the gm i would be there no later then that date and i messaged the gm and he was out of the office for 3 days and i replyed to him again and they filled that postion so they didnt pay for relocation fees or anything n now i am without a job and living day to day out of a hotel with my wife and etc because of this.....not to mention they work you to death and expect everything to be "
bad,supervisor and general manager dont know how communicate . The employees that work in returns gossip and stir up stuff like highschool women. No raises
bad,"Worked at LKQ Redding for 4 years and held multiple positions, most of my time was spent operating a forklift or dismantling. Day to day life at work involved: nepotism, favoritism, very very poor management in general, a confusing and very shady pay scale applied by rude, vindictive payroll/H.R. staff, no consequences for negative actions, even less reward for hard work."
bad,Run away. Awful place stay away.  Nepotism is at its best Poor management that steal sales from associates. The Hr is a joke. No one can help if you have problems with management or hr.
bad,All management is related so no room for advancement and no one to complain to supervisor always would say he would fire us before he gets fired what away to make you wanna stay always got threatened to be fired because there is a line of workers waiting to get hired over 30 drivers quit or were fired in less than 1 year.
bad,"as a delivery driver you are suspected to do two runs each day. some times dispatch forgets you are an hour away and will still get someone to come to you to transfer even after 3pm when you are trying to call it quits. plenty of over time here. its a 6am to 8pm job some times and sometimes its earlier days."
bad,Management had no idea what they were doing and always talked about other employees behind their backs. Pay was also horrible with the amount of manual labor that had to be done.
bad,"Can not keep people & tell people they get raise if they stay when,you,say you going to leave but never see raise!"
bad,"Work hard with minimum safety, no place to go and no pay raises. If u want a career job dont waste your time here. They also hire alot of temp workers you have to deal with, so he prepared to work with folks who dont care and wont listen to you."
bad,"The GM in Toledo/Perrysburg is the worst boss I've had in my life. The job and other employee's are great. You just have to put up with a miserable alcoholic boss who does everything he can every day to make everyone else miserable. All because he'd rather complain from his couch rather than come in to work and do something himself. This is the opinion of everyone who works there. I've heard it from everyone 100 times over. Run while you still can if you're considering working there. Oh, and the pay is horrible, and doesn't get better even if you excel at your job."
bad,"Don't work here. You will not get trained, in the slightest. The management claims they are always there to help you out, but 9 times out of 10 they are MIA or too busy to help. My managers exact words to me before I was put at the front desk was, ""Just wing it."""
bad,Sales managers are backstabbers. The HR person is having a relationship with a married man. Sales people steal sales from each other. The corporate office should really dig into someof the sweetheart deals some of the reps are giving to shops.
bad,Overworked and underpaid. They do not promote from within. They do not give yearly performance reviews or raises. Benefits offered were expensive and not great. Took forever to accumulate PTO. Management was terrible. Don’t waste your time.
bad,"If you enjoy being belittled and screwed on money welcome to ur new job. The managment is some halfwits pulled off street and enjoy there early leaving due to (mental breaks). If your struggling at home or have severe health problem forget about it LKQ owns you, you better show up or your fired NO EXCEPTION unless ur. A manager.  I would rather go back to fast food where they pay more then this place and. Fast food is no where near as stressful as this yard 383 in martinsburg wv.  Ill recap if you enjoy being putdown and owned. And never knowing what time your getting off plz come join at yard 383. Oh and if its a blizzard with 10 foot of snow owell we'll see you at work. If your yard car keeps breaking doen or cant make it over a pebble to bad. Start walking. Ill cut this short because i can go on. Wellcome to the most political,corupt, damaged job i have ever been to and if you think im kidding ask the rest of 383s coworkers."
bad,Don’t every work here this job is pathetic these ppl play with your money and also is very poor management . These ppl make rules up everyday with corporate approval. Also is you have a problem it’s worthless because corporate doesn’t do anything about it anyway.
bad,"Pushed and worked all the time. No home life, treatment at work is horrid. Those who want overtime can't get much. Those who don't get too much. Little time to rest and recover between shifts/weeks."
bad,I was hired as an hrly employee and told that I would be given a yr of training before being forced into commission. In that yrs time I was expected to learn everything about every single make of vehicle. IMPOSSIBLE!!!!! So after my yr was up I was told that my weekly commission check would be equivalent to minimum wage. When I expressed to my manager that it was unacceptable he fired me!!!!!!!!! HORRIBLE EXPEREIENCE!!!!!
bad,"I Worked hard to improve the team and environment here and failed."
bad,"The best part of the job was seeing what the customers were working on and talking cars.  "
bad,"I liked my job as far as that, the management and dispatchers, and HR had no sense of your family if anything happened. But if their family had something come up they was gone. HR is a joke, never would talk to anyone unless it was to fire them."
bad,"Demanding, Dont care about employees, the better you show you are the worse they abuse you. I really have nothing to say my experience here ok at first, to demanding, it will wear you down fast they will abuse you, and they will spit you out, If you get hurt dont report it, you will get fired if they file a workers comp claim on your behalf"
bad,"watching over your shoulder ,cant talk to other employees ,having to do so called supervisors work plus your own. unfair  . the job is ok management is very unfair"
bad,Processes and accepted things to do changed daily. You are empowered one day and all taken away another. Short notices for required coming in early and staying late.
bad,"Company has no processes in place as a base for any position.  Overall lack of communication between management and staff.  Expectations change from day to day.  Departments do not work together.  Decisions are made without input from those who know the details of the job.  Rarely acknowledge good work.  Often not told of changes until after work is turned in, then has to be redone.  There is no training of management, so managers have few management skills."
bad,"All i can say is that you have to be someone or know someone for advancement.Corporate owned not so good.there are some good employees there,but there are alot of bad ones.I learned alot.I started out in manufacturing,then the office on the phones,filing etc,then asst manager,then put me back on the phones."
bad,"Worked there for 7 months. Was promised raise and advancement in company. Several months later was stripped of my title and told upper management doesn't need mid-level managers. So basically stuck in same position with no room for advancement and unfortunately hit the ""salary cap"". Management is totally in a bubble when it comes to their employees. High employee turn over rate. Employees worked there for years without a raise. Whenever you mention the word raise upper management scurries off in a panic. I strongly advise NOT to work here. You will be highly disappointed."
bad,It will break up your life. you will be used until you have nothing left.
bad,"typical day at work, we never had meetings unless it was to insult employees. the management there are very unorganized, the plant manager there treats you like your no one.  "
bad,Very sad place to work ..
bad,Only $1  more than new hires after 4 yrs. Poor communication in all areas. Training non existent.  Very high turnover.  Common sense is not common. Commission pay was removed. Big pay cut..
bad,"The work isn't hard but the job is labor intensive. Management is a disaster simply bc the manager acts like the owner. There's no progression simply bc the manager and the supervisor gave been there for 15+ years and dont plan on expanding or doing anything different. You my or may not get a dollar or 2 dollar raise, but its pointless bc they'll hire the ""new guy"" at the same rate."
bad,"Not sure how it is at other locations, but LKQ gulf coast in Livingston, LA has one of the most toxic work environments I've ever been in. Your'e constantly watched on cameras they installed for ""security"" reasons and micro managed every second. I loved the people I worked with, but the management made it terrible for everyone. They spilled a 40 foot container of differential oil into the ground and just covered it up, they suspended people for doing their job the way they've been doing it after not telling them that corporate changed the process and blamed them for not getting the info they never sent out in the first place. Avoid this place like the plague."
bad,Management sucks. As simple as that. Dont expect to advance anywhere anytime soon. Some guys have been there for years and dont make $1 over minimum wage.
bad,"I worked for this company for 5 months, worse job ive ever had. The management sucks there, my supervisor acted like a kid, laughed about everything and never took anything seriously i had trouble working in the area they put me because there was to much favoritism and i was doing others work and it got me mad i was getting paid $10 a hour and was overworking my self while other employees that got along with my supervisor where just chilling i was working my self  off and decided to go complain to HR after i went to complain they decided to lay me off beware dont work at LKQ to much favoritism and the supervisors suck my supervisor will intentionally bully employees there and make fun of them when they couldn't do something due to them being new instead of helping them theres to much favoritism the LKQ is located by west mount Houston Road do not work for this warehouse unless you dont care if they treat you bad they have pour employee communication and if you would to ever complain to HR they fire you and they still dont want to give me my last check i went up to pick it up and they do not let me in i tried calling corporate and opened a claim they are holding my check and its not fair i dont know how is it this company hasn't been sued and they dont even drug test at all when they should theres a bunch of pot heads working there and always have accidents happening worse job to work at"
bad,"Management is terrible. Breaks my heart to say that, because it used to be a great company. Now the management has become way too inflexible. There is discrimination throughout the warehouse, and accounts of workers being targeted and pushed out the door by managment. If managment could shape up it would be a  phenomenal organization. As it stands now, it unfortuatly is a disaster. Dont work here."
bad,"Very poor management. Supposed to have regular route, but changes every day. Overload trucks which it's dangerous. Company only cares about you collecting their money."
bad,The place is a mess and there is no safety standards. Employees are allowed to do whatever they want. Until management is changed this company is nonprogressive and is a hazard to its employees.
bad,Environment is frustrating and combative. No support from management and any concerns are dismissed or used against you.  Hours are decent and breaks are sufficient. No incentive for doing a good job. Starting wage is par but don’t expect any increases.  Health care plan after 3 months.
bad,"LKQ demands flexibility in all fields of warehousing. Even the managers are not exempt from picking parts, stocking shelves and driving routes. A manager will expect to receive and answer at least five hundred emails daily while tracking down missing parts and allocating job functions. A typical day will start from 4:00 am to 8:00am and last until 8:00 pm. Work on most weekends is mandatory and if the manager has a laptop, they should be expected to work on call seven days a week. Managers will run daily, weekly and monthly reports as pertaining to inventory, incoming product, outgoing product, cycle counting and other procedures. Managers are in charge of interviewing candidates, completing personnel action forms, corrective actions and firing employees. A positive and clear mind set is required to achieve all daily tasks."
bad,"I started this job very optimisticly. Was told I could make a six figure salary, and without a formal dress code. Although it is possible, you would have to check your morals and find a way to deal with the immense stress. Management feel that you are incredibly replaceable and you feel incredibly insignificant. Being that you are the face to face interaction with the customer, this is a bad prelactice"
bad,"I have never worked at a job where so many employees have come n gone, and is totally due to management. Human resources have been called by about every employee and yet no actions taken. The job is very stressfull and Dangerous, i have seen many fellow employees injured and management hide it."
bad,"The job seems Insecure on a daily basis, low morale amoung employees, No positive recognition from management. The hardest part of this job is dealing with the functionalityof their processes, they make for a long day, which is not enjoyable.The work place culture is pretty much work harder not smarter, they don't make the necessary corrective measures as needed"
bad,"Horrible place to work, expect you to meet production standards with 3 days of ""training"".  Then when you cant meet production requirements and you tell them you didnt recieve proper training, they would rather fire you and wipe their hands clean than provide you with the proper training."
bad,"bottom feeders-Worst company -The LKQ motto is ""we work for our share holders""-but they do not offer employees any shares-just the board of directors who are FILTHY RICH with your hard work and at bottom feeders pay...- don't waste your time-a dead end company-just go visit a junk yard-you will get the idea.- or-maybe you just need a job...- you won't last long here pal...."
bad,"Not a place for advancement, nor do they appreciate dedication. Infrastructure is weak, unorganized, unprofessional."
bad,"The departments yell at each other.  If you are new and have questions about your job, be careful what you ask.  If you ask the wrong question you will get in trouble.  You are expected to work with your team lead for training and questions, but the team leads are not helpful.  If you ask your supervisor, he/she will keep records of you asking and tell you to ask your team lead.  If bring up these issues you will be escorted off the premised to be in an HR meeting the following morning.  HR does not work in the same location."
bad,"As an employee at LKQ in Lexington, Ky I can tell you it's no joke. Going in everyday and having to act different just to please people who you know have great disdain for you. The management at this location has no clue what they are doing. The only reason most of them are where they are is because they know somebody. If you don't know anyone and came from the ""outside"" you will go no where very fast."
bad,"Kool ok parts knock off. Wack pay. 23 cents 1yr raise. Been there for 3yrs Bs do so much work nd heavy lifting. Dont appreciate good workers. Another day another slave unless your the favorite."
bad,The pay and benefits were good.The plant manager never looked at me when we spoke and he raise his voice if I couldn't hear him the first time. Also he told everyone if they couldn't be there at 8 am then find some where else to work. He gave one girl a 15 min window and she still was late. I was 2 min one day and got wrote up. Another guy was late everyday and he was never written up.
bad,I worked there and they treated the black people unfairly. They gave the big and long routes to black people and everyone else got the easy routes.  It was all bad dont do it they only pay 12 when I was white it may have went up to maybe 15 but who knows it's still not worth it.
bad,"Could value employee contributions more"
bad,"The 198/710 (Santa Fe Springs CA) location needs restructuring with most managers. The Operations manager is clueless at actually managing. When you bring up issues he redirects the issue at hand with petty Replies like you “took to long” on your 1st run. Or will act like he did you a favor to guilt trip you into staying silent. The GM was nice and professional to me, but I have heard that he talks down to to his employees to promote you need to be friendly to to the Operations mgr, which I refused to do I"
bad,"086 location is a bad place to work. The managers will keep you down. The employees morale is always down. No room to grow in the companay, no pay raise...no nothing."
bad,Never in my life have I seen such a circus they will put 60 stops on your truck and act amazed when you can’t finish I have never seen a place where they ride the guys who do the work and say nothing to the slackers I once had a manager tell me drivers are worth a dime a dozen so when 7 called out on a Friday he was mad I said here’s a quarter asked what that was for I said drivers are a dime a dozen so have a quarter knock yourself out trust me they don’t care about you at all run as fast as you can stay away avoid like the plague it is an absolute nightmare
bad,"Management sees you as a replaceble aset."
bad,"Working at LKQ was really stressful, the management team all are a bunch of racist pricks. If you are not kissing behind at this job then you are ""on the spot fired"" without cause.I did learn a lot more about cars and car parts, which was a really fun experience. Everyday was different but for the most part the job was cool until this one manager gets on his period and is rude, disrespectful and racist to the employees and the customers who come there. They treat you nice until you start to become your own person and you are not under their thumbs anymore. The only thing i enjoyed about this job was the fact that i met a lot of new people from different cultures and backgrounds, I enjoyed the interactions!"
bad,Typical work day is very busy.  Always plenty to do.  The management is very focused on saving money but not providing adequate tools for completing tasks. Company is focused on saving money and buying other locations but doesn't want to invest in employees.
bad,It's a good place to work but the plant manager is quick to let you know you are replaceable and it's just business.  They don't care about your personal problems or family.  Guys that work there just wanna sleep with girls in office.
bad,"Very chaotic (rather than fast-paced) environment, little training, no documented processes, not very educated first level management that uses confusing HR terminology intended to impress may be a high school dropout."
bad,"Long, stressful overly demanding management team. Specifications of heavy duty radiators, and cooling systems also collision inspections. Enjoyable work environment due to happy coworkers. Extremely rude, overly confident management team. To say the least, compensation was always a strong motive to enduring this job."
bad,"LKQ is a large company that is mostly devoted to making sure the share holders make money.  They will cut corners when investing in employees."
bad,"The amount of incoming freight was excessive, such that it was literally impossible, given the size of the work force, the amount of hours in the day, and the amount of space available to put it all away. Yet they had to be put in stock IMMEDIATELY."
bad,"If you enjoy prison life, come aboard! Mandatory OT and threatend with termination if you do not comply. Management is clueless, instigating, threatening, lazy and ignoring of hard workers. Workers (inmates) are drug abusers, drug dealers, some dangerous and some tattle tails. Wish I didn't waste 2 sec of my existence for these people."
bad,"The plant manager & I did not see eye to eye on many issues, mostly regarding safety issues and disrespect towards the employees."
bad,"I would have to say this was the worst job I have ever had.  The quality control of the parts is downright embarrassing and the majority of the day is spent putting out other peoples fires and making promises to shops that will be broken the following week....accountability is non existent. One long term sales guy made 19k less in 2013 than 2012 and sold MORE parts due to the ""restructuring of the pay plan"". They are constantly reducing commission rates, adding new ""rules and requirements"" and are trying to do away with the long term employees and replace them with hourly employees. Its a bad work environment, lots of ""good old boy mentality"" and management that just doesn't care. I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone."
bad,"The manager was kind of useless. He just sat in his office all day or hovered over you while you’re trying to work. The leads were nothing but white trash party girls that reeked of cigarettes. The managers, nor the leads were ever any help. Co workers in your immediate cubby cube were cool, but the rest were all a bunch of back stabbing junk talkers. Their expectations are quite high for what they of you and they offer no incentive to want you to actually do a better than average job."
bad,The supervisor didn’t care about you at all and it was a bad environment one supervisor put his hand in my face they were very disrespectful I wouldn’t recommend this job to anyone period .
bad,my time at lkq was not very pleasant it is a very hostile work environment fast paced the manager is quick to frustration and long time employees are given final say
bad,"The only benefits I have found to working there are the comradery of the warehouse staff and the staff discount on car parts and paints ."
bad,Management was absolutely terrible... employees were fine.. and over all job was good... but moved on because management was abusive...
bad,Its is a good experience if you are the right race has alot of mis management and poor supervision ...All in all it is work  and as long as you mind your business you wont be fired
bad,"Employee for ten years upper management is a joke doesn't care about the customers complaints until corporate is on their heels. Then have the nerve to ask you ""Why weren't they told"". Answer because they don't care seen some good people come and go over the years. But management doesn't care all they want is the profit margin and will send customers parts they didn't order just to reach it."
bad,The hours are horrible the management sucks if you want to work here you pretty much don't have a life. And there will be no raises everybody's always in a bad mood everybody doesn't want to do their work because you're treated poorly here
bad,Poor management and human resources not to mention they are a bit discriminatory on hiring process. (Sexist) Not very understanding and accuse you of lying if you get hurt on job. They try to use Scare tactics slot.
bad,"Management is awful if there is a problem they do not take care of it. Your vehicle is your responsibility keeping up on maintenance on the trucks, on top of doing your route. Many hours and no incentive to keep doing a good job. Nothing is the same from one day to the other, you are responsible for finding and loading your trucks with product and sometimes your parts are all over the warehouse. You are aloud a small window of time to get this done and out on the road, in dispatch they are busy so we wait sometimes 30 min to get manifested. Managers have no idea what they are doing they come down hard on the ones that are there every day and on time but the ones that always call out and do the job wrong get treated the same as the good ones. Please rethink about this company this job is not worth it"
bad,Management here makes you feel undervalued an unappreciated. No room for growth or advancement. Upper Management is terrible and only care about themselves. Working here can be highly stressful and mentally draining. They pick and choose who to give raises to. Only certain people get company apparel and gift cards instead all employees. This place will suck the life out of you!
bad,They dont pay well at all. Make more money working at home depot or lowes. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this place. Mcdonalds even pays more.
bad,"the culture is one a professional junk yard. the people will be gruff and you are in constant danger of being fired. there is no union to represent the workers and management takes full advantage of this. HR is centered in Tennessee so the worker is on there own. Pay and benefits are pretty good, however turnover is out of control based the the poor treatment received by unchecked managers. If you accept this job keep looking because every day could be your last, without warning."
bad,Not a bad company to work for its the mangers they have runnin the place..
bad,"The ppl are horrible.. the management is worst! They judge you upon hire. Attitudes, mean, they’re very smart & disrespectful. But expect you not to say anything back. Lack of training, writing up for things that wasn’t Accurate. Just an all around NO GO!! Was the worst job I ever had. Lkq is not a family place. They’re everything opposite!! This place is MISERY!!"
bad,"Production is 60 parts per hour you have to pull , the rack are messy, the order pulling forklifts are unsafe I ran off track 2 times and they just brushed it off , the racks are bent in some sections i did not fell safe working there ,wish OSHA would have gone there but i do not want to do no harm to the company , I felt highly stressed working there every day."
bad,This place may look professional but management is a joke. They have favoritism with drivers and like I saw on one of the reviews they do tend to blame the driver. Pay is different amount depending on the warehouse you apply. And work is stressful having to deal with a loaded truck with many stops and them calling you for e.t.a.
bad,"The workplace culture is horrible,  and the management plays favorites to the employees that they like.  They do not offer any type of training and expect you to know everything.  There is way too much malicious gossip from the employees/management.  If you ask one of your team members for assistance -  only about 2-4 people are glad to help, but as for the other 50+ employees they have something negative to say.  It is too much division,  immaturity, and  negativity.  The HR department is a joke and tell your business to everyone.  Don't ever go to them if you have a problem or issue because it won't ever get resolved.  If you are a Male and do something wrong they are all over you like ants at a picnic.  But the sad thing is if you are a Male that has an issue with a female coworker/manager nothing will ever be done about it.  This place is unfair,  has double standards,  and don't follow its own rules/regulations.On top of that the carpet gets cleaned once every 5-6 months, the restrooms are hardly ever cleaned and always stinks both male and female bathrooms.  The only good thing about this place is the pay/benefits."
bad,"some of the management need to go. Day at LKQ is day to day with the management. I learned to look and clean use car parts. Workplace culture is known. the hardest part of the job is to?"
bad,"8 to 5 typical day. "
bad,Management Sucks......... Leadership suck.They expect you to be a robot. Give you 50 stops and you can not make one mistake. They dont appreciate hard workers.
bad,"You hard work is never enough. My manager was the worst about turning coworker against eachother and so evil to set up her own employees to terminate an employee. The headquarters will not back you up but the state will, it's not worth the drama."
bad,"Management doesn't care about employees, unsafes trucks with not even AC in the trucks and water licking inside the truck, and even in the warehouse as well... Do not work on this place!"
bad,no room for advancement. great as a part time job. loved the people that i worked for and with but you wont get a raise and you will get mountains of work added with new responsibility but no new pay.
bad,"Quality is the companies main goal, and no one cares.  Managment is very poor with no leadership or direction. One manager was very great at his job and was constantly belittled in front of his crew... they pick favorites.  If you do care and are passionate about your job and quality of car parts going to customers you get picked on and singled out treated poorly. Knowledge of the system and flexibility of learning other peoples jobs gets you nowhere. It's a very fun job in its self though I loved it. Just couldnt handle two faced, highschool drama, constant turn over rate,higher management was disrespectful."
bad,"I wouldnt work here if they paid me a million dollars. They treat their employees like dirt. You are a number, a dog. Nothing more. Cant complain no one listens. Besides calling you a lair. They threaten to fire you at every turn they can . no matter the reasons. They will destroy your very soul to the point where your sad every day."
bad,"make cold calls, broker in car parts, check delivery schedules and estimate delivery times, answer calls for sales, call customers to ensure delivery was made"
bad,"check in cars and verify vin numbers, put stock numbers on cars and do work orders, and print inventory tags"
bad,Worst job you could possibly have! Co workers were great it’s the upper management you have to look out for . It’s family ran so once one don’t like you they all won’t like you. HR doesn’t do anything to help. They just try to avoid the paper work. Supervisors will throw you under the bus to make them look better. The pay IS NOT WORTH IT. Checks are barely $1000 you gotta do OT just to see that or better...
bad,"Great job, loved the work i did however poor management makes for a hostile work environment and i knew i could do better than where i was at, there was illegal activity going on that was effecting me wanting to work there, they didn't pay enough for the type of work i did."
bad,I've worked for lkq for 2yrs this place really needs some upgrades trucks are in poor working conditions lead is not properly trained doesn't communicate well your pretty much threw in and told to do alot with no training there's so much more I could mention but to not enough time
bad,"was hired to do AR Analyst now have to do collections, national accounts set-up along with given accounts..  These were individual team positions, Have given more work than one person can handle,  Management does not listen to what you say if in a conversation on an issue, they just let you talk than continue with their own thought, may or may not concern your question."
bad,"Extreme hours not a good home work life balance"
bad,"Lkq will not properly compensate you for work done. Manager is just looking out for himself, could care less what you are going through. Was cursed out,threatened,pushed,and choked by a customers. Lkq did nothing sent me back to deliver to one customer and allowed other to come in for parts smh."
bad,There is no communication between departments. They tell you you will receive benefits you don’t get. You have to fight for the ones you do get. Because they hire such low quality people they get out of the company exactly what they deserve. They do t care if they lose good workers just to bring in others that will take a dollar less to do a half “assed” job.
bad,Very low pay for CDL Drivers the routes aren’t bad you jus aren’t compensated enough  and management can be aggy!! They want way more than they are willing to pay for
bad,As a truck driver the first month is fun you love it. The second month in working for this company did a complete 360. The management is horrible. The accounting cant keep track of their collect on delivery accounts. Your on the phone none stop. You pack your own truck in the morning this includes after market parts and salvage parts.  You come back from an hour and 30 minute drive away. Now you got to do your returns before 5. This place isn't great at all. They pay you the lowest and bare minimum which is only 13 an hour. You cannot move up from a truck driver and your raise is like a quarter.
bad,"The job itself it not bad, the Management team is the issue, they don't pay what the duties are worth, & Its not room for advancements. The Director and Management team does not have any compassion for their employees and they are very unappreciative of the hard work you put in."
bad,"wouldn't recommend. favoritism feels like a number one priority here. There is no room for advancement and there is no room for mistakes. So unless you're perfect, you don't want to work there because you'll more likely be fired literally over the smallest thing. Be ready to also to have new rules probably every 2 weeks."
bad,"Management is horrible and if they don't like you they will find any small reason to fire you. There is overtime available, but not worth it if you want to spend time with your family, no pay increases, no bonuses, there is insurance after 90 days but it'll take most of your pay check. You'll do a lot of work for little pay, not worth it. There are way too many lazy employees so if you are a hard worker you'll be doing their jobs too. I promise you can find something better."
bad,"They paint a nice picture when hiring employs, they promise you advancement, and that their is a lot of opportunities because its such a big company, don't be fooled. You get stuck in that place"
bad,The manangement could never give you a straight answer and they constantly talked bout cutting overtime but continued to increase drivers workload.
bad,"Good Job, outside in all types weather. Some heavy lifting required. Working one on one with customer base if best part of job."
bad,"The job in of itself is not bad, However the leadership at my warehouse is very unprofessional. Communication is terrible, and ignorance runs rampant. There has been no raises or performance reviews in 2 years! They only offer 1.5 hours of paid time off every two weeks....no separate sick, vacation or personal time. This a good job for a younger employee without a family and doesn't care about advancement."
bad,I was m0lsted several times by the managers who threatened to fire me for not performing g@y acts with them. I was forced into doing these disgusting acts in order to keep my job
bad,"In my short time at LKQ I was delivering in the northridge and west side of dayton where most of the shops were owned by foreigners or people who just had no bank account, not to mention the area is one of the worst crime areas in dayton. So as the driver YOU would be responsible for taking in THOUSANDS of dollars and having that with you unsecured ALL DAY. At times it seemed like the owners of some of those shops would flaunt the money so everyone that was in the vicinity could see you were getting a lot of money and that only made it feel more sketchy. On top of that 60% of the customer returns are 500 lbs engines that no one will help you load, and the engines are never drained of fluid. That little dirty shop that you will work in is just a cancer transfer station from the junkyard to the shop you'll see only black soot on everything. On top of everything there is no backup, when your coworkers call off, the load doesn't go to a backup it gets split up with 75% going to the fastest person in the office. This place is a joke stay away unless you are desperate."
bad,Very toxic working environment! you are expected to tolerate it andcomplaints go unanswered.i was threatened by a coworker who is friends with management an it was brushed off.
bad,Hauling car parts and engines. Very physcial job with the motors and engines. Management changing alot. Not the best work environment. Warehouse people quitting cant keep anyone.  Very dirty job
bad,LKQ take away 1/2 hour for lunch even if you don’t take your lunch .. people that works in dispatch are rude and disrespectful they don’t get alone we’ll with each other and they talk about each other behind there back .. it’s a lot of profanity use in the Romulus warehouse.. drivers are under paid no one like to work there longer than three months. There has
bad,"Old boys club with no true corporate feel.  Many of people are old school guys that were acquired when LKQ bought their business."
bad,"I applied to be a deliver driver in Humboldt county. I was told I would start around 8 am and end at 5, with little overtime. Boy was I fooled. I start at 6 am and have roughly 400 miles of daily driving to cover. This area stretches from Garberville to Brookings Oregon. Every. Single. Day. Management are incompetent and are not understanding. Unless you're in desperate need of an instant paycheck, save your sanity and do not work here. $16 an hour is not worth all the poorly run shops and the two faced people that run them. They'll call and complain about anything and everything they can. I assume in hopes of getting a discount."
bad,Management is a joke (returns department is terrible). No growth in the company. The co-workers are the best part about that place. Was only $10hr....
bad,The bosses were disrespectful and talked to you like you was a nobody which was very stressful and downing.You work in all weather conditions and the place just didnt seem to care about your opinions or nothing you thought
bad,"Company is ran by unexperienced and rude managers who operate on a double standard. Employees act just as rude. Too much street like attitudes, very unprofessional  ."
bad,very dirty an unsafe place to work very  cold kept heaters turned down garage doors always opening had to walk to worksite under icy conditions
bad,hard work loading doors and other car parts had to check for damage put them on pallets load the trucks with a fork lift bosses that have no idea what they are doing.
bad,"Low employee motivation, most of management only cares about the bottom line. The only place ive worked at and experienced bullying and harassment where supervisors took part of"
bad,"Co-workers were great, hours and pay were fine, benefits were par for the course. Management were unhelpful, condescending and inconsistent while simultaneously doing virtually nothing all day but ""delegating"" which amounted to looking busy and hiding in the office with a cup of coffee. To top it all off, their equipment constantly failed with zero intention of repairing said equipment. Trailers had man-sized holes in the floors that product was lost through in transit, forklifts were constantly out of commission, etc. Nobody respected these salary-suckers for a reason."
bad,"Lots.of cross training and different jobs/tasks assigned. Little pay. Everyone is replaceable. Poor management.Great co workers and steady work. Good job to have, lousy place to have a career."
bad,"They over work employees in the busy spring and summer months. Shifts very in theses months from 12 to 16 hours a day. Then they start laying people off and getting rid of people in the fall. After being laid off I was told I would be called back in January, but they never called me back. They had a job fair and hired new people instead, even though those of who were laid off were already trained and certified on to work on the machines. an"
bad,"At least In the south east region its who you know not what you know that gets you in  the good ol boy club. I have seen people that deserved to move up in the company but instead the position given to someone with zero knowledge. All because they have some type of connection to someone ""important"" in the company."
bad,Just a job not much room for advancement cold in winter and HOT in summer. Starting out pay for new hires is ok and 2 weeks vacation. They do not drug test so they can get warm bodys.
bad,"The company has a collabrative communication issue in that best practices from one plant or distribution center do not get passed on to other warehouses and credit isnt noticed or given when creating said practices,i really enjoyed the daily diversity that came with the job, there was always something different happening and it was very fast paced."
bad,"No matter how hard you work,  you don't get a raise, the bosses are constantly picking everything you do apart, Never saying you did good but criticizing everything you do. Management thinks everything should be on emails, computers are slow, moral is low and the only enjoyable part of the job is leaving at the end of the day"
bad,job is simple minded but physically challenging. Management could help there customers more instead of acting like they are above anyone and snooty. If an employee goes above and beyond to help a customer the employee if frowned upon
bad,"No words as far as management went, did my work load as well as everyone else's on the team, not happy with the treatment at the Taunton location, would I work for the company itself again yes, issue not with LKQ/Keystone new management was the problem"
bad,There is changes which is good but decisions made seem to be made on ego and not on fact of improving a process and more about control of staff not growing staff
bad,"My experience working for LKQ/Keystone was awful! Fairness, decency, ethics, and organization are all terms that were unrecognized by management. I recommend working for this company only if you meet the following criteria: you enjoy being belittled by an arrogant supervisor, you like working for a company where the general manager hardly acknowledges you after you're hired, you like getting blamed for things that you didn't do, you like looking around at a warehouse and thinking about how unkempt it is, you love spending hours cleaning when no one else will only to be told in a meeting that the place constantly looks terrible, and you never want raises or opportunities for advancement."
bad,"Company overall is ok, day to day work is normal for hourly pay but salary compensation is where they drag you into doing double the work for nothing more. management is only out for their own bonuses. They will lie at any cost to get their own way and this includes setting you up as the fall guy. Unless your buddies with them your just a peon. Don't complain cause then your the next to go, cause you don't know what your talking about!"
bad,"i would take calls daily from body shops and route salesmen that delivered body parts. the customers were a delight to work with compared to other call centers, and the environment was much more relaxed as you worked mainly at your own pace and were on commission. however the inmates ran the asylum here. management let drama run rampant, and allowed inside sales reps to have inappropriate relationships with customers on the phones and discuss deeply personal issues with them. you could over hear inside sales representatives swearing and speaking negatively about co workers, as an attempt to keep their customers from using other sales people. it was very cut throat. LKQ purchased keystone and the managers at LKQ would communicate to keystone reps via email very disrespectfully, rather than being constructive they were negative and abbraisive and would even swear through emails. when multiple people would complain to management they would be told that LKQ (a salvage yard chain) was a different world full of men working in a junk yard that were not capable of using appropriate computer etiquette and that we had to let it roll off our shoulders"
bad,Compensation is constantly changing and there is a high turn over in this company. The management does not take care of their long term employees and seems to make up rules as they go. I would stay working for them a long time if they would just pay correctly for work done and stop adding more work to already too much work without extra compensation.
bad,"My day consisted of constant calling of customers to try and sell them parts. Every call had to have a BDR, or write up about the call. These where then put into a database that anyone could look at. The favorite employee's would then look in the database and pick out the most expensive quotes and call those people to sell to. The favorites were not required to do the COLD calls, but could steal your sales. Worst company I have ever worked for and POOR MANAGEMENT. The district management came to visit one time, about 4 of them, and all they did was stay in the conference room and not even talk to anyone at the plant, for that matter they did not even talk amongst themselves. Very unprofessional, this of course in my opinion."
bad,"Typical day of work involves working with insurance companies providing estimates,cold calling on new body shops to gain new business,and account matience of regular accounts."
bad,"During company wide sales downturn, management panicked and weekly changed  directives and focus. Expected unreal job performance . Management had no training regarding salvage auto parts."
bad,"The hardest part of working for this company was the poor management. We would need supplies ordered, schedules to be made, among other things, and everything was overlooked and not handled accordingly."
bad,dismantle trucks and cars for parts resale of OEM parts and sheet metal .everything that's is sellable and not aftermarket from engines to door handles
bad,"Some management is amazing, however some arent. The job tends to start pretty good but once you prove you can do one thing, they seem to pile you up with everything. In my years i have only seen worse change and the warehouse seems to be turning into anarchy. There is virtually no room for growth in the company and people are generally rude and bitter. Also overtime seems to be mandatory and if you dont do it they try and punish you with various tactics."
bad,"typical day-drive the pickers and pick parts"
bad,fixed hours not really a place for advancement.  if you are looking for a set 8-5 hours and steady pay its a great place.  if you are looking for a career where you are given guidance and a set career path to follow this is not for you
bad,"Strongly customer driven to the point where the ""internal customer"" (employee) is sometimes lost.. The efforts of the employee is typically overlooked."
bad,I would not recommend working here. The people are hostile and the manager avoids confrontation so nothing is ever done. Also there are no bennifits and no way to move up in the company.
bad,LKQ is a major corporation and they behave like it. If you want a job where seniority means nothing and no room for growth or even a cost of living raise and nothing to look forward to then LKQ is perfect for you! Management is a mess and they are constantly changing without thinking things through.
bad,"In a typical work day, you can expect to be yelled by customer for the ever changing policies. Having to deal with a management staff that can't make up it's mind about anything. They will tell you to do one thing and then change that not even a week later. They will tell you anything to try and make you stay and not leave but they never follow though with the promises. After going though my first performance review I struggled to understand why I was just satisfactory. I work way harder then a lot people here and It was like they don't even see it. After having a long conversation with one of the former manager I was informed that the mangers bosses were telling mangers to give employees just satisfactory grades so we will still have something to work for. Basically they do that to try and get you to work harder even if you go above and beyond there expectations now."
bad,My manager was just horrible. Didn't care about his employees and was only focused on his bonus at the end of the year. Poor work conditions and very unhealthy work environment. No room for advancement and management treats employees as they are replaceable and worthless.
bad,Company was good to work for learned a lot would go out to auto auctions preview salvage cars then bid at live insurance auctions. Management was good worked will with co-workers worked outside rain or shine. met a lot of people.
bad,Good place to work everyone is friendly and good supervisor
bad,as a driver you get treated bad. you have to drive around all day and have dispatch call and harass you
bad,Briefly employed with LKQ. Management was a mess and I was not treated fairly overall.
bad,"My typical day consists of daily routine follow up calls to check on my regular accounts. I check open work orders from the previous day and follow up on any open issues or sales from the night before. I attempt to make between 30-40 outbound calls a day which I complete before 1PM. Thoughout the day, I am also required to take 20-30 inbound calls from customers looking for parts. The hardest part of the job is trying to maintain your current accounts without other ISC's stealing your business. The sales floor is cut throat and it is up to you to keep an eye on your sales. The managers are well seasoned but there are not enough to go around The management style is laid back. Often the middle managers must comply with upper management so decisions usually come from the top down. The company would be an excellent candidate for ISO."
bad,They start you off a just okay pay grade but daily shifts can be up to 14 hours while not being fairly compensated for the physically labor you are going. Plus raised are about 30¢ yearly. YEARLY! Worked in LKQ ONTARIO from 2017-19
bad,Not supported. Poor culture. No training Program. Sweatshop atmosphere. poor management. Very stressful. Often reprimanded public in front of the whole office.
bad,An employee will be penalized for going the extra miles to attract more or new customers. Sad. I got dismissed because I put customers first into to attract more customers and increase my customer base
bad,Managed retail and commercial accounts and logistics in a high volume atmosphere with minimal error accepted. Time Managing and Creating accounts keeping customer service to its highest degree possible.
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job was the diversity in the cool coworkers that you get to work around management wasn't much help and put a lot of work off on everybody else even if it was something that but didn't pertain to them
bad,Pay is based on commission you get paid for what you deliver. Every day is different you don’t know what your pay will be from one week to the next. You work  8 hours plus a day.
bad,Thwy dont  pay good no over time aloaded the management are suck they work by their mood they don't really care about employees and they don't have any celebration day or lunch
bad,"A little too relaxed, lack of training it's employees. Management overwhelmed with getting things done, expecting the most from there harder working employees without providing any chance for advancement."
bad,"it was okay. Raises weren’t a common thing, and a bad place to work forever. Didn’t seem that hard work payed off to well if it did it was a small reward"
bad,I like to work with engines and transmissions. Job was great to learn to get into the automotive industrial. Good to work with employees to help get the job done.
bad,"Management wasn't what it should be."
bad,"Hard company to work for. They watch you all day and yell at you in front of the customers on video calls asking what is taking so long. They have no interest in customer service. It's a take it or leave it sale, ."
bad,Dirty place to work. Very physical jobs and demanding on the body. It’s impossible to stay clean working there. It’s poor working conditions. Very hot in the summer and and constantly covered in metal dust
bad,The management at this job is cool but the salary isn't fair. I fewl as though for all the work done a day the salary should be better. Ibdo like the management because they will work with you if you have any issues but I don't agree with the salary.
bad,"not a great place to work at. disorganized,stressful and boring. No chances for personal growth. manager is not fair at all. good benefits and health insurance."
bad,"I would NOT recommend working here. Company does not care about employees. Pay is low, not much room for advancement. Filling in minimum amount of characters"
bad,"I like where I work , it's a very friendly  Environment. I just feel like it's a under paid job. We was supposed to get a raise but, they just highered the pay by 50 cents."
bad,I really didn't like the way the company conducted there system of doing the work. It was very disorganized the supervisors were not a help and unprofessional.
bad,It's a okay job to have it's just the pay for the work you do overnight. The job is very competitive and every night when i come to work i would have to pick a certain amount of parts.
bad,"driving to Rochester to drop off and pick up parts to be delivered,  learned about the auto industry, the management was varied, the hardest part was the sitting for two hours straight driving to Rochester and two hours back from Rochester, best part was driving, not being in an office or building"
bad,Pay is not very good and management is more interested in lining their packets than the well-being of employees.Do not apply here if you want something more than riding a desk for years. This job will get you nowhere
bad,"You're very under paid for what they ask of you. You will be asked to do a ""favor"", but in return it becomes your job. I've worked several different departments and get nothing from it."
bad,"Long hours, long weeks, 25-50% working outside regardless of the weather.  Corporate management expresses interest in employee development and retention, but their message is lost by the time it gets to the district managers.  Many district managers have little or no management skills.  They tend to be rough necks that did okay in the field and were promoted into positions for which they don't have the appropriate skill set.  I'm surprised they don't experience countless harassment lawsuits due to aggressive and inappropriate language.  On the positive side, the corporation is growing and basically seems to be printing money."
bad,I started working like a Warehouse Clerk and then I go Driving and delivering part all over Virginia. There is a lot physical work a fast speed environment.
bad,"I am grateful that LKQ gave me an opportunity to add to my experience. I am now seeking more, that's the only reason why I'm looking for employment somewhere else."
bad,We were on the phones all day trying to buy and sell used auto part.
bad,Same thing everyday come in sort parts and stage in certain area and someone loads the truck then work in the back putting more orders up on racks to be delivered to customers
bad,The medical benefits are great and cheaper than most.The co employees are awesome also. Management is mediocre  and the pay is substandard. The national average for salesmen in the used auto parts industry is roughly 5%. LKQ pays 3.5 % comission. LKQ Corp. seems worried about LKQs image more than they care about their employees
bad,Career growth would be the reason i would be leaving because there is no room to move from where you start. There are places to learn more things throughout the warehouse but no extra oy for being cross trained.
bad,"I enjoyed working with a few supervisors there. There are some really dedicated, hard working people there. I felt that I was among people that took pride in their work."
bad,Relaxed environment with no stress and flexible hours made it a great fit for my needs at the time.  Opportunities to advance were slim and new management that came in is inexperienced and nervous.   The new management is well educated but not experienced which caused issued.  I chose to leave to start over and try to advance.  Job is OK  if your looking for a job but not a career.
bad,"Management needs a lot of work. When I started there the first GM was amazing and attentive to both customers and employees. When he moved to his own location and handed his title down to the sales manager, everything went down hill. The manager will throw you under the bus with customers, feeds into drama and rumors, he will do anything to avoid conflict, he avoids customers and employees if they are difficult or just doesn't want to talk. Other than that it was a lovely place to work and the pay was good and rewarding"
bad,Started off ok then it got stressful cause they dont want to hire a single soul but want to push everybody's work on you like you dont have a full plate already plus lack of materials and half training. I literally was thrown in the water with no life jacket if you get me. No one stay for more than a month. By far the worst job I had so far
bad,"Bad management friendly associate, overtime when work wasnt done. Not a place for people with health issues or for the elderly.  Lack of parking. The money sucked"
bad,"I was a 15 year employee at LKQ and I can genuinely say my life has only gotten better since quitting. This place is a vortex of disorganization, ridiculous ideas, making sure the pockets of management are nicely padded while the drivers, sales & warehouse employees struggle to meet their monthly expenses."
bad,"Everyone is miserable there"
bad,"Management is terrible. An employee was reported to management by myself as well as other co workers as smelling like alcohol and nothing was done. Claimed it was mouth wash. Direct supervisor is beyond dim witted and doesn’t know how to talk to people or manage them. They hire new employees that you get to train and pay the new one more then you, buy we’re not supposed to discuss our wages! Employees that call out often are not disciplined for their actions. There are “counseling’s” in upper management offices. One was up to 45 minutes for being mean, rude, slow and over all lazy!"
bad,Make you work harder for no rasies only gave overtime when good for them unorganized personal more stuff coming back damaged not a happy place doing more stuff that didn’t make sense of why doing when not needed
bad,"I worked in the office under accounting. The job was not bad. It was the office manager that made everyone's workday miserable. Talking down to employees, talking about employees to other employees and the worst micromanaging I have ever seen. It made for a hostile work environment. I was glad when I left."
bad,"I worked here for a couple of years and rose a bit through the ranks. It was easy to do, since nearly all of the other staff are knuckleheads. But even as I rose through the ranks, the pay structure was hardly incremental. There is simply no incentive to worker harder than the next person."
bad,Its an ok place to work if you just need something for the time being. There is not a lot of advancement there. I hate the hours I work on the over night shift I don't like those hrs. they have there days where things go great and then things go bad. they need more people on the night shift. they don't always have working tools and equipment for us to use. the benefits are great but the pay sucks.
bad,"When I first started with LKQ, I believed I was in it for the long haul. I was able to advance quickly to a management role within my first year, only to find you are greatly under paid for your role compared to the same role in other companies. Higher management request ridiculous goals and your departments are greatly understaffed. Asking for time off is like asking for a kidney. Overall the people you work with a nice but management and the corporate office are off their rockers."
bad,"Delivered car parts to customers. Parts were damaged or wrong, told sales man and they would say take it any ways witch put us drivers in the middle (they wanted to make commission). Good thing about job you are not in office all day."
bad,"Bottom line... Managers do nothing to help make your job easier or more productive. If you ask a manager to handle something only a manager can, usualy you will get a ""thats not my job"" kind of answer. I would have to ask fellow coworkers for help because managment was never any help."
bad,"Start work 7am  collect all paperwork required for product loading."
bad,"They paint a nice picture when hiring employs, they promise you advancement, and that their is a lot of opportunities because its such a big company, don't be fooled. You get stuck in that place."
bad,"Advancement is merely learning more, not a pay raise, unless you get in good with a manager. It's a favoritism game. I had to go when a supervisor came in stoned out of her mind on a daily basis (in the morning, and then again after her lunch break). I felt insulted somebody thought an educated, intelligent employee should have to work ""under"" such a person. If we allow this, why not allow alcohol use in the workplace as well? "
bad,Learned about the inner workings of numerous automobile manufacturers and what goes into repairing vehicles depending on the type of damages.
bad,It is a very hard place to work at do to the lack of management. Everyone that I work with just comes in because they have to. I love what I do but the compensation does not meet the work load.
bad,"miserable, discouraged"
bad,"Good compensation/ benefits package."
bad,"The job was not terribly difficult. It was actually enjoyable when you are out driving the routes and delivering the parts. The management style is very pushy, especially with new employees. There is definitely a lot of hazing the new guys going on. Corporate came in and audited our drivers by reviewing the GPS history on our trucks and they said we were doing great and making great time. Management however felt differently and was constantly pushing us to go at an unsafe pace. They would threaten our jobs on the daily. There was definitely a lot of ego going on and a lack quality leadership. Management would also encourage drama between employees to the point where some folks almost got into physical altercations. Probably the least desirable place I ever worked."
bad,I worked for a company that was purchased by LKQ.  Prior to the buy out my former company was an outstanding place to work.  The policy and culture change under LKQ made it seem as if we were merely numbers.  They did put a lot of money into the facility however employee moral and relations seemed to dwindle.
bad,"a works day included pulling wires out of about 22 cars, no matter the weather. management was poor, abused power and authority. workers steal from and fight eachother."
bad,"Days can be long and difficult.  Many managers set poor examples resulting in several employees consistently seeking the easiest path to the end of the day.  Upper management is strictly focused on volume allowing customer service to take a back seat.  The lack of focused management results in a ""dog eat dog"" workplace culture where co-workers will steal and sabotage each other to make a quick dollar.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with the lack of customer service.  The most enjoyable part of the job was travel and working with some excellent customers."
bad,"The best part about LKQ is that the workday goes by extremely quickly. There is never a shortage of work that needs to be done and problems that need to be attended to. If you show initiative and take on extra work, that unofficially becomes your duty ongoing. Management is swamped constantly but still somehow finds a way to take time off when they are needed most, leaving the warehouse at a decisional standstill many times in the week. The benefits package they offer is overpriced and in my opinion, the subsidized services do not provide value unless you have a family to take care of. As for organizational culture, it is the standard automotive industy- where communication barriers are always present and timely results rarely happen. This is a god job for people who just want to punch in and out on a daily basis without caring for the growth of the company they work for."
bad,This place is alright for a first job. Wouldn’t recommend staying here for more than a year. You get treated unfair and pay sucks and you get no raise. Been at LKQ for about 2 years and haven’t gotten a raise. New management is trash and does not care for there employees which results in employment not caring about their work.
bad,Driving around yorkshire delivering paint to auto shops and garages. Ordering stock on some weekends. Generally working alone. Usually an early finish most days
bad,"I really like the job itself that I was hired to do. Unfortunately, the longer I work there the more responsibilities of other lazy and/or incompetent people end up being my responsibility. Management is alright except when it comes to trying to get a straight answer when asking about your wage. I took the job for considerably less then I should have with the promise of more after 90 days, after a year and a half and I STILL don't make what I was told I would at 90 days. If you have never worked in a warehouse, it's a place to start. If you already have decent experience don't be fooled by the corporate candy coating."
bad,"Started at 6:00 finished anywhere from 4:00 to 6:00"
bad,No comments . Low pay to select race . Raise to select race or people.  This company promotion are determined by who you are friends with.  The management is
bad,job security and plenty of hours available to work.  hard place to work for tho. expectations are a little too high for what is done at this location.
bad,"I honestly enjoyed my time at this company. I met many great people and enjoyed myself when out on the road with the training team. I'd like to think that I gave my all to show the company that I was a lifer and wanted to advance in this company. Due to circumstances I couldn't control and lack of decent management, I was forced to move on because I knew I wasn't going to advance with the management structure that was in place at the time."
bad,"I worked there and the review that says a picker makes 38,000.00 a year is some bogus talk. I was not at the one in WI, but the branch I worked at, people went years without a raise, not even a nickle.  Starting pay in the door is $10.00. You may get moved around, but your pay remains the same unless you are lucky enough to get a lead position, which seldom happens.  "
bad,great company to work for yet not very understanding about employees with families changed my start time 4 times in less than 6 months even though I told them prior to hiring me that my earliest av. start time was 8am they still changed my start time to 7 am which is not something I am able to do as a single mother
bad,wasn't a great work environment and no room for advancement
bad,The truth about this company if you get employed here they put on this 90 dys trial period to see if your gonna like the job you start off wrking on a straight hourly pay then ounce your 90 dys are up they put you on another program called commission then they tell you that you can make Alot of money being on it but they fail to tell you at you name is not on any of the invoices and when you have to go around and pick up parts from the body shops you go to you have to take a hit off of your own commission even though you never sold that part to the body you took it to. So your gonna find yourself either staying or quitting and top of that you have a morning run and when you think your dne for the afternoon you have to run back to the same shops you went to in the morn to drop off more parts in the afternoon by the time you start wrk and get back your very tired and you feel like your wrking harder than smarter no advances and small pay raises .
bad,Don't work here. Outsourcing jobs to India and it is a harassing place to work. Only thing good was benefits and flexibility of schedule. Never got promised raises even though performed at the highest  level and there was no room for upward mobility. People have been there for 18+ years but only because they are STUCK. Seriously just DON'T!
bad,"A typical day at work was immediately answering calls and chats online from nationwide customers/potential customers."
bad,Upper management has been in place too long. (Good Ol' boy system) If you kiss rear and be a yes person you will move up  fast. Because all the good candidates have gotten a promotional and left to better companies
bad,It is a relaxed environment but you are always having to finish or do the job for everyone else's job. Management is always looking down on you and never really wants to help. Will be told to just wait it out and then it never happens.
bad,"place to get some experience, must love junk yard work, and be able to deal with all races. Local management is the best and those above him care nothing about the employees, only the bottom line. wages are low for what is expected."
bad,I stayed at this company a year and ahlf but it has poor management also there pay isnt worth it u do twice as much work ur job title is endless as a worker .
bad,"Fun and easy job, but there were no hours. Benefits were really expensive. Was told it was a 8-5 monday through friday but eded up being 8-10 monday through friday."
bad,Pretty cool place to work in but just not enough pay for what they have you doing and they always expect more from you but when it comes to get a  raise it’s like they don’t know what that means
bad,Great Place to get a paycheck and nothing more
bad,They do not like to give raises and play a lot of favoritism and it is vey unprofessional. Your schedule is okay but you are required to work on weekends.
bad,"the boss plays favorites"
bad,worked in the salvage yard dismantling car parts inventoried everthing we carried are discontinued carrying of old outdated parts drove box delivery of parts to local businesses and schools.
bad,"I was the only one doing my job, I train myself despite of mix information I am getting from the managers. The company don’t have no sick time and you accrue vacation very slowly."
bad,"i worked for this company for 10 years. was promised a promotion 4 times in 5 years and none of them happened. we had three pay cuts in past 5 years as well.  all though i made decent money, the pay cuts bring moral down and they say they did it to motivate to sell more. sound backwards. yeah we did too.   this a corporate company and all they care about is the stock holders. you can make a living here but there is a lot to be sad about being happy at work instead of "
bad,Prior leadership was amazing.  Was very willing to work with you and fostered an environment that promoted collaborative thinking.
good,"clock in review returned parts"
good,There was a lot of drama between different races in between co-works.A lot of the co-works would get in to physical scuffles
good,"Working for LKQ often feels like stepping back in time to an age where only men worked at the office, women held no positions of power and promotions were earned solely based on tenure.  The core leadership team at LKQ does not see value in diversity, understand how to set and communicate clear goals, and operates like a local business, rather than a global enterprise."
good,"long hours , 530am til whenever . never a set time it could be 5, 6 or even 10pm. no benefits, raises are about 25cents. they will fire with no care.."
good,Good place to work with long hours and decent benefits. If you can get the right route you can really enjoy your job. Management at the time only seemed to care about the business and not the employee.
good,The job is easy enough.  Training lack.  You're not very prepared to help adjusters completely.  New manager that lacked people skills.  Disgruntled employees because of manager.  If you asked to many questions they take it as you don't understand where in factif it was taught more thoroughly in training you may have not needed to ask.
good,It was the worst job I've had so far when I first started the first 3 to 6 months I was in the field picking up the garbage from the vehicles that were once there after that that I was placed inside doing inspections on sheet metal and engines was allowed to drive the forklift and then wasn't whenever they found out I did not have the license or permit to use so they were making me use a pallet jack four engines anywhere from 150 lb to 1000 something pounds very poor people to work for and I will never work for them again
good,I was there for close to 2 years and only had a small raise once. The managers would only pay attention to the work ethnic of certain employees and let others slide. They are not keen on fixing broken equipment properly and would rather do it the cheapest way possible. they expected you to work hard enough to cover the people who didn't feel like working.
good,"The hardest part of the job was being the only hard working person on our team. The most enjoyable part of the job was everyday learning something new. I started out as a receptionist. I am now accounts payable/ receivables/collections coordinator."
good,"stressed all the time. "
good,Dismantling cars.shipping @ receiving.
good,Tired and not enough pay . Everyone was nice no complaints about that and communication and learning was an open field. Stop working there because my schedule changed and I couldn’t manage .
good,"I think the company as a whole itself can do better at picking more professional managers, ones who do not favor other emplyess over another. I liked how the enviroment was fast paced everyday, there was always something to do to stay busy."
good,Prepare order packets for our puller team. Set up dispatch & QC for there work day. Go through and solve any problems either by emails/phone/sales or print orders.Manage/oversee 10 employees with daily task. Inventory all supplies and order what was needed to complete all job task. Hardest part of the job was working with many different  characteristics and making things work for each individual. Most enjoyable part of the job was being able to be to complete all jobs each day as needed and knowing I had a good team under me. Must have thick skin & good self esteem for the environment.
good,"I drove a truck to So. Kearny N.J. every day and made a daily delivery of auto body parts back to my warehouse in Lakewood N.J. Every morning. Also every afternoon after returning from my daily delivery, I then used an auto lift truck to pull auto body parts to fill customer's orders."
good,The company seems to be struggling to keep management people and grumbling can be heard down the lines.  Drivers are not happy because they aren't treated with respect and raises are nonexistent.  Many good drivers have left for better pay and better management. There is no loyalty between management and staff.
good,"My typical day starts by selecting orders for next morning routes,Unloading containers,put container parts into stock. I learned  how to operate a sit down propane fork lift and use a hand held scanner. Our management is poor due to favoritism on other employees and now raises when you need them they seem to be lost.My co workers are a good team i love working with them and we work well.Job is not hard is just that you need to make at lease 20 hours O/T to have a good check.The most enjoyable part is going in and having a good time with my co workers and still get things done."
good,No job security. Management let you know daily how expendable you were.
good,"Its not a department store, customers are just different. They are going to try you if your new and see if you are going to do something, when they try to walk out with a part or if your going to fall for""its my part I brought it in"", knowing there are no outside parts allowed in the yard, 5 signs before you even come in. Some of the people I worked with are lifers, 15 to 30 year employees, great people specially the older crew I mean 55 years and over, hard working and reliable. I really enjoyed working with my crew specially the supervisors."
good,Management very unprofessional.   Employees of many years walked out due to very bad management.   Took corporate way to long to do anything about the way people where being treated and talked to.
good,The upper management is awesome. Will do what he can to help in any way he can. Supervisors are lazy and  do not do things as they should. Not willing to help in a pinch.
good,"I didn't have a bad work experience but, I know plenty of people who did. Mostly involving upper management. My worse experience was at the end when the company was changing location. The Friday before Christmas week they decided the Monday before Christmas they were going to be moved. So the week of Christmas a lot of people had no job to go to. They never kept us informed enough about it. Worst Christmas present ever."
good,"I started out happy about this company, i liked the shift and i thought my coworkers were cool guys to work wit. Learning the system was a lil hard but i got it down. I think management needs to treat all workers the same and not treat other shift workers different."
good,"this job is hard work with low pay. if you stay with them for a while they do treat you better."
good,I enjoyed working for LKQ. I enjoyed buying cars and the people I worked with. I didn't like the drive or the hours. I was also not impressed with the days and hours because of the distance and lack of employees
good,"They never had enough work to keep all the areas busy. But they would always need bumpers that day. so your not working to hard because than all your work will be done, so you take your time and get relaxed, than they drop a hurry part on you."
good,so so amount of time driving is crazy on top of waiting for afternoon truck to get back ya dont get out in time to do all afternoon deliverys and they tell to hurry up
good,"I was in charge of 80 personnel and 40 trucks, in charge of payroll, hiring and firing. I learned how to interact with customers and make deals to secure business. Had a lot of company gatherings and parties. Hardest part of the job was the long hours."
good,Managers promise you a whole lot of things but never do or back up their promises. I will never work them again. I was promised so many things but never got them.
good,Work starts at 7am to 330pm. Some morning you have to deal with lack of supplies throughout the day. The job offers some what good pay for the hours that you work weekly. I've learned how to re manufacture cylinder heads for Fords. Chevy. Honda. Audi. and etc.
good,"The job is easy, but very unorthoxed at times. Needs to have a flow system in place to allow qouta to be reached on a daily bases. There needs to be personal accountability."
good,"come in dispatch all driver routes .then coordinate the warehouse for the incoming freight and other items "
good,This company is a great company to work for. The people are great and the employees are amazing good people. The worst part about this job is the pay isn't great.
good,Not enough laborers. But decent and kind work place.   Lifting rims all day . Putting them on the conveyor system to get id. To either scrap or put rims on the market
good,It was a typical day at work they need a lot of work out in the yards there is NEVER a manager on duty they always have substitutes when it comes to a manger there is never a set person i can go and talk to they would change managers left and right
good,A typical day at work would consist of starting my morning report. The rest of the day would consist of sitting and waiting on customers to call. Made for a long and slow work day.
good,"a lot of hours. need more leadership, lots of good co-workers"
good,The benefits package needs immediate attention. It is not very competitive compared to other companies. The turnover is unbelievable. The management team is very weak at the shared service center.
good,The benefits package needs immediate attention. It is not very competitive compared to other companies. The turnover is unbelievable.
good,I haven’t been there long and I’ve seen probably 10 people come and go.  Along with that pay isn’t the best. And they have people who just started who are getting paid more than the people that have been there for years and that are doing less
good,"Everything is not for everybody. LKQ gave me an opportunity to pay my bills and take care of my family, so for that I’m thankful. LKQ has good benefits, and a 401k plan. There are some areas where they can improve and may have improved since I was employed there. Ultimately it comes down to your life and what you need. LKQ is a job not a career in my case. I thought I would get out what I put in but that wasn’t the case at LKQ."
good,"They are not mean or cruel, they just don't care. they will act like they care, but they don't. If you are a good worker they are much nicer and more trusting of you. just don't give them any reason to not trust you, you may not get it back."
good,"It’s definitely a lot of work, the route has a never ending list of places to drop off, almost all of them 30 minutes plus away from each other. The customers are cool people, and the process is pretty simple. Driving the box truck is fun as well. I had a good experience overall."
good,Which is why i am still there.  I love the hard work.the pay does not come close to being appropiate for the hard work and the raises are pathetic. Mgmt doesnt really care aboout us but whatever. Always looking for something better.
good,They put work before your children and family unable to communicate with them if there is an emergency. (No communication by phone or via email). Plus not being paid enough for the work performed or duties.
good,Just like most work places you go to work to work. The coworker were fine. Management are the ones that need training to learn how to talk to employee
good,The manager I worked with before being laid off was very poor. Had never been a manager before and didn't know how to be in charge.  He laid off people due to lack of job requirements.  Very poor management.
good,Mid-level management are great buy upper management don't take the time to talk or listen to guys that have been doing it for over 10 year and they are new in there places of management.
good,"The  Representative position in this company is not very organized, The training was sub par and at times I felt myself questioning the information I was giving the customers. The job itself is simple but gets very hectic very quickly."
good,"whatever you are hired at, that is what you stay at. No chance of advancement no chance of additional income. all your phone calls are recorded. no sick time."
good,8 hour day work. Worked Monday- Friday. Insurance and benefits. Management changed twice while working there. Enjoyed operating equipment there.
good,"A typical day at lkq is processing cars and trucks that have been picked through by customers. So when the cars are pulled from the yard they are brought to the back of the facility to  be broke down. There are three areas in the processing department. Wire cutter, motor breaker and tire guy. I was the motor breaker, before every car got crushed i had to break down the motors, i had to take off all aluminum pieces and parts off the motor and transmission and also cut all the wire off the motor. I had to flip the motors back and forth on the grond in order to do this.Co workers were good Management was very poor. The most enjoyable part was going home everyday.My payrate was 11 dollars an hour."
good,I moved up very quickly in this company but there was bad management and owners.
good,"Overall, the environment was usually very good. Communication from management was lacking. My region had a lot of cronyism, some plant managers hired many family members."
good,I love the company and my job as a Route Sales Lead.
good,"LKQ is a very micro-managed publicly traded company with little to no advancement opportunities. I was told several times that I would be moving from a sales assistant position to an inside sales representative position and it fell through every time. I had to actually move to a different department all together just to get a raise, but the project was falling apart. Management verbally praised me for my hard work, but did not show it with a pay increase or advancement. Not a place if you are looking for a long term career. Why are multi-billion dollar companies always the ones that pay so little? Except for their highest management employees, of course. The employees that actually work their hearts out to make the company money and move ahead get very little."
good,Based on a hourly payed employee. Company offers 401K to its employees. Good company to work for as a manger or accountant. They are salary. Regular employees don’t enjoy many benefits
good,"Went to work painted bumpers all day, went home. Not much to the job besides being on time and getting your quota. Not enough pay for my likings though."
good,"As soon as i clock in i get all my work materials ready, I work in all elements of weather rain or shine. Then i get started by doing a cover sheet on vehicle, take pictures, then I create a dismantle report by putting all working and functiong parts. My job consisted of inventorying 8 or more vehicles per day."
good,was switched to night shift with no questions asked and when i first applied i had mentioned to them i can't do night then a year later i was forced to do night shift.
good,LKQ is a good job to work for they have plenty of overtime and they paid pretty well also the management could use some help on responsibilities and communication other than that good job to work for.
good,First of all is an awesome place to learn about parts. Love working with machine and customer. In every job you have pros and cons. In this warehouse people love pointing finger instead of finding a solution of the problem trying to find the person whos guilty to get him/her fire. Ideas come from workers but they leave it in the air. First of all the warehouse people know it all and see more why they don't ask the employees for ideas. How to serve our customer better or how can we protect ourself from accepting merchandise that's not our. My personal experience is best to work together and give opportunity to others.
good,"Easy job, coworkers are great to get alone with. Supervisors are not easy going. Overall I gained a lot of experience the short time I was there. Its a great place to work."
good,It was a good place to work at the time.  It was fast paced. I learned a lot of skills and for that time It was a good place to work.  The management was fair. Over-time was always available (in fact over-time was essentially mandatory). They provided a free lunch for the staff once a month. It was a decent place.
good,"You will never do better at this company than the day you were hired, no progressive pay structure, minimal advancement from within.  Management does not reflect on the impact actions take on staff."
good,Working for LKQ formerly known as Crazy Rays I learned tons about vehicles and was able to master learning every part down to last sensor. Long days but u earn every penny.
good,"no matter how much you work hard, it goes unnoticed, people below you mysteriously move up with no experience. lots of favoritism, and lots of finger pointing for careless mistakes"
good,"They train, but you must have your own tools. The work is based on commission not hourly, must wear safety glasses at all time, work place safety. Manager never leads by example, never wears his safety glasses, always talk down on employees like calling them stupid, and verbal abusive."
good,Its a way to make ends meet and put food on the table! Very dirty environment in the old building; I'm not sure about the new building! Can be hard work!
good,"Based on the time that I worked at Keystone, it was a challenging job, that required long days, and very few rewards.  I was treated fairly, but was expected to do more with less.  Too often ideas for improvement went no further than the management, where they most often went unrealized"
good,The job was stressful and I did bit enjoy it.  The environment was dirty and unfriendly.  Management was uninvolved and unfriendly.  There was no attempt to provide comfort for weather situations; i.e. heat.
good,dont understand why it forces you to fill all of this out but i didn't enjoy working here and they had very unreal expectations for there workers and just threw people away very easily
good,"In the morning I would arrive and help set up delivery routes for the drivers. Then I would write the returns for the customers. Then I would have to coordinate with the return specialist to reduce shrinkage and maximize stock. Then I would have to schedule lunches, coordinate deliveries, set up sales orders for the day, etc. With only half hour lunch."
good,It was good but very unorganized. No one knew what was going on daily. Broke down trucks daily.  Management cared very little about it's employee's.  Didn't work with OSHA regulations. Nothing else I can think of.
good,"Working at LKQ-Keystone was decent in my opinion. The major turn offs for me were the lack of structure in management, and the hypocritical behaviors. There were times in which i got yelled at or cussed out by a fellow employee that i reported at least 4 times, and i noticed that nothing seemed to change even though people higher than me said it would be taken care of. The overall attitude of the people that i worked with were quite negative management or not. The training is left at the learn as you go level as their training material is not very accurate to the work you perform. Also you get trained by other people doing the same job, but everyone does everything differently. I was training with someone who does quite a lot of things incorrectly in which i had little to no idea what i should or should not do. All in all i would say that working there was equivalent to working in retail with the environment and attitude."
good,i worked here for over a year. once i hurt myself they fired me as soon as i asked for workers comp. i was a foreman and always did my job to my best ability. always meeting quota.
good,"Has benefits to avoid as they remove too much from pay."
good,"Very busy, fast paced work environment. Multiple opportunities for experience with different types of equipment. I learned a lot about safety, equipment, computer system, auto parts and working as a team to get the job done. The management needs work. The workplace culture is friendly among warehouse personnel, but warehouse does so much work and doesn't get paid well for their efforts. The hardest part of my job is to perform all of my responsibilities in 8 hours time. Understaffed, underpaid, and overwhelmed. The most enjoyable part of my job is putting stock parts away. It is really fun sitting in a swing reach truck putting engines and transmissions away."
good,"LKQ is a large company that takes advantage of Hard Workers, an is short staffed so expect to the job of 2-3 people. Its Very Dangerous working with electric fuel lines. These are outside jobs so be prepared for the Heat."
good,Very pleasant place to work. Learned a lot about the Salvage yard industry. Took Pictures of inventory. Worked thru some reports.
good,"Regions is a good company.  Great benefits available, and the pay is good too.  The people I worked with were good people as well."
good,LKQ is a good company to work for but the management and organization is very poor and can be unprofessional. But overall the job itself is nice being out on the road and doing deliveries.
good,no room for advancement and poor compensation for deserving employees love the people but there is nowhere else to go fro where I am at been with the company for 5 years and making less now than when I started
good,"As in any job, there are good and bad aspects. For myself, the bad outweighed the good and it was time to move on. The people were fine."
good,"need a new managment team, co workers are good, called cust to verify purchase of cars, cut checks, dispatched tow trucks"
good,"The company was poorly managed and extremely divided. Too much gossip and not enough work. After I left for maternity leave,  I was immediately rehired back to Source One and given a promotion upon starting back with them"
good,Know people and car parts to succeed.  Can be a tough culture for job advancement.
good,"Typical every day we basically do things the same. We must have a lot of patience in working at LKQ. I have learned we can provide better customer service working as a team. Being a manger in LKQ is different, they don't treat us as how any employ has to be treated. over working every men and not paid well."
good,"Always on the go, never a dully moment. Dealing with customers and truck routes on a daily basis. Dealing with customers accounts and issue's. Learn how to handle customers in a very positive manner and resolve the problems at hand."
good,"the day would start early and end early I learned the if you want to get ahead at this company you have to be family with management, whos nice until you mess up then they bring the world down on you. most of the coworkers are great but there are some who would throw you under the bus for a bag of chips but the hardest part the job is the lack of communication between management and employees and the most enjoyable part is end of the day and payday"
good,Ran a billion dollar company like a ma and pop corner store. Unorganized and dysfunctional.
good,"6-2:30pm, enjoyed learning the CNC machine. Company was just bought out but did not change management. Again, employee's are replaceable so they don't go out of there way for better employee training. Co workers were great. Always willing to help."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of heavy lifting, driving / operating Hi-Lo machine and helping customers."
good,"fun and hard working environment, no mangement support, 12 hour days, employee christmas partys and bonusess, paid vacation and holidays,"
good,Work day is from 8am-6pm
good,Tgis place is too micro mamaged and gigjer up management does not want to accept fault but only to  sgow fault on there employees. I started as a night shift worker and moved to a night supervisor than to a car dismantler.  It is a simple get you by job untill you find a better imcome.
good,decent place to work dismantling vehicles figuring out how they come apart learning how manufactures put together there vehicles finding modules can be a pain
good,Benefits are a lot per pay check.people are good to work with lots of standing at times.safety is number one all wear your PPE before you walk into the building.
good,Management has a problem respecting employees. They are too busy looking at emails to manage the yards correctly. Lazy employees are told nothing hard workers are asked to do more for less.
good,Overrall its okay but is mismanaged. They're no incentives. All of the members of upper management will hand pick there buddies to move up in the company rather than post the job to allow any employee to apply.
good,Needs to be more Diversity with Woman in Leadership. A proper mentor ship would also be great to have and the right tools in order to advance your career.
good,Worked there 3 years lost touch with everything around me because of working 6 to 7 days a week 10 hr a day. I did learn alot about various types of machines and cars
good,Decent job but not much advancement opportunity at my location.  Typically long hours with poor morale.  Systems and procedures are poor as well.  My department lacks any supervision or daily management.
good,Good company but upper management in the W1 and W2 are horrible do as I say not as I do type managers. They protect themselves and step on anybody to get to the top. I enjoyed my time with my facility but upper management made me walk away.
good,Not satisfied with current employment. the pay is too low. the managers do not respect warehouse workers. they do offer medical insurance dental insurance 401.
good,Good place to work for the right person. Typical corporate company. After a while you begin to feel like a number not a person. For most anyone in the bottom work field it is not a bad place to work.
good,"Working for LKQ was ok, not place where I saw potential in personal growth within the company. At the time, I worked with a manager that threaten jobs, therefor I did not feel comfortable. After he left the new depot manager made improvements, but at that time, I was heading out. Responsibility was to load a box truck with vehicle parts and delivery to body shops."
good,"Not a bad place to work as a dismantler, very fast paced with virtually no training on how to properly remove components. Decent pay and great benefits where the upside to this job."
good,"LKQ is a very fast pace, stressful place to work. It's management pushes you to reach goals and does not mind it's employees to use underhanded tactics to take sales from other employees."
good,"The job is a pretty typical driving job. It's hourly so you never really know how much you will make from week to week because the work load is variable. I have been there for a year and only got a 40 cent raise, there is no sick time allowed and the PTO balance is a joke."
good,"fast paced , ricdicoulous gps / software , unruley supervisors  ,always waiting for am shuttle truck to get back so getting out late in pm route then driving a hour to start stops  so ya actually dont start your afternoon route on time"
good,Good Job !   If i was paid more I would love it.  The only con is there are not many advances to be made within the company.  I tried and got no responce yet
good,Es un buen trabajo  tela pasas bien pero lo malo son tus beneficios
good,A typical day at LKQ consist of you help the drivers load there truck correctly. After that you go to the main office to grab your orders from the pickup box sort out your paper work and pull your orders in a fast past. The hardest part about the job was working in freezing below temperatures.
good,Up at 0530 o be at work by 0600. Worked from 0600 until 1800-2000 hours at night 5 days/ week. Drove from 200-300 miles/ day delivering parts and visiting new potential customers over 7 counties. Workplace was volatile at times. Truck maintenance was lacking and never had snow tires on trucks. Best part of the job was meeting new people in the automotive business.
good,"No advancements, Easy job, Cool people, Low pay, Ok environment, lots of new people low high low high low high in a dirty area"
good,"This is a wearhouse job, unfortunately they don't have a night shift premium, and there is not to much room for growth. It's a fast pace invoronment, coworkers are great to work with."
good,"The job is dirty /physical and u will ruin your clothes, no reimbursements, and u better know forklift. This ain't just a driving gig..other than all that, the warehouse guys seem pretty cool til they leave for lunch while you're stuck unloading/stocking all the heavy ****!"
good,"Started off better than expected. But soon was difficult to understand   the direction versus expectation. In the end, it was better to move on and try something else."
good,"(keep in mind this may vary from warehouse to warehouse)"
good,"A typical day here for  me was hot and very physically demanding which i enjoyed most days. I got along with all co workers, i learned how to install cylinder heads on automotive engines."
good,"I categorize 5-8 motors a week. I also order parts for the supply room, dismantler, and mechanical equipment."
good,"LKQ is ok but not to much room for advancement,"
good,"a typical day at work for me is very productive"
good,"taking orders, invoicing customers, collecting money, checking in stock, keeping shelves stocked, delivered products, put them away made sure customer didn't need any thing else. Greg liked to mirco manage which kept most of us unhappy. Most enjoyable part of my job was going out on deliveries and chatting with the customers."
good,"Nation wide locations and branches to find work."
good,"great people and managment, but layoff forced me out, i had fun and it helped feed my family"
good,Purchased over 100 cars weekly from various auto auctions purchased for 5 salvage yards self service ie pick a part and full service salvage yards lkq southern calif and lkq north valid my territory WAC from San Diego calif to Los Angeles calif Monday thru friday
good,"Fast-paced, productive, hard-working environment"
good,"I went from delivery driver to dismantle manager in 8 months time.... Operations Manager saw my potential, site manager didn’t like me.  It was ok when I was a driver, a driver trainer, or even driver supervisor. But as soon as I hit Order Fulfillment Admin I was trash to him. It seemed that no matter what I did I did it wrong, despite being thrown into a position with absolutely NO training of  kind I felt that I took it over and mastered it quite well. And then was bumped"
good,It can be better if the environment was better. But working with good employees and meeting new people on the road was good. And you get the chance to atleast get to know about cars
good,I dislike working for this company. I'm only there because I'm now looking for something better. I feel over worked and under paid. My co-workers dont pull their weight so the work load is placed on me.
good,"I've enjoyed it here but it's kind of everyone for themselves. Just do your job and finish it and you are good. Management watches and pushes you to finish on time. Heavy lifting is used all day, 2 15min breaks and 1 30min lunch."
good,"Our manager boast about safety, but when brought up or if something happens, he doesn't show signs of caring. We had someone die on site(cause unknown to me), but the lack of managers taking lead for the person who was dying was poorly handled. When many associates tried bringing up ideas on how we can safeguard future happenings(ie:defibrilator, emergency equipment), they were blown off with, ""That cost too much, or that is unneeded."""
good,No chance for advancement . Legacy hires people that were hired when company was sold to LKQ . location is to small for what there trying to do can't operate equipment safely.working in cold and rain . nobody cares about there job. constantly training new people on crusher side
good,"Underpaid and over worked, Worked for LKQ over 3 years,  it was fun at first but after the new revise of company made it so noone could make a living only working 1 job"
good,the job consists of various different jobs at high pace rate on a time schedule from loading and unloading trucks to picking and stocking the warehouse to receiving products and labeling
good,Low pay for the cost of living in the area. Long hours just to get a decent paycheck.  Benefits are expensive and not the best. Flexible with family/work life.
good,"No proper manager other than that ok . Plant manager asking about  political views and not much more , it also  was unhappy when people working would not speak to it .. That meathead manager should have had his face soaked in the toilet ..."
good,"Hard work. Very busy. be prepared to work in the elements. at 8 am, identify engines and parts that were to be recycled and then tag as such. also, identify engines and parts that were to be restocked. enter into the computer accounts that were to receive credit for recycling.Then boxed all cored engines and transmissions.Secured them in box by binding them. With forklift transported to scale to be be weighed and labelled the weight on boxes."
good,It's a good place to work team playing environment alot of hours not that much paying involved as getting a raise.  It's alot of hard labor work . And dealing with customers at times
good,I liked working there I had fun with the people I worked with got along with everyone it is an easy job if u like to work on or take cars parts off an tearing engine apart.
good,If you are a go getter you can make seriously good money with this company.  You usually need to go around managers to get things done so it can be quite stressful.
good,LKQ focuses on the bottom line and views most employees that work in the field as expendable to raise their profit margins.  High demand for results with little employee compensation.
good,all my co-workers are all good people to hang around with they will help you out with anything that you ask them to do and my customers  are very cool
good,it was slow paced heavy lifting stocking with a forklift that required multi safety harness and maneuvering procedures had to be learned we supplied car parts to auto companies and dealers so it wasn't easy.
good,i worked there for over 2 years and i loved working there and being around all the cars... But management had no backbone when it came to the employees being professional.
good,Has it's ups and downs but mostly downs there is no room for advancement. Management needs improvement and they need to focus on fixing the small things.
good,"A typical day at work for LKQ starts at 6 am.  You work 10 hour days and suppose to only be 4 days a week. However my line was generally behind for whatever reason and we would be on mandatory Friday with the occasional Saturday thrown in. Your working in a hot factory where things would break, be missing or you would not have a fan to keep some what cool.  Management stayed in their cold a/c offices and would come out only when necessary.  The work its self and co workers seemed to always be good.  You are working on huge 200+ lb engines and had a  quota.   Hardest part of this job for myself was lack of support from your management or maintenance team.  The most enjoyable part for myself was working with everyone, everything flowing, no equipment malfunctions."
good,"Went into the job knowing very little, but everyone works with you to make sure you learn and understand everything that goes on in the workplace. managing my life and work was pretty difficult though, the hours I work don't leave much time to take classes."
good,"LKQ is a fast paced automotive call center that deals with retail customers, body shops and insurance adjusters all over the country. I love the knowledge I've gained about the ins/outs of the business and about the parts themselves, be it engines, transmissions, rims, etc."
good,"GAP are lax due to the system being used. Modules available are not being used. System is not set up for Canadian companies."
good,"In the time I had worked here, the management team was very rude to me, and the plant manager had lied about workers compensation cases. This is a great place to work, but do to the nature of the business your prone to injuries. Management was my best friend until i got injured, then they did whatever they could to burn me."
good,I would say that the most enjoyable day of my job is when i have the chance to see a smile on my customers face when they are having a bad day. when i walk in the room no matter whats going on i try to leave my customers with a great experience and a smile because i can see that the person before me had upset them in some type of way so for me i know that in order for me to have a great day is by me saying something funny or just doing something kind that will show them that someone cares and that tends to go along way because i know that the next one behind me will have a better day when they see the smile and joy ive brought to that customer
good,"Handling many accounts, with stipulations with each account. Management is changing many procedures to improve customer growth with the national accounts but keeping up with the changes in a short amount of time can be challenging. As I am keeping up with the changes, the incentives bonuses need an to be increased outside of sales."
good,On a daily basis i go in at 5am unloaded the tractor then proceeded to load my truck. once my truck was loaded i got invoiced out then started my route. Each day is different never know what time your going to get off &you never know when your going to have a double route. The management could be a lot better there is a lot of unionization in this company.
good,"Des patrons à l'argent non à l'écoute de leur employé, du travail toujours sur le rush mal organisé... résultat (faillite en 2013)"
good,"I processed returned product for reentery into inventory, Processed credits for costumer, Approved all credits, assisted sales with returned items for resale, assisted dispatch with retunred items for redelivery, assisted nmanagment with store store retunrs and credit processing of those returns. The most difficutl of this job is the realization that the company will not ever put me in a postion to be as successfull as I would like.. The most enjoyable part was dealing witht eh numbers and the accounting duties I was assigned and assisting others it working to make the company more profitable. Managment at the store level was adiquit but lacks vison at the highest level and at the coorperate level believes that turnover in the returns department is due to inadiquete staff instead of an excessivly high returned product to manpower ratio.."
good,open at 5 a.m. unloaded and receive parts from truck. segrigate orders for delivery over 10 routes. send & receive emails all day long concerning parts and orders. complete all daily reports. check stock and order supplies. separate and distribute orders all day. close at 5 p.m. I've learned shipping and receiving. further experience managing more people. managemeny has turned over in the past year and has not yet acclimated to the place. the hardest part of my job is trying to accomplish too many things in the day without proper support and time. I enjoy being busy all day long and using several different skills to accomplish a variety of kobs. I am the go to guy for almost everything at the plant.
good,Good luck to all that apply to work for this company. Be prepared for anything. Lots of people around. Very informative when you need something. Competitive pay.
good,It is an ok place to work. some times I it was hard putting up with the other coworkers spit personalities and constant death metal at high volume. it never seemed like I could do enough work to have the boss happy.
good,"Worked there 10 years, lucky I had many clients, therefore I made great money. It’s a base salary but when you sell a certain amount it’s great commission."
good,"It was a decent place to work. I got along well with co-workers and I got my job done every day. Could of be some improvements in certain areas, but other than that it was an all around great place to work."
good,Managed retail and commercial accounts and logistics in a high volume atmosphere with minimal error accepted.  Time Managing and Creating accounts keeping customer service to its highest degree possible.
good,"Taking care of customers needs such as parts delivery/returns and making good friend's. "
good,"There wasn’t enough money paid to the employees for the amount of work. The first manager was the best, the second didn’t seem to care one way or the other with how things went."
good,"Challenging goals, but achievable goals."
good,The management when i left was the biggest problem. They had unrealistic expectations of order fulfillment. But pay was always really good. had great benefits too.
good,"Fun for the first six months while training. Then you lose half of your hourly wage but get a .25 commission on every sale unless it comes back.bad or wrong. After 9 months they put you out on the main floor and then you get paid ,25 commission only. Just swimming with pirannahs."
good,Good place fun team work management change good hour and benefits cool environment when I worked there nice people.........................................
good,LKQ started off all right but it became very stressful seem like people didn't care about their job becoming more trouble than it was worth almost seemed like they didn't care about their employees
good,average place to work people were cool pay was garbage  lots of perks and company freebees  the christmas party was fun we had a good time and they provided rides for intoxicated people
good,I rode around on an electric picker up and down isles picking orders for customers as they ordered recycled auto parts.  Very little breaks and one small lunch.
good,"Awesome supervisors and easy task, just the pay is kinda low & raise arent often.. I would definitely recommend this job for people to learn more experience working in a warehouse, lot to learn here."
good,I enjoyed working there for the most part. I felt they didn't value their employees. I left for a better opportunity and better pay. the day to day work was challenging and fulfilling at the same time.
good,Night shiftget quiet at night and boring but you work on your own pace. Some people just rude in the am schedule !!bunch of dumb f$:! Really tho night guys are chilled ! But yea if I like night shift go ahead and go for it!!
good,"the day would normally start with the assignment of the parts needed to be pulled that day. then yard vehicle inspections where done."
good,"It's a job. Hardly anyone does what they should. Gossip everywhere like a high school. Benefits, health dental vision and kinda low pay and doesn't acknowledge working harder or learning and trying to move up. Hardly any raises. Tells you to work overtime if you need more money instead of looking to give out raises when earned."
good,A normal warehouse job; it is a bit tedious and the workload can be overwhelming at times. Great place to get experience for warehouse work. Lots of opportunity to pick up slack.
good,Ready For Grunt work hard wok low pay no form of moving up . only thing i seen that was cool was when they would give out free boots/food catering after sales days
good,"Keystone automotive is a great place for people that like to work hands on. There is also a lot of things you can learn such as forklift operations, order picker, pallet jacks. Also has a number of insurances and benefits."
good,"Mostly fast paced sales environment. I was given a sales area that no one had been able to break into, and though I didnt meet the stated expectations, I brought sales up in that region way above what had been achieved before."
good,"You get plenty of hours but you are always short on supplies and rules always changes, but all in all they work with your schedule for appointments and stuff"
good,This job was tough because the actual warehouse was 3 hours away and everything was supposed to be done 3 hours away. If you had a problem to try to get an answer was tough.
good,"You will feel as if you're family working here. The pay is not great, but the time you will have with your family is a plus. I only wish that they paid better for certain positions. I could not live off of what I was making with two kids."
good,Pay not good for hourly employers. There aren't any standard operating procedures for any functions. Many hours to work as they are open 362 out of the year.
good,"Good place to work, enjoyed my daily duties. Would refer this company to others for employment. some management was really good but upper management can improve"
good,"Very ooor management no one took responsibility in wrong doings, coworkers are t dependable favoritisms drives good workers away, money was the only concern to management of employees safety"
good,"The culture is great.  Friendly, helpful colleagues and most of management is eager to help you find the best practices for your position.  Benefits aren't so great--insurance is pricey, no sick time, and it takes a while to move up to accruing a good amount of PTO.  Only six holidays per year. 401k match is great, though!"
good,"I have been in almost every position if your a hard worker and get your job done they tend to want you to work everyone elses job too! "
good,fast paced. get it done and do it right or go home. management doesn't really care how your supervisor talks to you or treats you in any work environment.
good,A lot of upper management issues. People need to look at the support instead of the roof. The people in the company weren’t bad and my co-workers made it bareable but other than that it wasn’t the best environment.
good,setting up car and draining them of fluid other than that i did not enjoy the job it was not organized and the manager did not respect his employees i did like working for him
good,Fast paced. Always busy. Over time. Decent management. Not a lot of pay raises. Different locations so relocation possible. Good people to work with. ay
good,"Long days and hours, asked a lot with out management giving much direction or input  3 managers in a 9 n=month period.  Left in the dark about  operational problems ."
good,"RV is not the industry for me."
good,Pay is base plus commission so earning potential is there. Some management favoritism. Good work environment. Great co-workers. Some communication issues between sales and delivery
good,"fast paced , very competitive, some department clashes, communication level low, reactive instead of pro active, a lot of closed door sessions not all on same page"
good,Working for lkq was a good experience I learned how to drive a box truck & deliver used car parts. The work environment to me was to stressful on certain days they made you feel like you didn't want to work there no more.
good,work was easy besides when it rained but could have paid more. The management could have been better also lots of uncertainness in the work place. Decent beginners job.
good,its ok but dont expect a great future unless your a manager because some of the leads can be a little hateful and jealouse if your a real hard worker.
good,Jobs ok but pay is horrible for the jobs I do. I don’t the warehouse workers got any incentives. No room for advancement and raise are very low when given.
good,Help customers to make sure the correct parts are delivered in a timely manner.  Not a good learning environment but like working with my team members.
good,when i first went in a had to put 8 to 10 wheel in the strip tanks for it to strip the paint off the rims then after that take it to the blasting machine to it clean then send it over to the detailer.
good,"Great place to work, hard working knowledgeable people.  Accessible Management makes it easy to get buy-in and advance initiatves"
good,Would start at 6 am truck already loaded for parts to be delivered to customers. They tried give you a set route so you knew what your stops were every day. Would get hours if someone else needed help after your done  could help them
good,good place to work just very corporate and production based not customer service long hours nice people was laid off because of my hand writing was no great
good,quality control in warehouse is horrible. parts being inventoried when they should have been junked is a problem pay isn't the best but it is decent..
good,"Selling used auto parts there are a lot of things out of a sales persons control until part arrives. Could be damaged, broke or possibly wrong. Then you have to try to find another in a timely fashion. Your pay is rated on how much in parts you sell, but with a high return rate you scramble to keep parts sold."
good,This company has a lot of room for growth although the upper management seems to be all connected. It still seems like they are figuring themselves out.
good,job is ok need more room to grow and better pay. people were nice and friendly but for the work the pay is to low. canr make money......................................
good,System was easy to learn.  Coworkers were friendly and helpful.  The location is very accessible and close to major routes.  Good referral bonus plan.
good,"Job Work/Life Balance               3"
good,"great people great benefits great place,lots of bonuses, mangers stand behind you with no doubt. company is world wide has many benefits, even gave out free gas on productive weeks"
good,Manager was never around he would leave work and watch sport games. Other workers where slow and put off work to me. Alot of work but no order and a lot of favoritism
good,its a good place to work as long as you've been there several years..if you are willing to get bounced around a lot and dont mind then this is the place for you
good,"A typical day at LKQ consists of cashiering, checking in people, I buying cars and answering phones. it is nice to have a flexible hours. I do wish there was better communication and teamwork. It would also be nice to recognized for do things."
good,A typical day at work includes picking up deliveries from the depot and taking them to different destinations around Yorkshire. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and the hardest part of the job is being on the road for long periods of time.
good,wanted to stay they hired old employee I was temp to hire thought everything was going good old employee wanted his job back guess he was better than me
good,ok job people would try to set you up to get fired cause its a dog eat dog company but pay was good just people were not. just stay to yourself and do your job.
good,"It's a great company. I did order picking, shipping and receiving. Also made deliveries to the customers. I had to relocate to California to be closer to my mother which is sick"
good,working at LKQ is good and cool but i was forklift certified and they didn't let me operate the forklift and i was certified but i didn't know any thing about cars i learned how to strip them and take off parts
good,"Learned to be a team player, responsible, reliable and punctual."
good,Management was very lax in handling harassment complaints and if you complained you usually got the short end of stick thought it wad my forever job but let it go just short of 8 years.the day i quit i felt so much lighter
good,For anyone that needs a job place is good to work for take care of there employees for the most part should have been make more money but not so well working me a lot then can handle
good,": Driving a 26ft box truck and semi truck with a 53ft trailer. Delivering auto parts to customers, unloading parts using a pallet jack. Filling out paperwork and receiving payment form customers"
good,Some unique benefits as far as discounts on Car parts. If you own a Car Lot or your into rebuilding cars working here is a great opportunity. And you learn alot about cars as well.
good,"Now outsourcing to other countries, too much work put on every person. Hard to advance its a clicky culture.Not given the right tols to do do the job."
good,"In my 3 years at this company I learned all the essential functions of warehouse. I learned to receive and count product using RF scanners as well as time management and organization. Management however was the reason I resigned. I felt I was not being treated the same. My Other Co-workers were nice and hardworking. Most of them. The hardest part was not getting enough OT. The most enjoyable part , like a lot of other places was working as a team and getting the job done."
good,"Lots of cars and yard is a mess, little management direction shop is not heated and is a mess very unsafe with stuff thrown everywhere not the ideal work conditions"
good,fun and friendly place to work great place to work discount on parts and tolerable co workers if you need personal time off the manager tries to accommodate you
good,"Management is out of touch with what the staffing needs are. They would rather hire 10 inexperienced workers that wont last, then pay a deserving good employee. started 10 years ago making 10 dollars an hour missed only 1 day due to sickness and only finished as a supervisor making 15 dollars an hour. They do not pay well. health safety only addressed as required by inspectors. not a safe enviroment"
good,"This job was an outdoors job which consisted of dismantling cars and cutting up the chassis, along with building creates in which to crate and shipping the car parts. I learned some automotive mechanics.  Management changed twice within the time I was there. Some of my co-workers were friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job was having to perform duties on snow covered grounds.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working during the Spring and Fall months."
good,Challenging job every day. Always something to learn to help you grow and gain experience. Could of used a little more upper management support in the beginning but taking the harder route without any guidance has made me a stronger self taught professional in this industry.
good,LKQ is a very diverse workplace. There is a lot of room for advancement but the lack of management organization is a major problem.
good,"Partschannel was bought out by LKQ in a month. Do not know  job security in the future."
good,"Lack of communication, the flow of communication between departments just wasnt there. several of the employees were unhappy due to not knowing what was going on from one minute to the next."
good,"LKQ is an excellent organization. Management goes out of their way to create a fun workplace on a day to day basis. "
good,"*Visiting customers daily "
good,"General manager way to involved, always oversteps boundaries."
good,"A typical day at my job would consist in receiving and shipping vehicles all day, having to clear check in slips, putting paper work in order and in the right place and also being very organized."
good,Taking parts off of wrecked cars to re-sell. Learned about cars and different parts. Hardest part of the job was the long hours.
good,"Because of the nature of their business, a sales employee is exposed to a variety of requests for different parts for many different cars."
good,"never a set time to leave. if your work is done, then you are done."
good,manque de communication entre les divers paliers de l'entreprise
good,"I have worked in every department except dismantling. Inventory, Sales, Quality Control, Stock Management, Yard & Building Maintenance, Shipping, Loading Dock Forklift Operator, and Front End Loader Driver. I watched 3 Plant managers come and go; all of which I served loyally and without question. I was giving the opportunity to obtain an education, and feel with all my experience & schooling that I have out grown my position. I leave with life experience and wish to better myself, and my situation."
good,"I keep in contact with locations and keep track of 1500 employees, co workers are great to team with"
good,"As business manager, I have commercial responsibility for achieving annual sales and profit numbers - both are set annually. I have been exceeding annual targets YOY."
good,"Hired for to help transition the start up of a new branch located in Cleveland , Ohio."
good,Great place to get your feet wet in sales. Not a lot of advancement opportunity. Very laid back atmosphere.
good,This job does not provide you with a chance to advice with the company. You're not compensated for going above and beyond your job duties.
good,Could definitely value employees better. Not much room for advancement. Didn't feel appreciated for things done beyond regular duties. Had to go thru the trenches just to get the same pay other drivers were receiving. New drivers were being hired at a higher rate of pay than employees who had been there for years.
good,"Difficult to advance but not impossible.  Pay is lower than average for location.  Work is hard and oftentimes thankless for the manual laboring employees.  Cattiness and nepotism are definitely seen, but my experiences with management were usually fair.  Training is never a priority and rules are always broken.  Laid back environment."
good,Load your truck and hit the road. Management is on point and you only see them an hour or two a day. Your truck is your office. Returns get redundant but all in all a good place to work. Just did not give raises that were substancial.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is that you are on your own."
good,"mainly outdoors work,in any environment. work could be dangerous if one isn't paying attention. one may work 6 or 7 days a week depending on staff availability."
good,Being flexible and able to muti task as well as continually re prioritizing work schedule is a must . Continually on phone taking orders . Must be able to complete tasks timely
good,I work with some of the most interesting people while i was at LKQ. We most coverstate about work ethics and what people was most good at. I enjoyed it.
good,"Good place to work,  I learned a lot working in this positions.  The management was good, but they didn't seem to work together.  It was a good environment, no stressful at all."
good,This is somewhat a sales job only without commission. Must be able to work weekends. It’s not a bad company but benefits and paid days off aren’t that great.
good,"Very busy for the most  part, especially if your the top performer.  200K every month"
good,Overall good place to work.  Good work life balance. Casual atmosphere.  Management was very flexible and helpful for training. Enjoyed my hours and position and responsibilities it entailed. Will miss co workers.
good,"Some of the longer longevity staff seem to make the place a lot more pleasant to work in while the Operation's team comprised of the operation manager and branch manager seem clueless about making their staff feel respected. There is no real incentives for increasing performance and the turn over is high."
good,I learned a lot being an employee at LKQ. I made a lot of life long companions. I also learned so much about the automotive industry.
good,"as the title says was a fun job but poor management overall, dont really know much else to say excepting i learned some valuable skills"
good,"Loading drivers bins and unloading trailers. keeping the wear house organized and stocked. "
good,"A typical day at work included, filling out customers orders, replying to customers via email, answering phone calls regarding items listed on eBay, acquiring pictures of product, listing 10-20 items a day, and helping to maintain a vast E-Commerce selection via eBay. "
good,"I really enjoyed working with auto parts and I have really learned a lot, but when it comes to a specific car part with all these new hi-tech vehicles. There is a lot to learn and it is very easy to order the wrong parts and delay the repairs and we all know how that feels. My co- workers were very helpful and wanted me to learn but they couldn't be there for every call and management was not the greatest when it came to training. Over a longer period of time I may have been better but after 90 days its commission only and I could not take the pay cut for the lack of training."
good,"Enjoyed the new experience and being a part of a good team."
good,A lot of wrong parts and broken things get brought out to customers. Seems like the amount of work load is a lot to handle for how few people work there.
good,"This place may not have been the healthiest place to work, but the hours were consistent, the pay was decent, and the coworkers were more like family."
good,Inside customer service representatives typically are hired at the same pay received at their previous job. Over time the hourly pay is reduced and replaced with partial hourly and partial commission. Eventually you are paid 100% commission.
good,The managers are nice we keep a well-organized area to customers are nice the workers are nice they don't pay too well no no razor one year she can for chance of advancement
good,It was a ok job management alittle off but good job had some overtime they like to give it to you then cut it sometimes put too much work on one person still send friend there for jobs just won’t go back my self
good,"Probably not fair for me to review this company.  I was the only corporate accountant at PartsChannel retained by LKQ, and I am grateful for that. I left this job due to the long commute, low pay and lack of challenges.  What I observed is that hard working employees were rewarded with raises and opportunities for advancement. This was not the case in accounting."
good,This job gave me all the knowledge i needed in a corporate environment that i needed at such a young age. Im very thankful for that opportunity. Great people.
good,working their was good with nice colleagues but  they also should  understand the problems of their employees  for example when i was seeking for swing shift for almost 1 months before my college was about start they did not give me any night shift jobs after promising that they will give me one.
good,"The summer  was the best time  because  the company would  let us barbecue, and dressdown on Fridays. Also anyone  birthday  would  geta cake from the company.medical  and dental  was pretty  good providing you pay for medication, but beside that it was a good  place to work."
good,they were very angry people the hours were long but pay was good they seem to be very inbedded in them selfs the company is ran by family and if you aren't in then oh well
good,It was ok place just alot of drama there and management does nothing about it. Alot of people get away with alot of stuff at any other job they would of been fire like you suppose to take a 15 min break some people take advantage of it and come back a hour later and nothing is done about it
good,"Typical work day included, pulling correct parts for customers, putting parts into the right bins while stocking. also using various equiptment to do the job effeiciantly."
good,Responsibilities included transporting automobile and semi-truck auto parts to area mechanic shops. It's a good place to work great people.
good,fun place to work/decent amount of politics..red tape ..all though very flexible....all around ok..i guess ok place to work ..no advancement
good,Sale is transitioning over to more electronic and less about the actual people. LKQ is looking to maximize profits and pay their sales people less.
good,Company over works me and very much under paid for all the duties and responsability that I have to do.
good,"Overall working culture is good.No stress but the pay scale will be less and it depends on the department to which you are going. Pay-scale for procurement will be less, even their hike also."
good,"Learn a lot especially on Car parts , love working with My Auto shops in different areas ,  Love the hours and it’s a Monday tru Friday job weekend off . It benefit me with my kids school schedule."
good,It was a fair place to work I had been with this company for quite awhile and technically if it was for me relocating I would keep this job. we rebuilt oil heads and tested the product as well we had a particular amount of oil heads that was suppose to pass the test that day.
good,"I started as a entry level position & worked my way up as a loader operator. "
good,"I enjoyed working here because, i was taught alot about body work plus the few co-workers that would talk to me were really cool and bright folks and wish them the best for them and their family's....."
good,"LKQ is a good job to work at if you can get hired on full time, I was off and on for a year but it was a easy job and a great work environment. Thank you"
good,"Its a fair company job well security, you will gain all of experience and knowledge there and also in the automotive industry by working with repair and body shop."
good,"Answering customer concerns and questions"
good,"Great place to work!"
good,"daily - always busy "
good,"While one did the same duties daily, the only thing typical was that one never knew what to expect when arriving at an account. The driver's position requires strong organizational and interpersonal skills. It is helpful if one can influence the account contact to prepare the original paperwork and box/wrap parts so they're ready for return processing upon the driver's arrival. The most enjoyable part of the job was establishing relationships with customers. The most difficult part was learning all the parts and, later, searching for them through the heap on the parts shelf in the morning to load the truck. It can be mind-numbing simple at times and a royal pain at others, dependent upon customer attitudes - some will push you as far as they can in order to attain a discounted price. Most co-workers were very cooperative to assist you and even make it fun at times.There are many responsibilities, but the pay is low. Unfortunately, the company makes the mistake by not placing a higher value on the position and the type of individual needed to conduct business in a manner that promotes a better company image. Yet, if one can perform the functions and be a responsible adult, one can have a job for a long time here, if that's what he wants."
good,My time with LKQ has gained me invaluable experience in a different work setting. It is so completely different than what I had done previously and yet I was able to translate some of my experience and knowledge to them.
good,"They pay cars dismantlers by production, good benefits offered to employees, hourly rate employees are low compared with expectations of production, safety and team work."
good,"Amazing manahement, they have a few kinks to work out in the budget area dont keep the trucks up and running but they are so laid back it makes worth coming to work because you can joke with management"
good,"suite a mon experience de vente sous pression , je n'ai guerre apprecier, les patrons demande a tout les jours de vendre plus et de developper des nouveau clients, et le reste de lentreprise focus a trouver des defaut dans la compagnie et a gerer plus que travailler."
good,Lkq wasn’t too bad. Most of the employees have been there for a while so it feels like you get way too far behind. But once you get the hang of the machines and what needs to be done it’s a great job to have
good,"A fine job to pay the bills but requires long hours, a lot of patience when it come to management and customers, and a hard working attitude. That said if you come in and do your work you will find a fair pay and a solid job."
good,Fast paced parts pulling and inspection. great lower management.i learned shipping ups from them. truck deadlines can be a bit stressful you have to hustle when the time comes.
good,"SaI was hired under the pretense that i would be handling both customer service and sales.  I came to find out that the aspect of customer service was not necessarily enforced.  I did enjoy the work itself, however the work environment was not what i was used to or looking for in a career."
good,Everyday getting the parts on time. I learn how to identify parts. Management was friendly and energetic working with employees. fast pace and dusty. The hardest part of the job is getting everything done at a minimum amount of time. The most fun part I enjoy is riding the forklift and writing up RMA.
good,Day is consisted on taking calls up to 220 calls accomplish sales making in between dispatch drivers for p/u either residents or business it can be relaxing environment but you have to meet the goal each day.
good,Management and Personnel are really awsome to work with. The coworkers are down to earth and real team players that will help out if too much work is put on you.
good,I am punctual and on time. I am also hard working and dedicated to the job. I want job security and a good working environment. I want a rewarding job and can lift up to 100 lbs.
good,It was a great experience for me when i worked here. I enjoy working on cars and tearing stuff up and I got to do both at this job. I would recommend this job.
good,"The place was good to work, but they had new people and supervisor and they didn’t have the Necessary skills to supervise and doing things the right way."
good,typical day would be me coming in early to help out on the docks loading trucks. then go to my regular job either breaking down tires or doing fluid recovery and some tow motor work. i learned to work hard to achieve my goals. Management was very helpful and always there to answer any questions or concerns. The hardest part of my job was breaking down tires alot of wear and tear on my back. My co-workers were very friendly and just a joy to be around. my most enjoyable part was going to work everyday.
good,Maintained above average quota weekly and fast paced always steadly moving and improving every day some days will be easy and some days will be challenging
good,"Great company, locations have a lot to learn on life work balance, compassion for their employees as well as proper training for managers and hr. Operating programs need to be replaced with better to handle workload of all locations."
good,"theres no room for advancement, no raises for cost of living expenses. top out pay is not to great. company has a very high turnover with workers. people come and go"
good,"good place to work on variety of vechiles and good work atmosphere when managment isnt always micro managing,good starting wage and great hours clean enviroment"
good,I would love to continue my stay here but I really don't se any advancement here or muc of any raises. Managers are always negative and never any positive encourage. They only see your faults and never boost your confidence. They make you look and fell like a failure.
good,"Day started at 7, load my truck for the route and did deliveries. Came back and loaded for a second round of deliveries. Some days my day ended at 6, some days at 3."
good,LKQ Corporation is a great company built on some strong ideals however it is going through growing pains as the company grew too fast.
good,starting the night i would check the doors for dents and delivery location then set them in the right door rack for loading and delivery. Then i would unload engines check for location and set them in the box for the truck rout they were going on. Then i would get three trucks for the night to load and check for every part that was to be delivered on my trucks roouts. Load the trucks then park them for the drivers in the morning.
good,"A typical day at was somewhat ok. Wasn't too please with the hours,the hours were very brutal and exhausting. For the most part it wasn't as bad at times."
good,"Over a typical day there are many challenges one faces.  This is not a problem.  Management is there to obtain goals, which are met. Hardest part of the job is trying to obtain unrealistic goals. Most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that my actions directly affect customers."
good,The percentage of profit for the company vs pay for the sales emplyee is way off.  and every manager tells you something different when it comes to the expectations of yours sales
good,"Co-workers are hard working"
good,"Fun, fast paced place of employment. Co-workers made the days worth being there."
good,"a typical day at work was dismantling 2-3 cars a day and/or operating Volvo l90e front end loader"
good,"It’s just a job. Clock in, do your job, and clock out to go home. No pat on the back for a job well done or a thank you.  All they care about is for the employees to to their job. No family atmosphere at all."
good,"Management tried its best to organize everything. Employees were rude, ghetto, it was like attending high school with 40 yr old woman. Management was constantly rearranging seats due to ""drama"". You were off 2 days a week, usually on the weekend. You have to be working there for years to have a mon-fri schedule."
good,"typical day at work is not always busy but when it is, its super busy from open to close and sometimes have to go in on weekends. Which I don't mind the over time. Working for LKQ i have learned how to completely rebuild transmissions and differentials from scratch. I've learned how to dyno transmissions, pick from inventory, move inventory to different location and look up inventory in ITRACK software. The hardest part of the job i would say would be knowing all transmissions by model number off the top of your head. we get sooo many different types of transmissions and differentials in on a day to day basis. The most enjoyable part of the job would be getting to do different things and not always doing the same thing day after day. I get to switch it up maybe once a week when needed. and getting to learn new things is the best."
good,"Working at LKQ was very boring, with the position I held you pretty much do the same thing daily. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with."
good,"The job is very slow paced and not challenging. I feel like I am not being utilized to my full potential. Also, management is unclear and sporadic. There is no standard here. Coming from the government there is a certain standard set for work, employees, and management and this is chaos and confusion."
good,Pretty good place to work. it has its ups and downs. suggest getting use to long hours and some drama. Most of the employees are pretty cool to work with but just like any job you will have to get use to the clicks.
good,Needs new management major issues there high turnover rate and constantly being moved around frown on overtime for most part all around good job high stress job good pay for region
good,"I enjoyed going to work everyday, and would have loved to keep working there. It is a good place to advance within the company. They hire with in and make it easy for advancement"
good,Typical day is run your route and hurry back so you can get off in time to beat the traffic. Most days the loader don't load your all you parts and then you are short on route.
good,"LKQ is  a great place to work for , corporate just changes things around way to much to for it to work out. I worked for LKQ for 3 years, which i loved my job. They recently fried or moved 4 people out of the office and placed the work on me with no help it was just over whelming ."
good,Customers call in to open a claim on their engine  or speak to a technician for information about their engine. Their isn't really anything hard about the job. The enjoyable part is working with my teammates.
good,"A temporary job but, I loved it there, learned a lot about Payables, great management, my first letter of recomemdation was from her. Hardest part was leaving because the department relocate to another state..."
good,"The years i spent working there was overall ok i had some problem with speaking to some employee,due to the fact i dont speak spanish. management was find,and i love to weld."
good,"LKQ Keystone is a pretty good company to work for.  If you are a male gender  you will do great with this company, they are pretty old school here.  They have inside sales positions and a rather large warehouse, one of the largest.  Training is great, they are very computer driven as well."
good,"I enjoyed working for the company. I started in sales, delivery & shuttle driving, & finally office assistant in wheel production."
good,"I've been a delivery driver for the better part of 25 years. I've never had the opportunity to work for a Fortune 100 company, or, make a better income than $40,000 per year!"
good,"LKQ is a relax and flexible environment . The job itself is great.,The salary is not  all that good . There have been many left to improve incomes. If the salary more competitive this company would be excelent place of employment"
good,"I am not one to take down on an employer but I simply didn't feel like my opinions or feelings were taken into consideration."
good,"Great quick enviornment take calls all day over 100 calls a day ,  ruchasing vehicles from customers who call in and let them know what paper work they need to sell car"
good,"My job entitled dismantling cars in a yard including cutting for body repair and pulling parts for customers. The job was very intense but very rewarding. "
good,Très belle entreprise qui mise sur le recyclage de pièces de véhicules.
good,"LKQ,OEM."
good,I put tires on machines and took them off of rims. I learned how to take tires off of rims the proper way. Management was very strict.
good,"Good company to work for, with good benefits and long hours."
good,Over all it was a good place to work and I'd still like to work there but it burned to the ground.and now I'd say even less of them cause I was a temp getting ready to be hired in n it burned down now I'm not getting payed to the end of the year like the full time employees and I don't think that's fair at all being the good worker I was n now I'm stuck stugglin during Christmas season.
good,"-Slow and easy at night"
good,a typical day was driving are working in warehouse pulling parts are running a fork lift. learned dissplin and decision making skills.was shift leader at one time and got tired of that and went to doing other things.I guess the hardest part of job was switching hours from day to day. Seeing satasfied customers
good,Love it would work there again. The people there or cool and will work with you still have friends that works there.💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
good,"Fortune 500 company providing used and new automotive parts for retail, service and collision shops. Publicly traded so always concerned about analytics and profitability."
good,Great place to work they need a little help with the commercial drivers area. They need to learn more about rules and regulations and the everyday operation of a class A vehicle.
good,One of the better jobs i have had. Lots of opportunity to move forward. Good benefits and pay. Co workers are friendly and welcoming. Raises in a timely manner
good,"High pressure boiler room type atmosphere. Money to be made at customer's expense. No team work, dog eat dog. Deliveries and pick ups are a hot bed of contention between warehouse and truck deliveries. No information updates given in a timely manner. That makes it hard to keep customer informed on their product deliveries. If the product can't be deliver on time and customer is not informed everyone loses."
good,"I have learned about different car parts and its functions."
good,On the days i work their its a great place to work i learnerd how to sandblast and use different power tools and learn about different car parts overrall a great place some streeful days because of the heat
good,Great place to work great people to work with but every job makes promises they don’t keep despite the years you been with them they hav great benefits
good,"LKQ great company! The management has a really care for all there employees. Company pay and benefits were awesome, I had to leave LKQ due to my change of hours shift with my personal life."
good,The plant manager has been very supportive and great with all of the employees. He makes going to work a very good experience. Overall good place to work.
good,At my work it was very on your own to make decisions very poor dispatching skills on their behalf had to take the initiative when it came to decisions and very poor work environment at times.
good,"The training at LKQ was hands on. The environment was nice and quiet so you could get your work done. Management was very understanding. Overall, this was a great place to work. I would recommend it."
good,"A typical day at LKQ keeps you moving. I learned how to do TIG welding, use of cherry picker & fork lift. Some members of management have a good time to help the day. The workplace culture depends on who you are. There is just no room for advancement."
good,"you have to put up with rude customers on a daily basis , you search customers tool bags  coming in and out the premises ,  and take the money from the customers paying to come in and if they buy any car part you have to engrave it"
good,Easy money; poor management. Lots of unnecessary drama. Strict rules that no one follows. No one enforces unless you do something to enrage management.
good,LKQ was good place to work for me. My managers and co-workers were fun to work around. Typical would consist of me labeling and kind of being by myself.
good,LKQ is great company to work for. As a previous  employee I recommend this company to anyone looking for great working environment. it's strives for excellent customer service.
good,Show up on time and be prepared to work hard and at a fast pace. Very upbeat work environment with very knowledgable co workers. Long hours on Mondays but once trained right the right person will fit right in.
good,"A typical work day would be answering more than 200 calls a day, speak very professional and coordinate merchandise from long hours on a computer screen."
good,Warehouse manger was the best I ever worked for in all my life can't ask for a better then him. Environment was ok it's a warehouse very understanding people loved it.
good,It is great place to work in . It was a bit stressful and the supervisor always stresses us out and the fact that we had to be there at 4 in the morning was tough but it paid well it was pretty chill I liked the job
good,"Like with any Company it's what you make it; I enjoy the hands on approach so LKQ works great for me.  With that being said if you need all the widgets in place and available to you to direct and guide you from point A to point B this might not be the company for you."
good,It was a very fun and great experience working for this company. Very decent benefits and very lively co-workers. I believe this job was a very good learning experience for me. I love  physically demanding jobs and this job was just that.
good,A average day at work I would come in get a vehicle into my bay start by removing the engine and transmission from the vehicle after removed I would split the them apart then pull all other good parts off the car tag all parts for them to be stocked in the warehouse.
good,"Not the best, a lot of smoke blown up your butt. Not. Lot of advancement opportunities. Once you're hired on in a position you pretty much stay there."
good,"Good benefits. good work ethics. great hours for nights. We had some unfortunate water damage over the holidays, and Rapid Restoration DKI has done all of the repair work to fix things.  Josh and the team have done an above and beyond awesome job!  The crew is polite and friendly, and they work hard and fast.  If you ever find yourself with a home or office repair job, these are the guys to call!"
good,"Hand sanding  with DA and make any repairs as follows: hot air welding, stick welding, high and low spots, and sand blasting each auto bumper. Paint each bumper in a nice finishing primer, place bumper under heat lamps push through assembly line. Detailer finish bumper for prodution"
good,"Travel on a daily basis to cover large territory in lower Michigan.  Great co-workers in the sales department. Must be self starter and self motivated.  Sales in business to business, cold calls, and maintaining established customers."
good,"A typical work day is minimal challenging, basic job, great for meeting new people and companies."
good,"A typical day started by getting a pick ticket and then start picking items on ticket in a timely and accurate fashion."
good,A company with competitive pay and training structures.  Great overall team vibe within the management platform.  Very diverse with their future growth vision.
good,The hours varied we were able to get as much ot as we wanted everyone got along well management was young but they did a good job.
good,"At LKQ, where my father works, I would go into the office after 7 on Fridays to help my father with inputting data. My job consisted of manifesting returns, inputting driver information, and scanning returns to be sent out the next day. I learned how to use different computer programs such as Excel Spreadsheet and Microsoft Office."
good,No room for advancement and no pay increase.  Enjoyed my job but very small department. I learned so much about receivables from here.
good,Trouble shooting for the customer. Sales . Paint mixing and matching. Customer service.
good,Deadlines were unattainable and the turnover rate seemed to higher than average.
good,I think that LKQ is a great way to get your foot into the Work Force
good,"Process invoices,prepare wire transfers, learned car parts. Quiet atmosphere. Just sitting for long periods of times was the only hardest part of the job. No problems with management and mostly enjoyed co-workers."
good,"I work the typical 930-6 8 hour shift sometimes we are offered overtime which is nice. The pay is nothing to what we have to deal with, there is hardly vacation time given. I love most of my co workers the ones who have been here the longest we are all pretty close. Yet we have new people in and out all the time because they hired non qualified people for the job. Hardest part of the job is keeping the phones from ringing."
good,"Throughout a single day I'll be bouncing from job to job helping out others and they make it easy to learn things in order to help/ make operations run smoothly. I'd scan parts to it's appropriate location, restock supplies in the middle of the day, clean, and review parts and possible damage and make sure it is properly noted in the tag if the part is being stocked, brace and package parts. Management is decent. Not the best in my book but they keep up with what they need to do and they do their job. Although, there are many moments where I doubt their managing skills. Co-workers and team leaders are nice and work hard for the most part. The hardest part are the busy days (especially in the winter). We're usually understaffed so it makes things run too slow if we get backed up, but it does leave room for overtime. The best part I'd say is the choices we get in how long our lunch can be, how early before our starting time we can come in, and how late we can stay."
good,"worked for LKQ for 12 years , I loved sales and working with my customers and fellow employees , I didnt like a rotating sales commision that always took money out of my check and fell on deaf ears with management . Also was no advancement possibilities and felt it was time to move on ."
good,"I am in charge of accounts, and all cars that enter the yard. I do inventory and account for all cars and parts. I work closely with other yard co workers and sales co workers. I know my job well and don't find anything real difficult. I enjoy working with others and getting my job done by the end of each day."
good,"Overall, LKQ was a great place to work, just didn't work out for me and my family."
good,"There is minimum job advancement, management has favoritism to certain employees overall relaxed work environment. Good team work job a team effort oriented job."
good,fair amount of hours. provided uniforms so yours personal cloths where never damaged. Good teamwork all around. Got discounts that were pretty nice. Paid holidays
good,I started as a dismantle tech.  I was in training to become the inventory specialist of the salvage division. I was learning the ropes quickly and enjoyed my co-workers and management.
good,"The management was very lacking when I was there.  But since then there is new management, it could be much better now."
good,I did like the job but never see the the managesment really care and how much timen and dedication workers put into his company and when it come to the year review seen to care about a compensation to our hard work.
good,Environment was ghetto. Some workers hid and went to sleep which left the work load more than normal. Could work as many hours as you wanted. They were not shy to pay overtime
good,I choose not to answer this field but site is forcing a response so I am filling it in with this statement. Having to list a description of work life at a company you are leaving is not good for them.
good,"the people I work with mainly are friendly and helpful, except some of the people like to bad mouth other people instead of helping them fix the way they are doing things to make them a better team member."
good,"Certain depts of LKQ need more training than others. Management needs to understand that moral is important and without their employees working hard underneath them, they wouldnt be where they are today"
good,A typical day at the job is to fufill daily functions of our production facility. We must produce certain quotas for the month. Fast paced and must be able to multitask
good,"Le travail d'équipe est important, et travailler dans la bonne humeur, beaucoup d'heures, surtout l'hivers."
good,I come in Early read my e-mails touch base with my General manager and ware house manager see what needs to be Completed for the Night. I learn how to adjust the work flow and daily reports needed and try to reduce scrap and adjustments to ensure Customers get product they ordered in a timely manner. We work in a hot warehouse gets dirty sometimes but my job is to insure all work and reports done by end of night / shift. I enjoy training new younger Employees showing them skills from a Managers perspective and how the Operations work so they get an Understanding of the day to day operations what makes it run efficient.
good,"I really appreciate the opportunity this company has given me and I love being able to contribute to the team. But as of now, I'm really looking for a company where I can showcase my many skills and abilities ."
good,"Typical days consists of approx. 200 calls depending on your customer base pertaining to all sorts of customer service issues, be it sales, quotes, tracking, etc. etc. You really have no directive from management other then don't undercharge for shipping and don't sell the wrong part. As long as you are in your seat most of the day and working hard management really doesn't even know you're there. The hardest part I feel about my job is trying to satisfy everyone's needs even though sometimes there are things that are out of your control. The customer isn't always the most understanding of things, and you are the one to take the verbal beat down. It's really not that bad of a place to work if you take the time to figure out the ins and outs, then tailor it to simplify your job!"
good,"You work hand in hand with the owner generally. He is a good guy, willing to go out and work in most conditions, so you do mostly work year round, biggest problem, you don't get paid until he gets paid for the job."
good,I believe I was let go due to another co worker talking badly about me behind my back and taking credit for a lot of things that I did.
good,I enjoyed the environment at this particular job. The work was fast pace and I enjoyed that.
good,I loved being at this job..I have grown as a person and became an even better employee..
good,"answering phone calls,taking quotes and ordering parts for the customers."
good,start at 7 unlaod truck stage parts to certain loc load truck .manifest any chem. and on your way to the deliverys all work was extrmly fast pace
good,A lot of hustle to get drivers out of the door during the morning dispatches.  the management team could use more training in leadership and HR related items.
good,"Was a sales rep for the RV side of the business. Manager could have been more in touch with us but just repeated  what upper management told then to say. Didn't really go to bat for us and threw us under the bus. If I had a better manager, would have been a much better place to work."
good,No advancement. Old man wont quit or move on to the upper room. Almost a year no raise. Job gets hotter and harder everyday.  Some people just do the most
good,LKQ has a small but good management team. I'd recommend working here for someone that is looking to finish out their career. There isn't really any opportunity for advancement to speak of and the compensation is lacking.
good,"Overtime had to be approved, great managers, adequate training, Physically demanding work, use of power equipment such as forklifts, swingreach, and one-man lifts. Need some computer skills and general knowledge."
good,LKQ was a very easy company to work for. The management staff was very helpful and supportive. Upper management often spent time to develop a culture of success.
good,Take apart engines/vehicles and label part for resale.  The hardest part of this job was the working environment.  The shop is open to the weather and the yard is dirt.  It is a junkyard.  I enjoyed taking the vehicles apart.  The workplace culture was stressful and fast paced.  Management was always cooperative and helpful.  I learned how to take apart vehicles and the engine that came out of it.
good,long day at time learned how to help every one when I had time lot of paper work hiring people all of the customer that came in to just talk being in management was a hard thing at time
good,"Overall, not a bad place to work. Salary is okay, but could definitely be better.  PTO needs some serious help - sick time and PTO are combined. Annual increases pretty much never excede 3%.  My manager was great, but many in management positions tend to micromanage.  If I were a younger person, I wouldn't hesitate to stay and work my way through the corporate maze to advance into management.  As it is, I need faster advancement and higher salary."
good,i liked working here most enjoyable part was the work environment and the people i worked with very good management team over there always provide me with overtime opportunities that i thankfully took advantage of
good,"Overall, A great job experience, but lacks team communication. In most areas of operation, day to day function was normal, but lacked communication from management teams made things complex at times."
good,Working at LKQ was a demanding fast paced job.  Multiple phone lines continuously going off to take payments from drivers while still counting cash and balancing all the bags from drivers on the previous work day.
good,i like going to work everyday didnt have a problem with anything.The management was good good hours pay was ok alot of driving but for the most part didnt have a problem
good,everyone gets along good and its very fun for everyone to come in and wok withone another. management lets you work through your mistakes and guide you in a good direction.
good,"It was a good experience, however, not a always busy job.  There was a lot of down time during the day especially during off season.  The job has a friendly environment and an easy stepping stons into call center in bound life."
good,"i enjoyed working for lkq greatly, all of the co workers got along phenomenally. i learned great leadership qualities, seeing that the turnover rate was quite high that left me and a select few to step up and lead by example."
good,"I worked outside all day in extreme heat. No raises. Wanted me to help everyone else instead of just doing my job, which set me back."
good,"Review end of day reports from following day with sales team. Have a brief meeting with general manager. Monitor sales calls while agents are on call. Answer phones to create sales and promote items. "
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job - Responsibility of working with multiple General Managers and Regional Controller for 22 sales location.  Provided special reports, operation improvements and daily"
good,"A typical day would be fairly structured with time schedules to keep and quotas to make, but as long as you do what you're supposed to when you're supposed to do it, you shouldn't step on too many toes. It's a pretty laid back atmosphere where most everyone appreciates humor and sees the brighter side of things. I never had any issues with co-workers the entire 5 years I was there save for a few management problems, but these were somewhat easily rectified with a mutual compromise one way or another. I learned everything I know about the automotive recycling business from them. It's an amazingly complicated and logistically challenging business to be in and from what I've seen, and the other similar businesses I have had personal contact with, this is one of the best places in the business. They are an international corporation, and being as such they obviously have the prerequisite ""top brass"" that has absolutely no idea what's best for the workers, future or the company itself. I met most of the executives for this company and some were just like me, some were bean counters that only cared about the investors and the bottom line, and some were completely hopeless and you had to wonder how they got that far and that successful, but this is all par for the course for any corporate entity such as this. That's why I never held it against the company. I was very happy where I was and after all, what's the point of working somewhere unless you can all gather around the water cooler slinging mud at the execs, right? The people that were my peers were always quick to help any way"
good,Team environment with constructive competition for incintives. Will miss the guys something awful. I was only female on the yard crew and I felt right at home.
good,A typical day at LKQ office is just like any other well respectable companies. I make sure all the jobs are deligated and make sure its completed at the required time and i handle the time scheduling and team building.
good,Plenty of room for advancement if you are willing to put in the effort to learn new skills. Promote from within culture. New HQ is clean. Compensation and benefits are subpar for the amount of work expected.
good,"A typical day is very routine. I learned a lot about sales and customer relations. Management is very corporate, and micromanaged. Overall moral is low. The hardest part of the job is lack of stimulation, The most enjoyable, however, is getting to meet some interesting people!"
good,"It's been a great place to work and improve skills. The people are committed to excellence and the success of the company. For as large a company as it is, the company still has a family feel to it."
good,"Lkq is a good company for those who are into the automobile business.its a fast Paced environment and very competitive, long hours wich can be very stressful but overall it's good work place."
good,It really is fun and rewarding to work at lkq. Management is changing and the company is always evolving. I truly enjoy writing at lkq. Everyday there is something different.
good,great hours and pay most of the people are nice management was ok not the best I seen other then that it was your day in and day out 8-5 type of job..
good,"Fast paced, with daily work task. A bit of a hostile work environment, best part was working with my friend and working as a team to finish our daily task"
good,One day they talk of promotions and the next there's no more work available. The work was ok but no job security for temp workers. Recieved on the job forklift training.
good,"Not a bad company to work for.  If you want to learn and gain experience in the automotive industry, this is the place. I definitely recommend. I've learn a lot @ LKQ...13 yrs of dedicated hardwork!"
good,This highlight of this position was working for my Manager. This Lady was great. It was a pleasure to come to work! The location was a 25 minute commute for me. I was able to work with the Branch Managers to get things done in a prompt manner. I enjoyed talking to our customers and assisting them with their requests.
good,"As whole I liked LKQ the particular branch I worked at had the good ole boy system all the ""management"" was a buddy. as far as the understaffed part they always wanted more than anyone could give and not get overtime.  example 2 returns people to 20+ drivers and counter sales."
good,"Great company overall. Worked here 6 years and worked through the rankings."
good,"LKQ has potential to be a top employer, but they change policies weekly and their retention rate is very low. They constantly fire people and there is not a real sense of job security."
good,Great Place to be. So many growing pains.  Great work environment.  Outstanding management and learned so much everyday about business in general as well as the variety of business that LKQ is involved with it was never boring.
good,"Learn alot and it was a new experience, like working with my team leaders and help customers,"
good,"The best job I have had post military. I really enjoy working at this position and job. As stated above I can go no further to advance my career. I am excited to share my knowledge and skills with my future employers to grow together in a long term rewarding opportunity. My current position is in a fortune 500 company and has excellent benefits.My typical day at work is anything but typical."
good,"A typical day at Keystone for me was arrive at 5:50 AM, prep my work area / paint guns, and paint roughly 200 bumpers in an 8 hour day. What I learned was how to paint in a production setting at constant speeds. Management was overall easy to work for. Didn't have much of a chance to get to know the co-workers that well because I would be at my 20 ft paint booth for my whole shift. The hardest part of the job was painting the larger bumpers in a limited time. Most enjoyable part was being able to always have work although at times the production line would need to be shut down for extended periods of time."
good,I learn the abilities and skills to operate a straight truck in confined spaces and narrow streets in downtown Los Angeles LKQ is a good company to work for especially because they offer good benefits as well as 401k. They also help with tuition reimbursement if you decide to go back to school.
good,"While working this job I found that it was very physically demanding and would probably be better for a younger person. Overall, i got paid decent for hard work."
good,"Everyday is something new. There are many positions and opportunities at this company. They are all across Canada, the US and Europe. Opportunity to move locations if needed."
good,"The management team is very good. They are ready to help in any area you are struggling .  The management team is easy to work for, they care about you at work or not at work, they call and check on you when and if you miss"
good,I enjoyed my time with optimum it was a great experience and it also gave me my skills I needed to win in sales. Also the leads are great the company takes care of their workers
good,I loved working there and could see myself getting a career there. I was not ready for this adult of a job. I got pregnant and was dealing with a lot of mental health problems and was fired. Would recommend it as a job.
good,"Working in supply chain, I found the upper management team to be the most brilliant I have every worked with. Now on the RVP,DM, and branch level, I can not say the same."
good,It's an stressful environment. The managers were not friendly or helpful at all. I prior experience with the cherry picker so I fitted right on in but for a person learning to operate a machine it could be detrimental because the managers was hands on with us employees
good,"great place nice people to work for. everyone happy so make it easier to get along. you can learn new thing everyday here with car parts, and always room to move forward.."
good,"Buen ambiente laboral, solo faltaria mas acercamiento al trabajador"
good,The hours are most flexible with my quality of life. Hours are sometimes available to help when short handed. Fellow co workers are always on hand to help w/situations such as part availability and knowledge of parts .
good,I would load my truck with orders. Then deliver the orders. The company was very generous.  You get paid leave starting the first day. You get medical insurance after being there for 30 days. They have a 401k that starts day one and they match contributions up to 4%.
good,I loved working with this company! I was able to learn new skills while enjoying the work i was assigned to. While being in charge of the reception position i was able to gain better customer service skills which i feel will benefit me in any job i purse later on in my career.
good,"My typical day with LKQ was to download or pull invoices, enter into the Oracle system, offer field support for offices around the US, reconcile accounts and discrepancies. "
good,"Great overall place to work day in and day out !!"
good,"At times, you had busy periods but the overall work atmosphere was very laid back and slow paced. As long as you were getting your work done, you were fine to pretty much work at your own pace."
good,"A really good environment, lot of great people, benefits and all around friendly co"
good,the work that is required is not difficult but it does require hands on and motivations. the daily workflow is very similar from day to day. the GM has an open door policy.
good,"Work 12 hour days Monday-Friday sometimes working on Saturdays if things fell behind. In shipping your day depended on when the trucks arrive. If the trucks arrive on time it would be an easy going day, if they arrived late it would be stressful trying to make sure you get your trucks out on time. "
good,It not a bad place to work for as long you doing your jobs and and be safe out there on the road. And communication with your customer out in the field
good,Started work at the Slough branch which had a staff of 10. Sales / admin / warehouse and drivers. Slough branch  transferred into the Reading depot a bigger operation but was painless and worked well. Generally friendly efficient and enjoyable.
good,This job was a physically demanding job. Because you where delivering auto parts and always had to eat your lunch while driving on the road which was not fun at all.
good,"Compagnie en pleine évolution qui ne cesse de progression."
good,This is  the best company I have ever worked for without a question and would recommend any up coming BDM to apply within ECP / LKQ we would guide and show how to develop and reach any target set with a professional approach.
good,"Good company. Relaxed and safe workplace. However, no raises and no room for advancement. Fun career. Great benefits. On the job training. I learned a lot and consider myself a professional."
good,"I learned how to use my people skills better. I learned how to use computer programs such as excel and Microsoft word. The manager could've been better, but my co-workers were great."
good,"At times, this job could be stressful. More responsibilities are piled on after working there for so long. High turn over rate. I had six different managers in my one year of working here."
good,"Good place to work but after almost 2yrs myself and many of my coworkers have yet to see any compensation increase, to go along with the duty increases. overall LKQ is a great company to work for... If $11 is a fair amount of money for you to live off of."
good,Good work environment.no room for advancement. Really busy always work to be accomplished. Great location and its good learning experience
good,Looking for challenging work environment.  Looking for challenges.
good,"My days at working for LKQ Shaw, were great, it was a great place to work employees were absolutely amazing to work with, everyone was there to help each other out, if you need something done. A typical day at work for me would be getting paper work in order and to start loading the truck of parts for delivery, learning something there was pretty much everyday, there's always room for improving yourself and your skills. Management was OK, and by OK I mean, we went threw managers like a box of your favorite donuts. Hardest part of the job for me was the long hours and being away from my wife and kids. the most enjoyable part of my that job was actually being away from the shop, tends to be real stressful sometimes."
good,"I usually started around 6 in the morning and didn't get done until around 7 almost every day. It's a Monday through Friday job with an occasional weekends. If you like overtime its a good place to work as a delivery driver. Otherwise, you don't get much overtime."
good,Good pay and hours. made a mistake listening to someone telling me to get a different job
good,"Great company to work for, best insurance package ever, but customer service wasn't the first priority."
good,"Job consisted of moving car parts from crates or bins onto trucks using your hands, forklift, or hand jack."
good,"LKQ is a large auto-salvage company that has a well-structured corporate work environment. It's very competitive. Everyday is full of decisions involving large amounts of money, as well as figuring the best retail prices for the company's inventory. The hardest part of the job is being planted in a cubicle for long periods of time and the risk-taking that is involved with buying salvage autos from online auctions. The most enjoyable part of the job is the reward of seeing how much money a car you bought and figured a bid for is going to generate for the company and the fun people that work there."
good,Work day is from 6:30am to 3:30pm.
good,Learned how to repair a plastic bumper and did shipping and receiving and stacked and sorted any and all kinds of different kinds of car parts and learned how to run a forklift
good,"Overall, working for LKQ was a great experience and I thoroughly enjoyed working there. All of my co-workers and management staff were easy to get along with, the work was relatively enjoyable and the work hours were great. I would personally be still working at LKQ if it were for medical reasons preventing me from doing the job."
good,This is a good place to work.  I need a change and not to be driving so am looking elsewhere for work.  I think the pay could be somewhat higher also for the work that is being done and how fast and accurately it is being done.
good,Trained. run my routes on the cherry picker. Hardest part of the job is heavy lifting. most enjoyable part of the job is making new friends. Managed to interact with new coworkers.
good,I enjoyed working at LKQ Corporation. They afforded me training.   They allowed me to go to work-related conferences out of town as continuing education.
good,This was a stable job. You will do well as long as you work hard and show up on time and ready to work. The hours can be hectic sometimes but the overtime is worth it.
good,the beter one in industry on the cars or trucks if you need to establish your family group it is the perfect job to do it
good,"Working at lkq was a good experience, it was good for the time it lasted helping me get on my feet training me and pushing me to work long hours made me become use to working in all conditions."
good,"LQK is a relaxed professional place. It’s not a place that you hate going to, the people there are nice and helpful. The management team is awesome. They allow you to be yourself at work, as long as the work that needs to be done is getting done."
good,"It was a great company to work would love to go back. I loved how understanding they were when it come to missing do to my family. Everyone there was really nice,"
good,"I believe that this could be a long term career for most as the current staff has a large number that have been there 10 to 25 years. "
good,"I love working here co-workers are great,my supervisor is always willing to help me out with any problems that I may have or maybe that comes up later in the day to help accomplish"
good,"LKQ is one of the best job opportunities, I've learned so much in less then 2 years. They have a very friendly staff.  Being a Guard at first was hard because I didnt know any of the part names but with time and help of my teammates I was able to learn quickly and move up to cashier. Then I learned how to do cash control and be in Dispatch"
good,"enjoyable company to work for, enjoy the people and being able to meet new people and learning new and being able to drive thru the valley, and help customers."
good,I received to pay increases in the five years that I worked there. It was a dangerous working conditions environment. It was not a clean environment to work in.
good,"Great job if you're willing to work hard and smart. Effort and common sense are musts, it's not too hard to advance as long as you are able to communicate, put in the effort and work beyond your role. Management cares, they want to make a difference."
good,"Good, solid job. Management seems to be really honest and real people. Decent pay and benefits, with overtime, but not too much to take over your life."
good,Fast pace work environment. Driving and deliver auto parts in a timely manor. Interact with customers on a daily. Collect payments via credit card or cash. Organize paperwork and file paperwork as well.
good,"The managers there were excellent. They honestly got to know you on a personal level and i felt like i could speak to them about anything related to the company, personal or otherwise. The only complaint was the pay as it wasnt competitive at my area. Other sections of the company had competitive pay."
good,A typical day at LKQ was great. I drove a box truck with automotive parts from a lkq warehouse.The staff at lkq were always great never had a complaint.
good,"Don't bother applying for this job if you're not at least somewhat physically fit, unless you're going for a sales position. The staff is very friendly and always willing to lend a hand to newbies, and the yard workers all display a strong sense of camaraderie. Management and HR are alway willing to help however they can, and are very understanding of the fact that one has a life outside of the job. A good place to work, overall."
good,I like to working at lok Q it was a great job to work with satisfying at 40 hours a week plus overtime everyone seemed to be nice you new is an all around good place to work
good,This is a good job with alot of perks. If you love dealing with people and making money doing it this is the job for you. You work on your own out on a route
good,This job requires a moderate to high degree of physical effort--car parts can be heavy at times. Not a bad place to work if you're young and don't mind physical labor.
good,come in clean parts and then start to inventory. i was night so it was diff than from day but after inventory check we broke down trucks that came during day and put into spot according to where its destination was. then we loaded trucks by destination
good,"I really enjoyed working for lkq . The reasons why is because the moment you walk in to work every one greets you with a hello , or a what's up , or even a peace sign or handshake . Make you feel good and want to be at work , feeling comfortable . The work was good , not to much and not to little , consistent . I learned a lot there , working with people and how to get the job done and work lots of hours ."
good,"Going in signing in on P.O.S system daily functions customer service one on one ,checking car inventory,cash handling. Placing and receiving telephone calls, Going to different Job site to collect inventory sheets"
good,Great job for someone living in Cincinnati their warehouse work is riding forklifts and hilo's unloading and loading trucks going through Coors and taking Coors apart must be able to lift heavyweight
good,"LKQ is a growing company ion a very competitive field. I have moved up 4 times within LKQ and have learned everything about Management, Logistics, Shipping & Receiving, E commerce, any and everything about the entire warehouse operations and production. The hardest part is keeping everyone on the same page at all times. the best part of the day is the work, I love getting the job done and leaving with some closer."
good,Friendly people to work with. Pay period sucks every two weeks great knowledge of auto parts discounts for employees to get parts for their cars..................
good,Working for LKQ was great for what i needed which was a steady job that I could go to everyday and make money. The company promotes from with in and will treat you great if you show up everyday.
good,It can be a good job for certain people. It definitely has job security however in working there for 5 years I only got one raise. Some management has their favorite workers and treat them better than others.
good,Depending on what routes you're on depends on how busy you can be. There is some favoritism depending on your race. There is good and bad here just like every job.
good,Good place to work and great people. Management is always there to help and understand workers needs. Typical day is usually busy so the day would fly by.
good,This job is alright once you catch on. You get most of your overtime at the beginning of the week which is good. Weekends off almost all the time. If you like to stay busy and need a steady job this is worth a look.
good,the company was a very fast paced place to work and very fun to work for but they need too pay more attention to the employs who work there and show more respect for the costomers .
good,"Manager wasnt to good, they didnt take good control.  They were no room for advancement.  Favoritism was very high.  The job really wasnt that bad but the management just sucked."
good,Actual work could be trying as the majority of time was outside in Florida. Quality company and managers. Most enjoyable was working on own. Hardest part was statewide travel.
good,Great place to get your foot in the door. Lower wages than expected in relation to company size. Good laid back culture.  Good working hours. Benefits of a big company.

good,come in find out my routes. i learned how to be a very good driver and that you cant take nothing for granted. my co worker were awesome. the hardiest part driving in traffic. the most enjoyable part was being on the road all the time.
good,"I've worked at LKQ for over 9 months and I would say it was the best job I have worked at thus far. The enviorment is casual, you receive your own company e-mail, phone number, and responsibility for handling your customers. Sometimes it can be stressful, but it pays off once you start growing traffic to your phone/e-mail."
good,"Energetic work place with supportive management. Upbeat, fast paced atmosphere.  Opportunity to work with multiple facets of the automotive industry."
good,"My typical day at work was the same as my previous job duties, as this company acquired the company that I worked for.  Overall, I enjoyed working with them, even though it was for a very short time."

good,"Was a great company, I will miss it. The company taught me a lot about culture and going from private to public. It was amazing the two different ways to operate. The growth was amazing to watch and learn how to do it. We learned valuable lessons on how to expand with developing procedures and processes."
good,"heavy workload, month end close, hardest part is working with different attitudes, most enjoyable part completing my tasks. Ive learned more accounting skills"
good,"Great place to work, management was great. I worked almost every job in this place."
good,"Most days consist of pulling customers orders, packing and delivering. After delivered to customers i would stock there shelf's with our product."
good,"Load cars into bays to be process, pull orders for customers to be shipped, customer service"

good,"was great until they moved way out east which added another hour and a half to my day.  Learned a  lot about car parts and how to interact with customers."
good,"good place to work."
good,the people there are like family. Christmas party's are nice the job also can be tough at times because you deal with used automotive parts and it could be a issue at times
good,You will be taking over 100 calls a day and as fast as you can take them. If you have large accounts you can make a killing but if you are new you will struggle for the first couple years. Need to sell 200k plus a month to make a decent living. Great Benefits and 401K
good,". Fun and busy day"
good,good envorment ... great co workers ... some management probs and favorites played but over all good . Some misunderstandings in general that need to be worked out
good,"From the beginning of the duration of working at LKQ to the end, it was a great learning experience. First I began as an order picker, preparing shipment orders of auto replacement parts.

good,learned many new job cultures and how to do daily deposits  car buying managing employee time
good,"Fun Place to work on."
good,"I loved my job but there was a misunderstanding in the end.  Also, they did not keep up on preventative maintenance on their equipment and would blame you if something went wrong."
good,Something different daily would present different challenges from day to day . Breaks and lunch were great department manager would supply outside things like pizza for doing a good job
good,I had a great time working at LKQ. The schedule allowed me to have a work/ life balance and still get the rest that I needed. The pay however is low for what you are responsible for and how much you have to lift. Having the knowledge and knowhow of operating a order picker should warrant a raise in pay.
good,Pretty cool job. Would definitely work for LKQ again. Was my favorite job. Around cars all day and buying cars for inventory. Employees are great and managers were as well
good,"good place to work. always plenty to do. I received my work for the day and I wasn't really bothered much the rest of the day. as long as i was working at a steady pace I was good to go."
good,"Great people and management with excellent work life balance. Had great relationships with local branches and customers, which made my job easier to help them with payment resolutions."

good,Good job great bosses great coworkers but we all say the same thing not paid enough I’m a loader operator making the same pay the yardsman make an hour
good,"LKQ has a laid back atmosphere, until close week, and there close last 7 to 10 days. Everyone there is very nice. The company feeds you a lot. It seems like every week there is some type of food or meal offered. There is opportunities to advance if you are an analyst. If you stay there and work hard you will make it to analyst 2 or 3. I really enjoyed my time at LKQ."
good,Experienced hard labor and ways to go around with out getting hurt on the job.
good,worked for this company for eight years would work there again if given the oppourtunity
good,Enjoyed my time there.Time off for new employees is tough so be prepared to be committed until you do earn vacation/time off. Same as any new employment to be honest. Good work environment.
good,"Great company to work for great pay,benefits and 401K. There is a Lot of opportunity to grow with the company. It takes time to advance, it doesn't happen over night. Strong management team, it seems to be getting stronger and stronger as the years go on."
good,The management not all that great some sale you broke promises and then start rumors about you and not good at all the company is great their employees not so much I believe they need to clean house at the jenkinsburg location very very immature managers and staff!!!
good,I been here going on three years and I'm still at 11 dollars I lift doors constantly been doing every since i started I asked to move out of qc management won't let me I work hard and feel unappreciated we a always hear what we did wrong never good job or you Guy did good
good,"I was a temporary employee here in college, great company and managers, low wages but good people to work with. Nothing negative to say about them...."
good,In the winter months it is cold and in the summer months it is very hot. You get 2 15 minute breaks and and unpaid 30 minute break. Be aware that LKQ employees get treated like gold while temp. employees get treated like trash.
good,I loved being around mechanical parts and counting and loading and unloading material  it helped me learn more about parts.  I now know more about car parts then I did before
good,"LKQ Corporation is a worldwide company specializing in aftermarket auto parts and salvage parts.  I learned shipping, receiving, dispatch and all aspects of warehousing, quality and inventory control."
good,"The company's success comes from its people. LKQ prides itself on bringing and retaining those employees that are hard workers, loyal, and customer service oriented."
good,Great people. Normal hours. Benefits and holiday pay. Everyone that works there is wonderful and friendly and helpful. Easy location. A good place to work
good,I appreciated the opportunities for advancement and the fair treatment at LKQ. It was a fun work environment with  a lot of moral boosting events. I loved my customer base after years of working there.
good,I think I'm a hard worker and do what I'm told to do by supervisor and most of all I pay attention to my job in people around me in that u no its loud n noisy so u have to wear safety glasses n steel toe boots in they give u a uniform to wear so it's a nice company men in women work together
good,"Working at lkq was the best job I had, it was fun enjoyable and I was always looking forward to going to work every day, I enjoyed the people I worked with and all the work I needed to do."
good,"I enjoyed working at LKQ doing Auto Parts Inventory in Gorham, Maine. Great place to start an automotive career. But it was time to move on to more lucrative paying jobs! Great co-workers and Manager."

good,Great company to work with starting off! great training experience! learned a lot while working for this company! most of your time involves being on the road!!!
good,"Good work environment. Organized, and under good management. Coworkers got along, and we had frequent employee days. Like cookouts, and paid lunch days."
good,Management is ok here would rather be in a cooler all day the be in the yard full of iron trains you in everything you want to learn and shows care for the employees
good,Great place to work however it can be a lot sometimes and they do NOT let you pick your hours. There is a set schedule and weekends are mandatory. It’s not a great place if you don’t like to get dirty .
good,"great company to work for, great training provided, and the ability to move within departments is available."
good,"LKQ Corp was a great place to work.  Everyone in my department was friendly and helpful.  I worked with many locations pertaining to their utility vendors, as well as outside services.  I also work on several special projects, i.e. duplicate payment reconciliation, Aged A/P reconciliation, Vendor Maintenance, etc."
good,Management is what ruins this company. Everything else is fantastic. I don't mind it at all I like work during the week and having weekends offs.
good,I got trained in a variety of jobs and learned how to manage my time and money. Learned how to relate to customers and refined my work ethic. Came to work everyday looking forward to the challenges that the job presented.
good,"The job is easy to learn, the customers and management is good, an overall great place to work. This company cares about it's employees, we work as a team."
good,Fun place to work where you must be determined to suceed. All employees leave wanting to learn more the next day. Everyone should apply.

good,"Payroll Clerk"
good,"lkq had many great people to work with and I found myself enjoying most days of work, although the company has a lot of damaged parts that get delivered and you end up coming back to the warehouse as a driver with many parts from designated vendors"
good,Good place for operators starting out.  Stay busy and learn the machine.  three year project underway as of 2/2017.  Would stay but need higher pay.
good,"Good co-workers, heavy labor sometimes. Managment wasn't reliable or consistant. Learned alot about the auto business and my managment skills."
good,Love LKQ as a company. Main reason that I am looking for another job is because I am stuck where I am at. There is no advancement within the department I am in. You have to have an accounting degree to move up which I do not have and the opportunities are scarce.
good,"So far my experience with LKQ has been positive. I do however, feel with my background and education that I should be making $16-22.00 an hour. I was hired at $12.00 hr."
good,"At first, ARSCO was a good company to work for until it was sold to LKQ. Corporate bean counters took over and consolidated operations and moved them to Texas."
good,It was a fun job. Got to tear down transmissions and figure out what went wrong and fix the part and get the rebuild the transmission and find out if it's gonna work
good,"independent work environment , you come in and you already no what you have to do , no micro management. "
good,Need more involvement in Process Improvement (six sigma). Very hard to implement change and process improvements. Need to focus more in that are or they will lose market share very quickly.
good,"A typical day at work is managing my own time productively."
good,"Work with management staff and plant personnel to meet daily, monthly goals. Mentor staff on process, performance, and personal improvements was most enjoyable part as well as working along with colleagues and learning from them."

good,"El ambiente laboral es bueno , pero es pobre la promoción laboral y salarial , además del bajo salario y la restricción de oportunidad de over time."
good,"LKQ is a fun place to work."
good,productive and fun workplace good people to work  around fast paste friendly  environment good place to go for all your vehicle needs open 5 days a week
good,Hard-working attitude is a plus management seem to care about a person don't be afraid to get dirty the people you work with are generally good people
good,"I really enjoy working here, I just need more money for my family and I. Good people, very nice,  just low pay for my experience on heavy equipment and forklifts."
good,"Great people with a great environment. Cold warehouse and pretty hard labor, but worth it. Problems are hard work is not awarded and you don't feel like raises are handed by work habit more as a whole which demotivates a hard worker."
good,"Not the best in terms of advancement and having a career but excellent job security. Co workers are friendly and the customers are great, hardest part of the job is being able to keep up with the high demand but really its not problem with the amazing team we have working together."
good,"come into work with a great group of co-workers, come check in with my boss and then go do my returns and check the parts in and the re wrap all the parts that are ok and put them back into stock."
good,"Early starts, or late starts which I love....Leaned a lot from Safety to forklift operations including but not limit to company operators"
good,It was an amazing place to work. The paint team got along great and we would even go out together after work. While the customers were sometimes difficult to deal with it was still an amazing job.
good,I enjoy working for this company and getting to know everything that I have come to know in the last year since I have started working for them
good,Work day is always busy and flowing. I learned a lot about salvage and recycled parts. Management is easy going . Co workers are a team player. hardest part of job is matching up all the pictures. what  I like best is being able to work with little to no supervision.
good,"Stocking recycled car parts, cleaning warehouse, customer service."
good,"P.T.I. Fill tractor with foul, hook to empty trailer and take to l.K.Q branches, drop and hook, bring back full trail to tampa."
good,"Fast pace work, I learned how to disassemble many different makes and model cars"
good,"A typical work day is me, myself coming in to work, knowing what my assignments are, and getting them done. I learned and mastered how to operate a forklift machine."
good,This is a great place to work. Everyone is very friendly and management works with the employees. They listen when ever you have problems. there is room for growth.
good,"Lack of advancement opportunities makes it hard to consider LKQ as a long-term employer. But, it’s a good place to get experience and learn the automotive aftermarket product lines."
good,"Everyday we followed the same routine, But the people I worked with made it as enjoyable as anyone could hope for in a job. although from time to time we had to adapt to a new way of doing business more efficient, it was never out of the norm. And working outside in a yard is, well, brutally hot here in Florida. But you never knew what interesting topic would be of the day. and playing around was at a minimum, but we knew how to do it enough to really enjoy the day, everyday."
good,Work fast to get your stops done in time. I learned that the customers like when I could help them get parts if they’re not sure about it. The management was very nice and the most joyful part was the customers I  dealt with on a daily basis.
good,"Good company, good pay, management is not very experienced. Benefits were great. Bcbs insurance. 401k. Life insurance. Work never ends and 40 hrs per week"
good,"The only downside is there does not seem to be many opportunities to advanced. The company overall is great and easy going. Ability to work from home when needed. Freedom to have tattoos or colored hair, they base your work ethic on experience rather than appearance. Great benefits, 401k, ability to transfer locations."
good,"The 12 Hour shifts put a beating on you but the place is clean, bright and climate controlled. Well mantained equipment make up for the long hrs. The orginization makes the day go quickly some of the time."
good,Hard dirty work. stressful because of time sensitive business. management is clueless to what is going on. management is just as overworked as staff are.
good,Hndled mostly driving and some sort of handling freight from one location to another within the Southeast region. You had to know how to operate a forklift and cherry picker in order to be successful within your job function
good,"Moving Hoods, doors, rims, lights and other car materials to different locations in the warehouse. Being able to work at my own place listening to music while I work."
good,"to much jealousy with the fellow employees, i was stripping down at least 12+ cars a week when everyone else was just getting maybe 8 cars."
good,Working here has improved my work ethic and management skills.
good,"LKQ has great overtime hours, but many job duties are left for those who work last. Work loads are not spread out evenly to help co workers all leave on time. Working as a team is always the best, but not always available.

Drove about 225 miles a day and visited about 20-25 shops a day. Enjoyed working with the customers to ensure that they got the parts they needed and that those parts were the in the best condition that lkq had to offer. Management was pretty darn good and would work with you to make your life as easy as possible. It was a difficult job and required hard work and fairly long hours. But then, that's why it's called work and not called fun right? I left this job because of health issues that the love of my life was having and she needed my help.

I learned that customers have many different concerns and one must tailor their approach to the customer based on a specific customers needs and attitudes. Management helped with the learning and treatment of customers by showing a good example and always being able to resolve any small conflicts in a professional manner. The hardest part of the job was not being able to have full control over what was available for the customer, knowing that if the exact item wasn't provided, we could not fully resolve the customers dilemma.

good,"LKQ in Massachusetts is an extremely large operation that employees 100's of well trained, customer service driven professionals. They understand one of the most important possessions a person has is their automobile. When your automobile requires a repair , whether it's your personal vehicle or the company owned vehicle you use to do your job everyday, it is a stressful situation that can become even more difficult when the parts you or your mechanic are depending on to complete the repair are not in the condition you expected. LKQ takes pride in working with you or your mechanic to come to a quick, affordable resolution when unexpected problems occur. Many factors come into play when a used mechanical part fails or doesn't function as expected and many of these problems are unfortunately not within LKQ's control. Often times there are additional new parts and installation procedures that are recommended by LKQ to ensure the used part functions to the best of it's ability. If any or all of these install procedures are not followed closely it is the responsibility of the customer and their mechanic to work out how the repairs can be completed as promised. LKQ provides detailed warranty information as well as install procedures for all of the parts they offer for sale - Used , new OE and remanufactured drive train parts all require a different set of install procedures. When a mechanical problem is reported to the LKQ sales staff they immediately put you or your mechanic in contact with their own ASE certified mechanic. LKQ employees technicians for all vehicle makes and models,"

Only bad thing is in my job (Overnight Shuttle/Route Driver) I have to sometimes wait a while for the 'other' trucks to come in (running late) from other branches to be offloaded so I can load out their transfers onto mine,and this can hold you up a bit from 'getting out of there' when you'd like.(makes me run late) But I also understand sometimes things like this can't be helped?? Only other remotely bad thing might be some of the trucks are getting a bit worn out and needing work/replacement? (We've had a few break down,some several hours/long distances from the terminal?)"

good,"A typical day at LKQ for me is very adventurous. I delivered to over 30 customers a day. All of the customers I delivered to was very fun to be around and they always complimented me and tiped me for my service. I learned that no matter how your day started out, there are people out there that will make your day. My coworkers were awesome. We all worked as a team it came to helping each other out. The hardest part of my job was coming back down 75 S. Traffic was heavy. My job itself was easy. The most enjoyable part of my day was interacting with the customers and going home knowing that all of my customers was satisfied with my service."

good,"I think LKQ is a great place to work. It is a company that moved their accounting center to Nashville, TN and took care of their employee's. They work together to help you be able to do your job to it's best."
