bad,"Honestly. dirty environment "
bad,It's not a cool place to work. The management was sorry and they don't care about there employees. This is in Irving Texas . They treat their employees like their nothing
bad,"Slave work. They treat you like a slave. Hot warehouses, management sucks, no job security. If they don't like you, they'll make it hard to work and get your hours."
bad,"Horrible experience, you will be treated as a slave. Management does not care for you at all. They want imposible things. They get mad when your overtime but want a lot of things done in 2."
bad,"I was touched inappropriately by a female employee. When the advances were not reciprocated, it created a hostile work environment.  No one cares. I called the Speak Up line and nothing was done. Only when I resigned was when they decided to investigate."
bad,Management is trash and so does HR. If you have a complaint you might as well quit because your words don’t matter. If you get injured we’ll good luck
bad,"Management was sorry and bosses were mostly womanizers and drunks.Most  got divorces from their wife's and re married worse wife's. No opportunities. I went to night school on their nickel got a masters degree in Marketing and they did nothing with me after paying thousands of dollars on their company education program in which they did away with. They did away with stock matching. Did away with a lot of great benefits for employees. Higher management all got stock options country club free memberships, credit cards and new company cars. Big rip off for the small guy."
bad,"Unorganized and managment has favorites, doesnt value employees, have to plan your time off eight months in advance. No opportunity to grow with the company"
bad,"It's just a means to a end type job. managers lye, through the employee under the bus. There's no growth or work /life unbalance dictate never communication"
bad,This place of employment is old and dirty. Management treats the employees like s**t.  Hostile work enviroment. The managers have no idea what is going on in the workplace at time. They all have an I could care less attitude.
bad,Really bad management insurance was good until the change and now its horrible bad turn over rate in all areas management is there for themselves not employees or customers
bad,I should have never left my previous company to go to work here. the driver managers are awful. If you need a day off you are constantly denied. they state that if you need a day off for a dr appointment they will give it to you. that was not the case in my experience.
bad,"I hated every minute I was at that H*ll hole! That place was so pathetic about 90 percent of the time you had to go in and do someone else job before you can do your job. and management still wanted you to go out and get your numbers. You better never leave anything of value in your truck, as sure as s*it stinks it will be taken. They would NEVER give decent raises, they used the money for security. You would have to be extremely hard up to work there. What makes thing very bad, your considered a thief the very second you step on the property."
bad,"Don't work for this company, they got racist people in the office judging people by their background and ethnicity and not ability and experience....."
bad,Hr is an absolute joke and management is even worse. Its always someone else’s fault at the company and never management and hr. Worse company ever with great products though. They really need to just be bought out by coke or pepsi and all of management and higher ups be fired.
bad,Essex has the potential to be a great facility but too often they go against their own rules and sacrifice quality for quantity. Happiness for profits
bad,I worked there for 5 years.  Was a driver then went to sales.  Management in sales was awful so I went back to driving and they didn’t take inconsideration of my time there and started my salary back to a rookie salary.  I been there for five years and a guy who has been there five days made the same amount of money as me.  Don’t ever work here
bad,"Very bad very very bad very very very bad would never work for such a crooked company "
bad,Go work some were eles. Cuz this place is not worth your time the supervisor has his favorite n if ur not in thier circle u will find yo self unemployed.
bad,They are full of empty promises and lack organization. Merchandisers come and go and you will end up buried in the work of 2 people. Poor milage compensation.
bad,Bad company to work for don’t fall for any tricks. Management plays favorites and do prefer men. Women don’t get a say. Stay away if you are a female.
bad,"Excessive work load that never stops. 3 yrs of lies from management tht things would get better. They only continued to get worse. They have a double standards policy, you the worker must do & continue to do more but the company fulfills none of there obligations. The distribution supervisors are puppets with no backbone, straight jellyfish. Use this company to obtain your DOT experience & vacate immediately"
bad,"Expected to work 7 days a week,  sales manager plays favorites,  no training at all.   Mileage reimbursement is not state or federal minimum.   Sales personnel make the same as a district manager."
bad,"Management has no clues what is happening. All new management is trying. Many of the benefits employees use to have is gone.Had many good friends and Coworkers missed, but less stress free."
bad,Management likes to hire outside the company for advancement roles even though they tell you that your qualified. They dont appreciate their workers. M
bad,"This place is such a joke man, managers are just so ignorant and believe me they try to butter you up, but behind them curtains they talk about you behind your back. You will get tired but managers don’t care. they will give you that saying. “ your to young To be tired”."
bad,This is the worst job I had. You make commission only. Stay until you finish. They work these young black guys like slave. Everybody running over each other to pick their order just to make the commission only pay. it's a joke. They pay you for three weeks when you start and throw you on the floor to a pack of wolves and its on. Only thing missing is the slave strap. They say you get overtime but you don't see it. If you don't have any work left they send you home. But it suppose to be a down time for pay. No. The pay is average to 14 dollars an hour. It is a big big big turnover. Run Run Run!   Misleading company.
bad,Worst management ever. Never had enough help. Always making others do more stores. Moral was terrible. Manager was run out of two other locations and somehow still keeps his job. The stores don’t even want him in their stores.
bad,Management does nothing.  Seems like everyone there just wants to dump on our crew. We have to do everything in the warehouse. Even though first shift just unloads trucks.  Was supposed to get new shirts on september and still dont have any. The whole company is going down the tubes.
bad,"Do not work for them, the management there is racist and they use derogatory words to describe people of color. The pay is average, management watches you like a dog and their HR directors prejudice too. The Supervisor has problems at home and takes it out on drivers. I still work there and see a lot of racism that goes on there."
bad,"The place just sucks overall. The management is a complete joke and I'm actually surprised the place still exist. When it was Dr Pepper Snapple Group, the place was worth something, then Keurig took over and now it's a complete joke. They preach that they're trying to stay competitive with other companies, but the wages and/or benefits don't come close. The insurance that they provide you is a complete joke, and only work here if you expect to have a headache and be mistreated. Best employees get treated like nothing and looked over. There's really no hard part to this job besides coming to work, that's the hard part. Truthfully if this company keeps going the direction it is with Keuring, it won't be good in the long run.It's a popularity contest and you better be prepared to be in it to win it."
bad,"Racist company cause turmoil with in employee life with work culture. Lack of communication from upper management"
bad,The job itself is not a difficult job but it is very labor intensive and time consuming and they say they will send help when you need it they never do so you will end up working 12 hours or more but then they send you home early later in the week. Because you cannot have over time. If your truck is running behind they make you punch out and wait until the truck arrives. So as far as a home life there's not one really because you can't plan anything you don't know how your day will end up. And you only get mileage between stores not to your first store and not from your last store so if they send you a d hour out of town to your first store you do not get paid for you can only clock in upon your arrival to your first store they don't like to tell you that in training.
bad,"I would not recommend management is extremely poor they talk and treat you bad they do not hold up to their position and they do not train well they miss inform you on your routes during interview. orientation is short  you will be giving routes at 3 am and are expected to be at first store at 6am takes you a fee months to get tshirts and work phone so you will not know what stores recieved their order causing you to drive back and forth to stores the mileage pay is never what it is suppose to be even with it not starting till you reach your first store "
bad,I would not recommend working here you have to do a lot of work and the management doesn't care. The pay sucks as well. Find some where else to work do not work here
bad,"Work you like a slave "
bad,Park on the street and let your car get hit or broken into. They will not pay for it. If you question and have a discussion they will fire you or write you up.
bad,I have been in this company for passed 8 year and there is no recognition and advancement in the company.  People are doping like flies and nobody is doing anything to prevent it.  People are starting with better pay then people that have been there for passed 7 years.
bad,You only make a base pay plus commission. So if you are on a route that is far away and you are not delivering alot of product that day. You barely make anything for your time. Company does not care about its employees. They run your raged. Make you work long days 6 days a week. They cant keep drivers. Because no one wants to drive a few hours. Then make 17 stops in different locations. Then come back. I worked from 10 to 15 hour days. You start at either 330 or 430am. and sometimes dont get back till 6 or 7 at night. Be prepared to be worn out. Be prepared to get lost. They have no trucking GPS so you are on your own and hoping google maps doesnt take you to an unsafe location. avoid at all cost.
bad,I worked 5 years to become a sales account manager to find out the pay is not worth the title.Taking on 109 gas stations a week for only 1000 2nd week
bad,Management play favorites The schedule is never the same you get to clean up after everybody then get in trouble for the work they did. Overall the company is not a good place to work you out a lot of miles on your car and they pay you minimal for it to
bad,Job can take a very hard toll on your body. There can be permanent damage done if you are not careful. More and more products are being obtained by the company increasing the work which increases the time. Time vs. completeness suffers due to increased volume of products.
bad,No respect for employees from Dr. Pepper . And just like this review they put silly stipulations on. EVERYTHING. They had to change the hiring process to make it easier for anyone to get hired.
bad,did not enjoy this comp[any at all. from day one i was set up for failure with no training for 2 months. then got sent to a location to train with someone who had only been in the position for 6 months and was not even the same position i was in.  worked there for a total of 10 months and was constantly walking on egg shells wondering who was going to threaten my job today.
bad,"No respect for drivers, you are at the bottom if u a driver. 18 to 20 stops. If you a relief driver you will be out forever. Routing sucks, u will drive all over the place jus to make a delivery. If you have a problem the manager would look at you crazy and walk away. If you call in they will hang up in your face. Take my word, stay away. Run, Run , Run away"
bad,Horrible experience. Gave my all for almost 3 years and then someone wanted to start something and I was the one that got railroaded. Complete joke of a company
bad,"I do not like the way they treat employees who were once very dedicated :)"
bad,They suck boss is a joke call you names  make u do peaple job send them l have to work late they call u name like I am slow lazy  retardedtoo I hate working there
bad,If you need immediate training without going over the road but you will work harder then you ever did before and your paycheck will never be over $1100 a week before taxes. You will work no less then 50 hrs a week with no overtime pay.
bad,"Everything about the job was terrible. The pay, environment, hours, management, etc."
bad,"Do not come here if you are looking for health benefits. They have switched from UHC which was a very fair and paycheck friendly insurance. The current insurance  has you paying 100% out of pocket expenses for all of your medical needs, to include perscriptions. And even if you can afford to pay the $2700.00 to meet your deductible they still only pay 80%. UHC cost $25 for regular doctor visits, around $8 for your perscriptions, and 50 for a specialist visit. And as stated it is currently 100% out of pocket by you. On top of this you also pay to have this horrible and should be ilegal insurance."
bad,"Go in at 5 to 5:30 am,work until your done.side bay drivers are at the bottom,off the drivers.bulk drivers get payed good and do less work.in mornings you see bulk drivers at qt for an hour talking ,because they on the clock making 20 plus an hour,side bay guys get 86 dollars a day and .25 cents a case witch adds up to not ,you have a lot off work stops,its like slave labor,when you get your check on Friday after working 60 plus hours and you only bring home a little over 600 dollars it off.that is why they have the HIGHEST turn over off sidebay drivers I have ever seen at a job in my life."
bad,"Lack of resources to accomplish tasks, primarily operational budget.  Confusion on direction among the middle management due to continuous change and exiting of key staff members.  Executive leadership team has clear direction and expectations, but execution is constantly mishandled by leadership team below.  Total compensation has continually declined, with extreme cuts to employee benefits since on-boarding; future outlook shows no signs of stopping this trend and quality of work life balance is projected to diminish further.  People's performance is based on falsehoods and not factual, objective information which can be verified...several instances of this practice are readily seen.  As said, ELT has great vision and the company can be very successful, issues persist with middle management and strategy on executing that provided vision."
bad,Where do I start? Management? Pay? Work life? Let’s just say it’s a pile of doo dooin genera. You’re treated like garbage  from your managers and store managers you work at. You are no better than feces on the bottom of their shoe in their eyes. You will get yelled at by your managers and store managers regarding things like “why are you here so late?” Or “ You can’t be on your phone” when I’m clearly on the phone with my boss or co worker regarding work related matters. They don’t care if you had other deliveries at other stores that were blown out or that you had to build displays at etc. they only care about THEIR store. It’s tneir competitor so they don’t give a rats butt Management is a joke in general and know nothing about what the job entails. They will schedule you to work 6 days during the holidays and say that you cannot get any overtime. It makes you question their IQ and if they have any math skills because that is clearly impossible to not get overtime when you work that much with deliveries and displays to build at 4-5 stores a day. I’ve contemplated getting into a car crash just to get me out of having to work that day. They will tell you that you cannot call in because you are short staffed which I’m pretty sure is ILLEGAL. Only work here if this is your last resort and honestly I think I’d rather flip burgers at Wendy’s now that I’ve worked here.
bad,Piece of trash company lot of favoritism they will promise u something but it never happens supervisor are lazy equipment is unsafe and they expect for u to drive it
bad,"Horrible place to work forced 6 days for more than a year. Making 13 dollars while coke and pepsi make 15 to 22. Start everyday at 6 and never know when you're going to get done. They've told me a can't call off before. They've made me drive 30 miles away during a snow storm, I slid out and had to call them and they said ""let us know when you're out of the ditch and on your way to your first store"" so i had to pay 200 dollars just to get to work that day. Ive told them i dont want to work 6 days often and all they say is ""well we pay you overtime so why are you complaining"". The trucks that deliver your product that you have to merchandise start at 6 to so if you've already done everything you've can and have a truck going to a store you have to wait. Ive waited for 4+hours before just for a truck before and then had to work everything that came in. Management has stright up yelled at me for asking questions. Horrible. I wake up everyday hopeing I get into a car accident on the way into work so i don't have to go."
bad,Would not recommend this place no communication and pay isn't enough for employees that have been there a long time. Employee turn around is crazy there. No one cares about employees
bad,Management trash. Picked favorites. Higher ups don’t care about you except for their paycheck. Sales rep cusses and swears at you on daily. Highly don’t recommend
bad,"The plant mgr got his job because he's related to a higher-up. They disregard employee rights/seniority. They've even MANDATED people, including myself, AT THE END OF THE SHIFT WITH LESS THAN 2 HOURS REMAINING! Ask anyone that's worked there at least a year (Avenel, NJ location). They’ll use & abuse a good worker & expect nothing from certain others. If you become their ""go-to guy"" or have high productivity don't feel special; the moment u stop bending over backwards they'll replace you like your worthless. Two of the supervisors will lie to have you fired and no amount of evidence/witnesses will save you. About the productivity, instead of going by Pallets they go by Cases, a much more variable unit. Basically, you can be working harder than everyone else but get called into the office about your numbers being low. Save your sanity. Find an employer that at the very least is competent."
bad,"Absolutely worst job ever. I was hired to manage a team of store merchandisers, but was actually just a glorified merchandiser that constantly merchandised stores due to merchandisers quitting."
bad,Managers don't know what they are doing and are all home relaxing while you are still working..Pay is horrible..pays the least amount out of all soda companies
bad,Worst job ever do a lot of work for little pay drive your own vehicle but if something happens to your car you get a point for calling off management is the worst bad attitudes smart mouths I’m glad I’m no longer there
bad,"I’ll get straight to the point, As an “Order Picker” you’ll start off around $10/hr. There is absolutely zero integrity at the Corpus Christi Location off Saratoga. If you’re new to warehouse work you will be minimally trained by kids that don’t even know what they’re doing. There is a strong RACIAL preference for MANAGEMENT. Advancement in title/Pay is non existent with order pickers, a high-energy/accurate order picker didn’t even get a raise coming up on his second year. If you are an excellent employee you will be expected to lead the group in the days work order. If you are slow or having a rough day you are treated as if you’re lazy and ungrateful. There is NO A/C in this facility and constant damage and Thousands of pounds of Two Liters fall every day due to inexperience/inattentive FORKLIFT DRIVERS. This workforce claims it is all about team work but you are treated exactly the opposite if you start to EXCEL. The better you do, the more you are targeted by other ‘slower’ employees. Don’t even THINK you have a voice or a say-so in safety here as it will go right over managements head. You get TWO MANDATORY 15-Minute Breaks even if you want to keep working. You get a 30-Minute lunch at 5:00 P.M. but if you don’t bring your lunch you can not leave due to TRAFFIC. All employees smoke marijuana in the parking lot at lunch in stead. Everyone is under the influence hence the constant DAMAGES and LACK OF SAFETY. No random drug-tests unless you get hurt, but expect to come back to work regardless of your injury. It is clear this company isn’t worried about the safety or well-being"
bad,"Don’t ever work for this company. The pay poorly, management sucks, better off going to work for Coke or Pepsi. The Twinsburg plant sucks so bad!!! Very disloyal also."
bad,"This place sucks your soul out of your body. It is the most exhausting, unorganized, uncaring company I have ever had the displeasure of working at. Need help, too bad. Don't ask your boss. None of them will help you out, but they will yell at you when you fail and tell you that you should have asked for help. But when you remind them that you did, you'll get a shiny write up for being insubordinate."
bad,"Job wouldn’t be so bad if it was managed right.  The management knows what’s wrong, but Take no effort to fix it .  Drivers complain daily about the same things and it is brushed off..  be prepared to pick up pallets of pops because they do not invest in load bars or airbags .they also give you non truck maps to go off ,so be careful of using that and the google maps on the iPhone they give you ..they are very secretive and will send you in bad locations without letting  you know that another employee has had an incident prior to putting you on that route . Trucks are not the best conditions.. as a new driver you will be in the worst trucks .  If i was you i would not take the sign on bonus !! Taxes will Take majority of it and your still stuck there for a year.  Most new drivers there now are in this position . There ready to quit but have to wait til there year is up or some quit owing them the full $3000 when they never even seen the whole amount ."
bad,"Poor management and a constant drive to run no matter the toll on employees is the culture. 7 days per week is the usual work week. Company line is Safety, Quality, Productivity. This line could not be farther from the truth."
bad,"I didn't much care for this job. You have to drive everywhere and the stocking can get overwhelming, especially in the heat. Sometimes you're finished early, sometimes not."
bad,"Unless you are a convicted felon, and can not gain employment elsewhere, this job is trash. Order selectors are grossly under paid, and immensely over worked. The manager at the Waco Tx location was possibly a meth head, and he stunk.  I was shocked by the lack of professionalism!"
bad,"Long hours,strees,7to10 stores a day,last min decision from manager's, poor management,phone calls and texts from sales rep all day, also adding random store's to my phone everyday and if can't leave work until everyone is done meaning you'll have to go help someone"
bad,"This place is horrible do your research management is very condescending I’ve never worked at a place that prides themselves on people who last a week. "
bad,"low salary, all kinds of hours, no weekends or holidays off, managers did not take care of workers, did not learn much from this company, someone different would quit once a week"
bad,"Started off fine, and after management changes and merchandisers quitting it has just been awful. There is no communication and they do not care about us little peons. Its really sad."
bad,was all work and there was a group with the management was a determination of future employment. The family setting was only with a few that actually cared about your efforts and the management was in the building they were not effective on knowing what was going on in the field.
bad,"Upper management is primarily comprised of uneducated truck drivers who were promoted through the ranks. These individuals promote racism and sexism and create a horrible culture. Proof is the class action lawsuit at the Northlake, IL facility. "
bad,Horrible management this company does not care about it employees they only care about there bottom line they will stab you in the back every chance they get and they will hire anyone just to fill a spot I worked for the Nashville division for years horrible company
bad,"Do not work for this company,  whose management clearly does not care about the employees. Currently they are desperately seeking drivers because their current 150+drivers are planning on striking (in Chicago) asking for higher wages,  better benefits,  a 401k plan with employer contribution and sick days ( they offer no sick days, but work on a point system for call ins). The job is physically straining, so be ready to bust your butt for little pay.  Dr Pepper made over a billion dollars this year in their first quarter, but they refuse to budge on increasing pay or benefits.  The management has stated, "" if they don't like it,  they can go elsewhere."" Is that the kind of company you want to work for.  No room for advancement and management is incompetent. Please do yourself a favor and keep looking for other jobs,  this isn't it. I've put in my 2 week notice and I'm in the process of becoming my own boss... bought my truck and will work for HUB group as an owner operator."
bad,Nobody got fair pay or fair advancement they would hire people straight in that got paid more than me and i was the one training them make less money.
bad,"got hurt & was put on light duty but still forced to do hard labor. reinjured myself & was blamed, while i was clearly not supposed to be doing what i was forced to do."
bad,"If you value a work life balance don't bother applying. Management is a joke. Professionalism is non-existant. The amount of disrespect, from management, is absolutely ridiculous and unheard of! The culture leave much to be desired. Lets not forget communication, it simply does not exist. Consistency is also a term they know nothing of."
bad,"The management will use & abuse good workers while giving special treatment to lazy/horrible workers, then if the good worker decides to stop going above & beyond and only do what is expected of them since their work ethic isn't appreciated the company will stop at nothing to fire that good worker (including making false allegations that don't have to be proven because the Union is in the company's pocket), while continuing to give special treatment to the lazy/horrible workers. The union that yanks money directly out of your checks that is supposed to protect the workers is CORRUPT and works in the favor of the company. They go against the contract whenever they please and when you put in grievances that get all the way to federal arbitration they still end up winning even though anyone with common sense can see they are in blatant violation of the contract."
bad,"Jacksonville ,Fl worst place for anyone to work, management terrible, they don't know how to talk to employees , the plant manager and the quality control manager are the most racist people I've ever meet in my life. They make you feel worthless like you don't belong here, and a lot of favoritism . it's all about who you know in that location, if you from Philippine, you will get hired, with/without experience. I was told the reason I was hired is because I had a lot more of   experiences , and to many people were quitting , the lab was empty."
bad,"This role is very demanding and you have to please many store managers as well as your area manager. They give you way too many stores on your daily route, It is very hard to complete."
bad,Management absolutely sucks. They make the whole place worse by not knowing how to run this business. The management is so bad they will tell on other managers to help themselves.
bad,Rarely promote people and keep promising things are coming ahead. Still waiting after several years and see no movement for my self and peers. Pay not competitive with industry..Lots of better companies out there.Don't waste your time.
bad,Management was bad the job just sucked workers cool the job take all your time but that's me you might like it I just did not but if you like soda drink all you like
bad,"Very poorly managed and very disrespectful. No company culture or team support."
bad,I had a bad experience with this company. the work load was very imbalanced for the wages offered. plus the work load kept increasing without any assistance provided.
bad,Good pay bad management was train for only 2 days was toss out to sea with sharks left me to drown management was very pour with in 5 days to complete my training was call in the office at 5 am and with out warning was let go I am still waiting for my millage pay not good at all seek a lawyer if this happens to you  ASAP
bad,"•	Operate standard sit down forklift and double pallet forklift "
bad,Work very long hour and work six day out of a week one off day go in at 5pm  and will not get off until 4am only short days are on Tues and sat other then that you are stuck in there
bad,"Would not want anyone to have this job for nothing longterm at all unless you are with pepsi or Coke.  Hard Labor for very little money, def not worth the money nor work. sorry."
bad,"They don't care about the warehouse employees and they never follow OSHA rules. Do not support this company please!"
bad,worst place to work they don't pay good and you working to hard for little bit money like you working in the warehouse. management don't care about the driver.
bad,Worked there 10 years. Had plenty of chances to move ahead but was held back due to illiterate supervisors and mangers. Was promised pay raises and better positions only to have them offered to someone else. Did work and didn't get paid the same pay rate as the employees whose jobs it was to do the work. They want you to do for them but when it's time for them to do for you they give you cold shoulder. Be careful because they'll take credit for your ideas and hard work.
bad,This place sucks no equipment hire u then keepu home make you drive rental box never drive tractor trailer managers all scared of one lil lady this place is not it go anywere elsec
bad,"I've had a lot of not so good jobs but this one takes the cake. The hours are usually long. The work load on my route was very heavy. Help was rarely offered even when requested on heavy sales weeks. Hardly ever the same person covering your route on your days off, which means the people covering it for you come in and barely do anything. Complained to management from top to bottom about cover people not doing the job they are suppose to do with no resolve. Management is not understanding of these issues and will just tell you anything to shut you up. If you want a raise for performance you will never get one. So the people who break their backs make just as much as the lazy employee who milks the clock. Management and sales never seem to know what's going on till very last min. Being forced to work later with almost no notice or no notice at all. Also the lowest paid merchandises out of all the pop companies. Store managers even if you are in good with them will still throw you under the bus for trivial things if it suits them. You would think the job sounds easy but it is not. It is a lot more labor intensive then people realize hence the revolving door of employees."
bad,This place was a nightmare from the beginning and this is coming from someone who has worked asphalt paving and lots of hard labor in their life. It's terrible and the management is worst!
bad,"The Management is horrible. Everyday you come to work new rules are made. Management is unorganized, its no room to move up in the company."
bad,"I was in between jobs and I thought I would try this. I was looking for a different career. I actually liked the job but too much BS. They want you to work 6 days for up to 12 hours. Knew the first week this was not what I wanted. They convinced me to stay on the conditions that i work only 5 days a week. The work was easy but physical. The worst was digging through a skid of product to get to the product you need. Loaders would load damaged product, load on skids with nails and miss pick product. Trucks would always be late, no one would tell you. Drivers would deviate from there routes so you never knew where they were. Salesmen would over order which cause more work. Most store managers were okay but some were just mean and nasty. They  wanted you to clean but their shelves were worse.  Dr Pepper Snapple has a poor reputation in the industry. Store personal and other merchandisers would joke about how bad they were. I made out due to the mileage reimbursement since I drove 150 miles a day.  That being said the reimbursement was only a fraction what the government pays. If you need a job and like to work long hours this is for you. You can make a decent living but you will be working 70 hrs a week."
bad,"To look at this place at a glance, one would think its a wonder they get by month to month. the incredible turnover rate, the seemingly arcane ordering system, the absence of any real plan of any kind... after a short time its rather obvious whats going on here. the last thing these people want is for anyone to hang around long enough to see what is up. save yourself a headache and pass this one up. youll be better off picking up pepsi cans beside the road."
bad,Work 60 hours or more a week and get paid for 40 put more stops on you then you can handle never any help all they are concerned with is whether or not the product gets delivered no matter if your out 14 or more hours a day no structure in the company no training and no encouragement or drive to make a driver feel appreciated or want to stay by far the worst company I have ever worked for in my life wore out equipment that is constantly breaking down my advice would be to stay clear of Dr pepper snapple group.
bad,Management  sucks wont work with you have to work overtime 7 days a week never able to get off. They need to get new management there asap
bad,back breaking work for no pay. they care nothing about the drivers. no way to move up in company. they show lots of favor to some and care less for others. trucks break down all the time and no ac heat or radio.
bad,"Worst company I have ever worked for. The management is very disorganized and absolutely no communication. I would show up to store openings/events and the owners had no idea we were coming. The locations of the events are in bad neighborhoods and the company does not care if you feel safe, whatsoever. If hired, your boss will tell you that if you feel unsafe you can leave and let them know. That is false they will make you stay there for an hour and half."
bad,"I worked for Dr. Pepper for just a short time. After being a Dr. Pepper lover for many years I was ecstatic that I was going to work for them. After only a month I realized it wasn't as much a dream job as I had hoped for. They are very disorganized, and were more interested in protecting the workers of many years that were not doing their jobs then the supervisors that were hired to manage them."
bad,"Management is a joke as they are all lost and don't know what to do. I guess playing games on your phone all night is considered managing. Training consist of having someone that barely speaks proper English train you for a week then throw you out there & then they expect you to thoroughly understand the job. Also, this place has been the most unsanitary places I have ever worked at as well as the most unorganized. Pay is good but you are sacrificing your time at home with family because of the constant long hours. All in all if you are ready to be a slave with no life.. Apply"
bad,"Long days, pay isn't that great, mileage reimbursement is a joke. management wants everything done faster than you can blink"
bad,"Unless you really need the job, avoid this place. I took this job because I was clueless and needed something quick as I got out the military. You are nothing more than a replaceable set of hands and meetings or ""gatherings"" are always preceded with a ""You freaking guys"" lecture. Management is horrible, there is no leadership. They will throw you under the bus fast to protect nothing but themselves, even when you were following their directions. You need to think beyond them and at that point they're useless. Plus don't think the Teamster union is a good thing neither, the workers don't benefit as much from having it."
bad,"I have been employed with this company for two months now and it is the worst experience ever. We loaders are severely overworked for 16-17 hours daily only to be told that we could do better. The pain, soreness, and swelling isn't even worth it when you realize that all those hours of mandatory overtime just get your pay taxed heavily. At some point you're losing more than you're gaining. The management has a completely apparent lack of concern for the health and safety of it's worker. The equipment is shoddy and ill-maintained. Were rarely get an adequate break. Sometimes after lunch at 730 we don't get another break but will have worked until 645 am."
bad,don't do it to yourself keep going worst job ever don't do it keep walking horrible management don't ever work there treat their employees like nothing
bad,"This company is probably the worst company I've ever worked for. They talk a good game about being employee oriented but everyone is just a number. I was hired on by a very knowledgeable, respectable person who gave the company 30+ years of his life and they canned him like he was yesterday's newspaper. "
bad,"if you're a larger person don't apply for this job. They expect too much from you and give you very little in return.you'll be working 10+ hours for very little pay they will give you hours, but if you mess up on something, they'll throw you to the wolves.The managements there is poor. The work conditions is awful. I don't recommend this job to anyone"
bad,"This company is the worst ran by dumb people that knows its eff up but want to convince you otherwise, people call out everyday and quit constantly,You walk in with seniority thats not good."
bad,How are you gonna pay $13.25? People are coming to work everyday yet you pay them pennies. Forget dr. Pepper Snapple. Know your worth.
bad,overwork you and they dont reimburse mileage and have you drive all around town.
bad,This was the worst company I've worked for. Its been times when I've gone to work and they didn't have any warehouse workers because the all quit the night before lol. So that leaves the management to load up the trucks for us. My 11hr day just turned into a 15hr day.
bad,"This company wants the work done fast and is never happy unless your do the work without paying overtime.  With the workload your giving it's impossible to do the work in 8 hours.  So every day your rushing around trying to meet their needs.  Yet it's Not possible,  very very frustrating to the driver and your overtime pay is never paid for the hours you worked.  .. My personal thought is Not to work for a company like this unless you really need to.  The economy is picking up now and better jobs are out their.  All the best in your search for employment..  cheers."
bad,"No opportunity to advance, very poorly managed, they treat employees like children and do not care about them whatsoever. Even Human Resources backed the poor management decisions made within the company."
bad,terible managers customers hate you because company cant keep same employees around.  Drivers get $92+commission comes out to about $800 a week after taxes. 60 hours back breaking labor. Not worth with I dont live to work id rather work to live ya know
bad,"I am currently a employee and I must say that this company is a joke management does not know what they are doing from the sales executive manager all the way down to the district managers. There is a major lack of communication ,and management will not hesitate to throw you under the bus for their mistakes instead of being held accountable. And they force you to work over time for free . And they promote based on favoritism working hard and going above and beyond does not guarantee that they will get the job over someone else who could be under qualified but management likes them. I hear on a regular basis from salesman that they are looking for work elsewhere so with this review I hope potential future employees read  this and keep searching elsewhere for employment because they will regret working for this company.  "
bad,"13 stores in 1 day... including 2-3 food4less in same route? not going to happen. Terrible sales from your route sales person. Hardly goes to actual store to do an order. Will make you take picture and shelf and make their orders from that. Just a  completely mess to work. They don't provide, gloves,boots or any sort of back brace for the job. Your expected to clean up after the merchandiser who does your route on your days off because they don't care. Would rather go on welfare than work for them again. And no discount on soda."
bad,"If you read any review about this company I hope its this one because I will save you a lot of time and hassle. There is no other company I have ever heard of that treats their employees this poorly. Management (what little there is) will never take any responsibility for anything and will always point the finger at you! No pay raise EVER, unless you consider 9 cents a year a good raise. No job security whatsoever, In the short time I've been here I can count 25 different employees that have come and gone because of their poor practices. You will work at least 10-12 hours a day non stop work and will never hear positive feedback. There will always be something you missed even after busting your butt for 12 hours and they will tell you about it. Management and sales team will drive around and milk the clock to get to their 8 hours while your day is just half way over. They never look at themselves as the problem and never will even with their record high turnover rate. Pay sucks, Hours suck, No work/life balance, Management is an absolute joke. I wish I would have noticed this a little earlier and not wasted this much time here. This place is a joke and at best just a poor job to take for a month or two until you find something else. Take this job as your absolute last resort. Oh and don't even get me started on vacation time.."
bad,This company is great for someone that doesn't have a lot of responsibility.
bad,"Horrible managment. No "" Common Sense"". they literealy fired half off the loaders, then worked the remaining of us 16 hours a day. You don't get paid time and a half for overtime. It's 7 dollers an hour plus cases for overtime. I've selected at Martin Brower and US Foods and this is the bottam of the barrel. there's not enough equipment for all of the employees, but you're on a by case commission. No organization amoungust the warehouse operations. They make it seem easy to select, but the cases are heavier and on the fridge packs, you pick 2 and get paid for 1. I average 1800 cases a night and still didn't gross half of what i made at other selection warehouses and worked way more hours also. The managers don't provide load straps and send loads out unsecured, but if a pallet falls over, it's the loaders fault for not wrapping it tight enough. We're talking about over 2 tons of product going out to customers unsecured. Next promotion after loader is ultility and there is no pay raise. There are guys there making 14 and hour for years with no pay raise. Union is horrible. They let us work on a contract that the Dr. Pepper Snapple group drew up. The contract wasn't agreed upon, but there was no strike."
bad,part timers make about 180  a week plus you pay gas. which you only get 55cents per mile which is bad!! Expect to be at least 20 miles away from home.  you dont get your gas money until the end of the month. Nobody an answers your phone calls. Their is poor training because the company will not be willing to waste money on you. THEY SET YOU UP TO FAIL.  work for coke or pepsi if you want a successful merchandising career.
bad,"Spent 4.5 years in my position as a BDR and achieved every goal and quota for my position.  Wanted to build a career with the company and advance into positions of more responsibility and was always overlooked.  My position was eliminated due to cutbacks, not for performance, while others kept their position who really deserved to be let go.  In my opinion, DPSG does not use their people correctly and are trying too hard to be like the others by bringing in former Pepsi and Coke employees, who left the company because they could not perform, to run this company."
bad,"This ad is always up and there is a reason they go through people like it's nothing. They have a trainer who you can not even understand what he is saying.  They have a core click of people who they keep, and if you don't get in with them forget about it. The hardest part changing over frozen hoses to the CO2. Slipping on the floor cleaner was also not enjoyable.  The most enjoyable part going home."
bad,"You will work yourself to death and get paid the same as anyone else who only had to work 8 hours.  The morale and team work in the Orlando plant is horrible."
bad,"The worst place I have ever worked. If your unmarred, devoriced, have the worst language, do not care about working holidays instead of being family and don't mind wating 2 MONTHS to get a pay check work 12 hr days for $8.00 hr then this job is for you. I will Boycot all 7 up products since working for this company. Management is horable and they do not care about anyone but themselves."
bad,"Management is TERRIBLE, has to be the worste beverage company i have ever worked for hands down! good products but no direction for improving sales and growth.. would NOT recommend anyone to work for this company..save your time and energy and go with a more stable work environment"
bad,"No room for advancement. I enjoyed the costumer relations that i kept as a vendor, talking with store owners, making sure they had enough product for consumer trends."
bad,"This would be the perfect Job for someone who has no bills, is single, has no family, doesn't have a social life, someone with no hobbies, doesn't have a pet and loves not making enough money to survive on. You make $10/hr and that's it. Don't expect a raise regardless of your efforts or how long you've been with the company. You will get no weekend days off and work every holiday also."
bad,Raw material sampling and testing. Worked with vendors and CoA's. Hardest part of job was the weather contions on the dock when I had to go check-in material.
bad,I was coming out of a job in contracting so I needed a job and thought this was the place. I will tell you the horrible stuff I have dealt with in the past year working here. So many cons that it is ridiculous
bad,"Tulsa Oklahoma Warehouse is absolutely the worst your damned it you do and damned if you don't. One hundred dollars a day sounds alright till your working 70+ hours a week then realizing your tearing up your vehicle from all the mileage. Management calling you on your days off pressuring you into working when you tell them multiple times no. Then want to cry in your ear if you not to certain stores on time, but the only way to do this is to cut down on the quality of the merchandising. Then if you hit all the stores in the projected time frame they'll whine in your ear because they don't believe you spent enough time in the stores? Make up your mind people! STAY AWAY UNLESS REALLY NEEDING MONEY!"
bad,The management is only out for themselves and will not protect yyou if it means them getting in trouble
bad,Very Poor on every level !!!
bad,"There is no opportunity to do anything more than lose time with family while over labouring for less than average pay.. The benefits were ok, but that does not compensate for what you will spend to maintain your vehicle for the sake of your job, which by the way will drive your vehicle into the ground."
bad,They expect too much out of you especially when you have 5-6 stores in 1 day. You don't get a route. You could be 10 mins away from home one day and then 45 mins away the next day. Often find myself cleaning up after people that don't do their job. Company says they're urgent to hire more people but I don't see any effort in it in terms of them uploading new job openings online. People would stay if the job wasn't underpaid and we actually got set routes. Management always claims it'll get better and theyll try to keep you closer to home with only 4 stores instead of 6. But they have been saying that for the past couple months and nothing has changed. Better off working for coke or pepsi where they only have 1 or 2 stores a day.
bad,"Acct mgrs end up doing a TON of merchandising. Its has to be the worst beverage company in the bay area. Besides the major labels (7up, ginger ale, root beer ect) accounts are not interested in their other products cause it doesnt sell."
bad,"Your job is basically to make the sales team look good. They do all the orders and are commission sales, which means they order for there pocket book not the store.  Every store backstock is outrageous being the sales man never look at there inventory or order correctly. Then the stores yell at you for all the unnecessary and extra product. Even if you have plenty of product, trust me they will order more and you will so much product left over it tends to expire.  Then you get yelled at for the product being expired. The sales team does everything the can to avoid the management of each store knowing the over order and want to avoid being confronted so then the stores management team takes their displeasure on you. Honestly, its always your fault! You do all the work, build the displays and heavy loading and get yelled at by sales team and management. Constantly being asked for favors and never compensated. You can never get support because everyone is quitting or leaving for competitors. Expect to work 6 days ever other week sometimes for a month straight!  You are very under paid and the job requires a lot of labor and lifting. Takes wear and tear on your car and barely compensated.  Management is very unprofessional and unreliable. You have to work 6 days consistently while management gets to enjoy their days off when they should be helping you with coverage and giving you your days off. You work every holiday.  They say the promote within, they don't either they hire people that are under qualified or they take care of the buddy's and promote them, when realistically they"
bad,"Stay as far away as you can. I had to drive to 7 different stores all 15-30 mins apart and except to be in each store for 2 hours plus. Not enough time in the day to get off on time. Worked 12 plus hours a day and no one will ever check up on you to see how you’re doing. I had to deal with multiple back room managers that treat you like dirt because you’re in their store. Job is extremely physical and you will never have time for lunches or break. Overall, no work culture, no team work, no work life balance, and no sense of accomplishment"
bad,"The place will lower your vibrations almost instantly. They preach competition; pitting the shifts against each other. Maintenance vs Production. Supervisor vs supervisor and so on."
bad,If your not of a certain ethnicity moving up in the company is hard. They show favorites. Hr does nothing to help resolve employee issues. There is no home/work balance
bad,"Low pay, indefinite work hours, constant lifting 35-50lbs . 250 cases per hour. Hot and humid in the summer, always understaffed.. whole crew is one long shift from 12noon up to 6 a.m. mandatory because you stay till its all the done. No room for advancement no other shift opportunities as an order picker."
bad,"One of the lowest paying employers in this industry in town but I still worked there for years until we got a new Plant Manager. He is toxic, he finds certain employees that he will pick on, demean them, and force them either to resign by intimidation or be fired. Employees work well together but the toxic work environment forced me out. Really sad, because before he arrived we had a great team that flowed well. The yard is a constant mess, unsecure, and dangerous at night without proper lighting. The production area of the warehouse gets free beverages while the warehouse has a charging vending machine that is always understocked."
bad,"Very poor vehicle maintenance. Very poor management, both senior and local. Very poor attention to federal regulations as it pertains to class 8 vehicle operation."
bad,People if you're planning on coming joining 7up Don't you work 9 to 12 hours going between 5 to 8 stores most days no breaks not to mention sale reps loading the stores up with unbelievable orders and then they expect you to get the whole store completed ASAP its bad management all around they will tell you take short cuts in the stores and then come behind you and call you and tell you what you could of did better or should of did. This place is a complete joke it's not worth the pay at all you're basically slaving for pennies while the sale reps cashing out sitting in their cars in the parking lot waiting for you to leave so they won't have to help you . For this pay you can do better at a different place that's non laboring and less stressful. One more thing dont expect a uniform for at least a month pray you get a good iPhone because those things dont really work and be prepared to argue with sales reps and Dm's over nonsense
bad,"Stay away"
bad,"They make it sounds like it’s a great job but it’s not. Planners are clueless, misleading management, no future , fustrating work.Over work under paid"
bad,The job has a faulty Bluetooth system that has you constantly repeating yourself which makes it harder to preform your tasks. Bad batteries in the phones so you have to constantly go to the desk to change it out. Everything you do is timed so the faulty system takes away from your productivity. The company also sets goals that aren’t meetable with the poor technology they give you. They loosely “train” you for three days then throw you out in the wild basically. Drama filled work environment with supervisors that just hang out in the break room. Overall good money horrible company.
bad,"Dr Pepper Snapple Group was a good company to work for with transparency and appreciation. We were a team and a great culture. Now it is just another F500 company that cares only about one thing... Profits over their people with very little or no recognition or appreciation shown. Never know when your day will come and you will be laid off. No job security or honor left. Great brands with no long tern vision. "
bad,"Management are always  angry, talking down to you or barely even there while you spend half your life there with shifts added last minute. Pay is decent, but don’t expect to get requested days off. They need a whole new management team because you walk on egg shells everyday"
bad,"The job listing says that the salary is 32k a year- it’s not, so don’t bother. Base pay is a rate per day, and it’s low consider you start early and finish late afternoon typically. They include bonus count in their ‘salary’. Besides that, local management is rude. If you want to work for an honest company and people who respect you this isn’t it."
bad,Every single other beverage company around pays way more.... management lies to keep employees ... Hard work forced to hit high numbers day in and day out or be wrote up
bad,Dont care about da employees only supervisors and managers care about each other. Liers and certain ppl shouldn't have stay working. Policys are .....
bad,"I was work in Austin. Manager lie to much "
bad,just a bad place and company. if you want to find another job they take there time when it comes to pay you. took almost month to pay me on several occasions.
bad,"By far the worst place I have ever worked at.  They think they are right up there with Pepsi and Coke but aren't.  They call you nonstop and cuss you out because you didn't make a sale or aren't selling enough.  You get beat into the ground so hard, so fast that you don't care anymore about 3 months into the job."
bad,"Stressful from start to finish. "
bad,"This company will pay you a low salary and require so much of your time.  You have to be at work by 5:30AM as a Driver and never have a set off time, regardless of being a part of a union.  No consistency for new drivers, which means no consistent pay."
bad,"They don't care just deliver the product ! Sales don't do their job and store's expect driver to do it . No set routes so different store and area every day . Just throw cases and don't bring anything back . If something is missing from an order which was already pulled and loaded by someone else they act like you stole it ! If you like being treated like garbage, injuries and chaos there's plenty of it @ 7up !"
bad,It's just a paycheck and no opportunity to advance or make more money.no vacation time . No sick days no benefits period! U never see the higher up people that are the ones u could voice ur problems too. The only time u may is if u don't do a good job one day they'll call ur direct boss and tell em to call u to go back and fix it. Whether it's big or small. They have no accountability themselves .  To them merchandisers are a dime a dozen and don't value hard workers such as my self.  If they did I'd be making more $ or a different position with the company after almost seven years of my life given to them .
bad,I didn't like the long hours of very hard work and not time off. There was no time for me to do anything else with my day because I would work from 4 to like 6 I'm the morning.
bad,This job sucks they give you like 5 stores. You start at 6 in the morning and you might get done around 5 p.m. and you drive your own car and you put all those miles on your car they don't care about the employee. All they care about is selling stuff. Anyine quit because this job sucks
bad,"If dealing with rude and inconsiderate customers is your idea of fun then this is your place to work. If working 14 hour days while lift gating your loads off the truck and filling coolers at gas station stores and smaller grocery outfits then this is your place to work. If working your self to misery and not feeling any success coming from your hard labor then this is your place to work. If you like doing your job along with everyone else's jobs then this is your place to work. Heres a run down of daily events at Dr Pepper Snapple Group."
bad,well our management staff still think it's Slave times will tell you upon hiring you that this job will be your number one priority it will come before your family your kids before everything that this is your number one priority from here on out. They will mandate you to work longer then 16 hours if need be if you leave they will fire you cause you have no rights in there warehouse and will tell you that. If you get sick have a dr excuse that doesn't matter they will mandate you to work against dr orders if you make a simple mistake they will fire you or chew you out and threaten to fire you. And the brilliant charming people they are can't figure out why they can't keep any employees 2 bad managers ruin this location. Save yourself the waste of time apply else where this place will always be hiring there will always be a job opening when selling blood at the Red Cross and welfare isn't cutting it with the bills use this as your absolute last resort even then panhandling seems more glamorous
bad,Boss got in his truck and drove to my house. BROKE IN and WAS SCREAMING AND YELLING WHILE SEARCHING THE HOUSE. Neighbor saw the whole thing.
bad,"Indianapolis, IN has the worst management in the history of my employment. This facility is always hiring cause their turn over for Truck Checkers, pickers and loaders is high. Pickers have to excite a number of cases per hour to keep their jobs, a truck checker is always on thin ice and as one before, I can tell you truck checker is a joke. While Pepsi and Coke use digital scanning of product codes, Dr Pep still uses the manual method of operation. Dr Pepper is behind in the times. Also, everyone in the building listens to Ipods and is on their blutooth and is union. Truck Checkers are not union, so they are always on thin ice with the managers. Overall, if you want constant overtime, about 55 hours a week on the low side, to 65 hours a week on the high, then this job might fit you. You don't have much of a life outside the job though and management really don't do a successful job running the place. I've been threatened several times while working at the Indy plant about losing my job if I don't pick up the pace."
bad,No respect for Warehouse Workers. Low pay and they over work you for 12-15 hour work shifts on back to back nights. Then at the end of the work week you still somehow only end up with 1 or 2 hours overtime.
bad,Worst place to work in Norcross supervisors don’t give a s***about you as a person they throw you out in the field without the proper equipment to be able to do a good job when it’s an issue they never answer phone or call you back but expect for the route to get finished 100 percent
bad,"Driver/merchandiser. Bad management. Hard work. Pay doesn't change for 1 hr or 16 hrs. Poorly managed fleet. Assigned helpers are RARELY help; more worried about their cell phones. Sometimes, you're expected to ""talk"" the delivery into store. Routes change daily, which hinders ability to shorten workday. Early start grates on you. Loaders have NO consideration for the driver. 👎"
bad,Las vegas Give's you 5 to 7 stores a day no help one minute they scream it's over time next min there's none not to mention management is terrible they have no idea what they're doing. Far as sales rep's Beyond wack they order product on top of the same product. Breaks you can forget that rep's are rushing you to the next store when you only completed 30 percent of the first store it's bad here
bad,"Just here to pay for college.  Doing this job forever is cool for some, but not for me, I need more. Not a bad spot to start out with, or a first job type of thing."
bad,I wouldn't let my dog work for this company. The  Management is by far the worst I've ever seen.  Everybody is in cahoots with each other. Starting with HR. The entire Irving Tx plant needs to be fired  .
bad,"If you were not part of the little happy family there (Clique) then you were left out in the cold, not to mention how you were treated. I would never recommend anyone working there. Very poorly run........."
bad,"Please believe me, you do not want to work at dr pepper in irving tx, bad management, Hr doesn't do anything to help employees. Small raises. Will change your shift schedule out the blue at any time for any week or months. Stay away!!!"
bad,"Horrible company, really bad culture. No responsibilities, no goals, no expectations, no direction. There's layer upon layer of management, but they're weak and immature managers. Management is whiney and often non-existent (often heard HR VPs complain day after day and go home after receiving sympathy from employees for whatever ailment of the day). No processes in place, recommendations of changes are met with a big ""no"". People stopped showing up for work because they didn't know what their jobs were or what to do, and nobody cared. Most of the full time office staff were working far less than 40 hours. It's a great job if you have a family you need to be home or pick up from school/daycare - nobody will ask questions when you go missing mid-afternoon. If you're looking for job growth and development, go elsewhere. People literally would quit during their first few weeks of employment, and many tenured employees were leaving with no other job lined up. I had many conversations with new employees who all made statements of feeling like bait and switch tactics when they interviewed vs when they showed up. Don't expect anyone to train you, you will be told very little about what your job encompasses, and you'll have to ""figure it out"" and ""make your own job""."
bad,Managers and upper management do not communicate effectively with employees.  Pay is low for merchandisers and loaders. And most of all drivers and sales force are under paid and unappreciated for all of ther hard work. Benefits are way to expensive for front line employees.
bad,"Management of this company is the worst I’ve ever worked for. Favoritism reigns supreme at the Twinsburg location. They claim your hours are based on sales, this a complete lie. Your hours are budgeted on bonuses. None of which you’ll ever see. Management will tell you whatever to save their own butts from the hot seat. Most managers were horrible sales people to start with, and those traits follow them to management. Do not waste your time with this company, look elsewhere where you’ll be appreciated for your hard work"
bad,"Been an employee for a longtime, had a lot of ups and downs but now the morale has been completely destroyed largely due to our recent merger. Hourly pay rate is good in comparison to other companies but our benefits are now degraded into the worst healthcare insurance that is overpriced and covers nearly nothing. People are now treated with disrespect and met with hostility at every turn in attempts to do anything to get the work done. Unachievable goals are constantly being set with no support or direction on how to achieve those goals (mushroom mentality). Our company used to take pride in it's open door policies and facility town halls which are now a thing of the lasr. The company makes no effort to hide the fact they do not care about their employees and all benefits of working at this place are constantly on a chopping block. Whenever you honestly question a new directive or PROFESSIONALLY voice your disagreement with a new change to policy or yet another sacrifice you must make for the company, you are branded as an ""actively disengaged employee"" and accused of working against the organization which is an outright lie. the new leadership rules with a totalitarian doctrine that rules by fear and intimidation. This is not the company I began with years ago and it's very depressing to come back to work everyday feeling powerless to do anything to change it. It seems as the main objective is to create such a hostile work environment that no one would ever want to come here again."
bad,"Long hours, working with damaged equipment. No support in getting job done. Broke a lot of DoT regulations just to make deliveries. Trucks undependable. Management plays favorites lack of leadership. Managers were always unsupportive two faced liars. No team work no overtime paid Chinese overtime. If you have a CDL they will not promote within"
bad,There’s no team work. You are under pay. The merchandise is HEAVY. You will mess up your back or have a heart attack trying to pull HEAVY pallets to the sales floor. There have a high turnover everybody quits. No communication at all. Put a lot miles of your car for almost little of nothing for mile reimbursement. Sometimes you never get to take a break.
bad,"When you get to the onboarding process you are promised salary + bonuses.  Not the case,  the bonus structure is an unattainable number that no one ever reaches.  When anyone questions management they become a target and quickly becomes extinguished through the use of subpar managerial techniques.  The HR team is non existent and does not properly represent the employees.  This is a Corporation that runs at the bottom of the distribution playing field and doesn’t plan to raise the bar.  I would recommend this company to a high school student willing to make quick money with no chance for advancement.  The management is very disorganized, untrained and not willing to exceed any expectations."
bad,16 hour work days on short notice.Favoritism and low pay this was by far the worse employment experience the push you to meet unrealistic quotas save yourself time and effort. It was so stressful working there I feel like weight has been lifted off my shoulders ever since I quit.
bad,"Worst company ever! They work & treat their employees like slaves, pay is terrible, (1,000 cases = $80) the equipment is trash. Heartless individuals!"
bad,"Do not work here. Don't expect Managers to support you. Managers and above only care about themselves. This company is not about the people, they will eventually take anything that's good left in the company away. Benefits is bad and continuing to get worst."
bad,Racist  unfair  don't give the right people  the chance to move up the ladder. Don't  use the company to fix the right things the aave it for part of their bonus.have management  that don't  know  what  their doing they got the job cause who they know alot of animosity  between  the  workers cause of management
bad,They say one thing and do another. they don't care about family/ work life. you are a number and when you  show compassionate leading you will be done.
bad,"even though i was told i had the quality of the job i bid on i was passed up for it. Point system isn't good, if you go to the hospital you will still get points"
bad,"The only reason there hiring is because of a labor dispute with there drivers. This is a union shop currently on strike at there Northlake facility.  So much for job security . This place has been under paying there drivers for years. You want to be treated unfair this is the place for you. Hate to say it but its time to find a job where they appreciate there employees. Stay far away from this one , Will be going on a few interviews this week.  You like breaking your back delivering pop with no incentives for low pay.The absolute mismanaged company you will ever work for.  They just got bought out and seems the top brass is running scared. Im otta this crazo place .One of the worst places I ever worked. I would not recommend this place to anybody"
bad,"I got paid $150 a day plus overtime. The boss got mad if we worked for longer than 12 hours a day, but it's god not to when there's 15 or more deliveries to be done plus spending 4 hours or more inbetween deliveries driving. We had to lift roughly 2500lbs or more everyday on our own. They never appointed us a helper unless we complained like a baby about it. $150 is horrible pay when you have to basically do three jobs on your own everyday. The manager is pretty understandable to the truckers needs but the person making the routes needs to do a better job. None of the truckers are happy about their salary in the Corsicana area. That location needs to be improved."
bad,They hover over you like your in elementary school. Wanting pictures of every store you go in everyday. Management is to lazy to get out in the market their selves so they depend on you to take pictures of your work after every bottle you put up
bad,"Worked here for 3 years as a loader, forklift driver, warehouse lead, and more. So when I say this place is horrible and is back stabbing to the max you can trust me."
bad,"This was not a good place to work.  Management did absolutely nothing to make sure the work place was free from violence and  discrimination.  I witnessed the discrimination and was subjected to threats on my person by another worker.  I would not work nor recommend anyone apply to this company in Elk City, OK."
bad,"If you want to work at a company that will suck the life out of you, and get in between you and your family then this is the place for you. There was a reason the employees went on strike!."
bad,Dr. Pepper Snapple was a good start to build on my computer skills. Overall i rate this company a 3 out of 10.  I wouldn't work for this company again.
bad,It's not worth giving your life to a company who doesn't appreciate it.  Long hours and low pay make for unhappy employees.  Consider this your last option for a job.
bad,"if you don't want to have a life outside of work, then this is the job for you. great pay, but it's all overtime. averaged about 16 hours a day. week of Christmas put in around 80 hours in a week. management does not care. 7 of us were hurt in a year then they increased what our productivity per hour should be"
bad,"I was told we would work 10 hour shifts, 16 at the most. We would work 18+ hour shifts, go home get a few hours of sleep then have to come back. We usually only had 3 or 4 workers including myself. If you didn't finish the Fridays work, then you would have to go in on Sunday."
bad,the company has too much turn over with it's employees instead of trying to keep devoted and great employees Dr Pepper just lets them leave.  Dr Pepper doesn't seem to value it's employee's too much.
bad,This is the worst job I had...  Your working 50-60 hours a week for 400 dollars after taxes. They pay you 7 cents per case. So to get a 600 check after taxes every week you have to pull 1700 cases A DAY for 5 days. That place is a rip off!! Go in at 6pm and leave at 5am-7am. TRUE STORY
bad,"I ended up leaving this position due to the hostile work environment created by the logistics supervisor. "
bad,"The Memphis Plant is the worse place I have EVER worked in my life. I have never developed a hatred for a job as I did with this company. They do not care anything about the employees and you will be overworked and underpaid. Start time say 5am but you will rarely start on time because of the lack of staffing in the warehouse they will still be trying to get your truck loaded when you get there causing you to be late to timed stops and taking valuable hours away from your day which you are not a hourly paid employee so its basically a waste of your time! Your actual rate of pay after training will be $7.82 per hour and ot will be paid in a chinese overtime system which means the more hours you work the less you get paid! 20 hrs over is paid at $3 and some change whereas 5 hrs over will be paid at $9 dollars. Don't fall for the gimmicks because this is no place you come to make a career it is just a place you come to, to gain experience no matter what your field is!!! The only reason i gave them 3 stars for job security is because you will see so many people quit they won't be able to fire you because they will need you to badly. Until the management team in Memphis is replaced and they become unionized I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy!!!"
bad,"Management sucks, they're always harassing you about your whereabouts and feel the need to because you have a gps on your phone. Reallly no type of trust or privacy when working for them."
bad,Load and unload trucks. Put product on pallets. Management was very knowledgeable and you could go to them about any concerns.
bad,"I worked for Dr pepper as a temp job. At first it was cool and exciting but after the second day breaks were never consistent and I worked from 5pm-5am  which are horrible hours for a college student. Also hours in description said ""5pm-1am"" which was not correct. In a 12 hour shift by law 2 lunches and 3 breaks should be given however Dr pepper did not follow the law. I was done with all breaks and lunches by 10. Clock in at 5 pm have first break at 6 pm lunch at 8pm and another break at 9:30 pm. From 10pm-5am was constant work heavy lifting and no breaks until job was done which sometimes wouldn't be done until 6am. I strongly suggest you make sure you know what you're getting into before you apply or accept a position at the job."
bad,"A typical day is stacking on a average 1500 cases on good day 2100 on a bad day, they are always short handed which means there is a lot of overtime but  Uncle Sam will take that you are almost making minimum wage once they take money a week from your check for health benefits  In and out burger makes just about what they pay lol... Crazy. Management is very very and let me say it one more time very bad but if you throw cases fast you get away with murder there's no team work what so ever, every man for them self. They love to point the finger at everyone else instead of owning up to there wrong doing which they do every night,no room for advancement. If you do decide to not listen and work there keep your business to yourself because your co workers will tell your business. Don't make this a long term job. Oh and you get no raises."
bad,Not very organized and make the work environment very hard and complicated especially for the side load drivers.
bad,"Weak management leading weak employees who squeak by only because they ""give an effort"""
bad,"This is a first hand experience. I saw how happy and inspired the poeple at first. We are considered as cream of the crop. But When this Manager came in everything has change, it turns to a very unpleasant and hostile working environment.. It starts firing people left and right in the department, the manager so close to HR...much more IT will hid any product deviation and instructing the people to keep within our deptartment so we dont get in trouble,,,,its really not good specially when it concern product quality."
bad,"Very bad management, poor HR management, lots of nepotism especially among Lab tech, they fire people without reason, and put their friends and families even they are not qualified. Too sad its who you know not what you know. I am among the pioneers, got fired for no reason. There is no seniority here, you can be a lead even if you dont know anything or even you are just new as long as you are friends with the HR Manger, Production Manager or QC Manager. People here are very unhappy, they talked among co-workers but not with management because they are very afraid to get fired after airing your grievances. Managers are really political but not all. Its fun if there will be an undercover boss, works like a worker, so he/she wil see how rotten the system is, go to QA dept as example, very visible but people cant do anything, they fire a lot of smart, hardworking lab tech and replace them with who they know. Time for change Dr Pepper!"
bad,"I was hired as a temp and worked for this plant for 10 weeks. It has a reputation in Jacksonville as being a bottom end job. Although the job title says QA Lab Technician, only 30-40% of the time was actually doing lab work. The rest of the time was on the production line checking bottle caps, labels and bar codes."
bad,"Employees are spied on via camera. Mangement is not honest. Everything is a big secret. You can't believe what they tell you. It looks like the rest of the company is ok, but stay away from St Louis until they get new management. They treat you like dogs."
bad,"Very unorganized. Under new management. Do not pay time and a half, and have little respect for employees."
bad,"No inclusion and no opportunity for career advancement! Many unanswered promises "
bad,"The management is bad and the culture they push is even worse. Management is so disconnected with the employees and work/life balance. Good pay, but the people running it make you want to leave."
bad,my first 2 bosses were cool - yes i said 2 in 3 months- but last one was a total jerk and tried to make things up that you did stuff wrong when that wasn't the case at all
bad,"They’ll use you like a robot and treat you like a slave if you let them. Not worth it haha. They make it sound sweet when you apply. Good luck if you wanna work there it’s easy, just unorganized and unprofessional. They fire good employees and keep the trash ones. Lol this place a joke."
bad,"The organization is decentralized. The field teams are tight and work well together, like a family. The corporate team treats the field like children and talk down to all members. They also don't seem to understand the daily activities of the plants. Its a very micro managed organization. The corporate middle management team are in no way leaders. Tread lightly!"
bad,They lied about the position because they said it was a full Time job.  But I have yet to have a 40 hour week. I went to transfer to a different position. The day before I was suppose to start at the new position they told me they no longer need me there even though they are extremely short handed
bad,Leads and anyone upstairs only thinks of them selfs. Corporate can care less and the feeling is the same.... if you want to feel like dog everyday then work here. Feel like you don’t matter then fine but I’m leaving and so are a lot of people.
bad,Very toxic environment.  Run as fast as you can away from this torture chamber if you are a female.  You will be harassed daily without any help from g leader or supervisors.  Make a complaint and your days are numbered.   Two faced environment/ very back stabbing.
bad,Dont work for this company. Hard to get along with and certain people get different privileges. Managament is horrible and they will only find fault with you. I was with them for 6 years and got passed over 6 times before i got a sales route. They have a huge turnover and only think of themselves. You get nothing done for you all year for working for them.
bad,"If you are looking for an old school, hierarchical culture then this is the place for you.  Military and white males do well here.  Maybe Keurig will have an impact, maybe not."
bad,"I have worked here for more than 18 months and am actively seeking other opportunities. The Appliance Product group is one of the most mismanaged group within the company. Think twice before accepting an offer with this low morale workplace. Repeated re-orgs, and change in job responsibilities, lack of communication all point to a place that you'd rather not be at."
bad,"Required too many hours a week for back breaking work, which getting paid commission means alot of free labor.  Management is absolutely aweful and treat employees bad. Rarely get a thank you or any kind of apprecation for anything done. A very poor work enviroment with alot of stress."
bad,Terrible Superviser and upper management. All they care that cases are delivered . Equipment old and breaks down all the time . If you like not knowing whats going to happen day to day this is the place for you
bad,"Horrible Company and Management, decent pay and benefits, but no one is held accountable for their mistakes, everyone wants to put the blame on someone else instead of owning up and fixing the problem."
bad,Horrible work environment. No room for advancement. And no opportunity for hourly wages increase. No time to spend with family 15 hour days on average.
bad,"Company in itself was therefore lacking respect for it's employees and or customers. Could not trust or count on one person there to help with anything. Management....please don't get me started, about worthless that includes current management today in the year 2017. Employees alone could run this place without any supervision. Would not recommend my worst enemy to work there.......wait.......actually I would come to think about it cause you would have to be a worthless piece of !@#* just to work there. I know I felt like that when I was there, the way people treated me when I went into stores because I worked for a !@#%*& company."
bad,To much work they always change your job requirements to keep from hiring enough help. This in return is more money in their bottom line. They hire you then burn you out.
bad,You work 50+ hours a week guaranteed and receive a $400 check. No opportunity for serious advancement. You really have no life if you work in the warehouse. Only good thing was you could smoke a cigarette basically whenever you wanted.
bad,"Management doesn't care. Benefits are very good. Expect way more work than the amount your getting paid. Don't expect any raise after 90 days either. Have to clean up daily after other countries workers.some associates get special treatment, Or favored. Getting written up for others mistakes or laziness. No advancementS or promotions in the company. Never being able to plan anything. Very unorganized. Never getting days off that you request."
bad,"I want a job that cares about their employees.  I get along with all of my co workers. I come in at 430 and sometimes don't leave until about 6, They get mad if you bring stops back but don't like you getting overtime."
bad,"Stay away if you want a life, they thing they own you. Management is complete trash. Senior mechanics don't want to show you anything. Supervisor things everyone is an idiot. Just complete trash. I'm glad I got away."
bad,Company has great products and hard working employees but has a terrible management team with no direction and not care in the world for its employees that have grown the company over the past years before their employment.
bad,Forklift position isn't what it seems to be. Pay isn't worth the troublesome work and there is one lead mechanic who is the boss and no one else. Work load is too much for one person. Go else where this position will drive you insane. Not a great company.
bad,"Well I am a former employee of this branch, and let me say if you want to be unappreciated and overworked, go ahead and apply here. Mgmt, both locally and higher, does not car about the work loads of the employees and whether or not the customers are satisfied. If you are going into the DSD business, there are much better choices."
bad,Management is customer oriented only and will sabotage your health and mental patience with there inconcideration. If you think that you can handle dealing with major problems as far as structure feel free to apply.
bad,If you want to be treated terribly and have management do nothing but talk bad about behind your back.  They fix an issues or problems that have been brought up time and time again. If you are a female then you are in luck because you will never suffer consequences for youf actions not matter how terrible you are at you job and have been reported too many times to count
bad,This place is something nice people but the equipment  and  environment  is lacking really bad and how managers  handle the meetings  before  start up is just stupid they have a room to hold the meeting before going on the floor to work  but they rather use a karaoke  machine in a loud work place to do them I  would put my time in some where else that is all I have to say
bad,I was not at all pleased in this roll.  My original manager was great. She took a fall and had emergency surgery leaving her boss to take over and her boss was horrible!
bad,"When I first started working for 7up, there were good managers and employees. Over the years new management has come with poor people skills and no respect for employees. Especially those with families and obligations. I was written up and almost terminated for SPEAKING UP!?Poor management and very lazy employees who do next to nothing .and leave work for the next guy"
bad,Wear and tear on vehicle bad... To many chiefs not enough Indians everybody wants to be the boss and no advancements.. Horrible management and not enough hours I use to be a merchandiser for Pepsi and got many hours here is different 23 hours was all I got and that’s doing everything without taking a break
bad,"Horrible hours. Start at 5 AM and rarely finish before 5 PM. Your job depends on how well your merchandisers take care of your stores. That means you are dead meat. Threatening emails every day and an unreasonable amount of asks every day. The company admits the job is nearly impossible, but still expects great outcomes. Almost the very definition of insanity. Run from this job, unless you're totally desperate."
bad,"I left a job paying 1200 a week to work for Dr. Pepper. I was told the pay was $135 a day until the 4th week but after that I would get paid $.27 a case commission. By week 5 I was solo and still not getting paid commission. By week 6 still no commission. They never placed me on a route, I ran multiple routes. No one in management speak or anything they walk right by you and don’t give you any information regarding the job. We had ten drivers but only 7 trucks, so I began to ask the lead driver about it and he was clueless as to what I was talking about. I only made $550 a week and no commission was added to my check. They use you during the busy time of the year and then when it slow down you going to make less than $500 a week trust me , I spoke with previous employees. You have to be the sells man, driver, merchandiser, and the account you will bring in over $21,000 in drink sells but only receive $500.00. Don’t waste your time unless you like a lot of work with no pay and to be lied too."
bad,I have never had a job that I've felt as undervalued as I do now.  Employee turnover is so high that the work is completely overwhelming and unsustainable.
bad,"the management there is completely clueless, n2 maintenance supervisor has no maintenance experience and is a poor manager in general. management from the top down are incompetent and don't care about safety or company policies."
bad,Avenel itAvenel NJ branch pays $13.25 the only people who will do this for that is people with out education and felons.  They are going to days so that will be better and the pay goes up $1.00  but everything else about this jobs sucks.  The workers are lazy the managers are even lazier. Go to fed ex or Amazon
bad,"Underpaid, unappreciated, unprofessional, and the annual raises are at a low %, doesn't matter what you did extra for the company year round. Doesn't matter the every weekend spent at the facility. Doesn't matter how well you do your job, you get whatever left in the pot to scrape. 1% 2% 3% that's it."
bad,"You will get accused for losing the drivers paperwork. The manager is ignorant, and all they do is pick with you. I would not recommend working here to anyone."
bad,"Been here 3 years in avenel. Only seen a 79 cent increase. No raises, long hours and you still wont make 40 hours a week. Management sucks ,doesn't know how to run the branch at all. They pick favorites and give guys the weekends off while you have to work. Dont waste your time."
bad,"If you want a job where your treated poorly, a job where you have to train people who started out making more then you do, a job where your looked at as nothing more then a number. Then keurig Dr Pepper is the perfect place for you!"
bad,Over work you . Do meetings on your time so you don’t get paid. No advancement. Managers don’t respect. No over time they cut pay down to 5/7 dollars.
bad,"The worst place to work in Waco, Texas, poor management, the pay sucks, poorly managed, I rather work at McDonald or Taco Bell then Dr. Pepper, everybody selfish"
bad,The job was fun until I noticed you need to be able to handle getting touched and talked dirty to all night long and also keep your mouth shut. It is a very awful dark company behind closed doors. They also do not follow safety in any way.
bad,Dr. Pepper Snapple group became a stressful place to work and had a culture of favoritism and targeting as soon as the new Manager I took over in the role as RDC manager about 3 years ago the crew and hourly employees are great hard working people and still have a great relationship with many on the people there but had to leave due to the horrible culture that was created by the current management I was not able to give the hourly employees the fair and impartial environment t they deserve so I had the leave
bad,"Long days due to asinine routing that’s shoved down your throat. Untrustworthy & hard- nosed management.  Very average pay for the long hours worked.  It’s not really a career, it’s a intolerable stepping-stone at best.  This company at this location really needs new management.   Do Not recommend that you work here."
bad,"it was terrible,awful,wack,disgraceful,pitiful,management wasteful,unbelievable in the worst way,disrespectful,management arrogantly false and defiant."
bad,"Please don't NOT APPY at  dr pepper  snapper group that's location in Norcross GA, i was a loader, your working 6 days a week (ONE DAY OFF) THEN YOUR WORKING RIGHT BACK ON SUNDAY Intel 4 or 5 o'clock in the afternoon then right atfer you clock out your coming RIGHT BACK ON MONDAY at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, Intel the work is Done.

And also watch Tv from there phone's right on their laps!! . So be aware/ be safe and most definitely BE  SMART !!"
bad,"DP is poorly managed and very much into the ""old boys network.""  If you are new there you might as well expect to be treated like an outsider.  There are too many issues with this company to go into, but suffice it to say they are due for a major overhaul.  I got out before the sh&t hits the fan."
bad,"No real advancement opportunities here, three shifts with uneven workloads between them. No shift differential pay. Paid time off, but no sick time and often if you have a holiday off you are asked to work that weekend, which means that you won't receive any overtime hours for coming in for the extra time."
bad,"No work. I was employed for 6 months, after training the 1st 2 weeks I worked the full 5 days. Then on the 3rd I worked 4. By the 2nd month I was working 1 or 2 days a week because they only have a few routes which are all taken by guys pushing 70 years old. Even some of the old timers get called off work when it gets really slow. I was going to have to wait years for guys to retire, all the while making $16.25 ph. Unless they're specifically telling you at the time of hire they have an actual route for you DONT TAKE THIS JOB!"
bad,"I had 4+ years of tractor trailer experience but 0 with the union so I got a day or two a week or nothing at all. I made less than 10,000 in 6 months."
bad,People are nice. a typical day start at 8 and end at 5 but most of the management will work overtime.  the company lacks of good system the management process.
bad,"Very unfair work environment in QA lab, Manager and supervisor have favoritism,supervisor change every 2 years,QA manager is very rude,no proper guidelines.."
bad,The batching department is terrible!! Horrible management and leadership. The so called lead always trying to find ways to keep you in trouble.
bad,"The typical work day starts at 4:00 am, when you would call in and get your route, (which changed every day). The routes can be anything from a few stores in one town, or, every store in 3-4 towns. I was told at time of hire that I would be compensated around $0.40/mile for driving my own vehicle; in actuality it was more close to $0.07/mile. "
bad,I'm a former employee... working for this company was hell. The Georgia branch is so dysfunctional ran. They are under staffed but claim they can't hire more merchandisers because it's not in the budget. You are given a schedule based on the area you live in but in reality they will never go by it. I was constanly jerked around and lied to sent wherever needed no matter how far. sometimes areas 80-90 miles away from my home and they had the nerve to have a policy saying clock in at your first stop. Also the work loads were terrible you have over 10 stores on a daily basis and the delivery process is so screwed I literally had to make plans everyday to be in the Market until 8-9pm. If you have a family and a life stay far away from this company
bad,Horrible bosses.   Senior mgmt is a joke.  Plant manager is a bully.
bad,"I worked in the Topeka branch. I am not one to usually talk negative, but have to share. The benifits are great there, as far as health goes. The pay rate is crazy. Either A, you are a bulk driver at around 12.00 per hour, work 40 hours and thats it. B, you work a Route and work around 60 hours a week, which in the end averages out to be 12.00 per hour or so. The Topeka branch is a joke. If your looking to make some easy, no saving for retirement money, then go for it. The management there are slave drivers."
bad,"Worked for Dr Pepper for 4 years. Minimum raises (no more than 5 cents at a time). You can never have a weekend off. Even if it's for a family function or wedding or whatever have you. God forbid you call in, management will punish you for it. It's all give, no take. You can never do enough. Management doesn't care about you. Only wants their soda on a shelf. I gave everything to that company and eventually I just couldn't take being treated like garbage anymore."
bad,"Old trucks that break down every week and Poor management who only cares about delivery, they don't care if you had an emergency or trouble with the old trucks that always fail on you.they have people quiting all year long especially now because the company remove a lot of benefits to their workers"
bad,"You can make good money, that is if you don’t mind doing literally the equivalent of three people jobs. It’s pretty sad when one of the highest paying companies in the area can’t even keep people because of the horrid reputation and terrible work conditions. I highly advise you keep looking, that or you will be shortly after you start"
bad,After the merger with Dr Pepper this company has gone downhill. Management does not have a clue on how to run this place. It is a dog and pony show every day.  People are quitting  every day. So sad to see this taking place in what was such a great place to work before the Green Mountain buy out and merger.
bad,Oklahoma city has the worst driver manager in the world working there. He is not trained or smart enough to be in charge and says racist comments to buddies
bad,"The leadership at the Memphis location office only values their own self interest.  They are not there to guide, support, and help the team grow as a whole.  The main leader is a bully and the managers below are their to simply save themselves which means throwing their workers under the bus no matter what.  There are no verbal warnings for mistakes.  You cannot make one mistake without being written up.  You go to work walking on egg shells everyday.  The leadership is very irresponsible and this place will never grow in the marketplace because it does not value its people. Your opinion does not matter/ and it is not welcomed if it differs from the leadership."
bad,Keep looking cause this place is all wrong. Worked here a year and hated it. Nothing about management was urgent or work related issues wasn't taken serious.
bad,"This company is not well managed. They make choices on a daily basis that negatively affect the company and when told about it just ignore the problems and hope they go away."
bad,I work in the warehouse on the night shift. Order rotation doesn't exist. Alot of equipment goes broken. We have to push out so many cases in a said time in which sometimes doesn't get tracked so we lose our records on how fast we pick our order. When this happens we get lectured when not needed. I learned everything there is to know about the warehouse.
bad,Keurig was a great place to work before Dr Pepper came into the picture. Their managers are horrible people. They have no desire to provide a good work/life balance for their employees and if they don’t like you they will do everything in their power to force you out.
bad,Long hours bad Supervisors bad pay no a/c in the summer bo heat in the winter dicount not a discount same uniforms 3 shirts for a year smoke free one toilet
bad,The company expects entirely too much of the workers and the pay is not worth it. Their health insurance is awful did not start out like that now it's the worst a lot of people have left because of that. Management as well as employees and extremely high turnover due to the company not being stable. Very unstable work plan your position could change day-to-day. A lot of the benefits and perks have been withdr
bad,"Executive leadership, Dr. Pepper, is an old boys network that lacks vision, strategic thinking, innovation, and proactive decision making. Their idea of lean processing is being cheap, not smart. They view their human resource much as their mechanical ones, disposable and poorly cared for. "
bad,"Worst management ive ever worked for.  Worst organization I've ever seen in a company.  They can't work together, and management spends more time kissing butt then fixing problems."
bad,"This is a dead end job that is grossly underpaid.both of the major comprtetors pay $4-$5 an hour more to do the same job, and mgt doesn't follow state break and lunch laws, if you question them on it, they retaliate."
bad,"Alot of mixed fellings in mamagment, managers are not in it for the employees only for them selves"
bad,"Union shop- difficult to get fired after your 90 days ( this also means they have a hard time getting rid of the people who need to be gone)"
bad,A typical day started at 2pm and ended at 2-4am. Not many breaks with consistent work orders. I learned how to not complain and keep my spirits up. I motivated myself to learn the system and to finish on time. The most enjoyable part of the job was finishing on time and compliments from the veteran workers.
bad,"(BDR) As a BDR Ive noticed that this place was a mistake for me in my career. Everything from the room we work in to managment and what was promised when hired. A typical day of work should be efficient and effect with many accomplishments. The energy from the time you step in is negative, nobody sales hello/goodmorning/etc not even when its a holiday. Managment is the worst thing about this place. Ive been in sales my whole career basically and have never been in a situation where managment and the system that the company ran actually hurt me. Benifits and perks are about the only good thing about working for DPSG. (This is strictly for the BDR position cant say its like that in all departments)"
bad,"Pick and audit orders by working from order sheets to build loads for transport, bulk and or rout trucks, using a forklift and or electronic pallet jack with accuracy. Load trucks, stock floor and maintain return product and empties pallets and shelves. Maintain the stability of the pallet by properly stacking and shrink wrapping the built pallet. Unload returned product and pallets. Perform general housekeeping duties in the warehouse."
bad,They are so far behind they send you out with 2-3 back orders per stop it’s like a needle in a haystack trying to sort thru all the mess that’s created and the trucks are never properly loaded
bad,Company doesn't pay overtime and wants 12 hour worth of work in a 8 hour shift. managment is very wishy washy and very inconsistant. Sales man slams loads when they have incentives they need to hit.
bad,There is favoritism like **** at the warehouse....An employee whos been there 6 years can NOT like you.. and is great friends with HR can get rid of you quick! I've seen many ppl coming and leaving..
bad,"The company at my level is not transparent for communication, but requires it from the employee. Decisions are made that grossly affect the employees work life balance and there is a thick glass wall when it comes to the open door policy."
bad,"Easy days"
bad,No life bih don’t ever come here  it sucks they treat you like cockroaches the stores you do all the managers are dicks I’m sorry for my language it just sucks they make you work on Christmas Eve too and New Years
bad,"I work for a temp agency that gave me a line position tho I told them my title was a material handler ,the agency was frantic to fill  Keurigs position and just as I knew , I wasn't good ,each team didn't want me on their line ,and I as a material handler didn't need to be there. This was a South suburban , Illinois Whse that had metal detector entrance cuz they had gang incidents inside the company ."
bad,"i already gave summery before jewel"
bad,"the most unorganized warehouse i've ever worked at The worst beverage company between the 3 long hours awful pay management don't kno what their doing you apply for the job but when you start you end up doin more than what you were hired to do with no raise don't recommend working at this place do yourself a favor go to PEPSI or COKE,   7UP IS THE WORST PLACE TO WORK AT I HATE THAT PLACE "
bad,"In order to do the online application, you have to film a video, which requires a webcam."
bad,"This company as a whole is very poor in management. Management hardly gets back to you but won't hesitate when they need you to drive a half hour away from home because of a call out. They also pay Chinese overtime which means you MAKE less if you go over 40 hours, hence why they encourage working fast. Before I worked with them I read reviews that told me not to but I didn't listen. If you're considering employment at Keurig Dr.Pepper, whether it be in Ocala, FL or anywhere else, don't."
bad,the driver managers dont care blame everything on drivers no support for their drivers dont come here to work if u do make it a learning experince and move on quick new bosses were drivers once and forgot where they came from real quick no loyalty just another number
bad,Management and horrible. They help who they wanna help. Loads never ready. Supervisior don't care if you need help or assistance they just try to get all the routes out so they can sit in the office and chill. The pay is horrible it don't equal the work load. When it comes to promoting they pick and choose who they want instead of the most experience or qualify persons for the experience. I move on and found a better paying job and less work and stress.
bad,management was so lacking and would never help out employees. The work was so backed up and they had 4 people doing an 8 person job. THey didnt want to hire anybody and if they did the new hires would quit within 2 weeks
bad,"My least favorite job, I got paid well but they offered far too little training for a job that would take at least 6 months of training to comprehend, did not know what to do 85% of the time I was there, and they did not give me enough time to do work that would take me nearly half a day to complete."
bad,They can not keep good help. All they care about is getting the product out. And don't care about the employees. I will not ever try to work there again.
bad,This place is so bad. Very unprofessional management. Basically they will just throw you on a route without any real training. Go look for a better opportunity elsewhere.
bad,This company I will never go back. I was hired for a machinr operator but instead I was put in a different department. I made them aware of it and they said that I would have gotten the proper training. I never did and was really disappoint becuase I failed my family and myself.
bad,"Job is not as it was described. Job was supposed to lead to management responsibilities and it is not going to. "
bad,I enjoyed working with the people in the various stores I serviced.  I learned to be patient with the variety of people that I worked with.  I liked the men I worked with but the hardest part of the job was dealing with the lack of support from my immediate supervisor who was new to the job and his lack of experience was sometimes a problem.
bad,Orlando Fl.branch is the worst branch to work for whse manager/branch manager are incompetent all they care about is results budget.
bad,Management is a joke. The pay sucked. They paidf you at their lesiure. The best part of that job was the feeling of freedom as I drove my car out of the parking lot.
bad,good job to work for every one works as a team and gets the job done as a team. its a typicl day there i learned alott bout the job amd working in the warehouse
bad,When I with a rush I ran 3  Warehouse And rode   A  I draw the    Problem Folk   Live   I have 4 years folks   I did all the maintenance of the building  A clean of all the wealth
bad,Great company to work for has great benefits family orientated for most drivers is continuous work so you're constantly lifting pulling pushing other than that great exercise plus make a great living
bad,Ok job work life balance good environment also you meet different people on your route only downside is equipment failure and lack of truck and space around building to park
bad,The management was poor and inexperienced. They were not available or very hard to get in touch with them. They have a hard time with managing personal and districts
bad,This was a terrible situation for me at the time. The supervisor at the time did not make it easy to work with him. He made terrible decisions and created an unsafe work environment. He would single out people he did not like or fit with him. Later I would find out this led to his termination.
bad,"There is a lot of discrimination that goes on they unlawfully try to call and verify your doctor's appointments and do not excuse you for doctor notes even though they are verified and legit. Had to file many discrimination grievances because certain rules only apply to different ethnic groups. They tell you it's by ""seniority"" but when your seniority comes they changed policy to ""first come first serve"" but did not announce opportunity to everyone"
bad,This company was not a great experience for me. While going through training I had two different trainers train me the right way then I had a trainer who did things his ways just to say he got the job done quicker. I started out working at 6am in the morning and I never knew when I was finished. My schedule was very unpredictable. I was never guaranteed my raise after 90 days as promised during orientation. They promised to provide a company truck but never mentioned its first come first served. I never knew where I was traveling too. Pepsi and Coke had set schedules and knew the stores they had to go too but 7up only told you where your main store is and once your done you could be traveling to Eaton or New Carlise and the towns are not my route.The only thing good was my sales rep. She helped me more than anybody they put in front of me.
bad,fun job and all but no one has a clue what going on in the office
bad,I left on a positive note with management leaving my feedback anyone who comes into this role will have the same challenges with sub-par resources.  Even if you are a human-machine which is what she is looking for you will fail her expectations due to the horrifically slow network and the beyond micro managing style.
bad,"Peers are very pleasant. The microbial growth and lack of proper ventilation in the environment can induce some health issues. PAID breaks may taken, it can be frowned upon. My area was AV recorded, it is not an installed camera, not sure who is getting the AV. Quite comforting. "
bad,"Horrible place , shady people . Mandatory overtime . High volume for a tiny warehouse . Other workers play the blame game , doing jobs that isnt even your position. No recognition of good work, they will just use you more .All Supervisors are Snakes. Run far from this place , it will bring you down and you will have no life."
bad,"Span of control makes it difficult to accomplish your daily tasks, safety protocals, and other priorities. Many expectations on front line with little to no support."
bad,"Human Resources is never on-site for support and upper management gives you no support at all. They just want to make sure the work gets done. The employees are out of control and Human Resources allows them to run the place because they aren’t around to know the truth about what is really going on. There is no growth at all in Atlanta no matter how good of a job you do, in the Supervisor role weather that be on the warehouse or distribution side there is tons of turnover. Which makes it hard to develop or implement anything that can be sustained within operations. They give second chance opportunities which is why the environment is so bad and out of control. As a supervisor if you don’t get burned out and last long enough, you will have to move in order to move up in the company. (Communication is terrible!!! from top to bottom)"
bad,"The manager sit in his office all day watching tv and eating."
bad,"this particular branch is having a hard time due to management, system, and wages. They are only bottling company placing product on top of wooden pallets. The pallets wouldn't be a problem if there wasn't so much product. Pallets are constantly breaking and it causes problems when on out on route. The company wages is around $42,000 a year and that wouldn't be a problem if the job wasn't so hard on the body. The competing companies are paying nearly double for the long hours that are required when doing this job. The turnover rate is very high. When i was there we were constantly losing drivers to because of the issues caused by management mishandling of drivers, the compensation and work equipment failing. This branch, if ran properly, could be a very great place to work."
bad,"Typical Day as a merchandiser consist of starting at 7am with no set end time. Expect to work long days,over 8 hours, especially in the summer time. Each day, every merchandiser is assigned a route which consists of 4-6 stores, sometimes more. Mileage remburisement is low, and you dont get reimbursed for the mileage driven from your home to your first stop; as I wasnt aware of this until after being hired in and having to drive 20 plus miles at times- to my first assigned store on my route., "
bad,No room for advancement. Terrible compensation.  Management expects you to work in excess of 10 hours a day with no overtime pay. Run from this company.
bad,This is a horrible company to work for. Promises not kept. Work you like a slave. No communication. Incredibly low pay for the amount of work. Have to use your own vehicle with only 10 a day gas allowance that they do not reimburse.
bad,The management is a complete joke. Senior management is entirely way too hands on and micro manage all the way down to the hourly level. There is no direction.
bad,They start you off at 14.00-15.10 for 6 weeks only to drop your pay to 8.00. The supervisors are no help with fixing problems. All around bad deal..
bad,"Lack training and processes. Not willing to put back into the company and reinvest in operations. Work/Life balance is non-existent. Leadership is very ""Old-Boy""ish!"
bad,Each year the HQ environment continues to decline more and more. Benefits decrease each year while upper management continues to reward themselves with new cars at the expense of the employees that make them successful.
bad,DPSG has the best flavors on the industry and continues to grow.
bad,unorganized lack of communication between management and workers
bad,"You spend about 90% of your time on your lift (Yale 80VX with dual fork attachment) loading/unloading trailers and putting product away in a 5 high rack system. The pay (in my opinion) is not nearly comparable to the work load or the constant additions to the work load. The Warehouse manager speaks to you as if he is addressing a Kindergarten class and treats you as such. If you are looking to move up in the company you can forget about it. There is no room for advancement here. The co-workers and overall ease of work is appealing though. You will make about 400 (net) per week ($11.50 to start + $.50 for second shift and $1.00 for third) and with a lot of opportunity for overtime from April to September you could easily clear 600/week (net) working 60hrs/wk. It is Unionized so expect union dues of $29/month and an initiation fee of about $4-500 after your 90-day probation. The Teamsters Local 125 overseas this location, but don't expect them to do much on your part. The workforce is widely Hispanic with many of the employees barely speaking English. Raise schedule for the Union is every September 1st and will only get you around $.30 cents a year average over the next three years beginning with September 2012 (2012 - $.25 2013 - $.35, 2014 - $.32). I my opinion this DC could use a major overhaul. The workers are mostly disgruntled and have no real attachment to the company. The company makes no effort to improve moral, but instead just implements more policies that they ""think"" make sense. Overall its not a hard or stressful job so long as you don't get involved in the politics...which"
bad,"Management is a joke, no HR in Michigan, no plant manager, supervisors are hardly even in or seen when in. They worry about people’s accusations and not how Drastically the efficiency has dropped or how bad production is running. maintenance is always on phones on their butts and supervisors are too. Unfair and they have favoritism!"
bad,"Don't work here. Manager is a disrespectful and is a crybaby. You have to talk to him a certain way but when it comes to you, he doesn't care about your personal well being."
bad,"If you’re not a family person and don’t mind working from 4,5,6 am to 5,6,7 pm at night then this is the place for you. Inconsistent hours and poor management"
bad,This was a great job until we got a new branch manager 👎. He is high strung and ALWAYS right wether he really is or not. Very bad anger issues. He will call you and flip out on you even if you haven't done anything wrong.
bad,"Senior Management at the Plains region in Des Moines, Iowa are lazy and complacent and should be forced to retire when they are no longer effective. Just showing up for work and not effectively running the region should not be ok."
bad,"micro-management, long hours, everything is the sales reps fault even if it’s delivery or merchandising issues. It’s a job so of course it’s hard work, but placing unnecessary stress to your employees for failure on management is unreasonable. Incentives are given out a lot, but they are rarely obtainable and you won’t get paid out for them.  Run Away Fast, is day go work for McDonald’s at $15/hr, less work, less hours, and less stress."
bad,"I do not wish t comment further.  The company prior to integrating with Keurig was a more cohesive work unit.  Understanding that integration cause disruption, but some can be avoided with candid communication"
bad,The job was alright for a while but then it went down hill. I was there for a year and never was told about a meeting and had to find out what happened through the grape vine. I also asked many times to be full time and they would rather hire new people for that instead of letting current employees go full time.
bad,"Day starts at 0530 and not a second later regardless of DOT regulations from the previous day. They will help you get a restricted Class A CDL. The job itself is not so bad, but the management and dispatchers make the job more difficult than necessary. A good place to learn what hard work is about and the foundation of operating a tractor trailer."
bad,"Dont work here. Its not worth the time dealing with awful management that has no clue about anything, way underpaid for the work thats expected of you to be done. Poor equipment. Lots of two faced workers and constantly have to watch your back and cover your self or theyll turn anything they can against you and on you."
bad,Just getting into a pay scale i can live with after 2 years. they expect 50+hours a week while the union will allow them to work certain sections over 60hrs a week without notification.
bad,I thought it’s be a good gig very STRESSFUL Management was horrible don’t know what their doing!! Overtime is a joke they don’t pay time and half it’s some Chinese overtime not enough compensation for the stress and they put on.. DONT do it
bad,"For the short period of time i worked there, i did not enjoy my job because of the poor training and lack of management skills. The pay was the only pro from that job."
bad,The company is a good company and has some great brands. The business is fast paced and always changing. The challenge is to accept change and evolve.
bad,"To stressful  you really don't get to see your family as much because your always there and on some Saturdays you get short hours of rest(sleep) your done when your finished and that can be at any time in the morning,  especially if your kid have to be too school"
bad,"While working with Dr. Pepper I was able to achieve many great things for my family. However, I had to break my back, and deal with unruly managers in the process."
bad,"Same stuff everyday. Offered personal days, cant have them. Management wont work with you when needed. Its all about the product, no cares for employees."
bad,"Meeting at beginning of shjft everyday abojt hpw many cases we would have to pick for that shift."
bad,"Management was never around, let early. Always short staffed. The co workers complained most of the time while working. Late nights, No intent on getting correct amount of workers in the warehouse."
bad,"If you value your life and that of the drivers around you, DO NOT DRIVE THESE TRUCKS."
bad,"I'm a full-time college student, and was told this position would have flexible hours. Not only was this false, but I was frequently scheduled during classes and asked to skip classes for work. I was talked down on whenever I refused to comply with these requests. If you're looking for a solid full-time job, it's got good pay and the work is easy. If you're needing something on the side, stay away."
bad,Its a job...not very enjoyable but it pays the bills. If your looking for a career look elsewhere.
bad,"More than 50% of the work within a certain department was about putting on a show and ""maintaining consistency"" regardless of what the output actually was.  Suggesting anything new or changing/improving tasks or processes was strongly discouraged by management, above the plant level, who were unfortunately based at the plant but covered multiple facilities across the country.  They were extremely incompetent, primarily in people skills and ability to manage but also with some technical aspects as well.  Overall their skill sets were inadequate for the position they were in. "
bad,"This is a new company in the soda & premium brand. This company calls on Pepsi, Coke and  Independence of distributors or the  independent selling ops. This system has a leadership team that is not the best. That are cutting job based on head count, not Experience in the industry or Knowledge distributor networks& how it works. Just one part of the system with 10 different arms and no direction from the leadership team"
bad,"The leads doesnt come to help you... If you are behind time, they will have alot of excuse and tell you...sorry..help yourself,we are busy!...they give you plenty of stops.. But not as bad as coke.. Coke is too much work!!!  In general, i like the job, its very physical and mental allertness. But long hours doesnt give your body enough time to heal from the worst labor of your life..."
bad,Warehouse closin in apirl to move to now gotta find a new job after 4 yrs of really nothing..thanks for nothing. They didnt care about the employees just that nasty  juice
bad,This used to be a great company to work for when it was Green Mountain Coffee Roasters. Once they sold out twice and became Keurig Dr. Pepper they became a terrible company to work for. Management is poor and reporting issues to Human resources does not help you. Health benefits are absolutely terrible. You are forced onto an HSA plan. If you are in production you are forced to do overtime even on holidays. If you are looking to advance favoritism comes into play.
bad,"I wouldnt recommend this job, the amount of hard labor you do compared to the amount you are payed is not worth the damage done to your body or the stress it puts on you daily."
bad,"Unless you have been working there for years on years that puts you in 1st shift it's not good. 2nd shift production is made to stay past their schedules off time and ""voluntary"" mandated to work Fridays. It says nothing in the employment contract about being force to work overtime or on Fridays. Management only cares about what they have to get done and non of there employee's needs. They do not supply proper equipment to do jobs properly. Getting a uniform takes forever"
bad,While I worked for this company Dr. Pepper was the only company in the city part of the merchandising union. I felt this and the seat holder only hurt the employees. Management was not supportive and picked on newer employees
bad,One of the worse job experience I have threw my jobs I have had. Management is super poor when it comes to talking with employee due to job being union. Back breaking work when doing stores(accounts) if falling behind they expect you to do mandatory ot till your route is done. Again lack of communication due to job being union so alot of the times any news that is must know we don't know.
bad,Poor management and your have to work 6 days just to get at least 34 hours. Equipment always broke are never enough for everyone. And the supervisor is racist only care about hispanic workers.
bad,"Not going to be long, if you can merchandise for any other company do it, thank me later. Because the stress if this company is endless and you are the lowest paid it off the beverage companies."
bad,"You will work your tail off For Low wages They will not advance you, Your raises are low, The Employees are cool mangement Are Snakes. Long hours in the summer scraping for hours in the fall/Winter, A Very Underpaid Job for the physical labor"
bad,In my interview I was told they don’t cover places that take close to an hour to travel to next thing I know I get asked to travel from Des Moines Iowa to fort dodge Iowa or Iowa falls both takes around an hr so yea basically was lied too you’ll get asked on a weekly basis to work on your day off you must call when you’re done even if you worked 10-14 hrs they dismiss you unless If they don’t reply after 10 min
bad,"If you want to loose some weight and get paid to do it ,not get paid very well, then this is a good job for you. Its very physical. I walked 20+ miles a day and stocked 30-40 pallets of soda a day. Went 21 days without a dsy off. Worked 3 am to 5 pm a lot. drove 40,000 miles a year easily"
bad,Lots of work for very low pay.Everyone for themselves type of attitude.Small storage space to much product for the limited space. People are not very friendly.
bad,"Everything seemed perfect my first month (even though i started in the craziest time of the year). When my first year or so come around, the warehouse did a complete 360. Empty promises filled my ears along with the rest of the night shift loaders. The managers would prioritize specific people on certain trucks. The same loaders would finish first EVERY SINGLE NIGHT due to the guy pulling in and moving trucks. After putting in almost 2 yrs, I later found out and overheard in passing, the SUPERVISORS telling the ""All-Star team"" (their favorites) when to ask for more work. They would get the biggest pallets and would hit the nightly number each individual picker had to achieve before logging off the headset while the others was stuck picking the small orders and would be throwing until the work was complete. Supervisors would tell my personal info the crew on dayshift and the other pickers on night shift that was below me in senority. I even had pickers below me come up to me and tell me that was getting suspended before i had any idea about it! When any of us would get in contact with the union to request an investigation, as soon as the supervisors caught wind of this, they grouped up to cover every square inch of evidence we had on them. So we seemed like a bunch of cry babys in the eyes of our union rep. The computers would even add points on to your record from several months ago that you thought you might of already served a suspension for. NOPE!! Turns out they hold back those points just incase they want to work up a case on you to get you terminated and in the end you"
bad,"Dr Pepper as a whole has the ideals if it doesnt work, lets not change it. As a merchandiser you will walk in to stores that weren't fully worked. Product not down stacked or everything wasnt put to the shelf/coolers which could. "
bad,"I wasn’t a fan of this job. The hours were long. I would get to work at 6am and wouls not get home until 6pm. The pay wasn’t all that. I didn’t like the fact you had to use your on vehicle. Yes they will reimburse you for mileage but it was only .40 a mile. Most of the reps from other companies like coke and Pepsi started out with this company and they all quit because of low pay, no set routes, and no overtime. I would do your research before you apply for this job."
bad,Signed a confidentiality agreement. I cannot legally speak on or against the company. My advice to people seeking would is to use this company to jumpstart your career.
bad,"Hopefully this employee isn't there anymore, but if they feel ""threatened"" by your work ethic, they will do anything to get you fired. Management wasn't bad, no problems there. The warehouse was a little unorganized, though."
bad,"poor management, stressful, long hours, little recognition, lack of resources, failing equipment, unrealistic expectations. Union environment, unmotivated employees"
bad,"if you want long hours, overtime,  and like to work alone this is your place. great job at first but they never have any help on the busiest days and just want you to do all the work yourself."
bad,"Work long hrs, for little pay, overtime is Chinese over time. If you don't know what that is your better off. I would not recommend any driver to work here unless you enjoy being lied to and paid very little for your time."
bad,Horrible Hostile environment to work in.  Poorly managed at the location I was working.  They are looking for slaves not employees.  They lure you in with a good salary and then leave you there to rot for 15 to 16 hour shift as a salaried employee.
bad,"A lot of backstabbing,favoritism. Management has a high turnover rate. Management is very lazy. You have to use your own vehicle for work and the compensation is pitiful. Human resources is a secretary with a different title."
bad,Since your on commission. The managers cut the merchandisers hours and leave you to finish their job.  And the sales rep. Has no choice but to do it since it's their pay if those cases don't get put on the sales floor. On your days off you still need to answer your nextel for any problems because the D.M. Won't pick up their phones.
bad,"Had to be there by 4am for Bulk routes and 5:30am for side loader routes. Walk in hope you have a route, get your manifest paper letting you know the stops (which were almost always routed improperly for example, you would have your first stop opening at 6am second at 7am and the third at 4am when you would clearly get there at first stop by 5am at the latest) then you would see what truck you had by walking out and around the building to match it up with the trailer on your manifest. then if you didn't have a truck under you trailer, you would tell your manager you needed one just to have him tell you tough s**t kid, then he would make you wait until everyone else got checked in before you would get a truck. after the check in then it was on the road for 8-14 hours. Bulk routes you would have about 5-9 stops dropping skids of sodas in big stores like Kroger, Wal-Mart, Target, ect. and Side loader routes you would have 9-17 stops taking the sodas off the truck loading them on an L-Cart/Dolly then taking 15-100 cases in a gas station and stocking every piece, it really take its toll on your body. Once you were on the road you could expect to get a call asking where you were, if you say what they don't want to hear, expect to get yelled at, cussed at, called dumb, slow and useless. The best thing was the customers and being out everyday without having to be micromanaged."
bad,"Pretrip my truck. Complete paperwork and checkout before heading out. Drive safely to route and then start delivering product to correct address and customer. collect signature and cash from customer. Once the route is finished head back to station. Back at station unload trays and pallets, get checked out, turn in all paperwork and cash."
bad,Definitely one of the less professional groups I have ever been part of.  Lots of long hours and unappreciative management.  Trucks on the road are very dangerous.  The only reason they are somewhat successful is because the products sell themselves.
bad,"a typical day for me would be driving my own car to about 4-5 different stores and merchandising, which basically took up about 12-15 hours of my day due to the fact that i was pregnant. not to mention that i never had any help though out my first trimester and i had to do everything myself on top of being harassed by my supervisor. they even sent me on short term disability when they felt i wasnt able to work anymore. very bad company to work for....you dont work much in your territory, they send you all over houston, and dont even pay you milage....they pay $7 per day for using your own car."
bad,"Its all about what the company what's and needs, people quit every month because they treat them like machines not like humans. Stay away from this company look somewhere else don't waste your time and your back."
bad,For your self type of culture. Not a lot of help from team. Management could stand to do more managing. No room for cross training. Voice rarely heard.
bad,"If you're looking for an opportunity to work your way up in this company well there is none here.... you either know someone or be a yes man to get somewhere.... I worked too long to see that and as much as I busted mine and work harder to get recognized or better value myself, I got no where..."
bad,"The workers are nothing but numbers as the turnover rate is super high because nobody’s job is safe. As soon as your training is over, you’re a target"
bad,Pay is ok but if you’re not Spanish you feel left out and they point out flaws alot. They also told me I was going to be working second shift but then once I started I was told I have to work 3rd shift starting at 9pm.
bad,I worked there for 2 years and received a 39 cent raise. My hours kept going lower and lower. I couldn't survive only making a little over 200 dollars a week.
bad,Work environment was very stressful and if you don't make production numbers you will answer for it.  Benefits were great at first but not now corporate greed took over and moral is low.  People leaving left and right.
bad,"Getting paid to work out"
bad,"poor equipment, poor management there is no fair between drivers for routes, you have to work driver with merchandiser but you get paid as just driver"
bad,"When I first started at Dr. Pepper Snapple it was a fantastic environment. Employees were treated well and rewarded. Once the merger went through however things started to change, more and more metrics were implemented that seemed more to punish employees rather than actually discover inefficiencies. The managers are losing touch with their employees moral and overall it is starting to go downhill."
bad,"I was with the company BEFORE Keurig purchased it, but understand that nothing has changed except many of the top level executives have left."
bad,"There are too many major changes of job responsibilities. 13 years with the company and was laid off because my position that I was promoted to was eliminated. The company offered me another position $17,000 less then my previous salary. This was a punch in the gut for me so I made the decision to go in another direction. Employees are constantly mistreated and management is always overwhelmed with doing extra work. Every department always seems to be under staffed. Glad I am finally away from this stressful, unfair, workplace."
bad,"Often extremely difficult to get days off, far too many 6-7 day weeks. Breaks are short and managers will randomly decide to crack down on breaks. Neither shifts hours are all that appealing."
bad,job it self is not bad but the  management and hr sucks they believe anything even if it not true  be careful especially  the hr team in the Houston location.
bad,I would not return to this company ever in this or the next lifetime. But let the record show Dr Pepper is great to upper management but terrible to the fuel behind the name
bad,"Being a merchandiser is possibly the worst decision you can make working for this company. Sales rep are never happy with your work unless you go above and beyond, and to go above and beyond you have to be absolutely exhausted by the end of it. Your entire team is horrible, you’ll never see coming back from a day off that you aren’t cleaning up a volcano, it’s absolutely insane. The management could care less about you as long as they don’t hear complains from the stores. You need help? Good luck with that. 6-7 stores a day with orders. The pay is beyond horrible. You get 30$ a day for your car, no matter how many miles you drive, and it comes with your paycheck so you’re taxed on it. The office manager is a absolute joke. All he talks about is drinking and mixing snapple with his alcohol after work. And how expensive his cars are, while you’re sitting there listening to him and wondering why the company isn’t paying you a decent rate, that’s because they’re giving it all to him. He’s a lair and has lied time and time again about getting better raises and he’s “working” on it. The annual raise is .36 cents a year. And you start at 12.00$ an hour."
bad,"Not enough money to live on when the other companies merchandisers make at least 5 dollars more on the hour, you basically have to do everything yourself I had to call the other employees and tell them they were training me and on top of it all you have to use your own car and the Reimbursement barley covers the gas you use. So my advice you’d probably make more money in the long run working at a McDonald’s"
bad,Be prepared to work all night.  night after night.  Management will work with you as much as they can but their hands are tied because it is a union position.
bad,"As a warehouse worker, you're on the bottom of the totem pole there and that is quickly made very apparent to you with the work load and treatment. If you do not maintain a specific pace for consecutive weeks, you are promptly dismissed. Everything works from seniority as well so even if you have a paid vacation planned and someone comes along with more seniority than you, they can bump you from your time off and you then run the risk of either being out of the money for your trip or possibly not having a job when you come back. We were at one point even told by a corporate representative that the warehouse crew is the ""hardest working, most demand position in the company"" but the pay does not reflect that statement at all."
bad,"The management at Dr. Pepper Snapple Group was extremely poor. In the Motts plant in Williamson I was lucky to receive my schedule for the following week by Sunday night. There was a few times I was scheduled to work Sunday of a week and told on that same Sunday, after the shift I was supposed to work ended. Generally the people there are relaxed, but the management is very poor."
bad,"Started out well, moved up positions quickly. 2nd shift supervisor was good to work for, but the rest of management was not efficient at their positions. Felt little job security with direction plant was headed."
bad,"While i was getting paid hourly it was pretty good place. Overtime was paid and i got plenty of work 70-80 hours when all the positions wasn't filled. When i took a promotion i feel that i was lied to and cheated. There was always a new excuse why I wasn't making very much. My mileage reimbursement was over two months late, that was from another company, but still. No company vehicle and no gas card. I spent 2/3 of my check in getting my work done. To start work there wasn't bad, getting promoted has absolutely screwed my life up."
bad,It's hard work lots of merchandising at stores when I would have lots of stops I would never get help be out there 12 or more hours managers didn't care
bad,Not a good place to work at all management is a joke . They talk about there drivers bad. If anything happens with a costumer and you they are going to take the costumer side and paint the picture you did something wrong. Even if you did everything right. You are always in the wrong with them. Pay is not that great
bad,job was horrible very horrible. management was very hard to work for and when you needed to call someone for questions about the job no one would answer the phone
bad,"Work hard,long with poorly maintained equipment,struggle and suffer untill you're off.But in the company of good people.I've been here long enough to move on."
bad,Never know what route you'll be running but you will be home everyday. Be ready to work! Management eh? Managers constantly change. Very tiring but somewhat worth the pay
bad,"A typical day merchandising for Dr Pepper consists of a daily routine in which you travel all over the city in your own vehicle to at least 4-5 different grocery stores.  The management only tells you where to go and what to do but will never lend a helping hand until you get too many complaints from the store directors.  Your co workers are never around to help as this job enviorment is not a team enviornment at all. The only time you deal with a co worker is for your 2 week training, which might be cut short due to the lack of staffing. The hardest part of the job is filling the empty shelves of the stores, especially if you work a store that someone skipped the day before you. beware of this company. they are foul."
bad,"Management is clueless "
bad,"My typical day is to walk into an account greeted by an angry manager about why their load was not delivered, damaged, not on schedule,etc. Tons of Drama. No accountability from managers to address issues with employees. Some of the pros of the job is a change of scenery. Not doing the same thing daily. Benefits are excellent. You do have the opportunity to transfer."
bad,the company never helped any of the sales reps. the coworkers we nice and helpful.
bad,Load pallets with proper product. Never enough to make full time hours unless holiday weeks.
bad,"There is no concern for employees by management once so ever.  Communication is non existent.  Would go weeks without emails being replied to phone calls returned by direct supervisors.  Any issues were answered with "" I have other stuff to worry about.""  No focus on sales or fixing problems.  Overall caring by management does not make one think its  a sales driven company."
bad,I loved my job but the environment was very unprofessional. I also feel I needed more hours to support my family.
bad,"First off this company does not take care of their drivers. Under paid compared to all the other companies. Management is lazy, sales ppl are lazy as well. Routes are all screwed up."
bad,Hard to work in the maintenance department. Shifts do not communicate. 3rd shift thinks they do no wrong and everyone else is stupid. Our pay scale is one of the lowest in Columbus and you are expected to work every weekend. Supervisor s and Managers are trying to turn it around but they have a long way to go.
bad,Too much nepotism to for advancement! Asking questions about that gets you fired or put into a position that your not able to advance any further in the company
bad,"Loyalty shown by the employees that care enough to go above and beyond is not reciprocated by management. Only selected individuals are expected to pick up the slack shown by lazy and employees that fake illnesses, injuries and call in sick. Bad employees are catered to and good employees are used and abused and are expected to put in twice the effort for the same pay as the bad employees."
bad,"There are pros to working here, however, they are far outweighed by the cons. "
bad,Toxic environment mainly due to the distribution manager. Insurance is terrible and so is the most people's moral that work there. After a short time working there you realize you're just a body and they tell you what you want to hear to keep you from walking out like everyone else.
bad,Nothing more to say about working here.  If you want more than 40 hours or want to get close to 40hrs good luck. They need to change its pay and give more hours
bad,Fun place to work for what the job is and you will learn many skills however management and HR is just a mess. Tons of clicks on site makes for rough work environment and people  getting away with things that wouldn't fly for others just based off who they know. Also participate in blame fixing and shifting blame away for friends in their clicks.
bad,"many long work days, work until orders are done,uniforms provided. management not on the same page. i was able to utilize my skills as a driver regularly"
bad,While the days of worker are long up to 13 hours we rotate 3 days off one week and 4 days of the next. This allows for a ton of off days. It has been a great thing for my young family. and has allowed me to balance pursuing my education while earning a living wage
bad,"It's a shame, the team is one of the best I've ever worked with since coming here and the knowledge of a couple of the guys that have been here has made it a lot easier on a day to day basis. But with Dr. Pepper coming in the entire environment has changed and moral has gone in the crapper!!! There has been a constant stream of people leaving and that includes Managers, Supervisors from the production building and it's only the start, as there is a line of people waiting at the door to leave and I'm not talking about just a couple. "
bad,"Company is very political & cut throat especially on Bottling Side of the business. They lie, cheat, pay to play and promotions are not the same for every customer. The big fish get kickbacks etc. "
bad,"I worked in eau claire for almost 4 years...the new manager is absolutely horrible...plays favorites, lies, puts people down and the communication is horrible. The manager lives an hour and a half a way from eau claire and is never around. Hard to get 40 hours. 2 of the other employees suck and dont do their job."
bad,"Not enough attention is given to the front line merchandising staff,the individuals actually going out and making sure the product is represented in the stores. The day starts with checking your phone to see what your route for the day is, which may change daily to meet the needs of customers, this can make for a long day as some of the routes are spread out and require to travel all around town. The amount of stores you have to go to a day varies, but nothing less than 6 most week days, and as many as 8-10 on weekends. The daily rate/mileage pay is not competitive with other companies, working in the same role. Merch staff is expected to work within certain guidelines, but sometimes this is unattainable due to the demand of the job itself and sheer number of stops daily."
bad,"This position as accepted until a better paying , better opportunity presented it's self, On positive note Dr Pepper, Inc do lead the beverage market and continued to do so."
bad,"business development in the vending arena. golf courses, anywhere that could fit a vending machine. nice people to with, closed the location in youngstown"
bad,I refuse to comment on this particular employer. My best advise is to see for yourself. I think this field should not be a required field. This is really annoying more than anything.
bad,"Everything has gone to the dump since bought out by Keurig now we have one of the worst healthcare benefits packets I've ever seen in Corporate American and I have been in Corporate America for over 15 yrs. Don't do it now, run to nearest exit."
bad,"lazy coworkers and aggressive/disrespectful management. If it wasn't for those employees, the job would be much more manageable. But, since it that is not the case, not recommended."
bad,I have worked for This company for 3years and haven’t once seen them hire with in  that’s un Hurd of and the pay is terrible they could really do better
bad,"As a District Manager, the responsibility is great. The amount of time needed to train and develop employees as well as spend in the field was not well compensated."
bad,"The management was very abusive and seemed to target employees if you ever made one slip up. They will fire you without notice right before your next shift if there is a grudge against you. There is a lot of favoritism shown here. However, the job itself is really fun and competitive but the management really ruins it."
bad,"Your forced to work 6 to 7 days you don’t have a schedule to follow it’s always last minute so can not make plans unless there’re schedule permits it  management  Don’t have a clue what’s going on yet there the only ones  allowed to be off on the weekends  there’s no communication across the entire company management will not  listen to your ideas only their ideas are the best ones you are just a number machines are falling apart and will not spend money to fix it but when they fail (and they fail) it’s your fault and they don’t remember you telling them about it  other bottles plants pay much higher  in the area "
bad,"Barely any time for a life outside of work! I definitely learned a lot and was glad I did but I would most likely never work hear again, definitely not enough pay for the amount of work you were given and hours you had to work!"
bad,It a job that not for every one you will work a lot of hour and the pay does not seem fair but there were good people that made the job fun in my opinion it’s no place to start a career.
bad,come in at 2pm don't leave till 4am sometime 6am management don't care if you get any sleep or not some weeks we don't even have off days need more managers on 2nd shift and employees the one supervisor they have on 2nd shift work so hard and they do him so wrong. I pull and don't get paid enough 0.07 a case seven cent jst sad.
bad,n/a to much pressure on the body and they always changing things around there and the way they do they point system you miss one day they give you two points no matter if you have a doctors note are not that's why there turn over rate is high and they don't keep anyone there and poor management
bad,"What to expect-"
bad,The business structure is terrible. Formal training is almost non existent. I was routinely working 10 hours a day and being told my work wasn’t good enough. Too picky considering Coke and Pepsi make sogonofocantly more money to do the same job.
bad,"No room for advancement, non union so basically they do what they want. No life work balance, management is terrible, no recognition, favoritism, terrible communication and the list goes on. If u have interests in working for this company dont. Stay away."
bad,"You sacrifice your family life to spent 60 plus hours, some over 70 hours at work. Management cares nothing for the emplyees, you are just a number. Would not recommend to a friend."
bad,A lot of work for little pay. Walmart Managers and receiving employers are constantly on you for little stuff. There are better opportunities out there. Trust me!
bad,fast paced. midnights.  learned a lot about shipping/receiving.  learned a lot about unionized employees.  long hours.  much room for advancement.  friendly staff.
bad,They hire you as daily workers so they have a reason to not pay you over time pay which is time and a half. they only pay you half time. You work some days 14 hours and bring home a little over 400 for a 50-60 plus hour work week. They work you like a dog and care less about their employees that work the warehouse.
bad,Working their is stressful and it seem like to me the managers there don’t care about there workers the warehouse is not organized the loaders their are not happy
bad,"getting your loaded truck, wait around to see if you will get a helper for the day. Then you begin your day, go to designated accounts and begin delivering the product."
bad,I did not enjoy my experience at Dr pepper Snapple as a full time employee. The hours were long and I had no help. No bonuses no incentives no recognition for any overcame obstacles.
bad,I feel they dont show enough appreciation to there warehouse loaders. They treat other occupations better than others. The work place is very hot and you have no time for yourself or family during work week
bad,This company is not that bad. All it needs is a better management group and way more communication. Maybe also treat the employees a little better.
bad,"Fun job very fast paced but managment is a joke advertise 40 hours a week but if you work 1min over your 8 hour day you get jumped then depending on your rout the next day you may only get 5 hours or so so getting 40 hours is near impossible. Every time i called in with a question to my superviser i was told ""i dont know youll have to ask one of the other merchandisers"" very buddy buddy work place if you are friends with management you can totaly scrue up your job no prob but if anyone trys to say anything its game over for the complantent"
bad,"I worked for DPSG for over two years. I gave them huge amounts of time and effort but management always expected more. Terrible work life balance, it became impossible to schedule things or do anything outside of work. Mandatory overtime kicked in often, usually 55 hours a week or well over. Management didn't care at all about me personally, (something I realized after my mom was diagnosed with cancer and I wasn't able to plan doctor's visits with her because of overtime.) If you have ideas on how to make things work smoother, management doesn't care at all and will not pay it any mind. Management allowed glaring errors from coworkers and expected their ""good employees"" to pick up all the slack. Needless to say, I hated it by the end. The pay is decent and good benefits, that's why I stayed so long."
bad,Management wouldn't work with you as needed. They would over work you and expect to finish in 8 hours. Compensation wasn't worth the excessive amounts of work
bad,If you want to make money keep looking. job security is here but money is not. Pepsi or coke is the way to go as far as the beverage industry.
bad,Staff didn't do their jobs like told. Pay wasn't worth all the work they expect you to do. Reimbursement was only acceptable because the vehicle i have has high MPG.
bad,"Low pay, hard work, long work weeks, poor management.  Over-time pay is called Q time.  where you should be making time and a half, you get an average of 3 dollars per hour for over 40 hours.  Definitely not worth it.  You have no quality of life."
bad,"Iv worked for 7up or DrpepperSnappleGroup for 4 years and the only advancement there is! Is a worse position. The only organization is "
bad,Days spent mostly on my own driving from store to store working orders following my assigned route.  Little to no interaction with coworkers as they were on their own routes.  Management was never afraid to call and give you more work.
bad,very hard labor job that averages about 12-14 dollars per hour
bad,"A good place to work only if you start out in the warehouse, doing the loading and picking of product and work your way up to driver. New drivers are expected to give top notch performance right off the bat. You can either be daily paid driver or a case pay, case pay can very week to week. Depending on how fast you are, you can make a little more. If your slow, you wont make $I-Iit. You are expected to work under 50 hours a week. every week it seems like the managment is adding new rules to make your job more complicated, like more paperwork, more steps and unrealistic goals set by people who work at a desk. Routing is done by a guy at a computer in another state! does that make sense? You have little controll over your route. its no wonder why this company only strives to be the best in the americas, yet they really are way back in 3rd.  when there are sales, they continue to run out of the product that is on sale! how is that good to make more money and for the company??  So if you are just starting out with a class A, come here, get the experience and then find another job that wants you to have at least 6 months exp. So thats about all this company is good to work for. exp. for you next higher paying job!"
bad,"I could go on with all my emails, text messages, and pictures that show how bad this companies image and lack of work ethic is .- But I'll just talk about how my former bosses did not answer their phones or give any help with complaining customers ( Ralphs, independent stores, gas stations, etc) because of shipment problems, display problems, not enough merchandising problems, etc. I had one merchandiser everyday for my 4 Ralphs, 2 vons, the #1 pavilions #2739 (atleast 800 cases a week) 2 bristol farms, 1 gelsons, 1 smart n final, 1 target, 1 kmart, 6 cvs, the #1 walgreens 6445 (60 cases week) and 1 riteaid. I had to merch stores everyday and sell to some of my other 100+ small format stores. I did it, not to many complaints from me, until I noticed  I was missing money on every check since I took over the route. I received 2 commissions reports in my 3 1/2 years with DPSG. (we were told we would get one every week). On it I noticed I was not getting paid for  some delivered items. I told my boss, HR, and my branch mgr about this for 3 months Aug- Nov 2013. They told me I was crazy, then they finally found ""the glitch"" and that DPSG owed me $1200. After I was paid I was written for an incident that happened on my day off and then fired. One more illegal thing- my old boss made me drive my truck into the LA branch loading door and fill my truck with a load that was not shipped by simi truck. So the Warehouse mgr loaded a pallet in my 85 toyota pickup (I have pics) with soda, water, etc. I drove down the street where the load fell out of my truck onto the street (more pics avail)."
bad,"Was a sub contractor...... Worked my own hours and was able to work at my own pace. However the job didn't offer insurance, so I have to proceed to look otherwise."
bad,"Workin their was to much hours to work. I was working 65 hours a week. Good for money, but bad for sleep and hygiene for working that much."
bad,to much work terrible benefits long hours with bad pay not worth the time and effort.
bad,"The manager is someone who does not know what he is doing, very incompetent. A young kid that is lost. thinks he is the only one allowed to take off even when he has no vacation time. he was hired in july and has missed 23 days with excuses of flu spider bite kid is sick moving. this company needs better employees who are COMMITTED to work."
bad,Poor employee support with a good old boy network that keep those really dedicated employees from being heard and supported. No development from leadership
bad,"The job itself I love, but the management is awful. Got a flat tire and broke down on the side of the road on your way home with no way to fix it because it's sunday and most places are closed and have no ride to even pick you up? Not their problem, it's not a valid excuse to call in the next day"
bad,"The culture in my department is bad, I don’t believe it’s like that in all departments.  The morale is very low.  Unfair treatment from management, micromanaged.  Horrible experience overall."
bad,Not coo place. One of the night supervisors should not be one.  That company is a job with no e in team. The only cool thing they do for us each year is the company picnic
bad,Decide carefully on where you want work and thouroughly look at the situation for a long-term perspective. Choose a shift that will accomedate your personal life.
bad,Everyone’s work experience is different but for me I felt conned coming here. This place talks a big game. Executive Management sells themselves as visonary but the reality is you find they are old school and behind the times. This causes a ton of unnecessary stress for everyone eslse. Don’t take my word for it though. If you really want to work here ask the recruiter about employee engagement overall and the score for the department you are considering working in then find people who work in said department and ask them.  It should be all you need to know. Good luck!
bad,I enjoy the job it just gets frustrating with the lack of communication between the account managers and the merchandisers which makes my job harder than it should be.
bad,"They pay 17.50/hr for order selectors and 15.00/hr for loaders it’s sounds good but you don’t get your 40 hours unless you work Monday through Saturday and you alternate your Saturdays off , no room for advancement, I worked Monday through Saturday and I got 38.50 hours so it’s not all worth it"
bad,Extremely unorganized  can never get routes right might see two trucks drive by on same street or might even see truck delivering to a store directly across the street from you then send you 25 min ride out the way for next delivery... last stop on manifest is always the farthest away almost seems like they just throw what ever they got on your route equipment is trash pallet jacks or beat up badly lift gate jam daily Tucks never start have to wait for to get fuel up nearly every morning you come in early and won’t leave the docks nearly after a hr of being on the clock warehouse can’t stack pallets and don’t secure trucks EVER chargers in trucks never work but management wants to write you up for equipment failure overtime is never equally giving to all drivers and neither is help u never know what your gonna get because you’re so called router changes daily like I said they throwing whatever on your route it’s just a mess and 7up Snapple has been in its place it’s been because lack of catering for its drivers and other employees the standard is set so low when competing with other beverage companies would only recommed this job for temporary stay there no raises no bonus no way to come up your are set new guys can start making more than you because of this so yea not a place to stay just come for the experience don’t say I didn’t warn you
bad,tHIS place has a horrible safety culture and the everyone seems to overlook the safety.  The management is ok but they do show favoritism and do not implement the same rules to everyone.
bad,"Long hours, below average pay, average benefits, absolutely no work/life balance. Make you feel guilty for taking time off. Laughable tuition reimbursement for employees (which shows how little they care about developing their employees). Authoritarian Management at all different levels."
bad,You have to start very early in the morning so you can be able to pull pallets. You want to beat the crowd at the stores. You have to try an make a strategy of what stores to do. You have to hope that the phone works or you wont get paid. You dont get to do what Pepsi and coke can do. It is a very physical job that you have to keep going. You have to try and take your one break (lunch) while you drive from store to store. The other people that run the route will most likely screw you and leave you with a lot of the work that they should have done. It ends up starting at 6 am and ending around 4 pm. You dont get to decide what days you get off.
bad,"Management was very non involved and when they were they expected you have everything full at all times, because you know heaven forbid people came and bought the product hours after you had already left the store.  Also no room for advancement at all, I was passed up on numerous promotions even though I had more experience than anyone else."
bad,"really fast paced job, the harder you work the better your check will be. not safe, employees are reckless with equipment. dirty atmosphere. break room and bathrooms are horrible, and mangers are unprofessional"
bad,"It's fun to work at Dpsg when I first started but whe the branch manager got replace everything was  turn into worst they threaten you, need to be his favorite so you have job security"
bad,They eat you up and spit you out plain and simple. It started out as a good experience for the 1st year then after my 1st back injury it just went down hill from there. I was a sidebay truck driver and I don't mind working hard for my money but dam these guys just load you up more and more until your back gives out and then they will just replace you like you were never there. Sad but true.
bad,management very bad nobody knows what anybodys doing.the hardest part of is what tine your load is coming.and who is bringing it.and whats on it. the best part is meeting new people every day.
bad,"For the work done, this company does not pay enough. From the heavy lift, pulling, to building displays, etc...even though mileage is paid - this actual work itself is not appropriately compensated."
bad,Very labor intensive for a driver because you rarely have help delivering the products.  A typical day is very unpredictable because your route can vary day to day.
bad,not bad place to work. Pay not enough for time spent. And also not enough support. expect you to do a good job with half the employees you need!!......
bad,"While working at Dr Pepper, I learned several sales skills on my own. A typical day at work included Sales, merchandising, and delivering products to customers."
bad,"Constantly changing focus. Expects you to create miracles with selling. Never know when you will get out of work. You might think you're getting out at 2pm and you get a call and you're working until 5pm, and no is not an answer."
bad,"In 25 years with the company I learned a lot regarding warehouse/logistics, Inventory, production scheduling and planning, lean operations, management, supply chain, SAP and overall operations of a beverage manufacturing facility.  I was able to experience travel within the company to help launch SAP WMS applications to other facilities within the company. Dealt with and learned a lot from a very diverse group of great people in the 20 plus years at DPSG."
bad,"When viewed externally, this company is a money generating machine.  They pump out dividends, stock buyback, and stock price growth."
bad,"Pay is half decent, but too many hours.  No time for family life; high turnover.  Company bought out Davis Beverage in Bethlehem, Pa.  Too many chiefs and not enough trustworthy people."
bad,"The benefits and compensation are competitive."
bad,orlando branch has the worst management team i seen in 18years no backing  and want to blame fix you for everything you do but they are not held accountable for when they are responsible for something you go to meeting and watch supervisor bring there little kids to the office and yell and whip them in front of employees come in in shorts and flipflops and nothing is done about that stay away from this company in orlando  you will regret it. you cant even see how they pay you and when you ask  they blow you off
bad,"unfair work on commission, co worker feel mistreated, too physically demanding"
bad,The work itself is not terrible but the employees are very judgemental and a large population of the male employees are inappropriate and overly sexual with their comments and it makes working there very uncomfortable. There is not enough training when you are hired and there is a lot of favoritism. When sexually assulted they make it out to be the females problem and nothing will be done.
bad,10-12 hour work day
bad,Was very exciting talking to all of the people during your work day.
bad,"This job was an okay place to work initially. Until I became familiar with the workers and procedures they follow and noticed that not everyone is on the same page, and leads show favortism to particular workers which i feel is highly unacceptable!"
bad,Trust no one. Management does not care about workers. Co workers are good. No supplies for the job expected of you. Expected a lot for a little.
bad,"no organization whatsoever , warehouse is a mess, nice ppl to work with tho"
bad,"Need to have a 3 day training on Forklift operations , you losing some good and intelligent people because of not having an on the job training people like myself who is a NUTRITIONAL Science Graduate, who could excel in Control and Quality,  lab work, besides Batching"
bad,"Although this company has great compensation and benefits, management typically does not care about how work affects employees and doesn't do enough to ensure employees feel valued."
bad,"I haven't worked here for nearly 5 years but from what I can see the starting pay is still not worth the type of work involvement. The warehouse was tiny, extremely hot in the summer, they had no fans or a/c inside. This job should be $15.00 an hour minimum starting unless they changed it dramatically since I left but I highly doubt it. Work involved trying to pick as many cases as possible you didn't get extra pay or any incentive, communication was awful there were days when we had to rebuild pallets of merchandise cause they lead salesman didn't get orders in till way after the time cap. They would sometimes add extra junk to our orders, and the parking the trucks in the warehouse was something we had to do. The drivers never did it, and of course you had to reverse each truck inside cause the forklift had to reach all the open bays and with the lack of room in the warehouse that would've been impossible driving them in forward. Honestly this was the worst job I ever did and back then I was doing it for $11 an hour. Even starting $13.00 an hour is criminal and very underpaid. Don't work here there's better warehouse jobs that pay more and are less stressful and of course the summer heat not being an issue."
bad,"Pay was pretty good and coworkers were fun to work with, but management was terrible.  I accepted 2nd shift job offer over phone, but when I showed up for orientation they didn't even have a 2nd shift.  Same thing happened to another guy they hired about a month after me.  No employee handbook and when I had HR related questions, rep was rarely there to answer them.  Worst problem was that crew was badly understaffed the entire time I was there, and company didn't seem to know or care.  Too much overtime was the result.  Quit in middle of work week from fatigue 2 or 3 hours before shift end on a Wednesday.  Worked 37 hours in less than 3 shifts."
bad,Great portfolio of brands. Company is hindered by lack of credible day to day middle management. I felt that I was left out on a island to fend for myself.
bad,the culture has change and moral is down no overtime and customer is unstable uncomfortable inconsistency is no there no more ask a lot from us sometimes its toxic
bad,I was there for a month and it can be a pain driving to far stores u don’t live anywhere near. The constant lifting can be a MAJOR pain. I quit and pretty much realizing the job was not worth it.
bad,"if you aren't a manager you don't know what you are talking about no matter how long you've worked here. They will not listen to the employees at all, people are spoken to in an extremely negative tone. Corporate doesn't care it you ever have time off all they care about is money but that's for themselves. Set schedules are 4 10hours shift 2 shifts a day and but actually run production 6-7days."
bad,"Check today's route on your company phone which is typically 5-7 stops (way too many). Drive from account to account stocking shelves and building product displays. "
bad,You have too many stores not enough hours usually. Constantly getting blamed for working too slow because of a stores shortcomings such as lack of jacks and messy backrooms. Salesman constantly over ordering stuff you don't need to fill quota.
bad,pay and the inability to even have overtime was the main problem.  Would train new people to never be paid more while the new trainees were being paid more than a lot of the older employees with the company.
bad,"Great company and good benefits.  Even when company recognizes unethical issues existing with their management they prefer to support the side initiating issues rather then support the affected individual especially if the initiator is of a protected class.  They are very open on this matter.  They claim they will do anything to protect the ""protected class"".  As a manager this information was given to me directly and I was not allowed to preform any write ups on individuals that were part of the protected class."
bad,Having to go to different stores and pull and push pallets out to find what I need to stock the shelves at 5a.m. Too much heavy lifting and going back and fourth trying to find what I needed.
bad,"Review and responding to emails that are required for an assigned group, routing for daily product delivery before cutoff deadline and to maintain software and customer maintenance daily."
bad,The management at Dr. pepper is okay the best part of the job was my co-workers we got alone great and we worked as a time to get the job done each and everyday
bad,"A typical work day is creating a plan of execution for each store you are required to go into that day and make sure priorities are met for that day. Their is a lot to learn such as management skills, different methods to organize and prioritizes. It is very rare that you have a problem with other account managers, but it is almost a guarantee that there will be problems with the merchandisers."
bad,There no unity at this company. Management is a joke. There a lot of back stabbing in the maintenance department. We are suppose to be team but behind your back people always trying to get you fired. specially if you don't come into this department as mechanic. If I voice my opinion I sure they will try to get me fire to.
bad,"Working for this company was not a good experience. This is a very poorly organized company. The starting pay, in my eyes is kind of low for the job."
bad,Worked inn trucking since 1995 as a local driver in NYC moved to FL in 1999 work as a owner operator making runs all over the southeast. Presently working at Dr.Pepper Snapple as a local driver making deliveries and pickups in Orlando FL.The hardest part my job is the merchandising part and the most enjoyable would be the driving.
bad,A busy environment with plenty to do and a short handed staff. Supervisors allow bad employees to continue their behavior. Supervisors are in meeting most of the time and only way to contact them is by texting or email or phone call.
bad,"The job itself was fun. A specific Supervisor was very disrespectful. I loved working there, the physical labor was fun for me, but dealing with the supervisor's flip flop attitude was too much. One specific manager was an amazing individual, and a few of the coworkers were too. Trying to get the orders out super quick was my goal, and learning more about the job was too. Sad I couldn't live out that goal."
bad,easy work don't recommend working here for a long time management is poor under paided for the expectations they want out of the people they have working for them
bad,"productive work environment but lack of understanding and communication. "
bad,Not good pay for the amount of work you have to do. No advancement opportunities. Management isnt very knowledgeable. Vehicles are not up to DOT standards.
bad,Good place to work the only issue there were times that I did not receive the support of my Supervisor. I believe they were scared to support their direct reports.
bad,"It was ok far as the work , I say the needed more people to get the Job done , . More back breaking then ever . Its a miscommunication problems a lot of mistakes were made."
bad,"I worked as a merchandiser for a couple of months at the seemingly chronically understaffed L.A. branch. That should be your first red flag. Why do people keep leaving? For me, it was ineptitude from HR and Sales members. Example: I didn't get my mileage reimbursement for May until July."
bad,"Absolutely love the Dr. Pepper Snapple company; however, in Des Moines, IA the management is a JOKE! DO NOT apply here, you will regret it."
bad,"Operate and maintain plant utility equipment including steam boiler, waste water treatment, water filtration system, and air compressors;"
bad,"Arriving To The Customer Account Early Morning. Waiting On The Delivery Truck To Drop Off Product, When My Load Arrives, I Use Pallet Jacks To Bring My Product To The My Working Area. Once I Work The Load Arrange The Shelf Properly, Build Displays And Filling Coolers. I Take The Back stock Condense And Organize It In The Back. While Multi-Tasking To Provide Excellent Customer Service, To Provide The Best Customer Experience"
bad,I worked there for just under 2 years as a driver for this company. I will not mention names but the management is poor. There is one particular person you deal with on a daily basis who is always negative and it will reflect on you greatly. Management does not appreciate drivers.
bad,"Time flies by when you’re working. Must constantly working or you’ll fall behind at the end of the day. Loads are stressful especially on weekends. Usually don’t hear from management till you slip up.  Also you mileage pay doesn’t count till you get to the first store which sucks cause on the weekends, my first store was an hour away"
bad,"I have worked for this company for many years, and have done the best job possible.  My co workers are a great team, some working as many years as myself.  Management has changed, and this company is not the same.  I have been loyal to this company, as well as my co workers...this company is not what it used to be."
bad,"warehouse atmosphere, many workers performing different tasks at the same time. Office employees preformed well, compensation did not resemble all the hard work that was put in."
bad,not the place to work if trying to maintain a family!!!!.located nice in englewood co. Empoyee parking not good at all.
bad,"Job started out great. Then after the Dr Pepper merger last summer (which most employees now believe was a complete buyout) we have no benefits. We no longer got free coffee, discounts on brewers, and the bonus we got right before Christmas (which helped TREMENDOUSLY) was put off until after the first of the year when Dr Pepper employees received theirs. Dr Pepper employees were offered our ""half off"" beverage incentive, but we have yet to see any benefit from working with or 'alongside' them. The insurance was complete garbage. It's honestly cheaper to die than try to meet your deductible. You have a lot of work placed on you, with no reasonable amount of time to get things done. Changeovers are always a disaster. It was a wonderful job when I started, but Dr Pepper dragged us down quicker than expected"
bad,Honestly if I didn’t have any bills to pay I would leave this job. But I’am Thankful they have me the opportunity to work fir them but I see myself not getting no where in the company. Management has their favorites place sucks I won’t out.. don’t waste your time there
bad,1st shift is always held accountable for what ever happens. There’s no such thing as  seniority so they are bringing new hires in off the street with no training making more than you and expect for you to be ok with it this location in Irving is going down hill especially with the way they treat their vets. Now if you do choose to work for this location don’t choose production that’s where the issues are go to warehouse or driving trust me production will cause you to go home everyday with a headache and the more you complain to HR the faster they will find a way to fire you I have witnessed it and experience it after 7 years it’s easy to get hired and quickly fired
bad,"need better job to provide for family, I work around 70 hours a week making not even minimum what other merch managers make at other companies. Just want to be paid my worth."
bad,"You are expected to do a Back-Breaking amount of work in an unreasonable amount of time."
bad,Dr Pepper was one of the worst jobs I worked at. You get Chinese OT which translates to about $8. They work you like a slave and you’ll still get the same daily rate no matter what. Sales managers will over order and store managers will yell at you for there being too much stuff.
bad,I feel the manager that replaced my previous manager was not fit for the position! I feel that some of the choices made were not the best for the employees.
bad,The company has a culture of promoting by favoritism and not the person working hardiest. It is also a very stressful environment for the low pay.  Not a culture that values diversity.
bad,"No hourly rate, which means ""Chinesse"" overtime which is your hourly wage cut in half after 40 hours a week. And when working in the summer most of the time you work overtime. Decent 401 k plan and health benefits. Don't break your back doing this job!"
bad,long stressful hours most equipment in plant is out dated and needs repairs and up dates to setup and change over correctly. your at work more then your at home with your family.
bad,"horrible pay compared to other companies, out on your own fast pace work, benefits are great manual labor management is OK, you have to use your vehicle to every day to drive site to site a lot of tear on the vehicle"
bad,"Besides getting paid every week this job was like being trapped. Stayed in till 9:00 in the morning and we clock in at 5 in the afternoon. Only give you 10 minute breaks. Forklift operators move on they time causing the floor runners productivity to go down because of the slow fork lift drivers. Hardest part of the job was to keep your productivity up when there's so many distractions inside the warehouse."
bad,"A very time-consuming job which demands 50-60 hours a week, which was fine with me until school interfered. Working long hours mostly made the supervisors and managers stressed from the inability to finish production goals."
bad,"It was a great job. Office manager was HORRIBLE to deal with! I could never do anything right. I have been told I am not the only one that was treated this way. She apparently ran off another person, since their hiring again . If she would leave it would be a perfect job."
bad,A Typical work day is 7 Stores and you will work 10-12 Hours a day no time to spend with your kids if you have some because you are so tired and the pay sucks. bad communication skills all around...
bad,"This coulld be a ""career"", not just a job. The upper management does not support you as an employee and wants you to dedicate your life to the company with little chance of advancement. You can be demoted for no reason."
bad,"The company would be great if management would allow employees to have work. In the busy season everything is fine, but from January until around April they make us take off work and replace us with salaried workers who don't have much work of their own to do. Yes we have went union, but haven't inked a deal yet. It has been 6+ months of negotiations. I am sure over pennies. The competition( coke and Pepsi) pay much more and do the exact same work. 18 hours a week can't pay anyone's bills. I think the company only has something like 8 or 9 full time merchandisers. All others in the twinsburg plant are considered part-time for as long as 5 years before becoming full time. This way you won't get the good pay, holiday pay, vacations. One would better suited applying to the competition. Better everything over there especially with coke"
bad,Average day would start around 5 A.M. and last until the last pallet was unloaded.  The routes were made using a computer which might not have been a bad thing if the addresses were current/correct but since they weren't it meant a lot of rearranging the load during the day and a lot of out of the way stops. They also claim to pay overtime but it's really halftime.
bad,It's a ok kinda job. I mean the supervisor try to act like your friend but when the  head boss comes around different story. Hours are crazy. But I can say everyone do work together. The pay should be more for all the work they want u to do.
bad,"I worked there for four years and everything was great. Benefits, good pay and overtime when it was necessary. Then hours got cut for everyone and the vice was tightened."
bad,"Been a driver for over 30 years. I've been doing bulk delivery (Drop Delivery to Supermarkets) for a long time. The company is now transitioning away from bulk to mini bulk ( Some drops to supermarkets and the rest of your stops are side loader stops servicing convenience stores etc.) I think it's so older workers will retire or quit. Some of the drivers at my warehouse have been on no touch bulk for 20 plus years, now these guys are in their 60's and expected to do hard physical labor again. Again, I think it's to get the older guys out. Ever since Dr.Pepper/Snapple took over American Bottling it seems like their main focus has been on job elimination. I make good pay and benefits and enjoy the people and customers, but the company has really gone downhill. Find a different place to work."
bad,drive to store and break down the delivery stock the shelves wherever you have Dr. pepper snapple products.
bad,"Low pay for touch frieght with old equipment with stick shift. No free coffee or bottle water. Employee discount on drinks not really a discount, can do better off buying at store. Just matches 4% 401k, no stock options, no pension, and no more copay medical benefits. No coffee in break room in morning to prepare."
bad,the best thing that i liked was my coworkers and the customers i met during my time there very saftey orientated company takes good care of its employes
good,it was ok not what i expected. could have been a lot better in a lot of areas.needs better leadership fun work place with supportive management. not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develope
good,over worked not a very good company to work for. They will over work you and not give any days off in a row. One week I had to work 12 days straight before I just had one day off.
good,"you get three days of training and then just get thrown out there, then you get 100 bucks a day and work no less then 12 hours a day"
good,"It's a job, unless you have no other options, apply, do your job, but don't forget where you going: your goal. Job emphasizes on numbers, they will call you on weekend to do work, that's their culture. Work there at your own risk."
good,Having to use your personal vehicle getting mileage reembursment is not enough. They do not cover any kind of wear and tear and some weeks your going to rack up several hundred miles going to stores.
good,Start my day at 6 in the morning then I Drive from store to store putting merchandise and selling in product to those stores. Building relationships with the manager inside the store
good,"Communication is lacking, no structure.  Management is lacking leadership. Management shouldn't show favoritism at the expense of the company and certain tasks aren't completed, causing compliance issues."
good,Its very fast paces and sometimes we could work as a team. The hardest about the job is most likely getting help when needed. We sometimes get hit with 2 or 3 pallets a store and have 7 or 8 stores to work.
good,high pressure sales environment. leadership lacking and high turnover in mgmt and directorship. SIGNIFICANT GAP between mgmt and sales staff as well as merchandisers.
good,Look for another place to work. Nothing else to say. Will no be a promotion nothing at all. Get injured you on your own they will not help you. No sick days no holidays nothing nothing
good,This job was okay very very fast paced from the time you started at 6am until you got done around 3pm the job was non stop but the early start time was nice but it made for an early night as well.
good,"I didn't like it, they wanted me to put them before my family."
good,"Poor management, little to no respect for ""Persons"". Compensation is not based on how well you do but on ""how long you've been employed no matter how well you've done or not. Work environment and culture suffer greatly because of it! This also makes job security and advancement a nearly impossible accomplishment."
good,"start the day at 5:30 a.m. drive to your first account.Talk to management about up coming promotions and ad activity. sell in displays for the week. work back stock, fill coolers and shelves."
good,It's a job. It would be better if management was more consistent.  If promotions was based on performance and qualifications rather than favoritism. High management turn over
good,I was there for 12 years and was not recognized for my  dities. Training was minimal and very micromanaged. Not allwed to have enough employees to get the job done. outdated equipment.
good,Not a terrible amount of daily variation. Distant Management. Usually requires extensive travel. Potential for effective team community.
good,If you like working and taking on more than one job title and getting paid less than what your job title requires. This is the company for you.
good,"Make picture frame useing nail guns"
good,"Intensely physical working 23 hour days 6 days per week. Pay not that good, everyone grumpy all the time, fights between drivers, and the company changes its corporate structure almost every month."
good,"The Irving, Texas Plant is the worst working environment I have ever come across in my 20 years of working. The amount of turn-over at this plant is ridiculous with the salary and hourly workforce. The management encourages dishonest practices and puts value on the people who are loyal to that behavior. I believe the company on a larger scale is a good company to work for and my experience was plant specific."
good,Leadership roles do not allow work life balance.  The culture has changed significantly through the changes in senior leadership and employees are not the primary focus anymore.  The salaries are competitive but the expectations are that you will work 50+ hours per week including evenings and weekends on a regular basis.
good,"Need new leads that know how to setup machines, and how to run. leads are extremely lazy not all but most off them. Management is a joke they dont know what they are doing its hilarious watching them trying to figure things out"
good,Busy environment lots of work and can be stressful at times especially during the summer. You ran the route but had to clean up after salesman who would leave a mess for you the day before at various customers. Benefits from day one weekly pay was nice benefits were ok not the best but they worked.
good,If you are a CDL A this job is the lowest paying position in the industry. If you MUST be home every night and love to hump freight all day for less than 50k a year...this is your dream come true!!
good,"Was happier before company merged with Keurig , my district Manager was not a trustworthy person and MANY times he would say one thing then do another thing.  He is not good at managing."
good,fast paced bottling company open 24hours 7 days a week. plenty of over time if you want it or not. 12 hour days are normal in this facility. layoffs in the winter which is the slow season.
good,Dont work there jhigh turnover rate company dont value warehouse workers its not worth the stress or the pay rate rhey try to win you over with .Overall terrible company
good,"Dr PepperSnapple group has a lot of great products. They have a lot of good people that work there. Their benefits and pay are really good. Dr. Pepper Snapple group is totally controlled by the stock market. They are only concerned about money, Employees are treated as expendable and tossed to the side, as a neccessay evil. A manager once said if an employee has a suggestion or an idea, put it over there, as he pointed to the trash can. Very negative and hostile work environment. A lot of turnover and burnout. Customers were treated very badly. You had to deal with many complaints."
good,Pay is competitive. Local management is horrible. Management at corporate level is good and they have the company positioned for growth even during ongoing push back from consumers about nutrition.
good,they control your life with long hours and mandotoray overtime.they have unfair mangement at the job their is to much favoritetism. Being bumped from shift to shift without notice is draining.
good,as a forklift operator your word means nothibg favoritism throughout.....the union sucks too. they have a racist supervisor called pete he ll get you fired or in trouble over nothing as long as you produce numbers...
good,I worked at the Spring location in the warehouse before it closed. They were all about producing numbers but did not show much gratitude for hard work. They ended up cutting severance packages or giving you the opportunity to work at the Houston location which was not for everyone.
good,"Start time 5 a.m. until finish, work smarter not harder and you can get adjusted to the labor. Management is hit or miss so you could be in paradise or purgatory. Workplace culture was like most jobs, politics as usual. The hardest part is easily the work/life balance. The most enjoyable part of the job would be payday."
good,"Treated professional staff like hourlies.  Checking on arrival times, leaving times, no time off for personal issues.  Any type of celebrations, employee socialization discouraged."
good,I went to work here - 1st job out of college.  Worked here 26 years.  Started out a private company then public then private then public again.  Changed locations and company names several times.  Please beware.  This company has great benefits but is cutthroat for sure!  Enter at your own risk!!
good,a night working here could be 8-15 hrs long in the heat or cold and rain.i learned to drive a old truck.my boss was ok need got upset.the workers enjoyed being around each other for the most part.the hardest part of the job was the week for a holiday.the discount on soda was the best part
good,I have a large volume of work that needs to be prioritized daily in supporting two Managers.  I perform all aspects of an executive administrative assistant.  My co-workers and people at the Company are wonderful.  The hardest part of my job is finding enough hours in the day to get everything done.  The most enjoyable part of my job is being given the opportunity to do tasks/projects that are outside of the administrative assistant role.
good,"Every morning began with the preparation of the daily deposit from previous days work. When the deposit was done, the mail was sorted and distributed. All vendor invoices received in mail were processed and coded the same day. Answering phones, filing, data entry, account receivables, checking-in drivers (paper work and monies), dispatching, were all part of a typical day, aside from special projects assigned at any time or day."
good,This company has the potential to be great. However; they treat some of their employees as less than important. Things would definately have to change to ensure that people will stay for longer periods of time.
good,The culture is changing so much at Keurig Dr Pepper that no one knows day to day if they will be let go. That type of insecurity is a large reason why so many good people are leaving the company. Wrong people in the wrong places.
good,"Benefits are great, pay not so much for the work expected of you. Management is out for themselves, reaching the bottom line gets them a bonus and gets you a bad back."
good,"Since Keurig took over employee morale is on the floor.  Management wont try to help solve issues.  They will ask for favors and not return them, lack of interpersonal skills. They now go strictly by the book and there no wiggle room for common sense."
good,They teach you really fast and then your just own your own. The routes are crazy and should be more organized as well as the loads. I had ideas but no one wants to hear them.
good,The company culture is terrible. Managers do not acknowledge the human presence on a day to day basis. I felt I did not exist managers do not even say hello. The worst place I've ever worked.
good,Good Company but certain managers were placed in positions that they were not qualified for. Engineering manager was not qualified to manage engineering team. No interpersonal skills or ability to direct or lead.
good,"The organization is fast paced company due to no inventory stock and a customer order driven business , which requires employees the ability to adapt to change and be extremely flexible."
good,Receiver are very rough and treat you with no respect especially delivery for Walmart. Be prepared to defend yourself at all time from the receiver and other delivery drivers. Its all about the delivery of the product management will not back you when things get out of hand at a store. Plus working every weekend Suck very hard to making any plans with your family.
good,"I came from a previous employer who had a great corporate culture, employees became friends and enjoyed one another in many capacities.  Dr Pepper Snapple Group could not be any different than my previous employer.  You come in, do your job (if you can determine exactly what you are supposed to be doing with no direction because in most cases there is no direction on anything), and get a paycheck - no more, no less.  The health benefits are not good, prescriptions routinely cost 10X what I used to pay (ex: used to pay $30 and now pay $300), vacation/PTO is minimal by comparison to other companies, facility and offices are old.  The biggest problem with Dr Pepper Snapple Group is that they allow senior employees to stay and become stagnant even after they become eligible for retirement which allows them to push down anyone who doesn't have 20+ years of experience.  Also, if you like to ask ""Why do we do it this way?"" this is probably not a good place for you, it will be greeted with hostility at worst and indifference at best and you rarely, if ever, will be able to find an answer."
good,"It wasn't worth on the wear and tear on your car, to the constant no help coming situation. I worked for them for about a little over a year and when I was there. There was poor management, little help, you would get about 7 to 11 stores and they are almost about a hour to anywhere from 3 to 4 hours when super busy. They expect you to finish in 8 hours and when you don't you get full responsibility and get yelled at for it (or they try to put the the blame on you) The store manager get mad when you don't have enough time or your bosses tell you to leave because no OT."
good,"Working was consistent. You got to pick what 2 days per week you have off. Just they would jump me in line for a position that i was waiting for, example, i trained an employee for a route I was supposed to get. The route was given to the new employee, and I was still left jumping around from route to route. And i still made the same pay the entire time i was there. Did not like it."
good,No one liked there job at Snapple. Depressing just being there. Lazy co workers. Poor management. Long hours small pay. Got some decent benefits. I wouldn’t go back to Snapple because I need a job that’s going to keep me interested.
good,Agradable y muchas horas  se empieza a trabajar desde las 4 am
good,While it was fun to be part of a growing organization the lack of consistency and structure was difficult to deal with; limited resources and best practices lead for inconsistencies.  Direct manager was no onsite and was on contract for over a year before being offered a full time role.
good,"I worked for this company in two different states.  They have really good products.  Unfortunately, they made me wear too many different hats. Very stressful place"
good,"Our day generally started with fork lift inspection, or cip of fillers, or prep. which ever machine I was scheduled to."
good,Always being short staffed made for long days. Management was never concerned with employees well being. Most coworkers were more concerned with their smartphones then getting the job done.
good,Its alright company to work at coming out of high school but pay rates are not that great and the management is poor around the work area
good,"Long and tiring"
good,"Long long hours, the pay does not justify the hours worked. Warehouse workers were taking more pay home than the warehouse supervisor. Did not liked to be micro managed."
good,"If you are just starting out in the work field ,do not get into this industry ,Canada dry is a ok place to work for ,they always treated me well,I was in the reset part of the company ,which I did for over 10 years and 12 with Coca cola.I would always pay attention to all areas of the business,all I heard from delivery drivers and sales reps were how much it sucked to be out there try to sell product and and make their quotas,long hours and not much compensation,avg maybe 30 to 40,000 for sales reps,12 to 13 per hour for merchandisers ,which sounds goods but  in reality is below average ,at least in this area ,DC -Baltimore, not much communication within the company.Always shorthanded and too much work for one person to handle ,not much overtime if any ,which would help the paycheck,but not much to OT to get.If you really  need a job and dont mind low pay to get by,then apply ,benefits are union ,so they are pretty good ."
good,"If you are the Night shift Supervisor you will be exempt. Be prepared to work from 40 to 50+ hours a week! always disorganized, never know what to expect. You have to wear many hats and work with a skeleton crew most times. Compesation not in alighnment with the amount of work required. Not many opportunities for Growth unless you start as a loader, then become a Driver."
good,"Life work balance out of balance. I work 12+ hours a day and sometimes that is not enough to get job done. Manager is better at emails vs actually going out into field to see the obstacles are and best way to fix them,"
good,Loved co workers team players the managers werent as well managed as should be
good,"Quality Manager is not a people person and only acknowledges you when visitors or SQF audits come around, definitely no room for growth I applied for 4 different jobs within the company and I was either over qualified or didn’t qualify. The management have there picks, too much favoritism for certain employees."
good,"I was a order selector at the Cranberry branch of Pittsburgh Management extremely bad, most promoted from within with no management experience. Instead of helping good employees succeed who want to hit their case count . The management and leads with manually force smaller orders to you so you have to work and run all day in order to hit your “case count”. Lazy employees who have been the 4+ months go slow and get forced large orders to ensure they hit their “ case count”. This ensures the company will not have to pay unemployment to people who want fired. Turn over rate extremely high few members the production team lasted over a year and it’s Because the horrible management and the fact that HR IS ALWAYS on the mangers side. If they change the way they treat their new hires and get rid of a few bad eggs in management also treated everyone equally and just let the orders flow out they would be a great company to work for. They are union at this branch and start off at an well above average pay rate also raises every few months and a nice max out rate. All the good Union benefits . Paid vacation . And your off for a lot off holidays with pay. They really have Good benefits and a lot if yearly paid time off but there is a lot of trickery that goes on there to push certain people out and to keep certain people in I had to find a new job and even had a few guys follow me because of how  bad they would mess with your numbers. Also truck drivers would steal from their own truck and just lie and say the product didn’t make it in the truck forces order selectors to get mispics"
good,"Fun exciting keep you on your toes job, constantly changing environment, lots of hours in semi truck, heaving lifting and sometimes mentally draining."
good,Easy job.very repetitive..low wages good insurance...great if your young and single.bosses are great but company is on a downward spiral since merging with keriug
good,Could be a better company if management was better loads are assigned all over the place one minute you have a load and come to the job and it is gone. They assign the same load to people which sometimes interfere with personal life because it is time consuming and unprofessional.
good,"Management is a power trip and does not appreciate the ""little"" man. Very stress place to work. There are some people who are supportive there and make going to work everyday worth it."
good,"Decent place to work. "
good,"Es una buena empresa nueva así que era un poco difícil que la gente la comprara, pero de ahí en fuera todo excelente"
good,Worked at Essex plant for over 7 years plant suffers from poor management and they lack people skills and have no clue how to run maintenance dept most the people there are parts swappers no engineering assistance and very weak on furthering training staff when I first started was the best place I have ever worked but changed after multiple layoffs and week leadership
good,Culture and Benefits package under construction as the company is merging Keurig Green Mountain Coffee and Dr Pepper Snapple Group together. Employees.
good,"There is little room for career advancement when the sugared drink industry is declining.  There will be layoffs.  The pay is very low, long hours, ruins car."
good,Fill coffee into k cups fill paperwork out.  Check quality tests.  Cover breaks when needed.  Perform duties that management requests.  Work as a team.  Work is stressful but the benefits are good.
good,"Very fun place to work at often,  However, there is little accountability and many people get blamed for others mistakes. On a positive note it is a very low-stress job."
good,"Local HR team doesn't support the employee nor do they do what's in the best interest of the employees.  If your manager wants to get rid of you, HR helps your manager with an exit plan for you.  Tenure with the company has no value anymore.  If they don't like you, they will exit you.  Additionally, there is zero work life balance.  Benefits and PTO are great perks, but not worth all of the long hours and stress."
good,long hours everyday but good pay. great benefits lots of labor. get 5 sick days a year but get penalized for using them. management does give credit where its due.
good,I don't have much to say and do not want to come off negatively. It's a much different position as a recruiter than I had ever had before. You literally sit in your chair at your desk all day long. It is very repetitive work and you read things from a script.
good,I would go to Large small grocery stores and place orders for the necessary product they needed for the week and product got delivered next day.
good,"a lot of favouritism The warehouse manager if he liked you, you could hang around the warehouse chit chatting and if he didn't, you were milking the clock, if your car broke down- since you had to use your own vehicle, they would offer a 7 up truck to the select few- others had to lose a days pay. Treated some, like dirt if they forgot something, others got a way with everything.."
good,I have had a good experience with Spherion. The girls in the office are supportive and knowledgable about what work is available and where to go.
good,"tough unfriendly environment,NO TEAMWORK  hostile environment very demanding and physical  the only good thing was 3 day work week. turnover rate over 80%"
good,"i learned to load trucks with dr.pepper/snapple products operating a forklift truck, the hardest part about this job was the actual loading of the product to the truck. the most enjoyable part of this job was working at your own rate and breaking at your own leisure. i had pretty cool co-workers but also some that were the cool"
good,"Had fun working here, but in the end Corporate blindsided all of us and merged our small location with another company and eliminated our jobs.  We all felt that Corporate had no heart in how they left us without jobs!"
good,"Overall DPSG is not a bad a company. The benefits are average, the  salaries are decent but some of the management at non-corporate locations leave something to be desired."
good,I thoroughly enjoyed managing Sales Teams and look forward to my next opportunity.
good,One thing about my job is that you work at your own pace. Ii have my own route so i dont have a boss breathing down my neck all day.My job can be a lil challenging on holidays and the pay isnt enough to provide for a family
good,There is a huge potential for this job to be awesome. I am sure there are branches that are well managed and staffed and a lot of fun to work at. However my branch is not one of those. It has been over six months since we have been staffed more than 75% and our management will not get out of the office to help.
good,Dropping bottled products to area Ohio customer base. Very physical work with very poor pay. No set routing available for any new drivers. Was over qualified for this company and still wound up finding very poor growth here. Bottom of the barrel basically broke company.
good,You are suppose to have only one boss but end up with many telling you what you should do.
good,I learned to work independently and established great time management skills due to the number of store assigned each day sometimes conflicting with the time that I was suppose to get off.
good,"Very manual labor intensive from the position I held, but the pay was not to par as it was day pay. With day pay, they pay you a set rate for the 8 hour day, and minimum wage for overtime. If you worked less than 8 hours one day, say 5 hours, and 10 the next 4, they would cut the hours where you were able to finish early out of your overtime hours."
good,Good job if you don’t like to be in one place all day. Stock multiple stores a day. You’ll learn to apologize for others mistakes. Overall it was a good job but could’ve been better if management held themselves to the same standards as the employees
good,"Merchandisers get plenty of assistance, relief and sales managers were often told to just figure it out from the DM. Relief only made five dollars more daily than a merchandiser but on multiple occasions ended up merchandising multiple stores along with doing the sales portion."
good,"I left KDP voluntarily, with no significant problems relating to my employment. The pay was unquestionably good, as compared to other production oriented jobs in the area. Insurance benefits carried an unusually high deductible which renewed each year, making most healthcare an out of pocket expense. Those who had serious health conditions may have found the insurance suitable as they easily met their deductibles through regimented medical treatments and prescriptions."
good,"Management is awlful, not matter how well you did your job it was never good enough and the union there sides with the company instead of their union workers."
good,I've loved my job at KDP and the team that I led made the work environment a good one. KDP gave me the tools I need to grow myself and my team and I took advantage of those tools and was successful in all challenges that came my way.
good,"Lots of heavy duty lifting. Work starts at 6am and finishes when your route is done, if you don't get sent to another store. "
good,"the work is hard but steady and fairly predictable."
good,My wife has stage 4 cancer had to be hospitalized and supervisor told me if I couldn’t work I’m replaceable so they take no value on family life that supervisor is the reason I couldn’t stay there
good,"10 + hours every day , never have a chance to do anything outside of your work life (school , family, etc)"
good,"Like Pepsi and Coke you are much better off if you're a student, part time or you have a working spouse."
good,Head manager is a hot head downgrades people not friendly should not be doing type of work he is not a people person. merchandising manager is hot head blows up about everything has temper issues account manger supervisor is laid back id had better management would be great place to work account manager and merchandiser work is hard but not to bad of work never could move up never met any higher up management
good,Snapple Co. bought Big Red/7up 2003 and began reshaping the work force. I was one of the longest working employees making a very good salary. I was told by my supervisor that I would be doing the same work as when I started and would be making the same amount of money as I was when I started. I could not take a cut in pay nor do the physical work that would be expected of me delivering convenient stored with a dolly to move heavy product. Wanted to move up in the company and was unable to do so due to there being no openings.
good,"start time is 6am and you go home when the job is done. Some days you get out early, and other days you get out extremely late. You can be the best of the best and they just use you. Pay is decent but not enough for all the hard work. If you take care of your business, you shouldn't have managers breathing on your neck. Independently working is a plus, but slackers just do what they want."
good,The dollar is worth more than the employee.  Family does not matter to managers and always on call.  Customers treat employees badly and management does not back up the employee
good,"A typical day consists of around working from 4am until whenever management says your done. Whether that's completing all the stores on your assigned route or not and a route is never permanent. Sometimes you cover routes, sometimes you work new places every day. Nothing wrong with a change, but after your 8 hours you could be called to other stores where hours at to make a 12 hour day for yourself. It's good work, just physically and mentally exhausting. Never know what you're going to get into the next day."
good,"No 24 hour dispatch, lack of communication on all levels. Every day there was no gurantee on what time you would even start your shift, could be your normal start time or hours and hours after words."
good,There is a reason that I left this company and the executive leadership team doesn't believe in treating its employees with dignity and respect. There is a reason I left...
good,"You better hope you have good co workers, otherwise you will be stuck picking up after everyone. That, or make sure you get put on your own route. Don't be a ""floater""."
good,I worked here for about 4 months and the work life is alright but majority of the time your by yourself never see management except for meetings. Also no action was taken when there was an issue reguarding company phones
good,"HCL does not believe in promoting based on performance.  Promotions are based on who you know - Only.  During my time with HCL, I was forced to work 20 hour days, I was berated by my supervisor, and I was NOT allowed to supervise my own team members."
good,unable to grow in the department and with the company will not let you transfer out of the department unless you knew someone in the other department to speak on your behalf
good,We were understaffed all summer. We would work unscheduled 12+ hours all the time. Back breaking work and you only start at $12. It was good experience.
good,"Worked from the minute you came in until the minute you left. Learned to do things on your own, do many different duties. I learned"
good,"high work load with little to no recognition on your accomplishments."
good,"Great brands but too lean to make actionable progress against the competition.  Lots of potential if the company is willing to invest resources, particularly on the national account side."
good,"good place to work, had great benefits and pay but the hours were bad and it was very hard, fast paced work. it was nice working with people in the different stores."
good,"It was a good job, hours and pay was fine, co workers as well, I had to leave because I was putting to many miles onto my car. I would work it again if I was issued a company car."
good,"working 6 days a week no set time on getting off its when the work is complete, good thing and a bad thing because its aot of work and you get excessive OT, but advancement is ittle to none and managemet lies to you daily. typical job for someone who doesn't have a family or nothing ese to do , a quick job earn a few bucks a month"
good,"This company is growing and has great district managers, but that's it. It seems like this company would rather get under qualified managers  who have no business skills or common sense. GET READY TO WORK EXTRA HARD!"
good,"My responsibility was to use Lotus Notes and PeopleSoft databases to processed new hires, contractors and vendors requests needed to set up/disabled desktop and software equipment for IT desktop technicians."
good,"start work at 5:30am by checking load to insure that it is correct. drive to customers location and unload/deliver product correctly. collect all empty bottle bags and empty shells ""used for deliveries"". make sure customer is satisfied and collect payment. at the end of the day I check my truck in, turn in paperwork and check/cash collected. I have learned to be very self efficient, give excellent customer service and to work hard. I enjoy being out on my own and having the customer relations the most. the hardest part of my job would be not knowing what my rout is going to be until I punch in to work that morning. over all I like this physical type of work."
good,"Entry Level is Merchandising, start at 6am to until you get done!"
good,Each day came with new ways of stack. Using hand hells to check drivers in and learning news valuable things about the company
good,"Co-workers are very helpful. There are employees that have a lot of longevity, currently. Work/Life balance is probably the hardest."
good,Dr. Pepper is a great job for someone who is still in school or looking to make a few extra dollars. People are friendly and schedules are very flexable. Short and limited breaks but paid vacation was worth it.
good,on this job i learned alot about how to identify and satisfy customers needs.
good,they will put you to work almost immediately. but you will get burned out pretty quickly. so pace yourself. you will work all holidays and most weekends
good,For being a professional company they are very unorganized and unprepared for big sales. Need more delivery trucks so loads can be delivered within reasonable time. I spent alot of time just hanging out at stores waiting on my loads to arrive. I really enjoyed to job itself just very poorly managed
good,"Keurig is plagued by the presence of too many unqualified millennial types. The millennial culture has far too much attitude and incompetence especially noted within the  product management and marketing staff. Far too many bad decisions. Engineering people are good though. I did enjoy my time there.  Older, highly experienced employees are few and far between....."
good,"KDP forget other companies  do what they do and treat their employees  well  less work great pay."
good,I feel this company doesn't value it employees. They treat people like they are expendable. They had multiple lay offs during the time i was employed. They shut one of the first two factories down completely. while acquired more assets and growing.
good,"very low pay . low incentives . no room for advancement . low moral no open door policy . I am looking for advancement , promotion  and appreciation. want to be an asset."
good,"As far as the day to day work went i enjoyed the job, good to stay in shape. Te problem is they pay by the day and overtime is mandatory. That being said they did pay you for your overtime but instead of time and a half, it is less than half time which amounted to less than min wage for any overtime. While not everyday would run over 8 hours most of the time they did. An example of why i rate management low and left is i had taken a sick day and went to the doctor and got my doctors excuse for my paid sick day. How ever without any notice to me my schedule was changed last minute and scheduled me on my day off and i was not notified until 5 am the morning of."
good,"most of the management has 0 communication with each other or other employees, They come up with half baked ideas and expect it to work with no input from anyone that actually does the work, they are like most companies and expect you to be open and honest and transparent but they hide every little detail until the last possible second.i like the fact i had almost no one breathing down my neck and they trusted me over all to get my work done without being watched every second, easiest part of the job was driving hardest part of the job was getting managers to communicate instead of leaving me in the dark on everything."
good,Salesman are the worst. Don’t order what you need and customers complain about them all the time. Dispatch lives in a totally different state and cannot most of time route themselves out of a paper bag.
good,"It was better than flipping burgers, but nothing to brag about. Keurig's buy-out slashed the best thing about the company - the benefits."
good,"OEE is pushed hard, and it feels training and safety are  pushed aside. Managers are nice however, for a while they expected their employees to work 6 days a week every week for months on end while managers got to go home every weekend, without any breaks."
good,management needs help.rules change daily. sometimes very stressful. employees are nice.the job itself was fine. but very long hours. management keeps changing on a daily basics
good,It is a good start up job for those entering the work force. We work from 5:15 until we are done. We sale products along with the sales account manager.
good,"this is a great company to work for as long as it isn't in Carteret, nj. there is no advancement in the plant and the run the plant by ""do as your told and youll keep your job"" mentality"
good,"I worked there 7 years in the beginning it was fun fair easy to progress. After year 4 , after the fourth management change! It went downhill! The turnover rate went through the roof we couldn’t keep workers there ! They had a lot favoritism. It’s a union job so people could advance from inside. But stop posting jobs and started hiring from the outside and people felt stuck and couldn’t progress!"
good,"They will tell you religiously that you will be trained and you will have the opportunity to advance. But it seems there is always something that has nothing to do with you impede your advancement. You will suffer because of everyone else around you. And when you do get the opportunity to try another position they have you convinced it's a promotion when it is just a lateral move, maybe even a half step down. If you wait and stay there long enough they will start to drain the life out of you.  Until they're just about to lose you and then start promising you that promotion again."
good,"Great work environment with customers and trade."
good,"My time there started slow due to me not having my class A cdl license, the money wasn't great, the work was unpredictable. After while the job became pretty descent due to wages and me having my own route."
good,"DPSG pays well but they do not offer great overtime pay. If you only work 40 hours the pay is good, but you will never work under 50 and the hours are not set so you never know what time you're getting off work. and although you are required to take breaks you cant without working too late and going over DOT hours."
good,"The job was very rewarding knowing that you could help the customers and the employees."
good,I was working through a agency so i was getting paid less then others. If I was working through the company I would of been more excited for the place. Overall the company makes you feel very much like home.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the freedom of being creative. Being able to create endcaps with merchandise and create promotional designs with product to promote sales. The hardest part of the job is the physical requirements of completing the jobs solo.
good,"Dr. Pepper is a smart company with a lot of smart upper level managers.  I learned a lot about identifying root cause, holding people accountable, and how things work in a faced pace manufacturing environment.  There are some good employees that work there.  They are a high performing organization, and have some  good plans in the works."
good,"One of the greatest things about working at DPSG, is the freedom. However, there is poor leadership. Management is not the best at leading by example. There's a lot of last minute decisions. Such as adding stores to your route with in short notice, not receiving your route until after start time, and late deliveries."
good,"Long days, early starting time. Dealing with customers and Store management can be a pain at times. If you can deal with working under pressure then this job can be for you."
good,"It was a good job at the time, wish i could have stayed longer. But my temp agency Areotek told me that i was fired by them. So i stop going and found out weeks later that it wasn't true. They just wanted to move me to a different place."
good,Pre-Trip your Tractor trailer. Collect Bill of Landing and mao out your route. Do not see co-workers often. Loved driving with little management contact. The hardest part of the job was on top of a 60hr work week 5-6 days a week. Include 12hrs of commuting. I had 8hrs of sleep and that was all of my free time. Get up at 1am and get home around 4pm.
good,not as big as a coca cola so it sota laid back company but it does pushes lots of product it was a nice company to work for. they had company cars u can use on your route
good,no matter how hard you work and show that you care you will have a hard time being promoted within this company. Every one is already hand selected for a position even though your suppose to interview for every position. I personally have been over looked for several sales routes because everyone I went up against and lost the jobs to have family in high positions within the company.
good,"A typical day includes reviewing paperwork, counting money, preparing reports reminding people to finish their work or do it properly. It might include researching problems."
good,"clock in at 4:30a.m check truck and bays for correct product then deliver off your route sheet."
good,"A typical day you stock shelfs and deal with customers.  Twice a week you get orders in to each store which must be inventoried and stacked.  Management is lose, i have met my manager twice.  This makes it hard for day to day contact. The most difficult thing about this job is the irregular hours, lack of time off,  and pay.  Best part of the job is that it is a foot in the door for sales"
good,"I service 18-22 accounts daily with a 6:30am start time. My day ends when all accounts are visited and managed. Each day is a different selling technique and account to service. Management support isn't the best due to lack of free time they have to spend with sales force in the field. I lead the entire sales team in total volume sales, so co-workers contact me daily for advice and insight. The hardest part of my job is working behind others. I enjoy most the weekends off and working at my own pace."
good,"Work would generally start between the hours of 6 am and 8 am and the end time would vary daily. Working in the merchandising field I learned that nothing is a definite and can change in the matter of seconds. Management would be possibly one of the worst parts of the merchandising roles because I had to deal directly with my companies supervisors, the sales man for the route and their supervisors, and also the store manager and their supervisors. There were too many people dictating my job role and having a say in everyday activity in any given store. Though there are many hectic and confusing things taking place in the merchandising position it was still beneficial and a great learning experience to interact in an indirect manner with customers than the usual customer service relationship."
good,"Horrible management, fun job. Be very careful and dont trust anyone."
good,"Wake up at 4am go to first location talk to a store manager and listen to any complaints, work the backroom for 1-2 hours if it is in order, if not add 1-2 hours to organize it (keep in mind that i was a swing guy so these routes arent even mine) because if a boss comes in its your fault, hope that not one little thing is wrong or that your account manager didnt forget to tell you to build anything or they will call you back even if they shouldve told you ahead of time or leave a note in a visible spot so you would know. 4-6 stops usually get off around 3-4pm unless heavy workload than ill be lucky to get home by 6pm and get some sleep."
good,"Soft Drink business is declining and the consumer is becoming more diverse, Pepper needs more alternative drinks beyond CSD"
good,Not a bad job overall. Pay is only about $10 to start. I currently work 8 days a week and average around 52-56 hours a week. Over time is nice but I NEVER get to spend time with my family and having a new baby that is hard on us. Nice being off a little earlier but being up at 6 on weekends not so much
good,"all depends on the position that you are working in. As a builder you will have to build pallets and make sure that they are loaded properly. As for your co workers you pretty much can have a good work environment. You will also work long hrs, but at the end of the week it is well worth it."
good,"A typical day consists of standing 90% of the 10 hour shift, lifting and moving 10-30 pounds constantly. Warehouse atmosphere, lots of moving forklifts. Management tends to micro manage everyone, co-workers are pleasant. Hardest part of the job is the heat, no air movement inside the warehouse."
good,The job is not bad if you have a great deal of free time. The hardest part about the job is flavor stacking an entire pallet.
good,"Great hours, salery is good, Benefits and advancement aren't there but over-all good company to work for."
good,"This job definitely has its ups and downs. Some days I work 6 or 7 hours, some days I work 12-14. It’s a very physically demanding job. It can be difficult dealing with the people you encounter or work with a lot of days. Unfortunately, the management has so much on their plate that a lot of things are overlooked and some people take advantage. Not the worst job but not the best either."
good,"I have learned a lot about the beverage industry working here, i have managed high prestige accounts and developed professional relations. The downside is that there are few possibilities to move up in the company, and the systems are outdated."
good,This company is ok but I really want to succeed and move up in a company. The pay is alright and some of the workers are nice and will help you the bad thing is the hours because I have a family and when I start at 5?in the morning and get done at 5 at night I’m pretty burnt out and really don’t have the time I want to be a husband and a father.
good,"I worked at KDP for 8 years. The first 6 were very good, even though women have a very difficult time getting promoted, but men get promoted after 6 months. I got tiny promotions, enough to keep me there I guess, but no real impact."
good,Had its ups and downs like every job but the money is ok if you stick with it. Management could be better by showing drivers more appreciation but you come in do your job and go home.
good,Keurig dr. Pepper is a place where they make pop they take cleaning very seriously. Management team needs to step up there's no leadership they make up rules as they go production needs more money
good,"I worked 4-5 grocery stores a day, by myself. Stocking, building displays. It's great being independent in a sense, working at your own pace, but during the Holidays, that can add up to 16 hour days."
good,"Everything's good about this job except you probably won't get your 40 hours due to overstaffing, also you will not get any benefits right away, if you want PTO time you have to work for it and accrue it. Also they make you work until lunch, and by the time the work is done is when you can take your 2 15. minute breaks."
good,"Don’t really know what the day will be like from day to day. Lack of communication. Lack of accountability.  Has its good and bad days, can be rewarding."
good,A good place to work at and friendly people also competitive wages good health care and benefits just a good place to work at.Management needs some work but over all a good place to work.
good,The hardest part of the job is never being able to work ahead due to workload and the lack of employees. Keurig's motto is work more with less people.
good,When it comes to experience and learning how to work at a grocery store and stocking its a very good job for that. Management doesnt seem to care too much about their employees. Co workers arent the most helpful but overall good learning experiences
good,"Work life balance was not appropriate."
good,"decent  place to work "
good,Allowed me to advance my skill set and had opportunity for promotion.  Dr Pepper allowed Managers to manage their business to achieve objectives and rewarded them for it.
good,"I have been employed for thirty years at KDP. I have always been a loyal employee. and have followed company directives from my employer. It seems however in my opinion, that our focus has shifted less to the customer's needs, and more to building our portfolio. This puts a strain on customer-sales relationship. I find myself having to abandon my core beliefs and strong arm customers (my boss's words) into taking whatever we offer them. Sales is based on a lot of criteria; customer demand, demographics,etc.I understand that publicly owned companies have to keep their stock prices up, but it is still morally wrong to force feed customers products that they may or may not want. I have sold every product that we have ever produced distributed. Some successful, some total failures. The customer must gain your trust, and know that you are working in his best interest, not dictating what he must do."
good,"The work I was doing was good. Things that had to be done. The culture was very poor. I thought being a TX soda company there would be some cool Texas pride. But working in the IT department I was one of only 2 white people. Not that I am racist, but you would think if you had 90+% Indian people working with/for you that you would maybe hire a different race? Very awkward environment if you are thinking about joining the IT department."
good,"As with any manufacturing plant. When it's busy, it's busy. When it isnt, you may not get your 40. But dr pepper still has sick time and many companies do not. Recently bought by keurig, so the future will tell."
good,"A total work day was hectic and stressful. Everyday you had to deal with drivers, up to 50 a day. Some were rude and some were frustrated from having to be there. I learned how to handle people and not let the little things get to me. Many duties were placed one you. My job consist of managing time spent on loads to cleaning the restrooms. Manager was great to work for."
good,Okay place to work but low mileage rate pay and poor management as far as branch manager when he demands no overtime and they pile extra work on you almost every day and I also got cheated out of my mileage when I had first started
good,"Working at DR. Pepper was ok, just know they don't promote women and men are going to be paid or than women. I was temp, so I don't know about the benefits."
good,a typical day at work is long so say goodbye to family and you never have set days off so it changes every week so good luck trying to schedule a doctors appointment never knowing when you will be off and also the late hours
good,Constantly making changes that negatively affect employees. Management doesn't seem to have a genuine concern for the employees. This may not be a company wide problem as is a facility problem. This facility is a great candidate for a union.
good,I would travel to different stores and put pop on shelves and then go to a different store and do the samething. There would days I would have to travel over 100 miles.
good,"I loved Merchandising and if I could do it again I would, taking care of other stores was my job and enjoyed doing it for the two years I did it. I learned how to do different things such as mange my own time between store, organize product and even make the order for the stores that would come from the truck the next day."
good,"not to mush in mind it has it ups and down.people are great  supervisor need more people training skill,  They don't full train employees. Benefits are great"
good,"A typical day was waiting for inventory to be complete investigating all product being produced that day, entering orders that were being picked up from our outside customers then finishing the orders with bill of lading."
good,"A typical day at work:"
good,"typical day at work is to interact with route drivers full service vending drivers, management, finance department for updated information about the cash room, check POD, cashier driver out if they have any form of currency, pack up DSD and invoices for the to be sent off to an our headquarter for scanning. Prepared bank deposit and balance cash handle for the day."
good,making sure the product is correct an not damage also delivery at a management time being very polite to customer making sure they are satisfiy with job we are doing
good,I really enjoyed my time working for DPSG I gained a lot of experience while working on there team for 18 years I started as a machine operator and worked my way up to a Production Manager.
good,Declining market makes margins tough. You can move around in the company and gain experience. The culture is one of work hard and face time.
good,Fast paced work environment with lots of consistent lifting. Must be able to plan for/work with changes in your days and aggravated store management. Start time is very early and your days will be long.
good,"family like work inviroment between union employees in production and warehouse, but company employees management don't seem to care about personal issues or emergencies that rises in a production employees personal life. The atmosphere appears the company vs union where company have no compassion for it's workers. Pay and compensation is very good compared to the location but no room for advancement"
good,"For most part fun work enviroment, most management is good. Jobs are not difficult but physically required. Pay isnt the greatest at all and advancement isnt really a big chance..slim to none. But if you are just looking for a job to do around school work or whatever it may be. Its not a bad job at all."
good,"There is a lack of communication between management, supervisors, and hourly works."
good,Dr. Pepper was a good company due to the employees I worked  but as far as management they weren't organized and didn't know what to do half the time.
good,"Leading the Kroger team was a great experience for me and I found my time with Dr Pepper Snapple very rewarding."
good,"A typical day at work is coming into a nice work space environment.  The location of the company is great with access to the mall and shopping strips.  Close to the Dallas Tolls and about 20 minutes from downtown Dallas."
good,"On a typical day, I would have to work 8-10 stories. A typical shift for me was 10-12 hours long. Even with me work through my breaks. Fellow merchandisers for the company would not organize the back-stock and sometimes would barely stock the shelves in the store. On a personal level the management was great, I enjoyed working with them. though on a professional level they did not adjust my schedule so my shift was shorter, nor for sales that would force me to work and a store longer. The sale representative would over order products for the store, make the job more difficult. Since, we had limited space in the stories back-stock. One part of the job that was enjoyable was seeing the results of my hard work and any given store and helping other people in the store."
good,The work is not bad is  just like any other place where people are the only bad thing. But over all it was a great experience that I had and which I learned a lot of new thing.
good,I worked here for a couple of months.. first off we only had 5 pickers and one loader. The manager was lazy so he sat in the office all night. Shifts were very long 12-15 hours. People would call out alot. Never had enough pallet jacks. Very hot. And the way they do things is a little out dated.  Not a place to make a career.
good,Management seems to love the Blame game. A typical day at work is be in by 6 a.m do your route as fast as possible with minimal mistakes. Come back to yard clean out your truck and repeat the next day.
good,"Since demerging from Cadbury Schweppes, the new ""Dr Pepper Snapple"" has slowly eliminated everything that made the company a great place to work."
good,"Spent 8 hours a  day on the phone, computer, working on reports orders or solving problems."
good,My approach to work is to always be available and listen to your employees. Follow up and visibility mean alot to them and allowing them to participate in the decision making process.  Their participation makes them have ownership. Ownership makes the employees proud of being a part of a company.  I love my job because it is different every day and I sincerely care about the safety of each employee.  Seeing the employees support safety after years of building a good foundation is paying off today.
good,"Good company to work for, but there seems to always be a constant change in management.No one seems to last long in the company.Room for growth is not there."
good,"Company does offers a solid benefit package to its employees. This company would be for someone who enjoys meeting the goals of the national corporation without regard to individual/local branch success. In my experience, they care more about customer service than the morale of their employees. An area that should be equally balanced."
good,Its a alright job...I had no life when I worked here..only day off was Sunday
good,"Lots of overtime, expect to work 13+ hr shifts. You go in at 5:30 PM and work until you see the the sunrise frequently. Lots of cranky co-workers when I was there. You can expect lots of overtime though which is a plus."
good,This job was a little heavy on the workload a couple years ago the pay wasn't worth the workload but after the company was brought by Keurig the pay got better over time and also the workload meaning the amount of stores you had to work went down and more help started coming in the Merchandiser manager I had was one of the best managers you can have he always displayed that he had your back and was always helping us when he could.
good,Temporary associates were treated poorly by management. They were treated as easily replaceable and most times management did not communicate efficiently.
good,The office is fast-paced and ever-changing.  The environment is evolving as this is a new and developing team.  The culture is also developing and forming an identity as well.
good,Only completing this section to meet the 150 character requirement to get the the next screen. I should really have the option to not have to complete this
good,management messed with  routes to much was not a bad place to work pretty laid back money was ok most of the time unless you upset the boss then they would mess with your route and not give you cases to make the money you need to make
good,"It was a good paying union job with many benefits such as raises, discounts on products and matched 401k. Working with the people are very kind and helpful as well as the managers"
good,I had a challenging experience and it was hectic something I never expected. The lifting got complicated and it was on a consistent basis throughout the day everyday. It became very hard for me to do and no longer able to do that role anymore.
good,"Keurig Dr. Pepper has a lot of potential just feel for the work we did and driving into limited area stores dealing with the managers of about a 100 stores a week 15 to 20 deliveries average, unloading and stocking shelves making displays in all weather all year round it's just a little too much for not enough it's like 750 to 900 a week should be like 1100 to 1400 a weeks honestly its alot of sugar Honey Ice Tea to do"
good,Worked hard and didn’t get paid much but they never ove worked you and they cared about their employees and pay was underpay but not to bad for the work
good,The mamager I worked for in Fountain Services was a witch. She was a bully and talked to her employees like trash and it was accepted because she has been with the company for more than 20 years. HORRIBLE experience.
good,Great company with great benefits an discounts fast pace Atmosphere come to work you can move up fast would  recommend for anyone fresh outta of school
good,"Good brand training, but a bit up in the air at the moment with the merger. Many have left in the past 3-4 years. The organization has changed a lot in the past 18 months."
good,Kids doin slave work poor Management police wait til you leave to harass you hudson dont want black people out there like mouse tryin to get chesse you better have your things in order to do slave work
good,A great push towards customer service and sales. I learned a lot more about pricing in the actual sales side of things. I also got a better understanding for customer service with having a larger area to cover.
good,"It was a very challenging place to work, and so many different types of machinery,good coworkers and nice management crew that was very understanding with us"
good,This company has a difficult hiring process for the job postings and awareness to the internal employee. The managers aren't really known to the people that are seeking employment to their designated department.
good,"Would recommend to anyone of the current manager left. I enjoyed the job. It is manual labor and the start time is early in the morning, but it was a decent job."
good,"I love working at DPSG. I've never felt so valued and respected as an employee before with other employers, but DPSG goes above and beyond to care and empower their employees. The work is rewarding. I love my job! I'm really happy to have worked for DPSG and I would suggest working here for anyone who truly values a great place to work."
good,Every day is a adventure. The opportunity to do different things in and out of the warehouse keeps me. Interested. Daily schedule changes keeps you paying attention.
good,"Keurig Dr, Pepper is a decent place to work.  The work hours can be long.  Most of the employees I have meet are decent people.  I have nothing bad to say about the company as a whole."
good,Decent company but because it's so big you have to have some pretty big credentials or know someone to work there and to advance.  Formalized programs and processes.
good,"Communication is key to every career, this place lacks communication in all areas of the plant. Other than that not a bad place to work for. Have learned a lot while working there to improve my skills."
good,I liked working there just not enough pay and they send you far away when someone missed work you have to cover their stores and merchandise them as well
good,Fast pace work picking orders with voice pick system. I learned to load trailers and to operate a forklift and walkierider. Management was not so good
good,"Interview the interviewer.  Ask about team chemistry within the group you are interviewing for and go one step further.  Ask for a couple of the teammates contact information to get their take.  "
good,It was a ok place to work at times. There were are a lot of things that could have been done differently by the company to make it a better place to work.
good,"Easy to end up with a manager that is completely out of touch with the work that needs to be done.  Many managers are off site.  Leadership is generally inaccessible.  This can be a good thing for people who prefer to work autonomously.  If you are not able to get your managers attention when you need it you will be frustrated when a missed opportunity turns into a blow up that comes back at your manager or at you."
good,"it was ok , be prepared to work also people will throw you under the bus to save themselves. be sure to cover yourself at all times. Work schedules are early in the mornings but you have the rest of the afternoon and evenings to yourself."
good,"Face pased competitive, overtime, discounts, benifites, paid time off, insurance, stock options, 401K., incentives, breaks every 2 hours, paid holidays."
good,Outdated when it comes to technology and do not motivate youngsters. People value experience than skills and education level. But a very good company when it comes with process
good,expect to make money but spend a lot of time at work including weekends.Good benefits vision dental medical. As I said lots of hours will needed to be put in.
good,"KDP "
good,Directives for this company change very quickly and need to stay on your toes.  not the most ethical company to be a part of in the grand scheme of things
good,"Much has changed in the last few years, from being purchased & going private to merging with Doctor Pepper.  While the culture has changed rather dramatically from the Keurig origins, the new organization offers many opportunities for those willing to work hard."
good,Its a profession to contribute into paying your bills for survival. Different reactions as well as circumstance for depending on the person being. From my work experience i wouldn't view this company as a profession for retirement
good,"great company if you want to be complacent and not move up in the organization.  Women are not widely accepted into management positions, its the good ole boys club."
good,"A typical day at work includes meeting with project engineers, going over the schedule and adjusting as needed.  Checking raw materials and upcoming trials/projects that need to be scheduled.  "
good,"Very stressfull, the work culture, had learned alot, great job knowledge, experience, learn technical skills, communication skills, computer skills, collabrated with the quality, and engerring departments, had company EAP days, coffee benefits, CAFE time, excellent pay, benefits."
good,challenge day to day . great peers safe place to work long hours . plenty to do in a 10 hour day. need to work on the people skills from the top down.
good,"A typical day was very hectic, people there really don't like to help new people. Cut throat place. Only good thing is that you do get a discount on products they offer, and you get to try new things before they even hit the shelves."
good,"I love my job.   But, I was a a lowely contractor.  So, I didn't feel like I even belonged to them.  A lot of them loved me, and that made me stay for as long as I did."
good,"its a high pace, physically demanding job but not too bad over all."
good,Was a good company do to it being a temporary service job I didn’t get the chance to get the full experience ..but from the time I was there it seemed to be a good work environment
good,Pay sucks here that's really it for me! Co workers here make it hard to move up and make money cause not everybody else here is on the same page and I feel even us the good workers  getting put in the same page same money I was raised different thought you get payed on what you know and how well you can work but thanks for the opportunity.
good,"it was a nice job. expect for the managers and the long work hours. not enough help, pay was good. some employees are grown men that act like women. they treat the employees like slaves"
good,"Some long hours but quite do able "
good,"Team environment but must be able to work independently to achieve your goals.  Very supportive group and lots of wins to celebrate.  Overall, a good company to work for."
good,This was a part time job as I was a full time student. I knew I would need to get a full time job eventually as this was only part time. The sales rep was nice but there were too lesss of hours to go round.
good,It was a very fast pace job were you have to use a thing called voice pick . That’s so we can call out the quantity of what we’re picking. It was pretty simple.
good,The job was fine. There was no room for advancement. Managers were not very helpful. Managers were fired and replacements were not trained well. They needed more help and were not willing to hire more.
good,I worked there a long time in advertising agency work and learned my trade as a creative director. had a couple of bad bosses that was very jealous of my abilities. made it hard to get any recognition there due to them.
good,"KDP provides a solid work place, although it seems like it may be hard to move up at times. As long as you do your job, the job security is absolutely there."
good,"Great hours, good work environment always work everybody's moving. nice co-workers helpful team, management was ok enjoyed working at Dr. Pepper job wasn't hard at all."
good,hard work but i will never do it gain not enough pay and they will hire anyone who will pass a drug test doesn't have a lot of room to grow and become a manager unless someone quite.
good,"the money is good , but it is very hard work everyday.management try's to do a good job , but the nature of the job makes everything difficult .every day was a new problem.poor equipment"
good,"this job mainly made different bottle sodas for various companies, also different cleaning assignments for different machines in a timed order. also learned how to work with different personality's."
good,"This was one of the best jobs I had seeing that I just moved back, it helped me figure out what I wanted to do, and it helped me think about getting my CDL"
good,busy consistent work there would barely be time to take lunch management was unable to help as a result of not being educated. Fast paste work enviorment.
good,I enjoyed working for this company. I enjoyed interacting with people and customers. I enjoyed going to different stores. The hardest part of the job was putting away the deliveries.
good,"It's a decent job.  The brands are fun and well-known and the people are nice.  The climate can get very political at times.  They do you give you lots of autonomy in your role.  Work/life balance has become strained in recent years, and flexibility (the ability to work remotely) could be improved."
good,general warehouse duties - work til the job is completed - load and unload trucks - stack pallets and completed customers orders - clean and maintain warhouse
good,"No room for Advancement at Dr. Pepper.  I really like my manager and will go wherever she may go, but I think it would be better for me to step out on faith."
good,"this was a good place to work. the benefits were good and if you were able to drive your own car, you would get paid mileage. only thing that I did not approve of was there is no room for promotion and management was not 100%."
good,"Good job was very thankful for this job, and would go back and day. The management was wonderful, and learned a lot from company. Was very understanding."
good,I did like working for the company and great company to work would recommend to anyone looking to work locally and be home every night.  Great pay and benefits
good,"My mother always taught me to not say anything bad about someone. I feel this should include companies as well. So sorry, no review from me. No stop forcing me to do this, I don't want to."
good,"In the case of an employee who has the experience they can not become a supervisor unless they have a degree, it doesn't matter what its in.  This is a problem when someone who has no experience is put in charge of a group of employees and they have no people skills just because they have a degree."
good,Lots of mandatory overtime.  Not a job for anyone who has a family as they require you to work 12-15 hours a day.  It was great financially however it wears you down.
good,Competitive work environment  and fast paced be ready to work or don't even go tot he interview you must be ready to earn your job  don't even apply if you are lazy
good,"Good Benefits, but needs management changes. Would be good if the management had drive to show employees how things are should be done instead of just sitting in office all day. Just my opinion."
good,"Management is good, Corporate made the job hard to live off of. Coworkers are great people. The Union doesn't help on the contracts like they should nor do they stick up for union employees."
good,"•	Collaborate and build relationships with sales/store managers to coordinate effective delivery and distribution of product"
good,I started off at $105 a day and they pay you chinese overtime. It comes out to be $5 or $6/hour. The work is slightly heavy but if you arent lazy you can handle it. The good thing is you work til you finish all your stores.
good,"If you work here you can get promoted if you work hard enough, however promotions are bottle necked at a sales level, between swing sales and account manager. Once you've landed account manager in order to really move up and not laterally you'll need to move states for the most part, as a district manager position would be the most likely step and those positions very rarely every rotate or change hands."
good,"As a former employee at Snapple the job its self was quite physical but i didnt mind the work out. They pay is ok but can be better, co workers are cool an some super visors let you work an listen to music."
good,My experience at Dr. Pepper was not a good one. I had touble learning due to lack of training and they aren't very team oriented. The benifits are unblieveable though and the pay is pretty good.
good,"Started out as Cadbury Schweppes, very good company to work for, Dr.Pepper bought it and sales increased and company decided to split up the territories and decrease the volume from the Louisville facility"
good,Dr. Pepper is a good company to work for you can work in the warehouse or be a tack driver or a stock clerk be a stocker who go to grocery store and stock dr.pepper products.you get paid burger while working in a warehouse better than a lot of another job.
good,Management needs work. You don;t get your schedule till two days before the week starts. Communication is lacking. Some days you're held to unreasonable expectations.
good,management doesn't bother you much unless you keep getting complaints on you.  The culture is nice in some stores.  learn how you be organized in your life personally and professionally.  the hardest part is to keep things clean and don't drop your product. the most enjoyable part is that when you done you done
good,"Good Starter Company for fresh out of college students to get your feet wet in the ""Corporate America"" world.  But if you are a minority or woman, it is hard to advance unless you are satisfied in a supportive role as an analyst or lower.  Yes, we have a few women manager but if you look at our senior management, it is prominent white male.  But the company is trying to change their image.  They hired a female to run the HR department as a senior VP.  As for work life balance, several members “older” senior management is still under the old ways of thinking that one must put in 60 hours or more work week to be considered a good worker."
good,"Be prepared to work alot! You will work 6 to 7 days a week in the summer. The pay is low but the benefits are good, overall not a bad company to work for if you are in your 20's."
good,The typical working day at Dr.Pepper Snapple Bottling Co. would be constant work from start to finish. Loading and unloading merchandise. I learned how to drive commercial vehicles receiving my Class A CDL through Dr.Pepper.  Management stayed busy just as drivers did. The most challenging part of my job in my opinion was patience delivering merchandise to clients that had customers as deliveries arrived. The most enjoyable part of my job was being behind the wheel.
good,Learned a lot from my lead on how to run and make necessary changes on each machines on the lines to ensure good product being received by the clients
good,"The right hand doesn't know what lhe left hand is doing ! Management is not there on a daily basis, and when they are they are clueless as to daily operations."
good,They expect us to be there at 3:30-4am but the trucks are not usually ready to leave until 5am or 6am. The benefits are very good but the pay is lacking compared to what other driving companies of this grade pay.
good,Nice company to work for.  I just wish they would hire within the company when a new position comes available instead of hiring outside the company.  Most of the employees do not know a job is available until there is a new employee on board.
good,it was a very cool place in the freezer.. but long as you are moving there was no problem. it was easy more very easy because you get paid by the hour.
good,"Get in early at 5 am every day. Drive far to certain stores such as Wal mart, Food maxx ect. Merchandise the entire store. Ensure all shelves and coolers are stocked correctly. "
good,Long hours. Pay isn't anything spectacular. People were meh. Had to quit for personal reasons with management and my enlistment
good,Drove my personal vehicle to stores listed on my route for that day. Inventoried store shelves prior to retrieving stock form the back of the stores. I put a lot of miles on my vehicle while I worked for this company. I had to keep track of those miles for filing my taxes.
good,Overall DPSG is a great place to work at. A typical day as a pallet builder is fast paced and very busy. Everyone is moving throughout the warehouse trying to meet the demands of the company. Although a nice place to work the pay was not competitive for the work load.
good,as you might imagine from a big company they really don't care about their work force having lives outside of the job however they do allow just about all the overtime you could ever want so the checks were pretty good
good,"Productive and fun workplace i loved working for dr. pepper snapple beverage co. My co workers were very nice and helpful."
good,At Dr.Pepper the days were long and the pay was not up to par. I haven't worked there in about 5yrs but from what I heard not much has changed but the management.
good,it was a good job untill they got bought out then the company just went down hill. typical day was wake up drive to all the stores and working all the products and making sure your stores look perfect
good,"- fun "
good,"Very easy job. When operating machines in warehouse, you must be able to learn your machine and be able to fix minor problems to keep production going."
good,Be ready to work hard. I didn't like the mileage that it puts on your car. You sometimes work 14-16 hour days on saturdays in the summer. The hours can be inconsistent at times.
good,"The facility has wonderful benefits, the training and development for employers to learn different things that has been added over the years needs a lot of improvement, The management team needs further training on how to treat people fairly as well as communication with employees, learning mechanical set ups are the hardest as far as change for people with a naked eye for the task"
good,They used what they called Chinese overtime. it is were you get paid time and a half for the first 4 hours then after that it depletes until it hits minimum wage so the would give you a work load big enough to get you 60-80 hrs a week to save them money.
good,"A typical day at work consists of running my daily report at first. I see what's new and what needs follow up. I check my emails, voicemails, send out responses. I work through any pending order issues I have, I update my customers about their orders. I check all field items and work with the appropriate team to fix it. I notify my customers of any delayed loads and the dates when they will receive their orders. "
good,"Drive forklift stack pop on pallets"
good,"I wake up for work at 4am and have to be at my first store at 5:30am. I start by walking the store and making a list of any of our items that are low or out of stock. I then go to the back of the store where the back stock room is and grab any items that i need to replenish the shelf, displays or isle stacks. During add weeks, some stores require me to build displays for whatever it is that they have on add. I'm already a very organized person, but if your organization skills are lacking, you'll become an organized person. In this job, there are times that you may have to back track due to all the thing your required to remember. So before I start working the store, I take a moment to think about how I'm going to attack a store and what order I should do it in based on priority. The management here at Dr Pepper Snapple Group are very helpful and are always willing to listen to what i have to say and any ideas I may have that could help the company function more productively. The hardest parts of the job is everything. There is nothing easy about being a merchandiser, well a good one at least. Having to fill shelves and coolers, build displays and put loads away is very physically demanding task. The people I come in contact with at the many stores I service makes my day very enjoyable. It helps ease the stress when I'm able to talk and joke around with someone."
good,"It is difficult to break the glass ceiling if you are a woman or of color.  Every department is different, so this is not true across the board, but is systemic of the company as a whole."
good,It is a good job to have if you are a hard worker that can work independently and push yourself.  Everyday you are responsible for increasing sales in the territory you are assigned to
good,"not much room to move up, but its a good job, pays well, lots of overtime, good exercise for the day, poor hours, uninforming managers"
good,The position as delivery Snapple driver will probably never have longevity because requirements are very high and pay is not very good.
good,Very nice company to work for a had a great time while being employed there no complaints other than better pay was needed
good,cool people easy work select orders using a single pallet jack then load onto truck
good,Average in pay for this position but a great comapny to work for with okay benefits.
good,"Employee's often at odds with management. Long hours, bad union contracts"
good,company lacks leadership and comunications. equipment breaking down frequenly and pare parts available.
good,"I Developed, document, and monitors company quality systems as they relate to the assigned production. I lead teams in the conduct of audits for Configuration Management and Quality Systems such as route manager & inventory reports. modify documents to include procedures, reports, and administrative instructions, and product shipping documentation,  Responsible for the design of internal & external auditing."
good,"It is an okay place to work but, long hours really low pay and not for a family person.  I worked there for about a year was the top case stacker in the eastern region.  Worked my tail off and never advanced regardless of what my supervisor told me.  I missed one day out of the whole time I was there and they fired me.  The employees there are back stabbers they disliked me because I was the best employee there so every chance that the other employees there had to get rid of me the did.  If you do decide to work there the best thing to do is not to try and out do the next guy or they will find any and every reason to get you out of there."
good,"Fun environment, terrible management.  Could use better communication between employees."
good,"Poor teamwork environment, but other locations are better."
good,"Long days with little help, very physically demanding, great entry level sales job. This job will give you the basic building blocks or retail sales in the DSD, vendor sales. Merchandising, planograms, resetting to shelf schematics."
good,The working environment needs improvement. There is lack of leadership and team oriented environment.
good,I learned to look out for myself and to learned to cope with coworkers who don't put as much effort into their work as I do.
good,"responsible for product distribution and order in the store"
good,Very hot and demanding job. My co-workers are good people. Union plant.
good,I would get my route for that day. I would go to my 1st stop and pull out the product for merchandising. I would place orders and check with the store manager to let them know that I just merchandised their store. It was a benefit and a feel good to sell in new displays . The hardest part of the job was keeping track of all the inventory. The thing I enjoyed the most was traveling and meeting new people also keeping things in order.
good,"i work for 2 different sites, one in Denver-co, one in Indianapolis-in, in Denver the management, the support, benefits and pay was great, the only problem was the reputation the company carried, the new management was doing a excellent job, but for the previous 10 years, the previous management almost lost most of their business, was a hard challenge we were facing trying to change that bad reputation, the 2nd site in Indianapolis-in, was a whole different structure, i took a big pay cut, and i have to work a extra day a week for less money and more work, management was great dealing with personal, but did not have a total understanding of the business, regardless, a lot's of good intentions and hard working at indianapolis plant."
good,"Interesting place to work."
good,"good company horrible pay  "
good,I was the lead machine operator and worked various shifts. I dedicated myself to the company for over 20 years. I worked long hours and odd hours.
good,"Advancement opportunities are available, but log jam at the sales position. The Cleveland Plant just went union, and are in the process of negotiating the contract."
good,• Received merchandise by verifying shipment.
good,"You are to arrive at work at 6 a.m. get your equipment together( depending on position what it might be), and prepare for the day. There are a lot of different positions that all depend on each other to get through the day. The co-workers are the best part, you work long hours so you spend a lot of time with them. Their are some really good people there. The hardest part is management. Some things that should be so easy to accomplish can be difficult at times. I learned valuable things while I worked there like got my forklift license got my cdl and learned the value of a hard days work. At the end of the day it is not a bad place to work and I value the time and experiences I learned."
good,"Company was good to work for, had good benefits, pay was decent. Ethical reasons caused me to persue other employment."
good,"A typical day of work is medium work,about 30 tickets to complete. I learned how to operate a pallet jack and different ways to build a pallet. Management was cool, they were pretty laid back but meant business. My co-workers were all cool. we all had the same goal in mind and that was to have a nice check at the end of the week. The hardest part of the job was getting adjusted to the hours, working at 6 p.m. until finish time. The most enjoyable part of the job was having a relaxed but get the job done type of work environment and the benefits."
good,No set schedule no time with family nice place to work for single individual with no kids. Treat you fair break every two hours.
good,This is a good first job for someone very physially fit and of younger age that has no relationships in their life. Hours can be very long and only partial weekends off. Mostly good for those who have strong work ethics and are self motivated.
good,it was a good place if under proper manangent
good,Ok place to work. Under payed for what we do. Have to continuously hustle all day long  to get home at a decent time every day. Work through lunches and breaks.
good,Would be better if had enough equipment and was able to maintain hours. Case pay is not enough you are better off being paid hourly. Because to see enough money you would need to pick 2000 cases or more a night
good,The management team is very unprofessional here. They would sometimes use obscene language when chastising employees and sometimes even when talking with members of upper management. I would not recommend anyone work here.
good,company has good benefits and the union looks out for its employees. hours must be flexible as there can be little overlap if someone calls out. management could be more involved in this especially.
good,Culture is still shifting due to 2018 merger and discrepancies are still obvious when it come to everything from compensation to management style to work/life balance.
good,Good place to work. Good if you are looking for job security. There is always something new to learn. Everyday is a new challenge that you are faced with.
good,"The typical work day is cut and dry  same old same old everyday."
good,Working for dr. Pepper I've picked up a lot of Commercial Driving experiences as well as stalking them wrapping them in their correct order making sure that the out-of-date or expired products were not sent to mr. Delivery vendors Warehouse to work in a good atmosphere.
good,"Keurig just merged DPSG so layoff are happening"
good,"This was a great job, but it did require some weekend work. Culture was pretty good because it involved continuous improvement and always trying to get better."
good,Typical day we left to start deliveries at 5 a.m. you'll be gone up to 14-16 hours some days. You are paid $10. An hour up to 8 hours and commission is .28 a case.3 to 500 cases a day. Do the math working 16 hours a day for a week. Load quality at times are terrible if warehouse is understaffed. You'll have to wait for an unlimited amount of time to get checked in at the stores then merchandise on top of it dispatch is terrible with routing. Get threatened with loss of job if you don't complete routes because of lack of hours..I can go on. I was there when the company was dr. Pepper snapple group
good,Very fast past and lots of change in procedures. Need more training programs for new employees. Managers need more knowledge on management roles. No opportunity for advancement
good,What made this job so hard was cleaning up the mess the guy before you made. It's a little better when you have your own route. And then there are routes that can take 11-15 hours to complete and other routes that can take 6-9 so youde think theyre try to level them out but they done. So if you do work there try getting an easy route.
good,Glad to have had the job. More glad that i got out alive and with marriage in tact. 
good,"As an account manager I would contact key personnel in assigned accounts pre-selling products, promotions, displays, point-of-sale material, and beverage section revamps.  Typically visit 14-16 convenience and drug stores per day and write orders for product to be delivered two days later.  Position is very physically demanding.  Get to meet a lot of interesting characters out there in the field but it makes the days go by."
good,"High level Manufacturing environment with lots of opportunity. Plant had 2 shifts, M-F with some required weekends depending on production needs. Always something to due and good teamwork."
good,I loved the management I worked under. Wonderful folks. I wished that the company had a better structure for the account managers so we didnt feel so lost
good,"Dr.pepper/ Snapple looks like a job anyone can do, it is not. low work force, travel and hard work required a work day any were from 10 hours to 16. your day will start around 4 or 5 am depending on how soon you want to start. and your day will continue untill the last store on your list is done, or it should as many times if you get done before 10 hours of work you will be given extra stores to do. there will be few days in which you will work 8 hours but on average most stores will take you 2-3 hours to do and you will have an average of 5 stores on your list. some with as much as 1000 cases or more of product to move."
good,"Only managers there, no leaders. They expect metrics to be hit, but do not provide necessary tools to achieve. Driven only by numbers Corporate pushes policies that make account managers lose money."
good,"This used to be a fun..productive happy work environment. We all worked very hard as ONE team. Corporate came in about 2years ago..and wanted more more more out of the workers..this facilitated everyone feeling like robots instead of valued employees...very sad. Lots of super good people left, not liking what direction the company was now heading...me included. Sad sad..😞"
good,Availability for career growth within organization. Believe in promoting from within which creates an environment rich in company pride and loyalty. Most positions of management do not require a college degree if promoting from within.
good,Started as a machine operator 1 held that position for about 8 months. Then was promoted to a filler operator were I performed filler changeover/flavors held the filler operator position for about 1 year then I was promoted to utility lead operator were I assisted all the operators gave breaks tally all the production numbers.
good,Started out at $10.50/hour. The work was very hard so i dont think the wage was enough. We were understaffed and overworked during the busiest part of the year.
good,"It was an OK job, a lot of long hours an not enough pay the company seemed to have their favorites . Not enough trust in their employees."
good,"Work is certainly hard work, lots of lifting throughout the day but the pay is decently compensated. For the most part it's a 9 hour a day job sometimes longer which makes life at home very opportunistic however the dynamic, culture and views need work and not much room for growth. That's the most i'll say"
good,"Convenient, comfortable environment. Close to transportation. Not much room for advancement opportunity. Most enjoyable part of the job was being able to maintain great, memorable relationships with customers, clientele and staff. Hardest part of the job was not being appreciated for all the extra, unpaid work you do. Management could definitely use some work."
good,"Great benefits that start the same day you are hired, friendly coworkers and tolerable environment overall. My job consists of unloading trucks and replenishing warehouse to make ready for night loaders. It's not rocket science, and a decent job. The last half of my day is working outside assisting with checking in trucks and maintaining damaged product, pallets and empty shelves. "
good,this was not the type of job I was looking for. The job has inconsistent hours and low communication with employees. I didn't feel that there was a whole lot of room for advancement. it was hard to get to know new people and build relationships. the best part of my job was interacting with customers.
good,"Arriving anywhere between 2am-6am until load is done which can be as late as 7pm."
good,"The benefits start the day you're hired. No set schedule. Work most holidays. The co-workers was a lot of fun. You work mostly independent, which can be good but rarely get help when you need it."
good,"Job function was enjoyable. Lots of movement, opportunity to meet people and I worked independently. Went to stores on assigned route to merchandise product. Took care of back stock within store and condensed product from delivery truck."
good,"good company, too much management changes lately with new mentality. this doesnt work that well at times but as long as the vision and goals are clear goals can be reachable. we have really good days as anybody else as well bad days we just have to be ready to learn from it and be better every day."
good,Love the early start times. To many problems within the front office
good,"It is unlike any other job you work. The management is ok, the sales team is horrible. They don't do there job and get no repercussions for not doing what is required."
good,Great way to build resume. There were different things that could make you successful and get to the top.
good,"Hard work, store managers are not very good. They look down on you"
good,"Typical day at work consisted of e-mails, customer service, order processing via edi, inventory coordination, production coordination, correcting mis-shipped orders, technical assistance with all distribution centers, start up proceedures for new locations."
good,"I learned how to motivate employees and management, by asking for feedback and implementing some of their solutions. I believe the best part of a company is the people because they can make or break the team. The hardest part of the job is convincing some people why change is good; some are stuck in their old habits and do not want to evolve with the current times.The most enjoyable part of the job is building strong relationship with people and gaining their trust. I learned how important is to keep promises and to admit when I make a mistake. Making mistakes is how I learned how to do better. I took pride in building a culture where employees knew they were valued and their voice matters. Management overall was effective they stood up for what was right and inspired their employees to do their best."
good,"A typical work day starts at 5:00 am and depending on your route, can end around 5pm to 7pm. Very nice pay as a driver and for co drivers don't get any beifits."
good,"We are looking for a self-motivated and customer service-oriented individual who enjoys working in a fast-paced environment. You thrive working independently on assigned tasks, but you look forward to interacting with people at work. You prefer to stay active and are excited to spend the majority of your shift lifting, pushing, and pulling cases of our products. Taking pride in your work and being detailed-oriented are qualities that are important to you. Please apply now if you are the person we're searching for to join KDP!"
good,There are bulk drivers that drive 53' tractor trailers manual transmission. And there are Bayside drives that drive automatic transmission. Bulk drivers back into docks and drop pallets. Bayside drivers us wheel dollies and hump cases into store and stack shelves...its 2 man job being performed by one person which equals long days. You are being paid by the case load and not the hours ... pay can come out to $16hr if you don't go fast
good,"The culture is improving and the people are talented. The e-mail traffic and meetings are overwhelming. Love the flexible working hours and ""work from home"" policy."
good,"job started of good, riding along with drivers getting to know the job. after training some days became stressful when getting unfamilar routes and not knowing where to make deliveries. When having to stock stores after making delivery every second counts and a lot of days felt like a two man job, cases would be brought back almost daily and was frownd upound. OK for someone looking for experience and decent pay. but not long term"
good,"the job overall is a GREAT job.  Great pay, I personally loved the work schedule, Though the 12 hours shift do get herd sometimes, they make up for it with the amount of days yu get off.  My one and ONLY complaint about the job are the PPL, they are too worried about what the next person is doing vs focusing on themselves"
good,"It was ok working there until overtime was cut and co-workers started slacking. Great benefits, discounts and paid time off. I would recommend working for this company."
good,"A typical day at work starts when I clock in, we have a pre-shift meeting, and from there we get our daily task.  I report to the shipping department. Throughout the day  I'm given orders to pull, supervise over temps, watch over inventory, and report anything that goes wrong.   "
good,"Great to be out on your own, some flexibilty in hours but often stuck doing your job, the job of drivers and the job of merchandisers all in the same day. Made for long, strenuous days and days where you just wanted to quit and go home."
good,"Working hours were available . Paid time off was earned based on time at company. Sick days were specified and rate paid was also time at company. Salary didn't apply to all"
good,A typical day there is you come early and you leave out late. Everything is unorganized management really don't know how there business and you stand a chance of getting robbed on some of routes.
good,this job consisted of restock any merchandise that had been bought.
good,it was enjoyable to work there just not enough pay or advancment opportunity but overall it was a great experience to be working at drpepper/snapple..
good,The job required long drives to stores across each side of town (7 stores day weekly/ 12 stores on weekends. Merchandisers sometime missed stores which created more work for next person or sales rep.
good,The Dr. Pepper company was a very good company. Most workers enjoyed the benefits they had to offer and they company continued to give even when they closed. I could always depend on them to give me the hours that I needed since they gave a lot of overtime. The workers were friendly and easy to work with.
good,nothing bad to say about Dr. pepper. decent company to work for. stable income steady hours plenty of work to do.I don't know if management is still the same but a little adjusting could of been done.
good,"Though this company has a great group of people to work with, they do not staff the offices enough for the work load which tends to burn out their people."
good,Other than the twelve hour shifts it is a generally good place to work with great benefits and higher than average pay.  The people are awesome and most of management is good.
good,"Deliver product and collect money in a timely manner. Make sure that the customers are satisfy with products and service. make sure that the machines, coolers and other services that dispense on the rout are maintained and working properly. I knew how to service and troubleshoot the machines so they would not be out of service long or the tech guys wouldn't have to come out."
good,"A typical day would consist of merchandise five to six stores.  I learned how to build relationships with store managers as well as with my coworkers.  The hardest part of the job was working long weekend days, every weekend, and six days a week a lot of weeks.  The most enjoyable part was being able to work side by side with coworkers occasionally and interacting with customers."
good,"I would work 8 to 9 hours a day depending on frieght. I learned how the sales and display assemblies were created and/or accurate. Management skills was odd, but that's part of any job. The hardest part of my job was if an heavy load comes to the store to drop the frieght and the store's warehouse is junky. What I enjoyed the most was encountering new people everyday."
good,"My time at DPSG was short, and only involved one team, so I can't say for certain what the company as a whole would be like to work for. I found that, although the work/life balance and benefits package were great, the management styles of those over my team were not ideal. I felt a general distrust of employees, as though the management sometimes expected us to under perform. Although everyone over me was a great person, and seemed to want the team to succeed, they didn't always seem to know how to make that happen. We often received much needed constructive criticism when we made mistakes, but were praised for good work far less often. At times it felt like a negative environment as a result. "
good,"Great place to work, commute was a little far ( 50 minutes)"
good,"This company offers good pay and benefits, This is a union company even they are very uninvolved."
good,"As a Merchandiser, my Route Manager has recognized my hard work and rewarded me for doing so."
good,"starts by clocking in n getting to work. I learned how to become more proficient in my job duties, working for 4hours then taking lunch before the remaining 6 or more. where I would past the case count nightly finish early  daily n proceed to help wrap pallets n load/unload trucks and also the floor"
good,warehouse management is bad long hours bad pay its a good place too work if u like hard work and no family i could move up because of problems with managers
good, A typical day at work includes checking your truck count every morning before leaving the yard. Then routing out your deliveries according to time windows allowed for deliveries. I learned alot about the beverage business and how it works. I packed out alot of retailers and took some orders for salesmen.  I would say the hardest part of the job would be the weather. The most enjoyable part of the job would be working on your own and dealing with the numerous different clients.
good,A typical day consist of going into stores and putting bottles and cans of soda on the shelf. The hardest part of the job would be the constant physical activity and heavy lifting in compact areas. The most enjoyable part is that once I finish with my stores I am done for the day no clock in or clock out time.
good,You go in and get to a truck that is ready for delivery. You try to deliver on time depending on weather and traffic.
good,The workday is hectic and stressful with the managers having to be on your back all day about the amount of time it takes service a store. This job is for the young and brutally hard work.
good,Company structure is inconsistant and not very organized. Needs consistant straegies and measure of success. Company needs to develop standard practices that are consistant with competitive companies to ensure they are competitive in the market.
good,At first working there was very exciting. I got frustrated because I had to do something I wasn't willing to do and wasn't in my job description. I left because if poor management and poor teamwork.
good,"The concept of this type of work its self is just like any other job, do your job, dont leave the work for the next guy, and go home. "
good,"minimum of 8 trucks worked per 8/hr. shift   "
good,"Clock in, stretch, pull for 4 hours, take a lunch, stretch, and get back to work until it says no more work available. i've learned to share my knowledge of the job with new guys that never did that type of work before.the hardest part of the job is trying to pay your bills on time. what i love most about this job is that it doesn't take long to move up."
good,It was a good plave to work.. People was nice and grate. I with I was still there to meet the new Manger or Sperisver.. I wish them all the best of luck.
good,Overall this is a good company to work for . A lot of time and dedication is needed for food manufacturing in order to develop the product and support the customer
good,I didn't mind working here but the management doesn't hold there salesman to the standards they should. Most of y time was spent cutting product and bring it back because the orders weren't properly made by the salesmen.
good,The work life balance at DPSG is the best perk with this company.  M-F and usually home by 3 or 4.  There was some lacking in support from management at times when needing assistance on a project or issues that arose.
good,El ambiente es tranquilo solo que cuando quieres otro puesto hacen preferencias
good,"A lot is expected of their employees in a short amount of time, must work until work is completed regardless of how long it takes.  Very demanding hours."
good,"Fun workplace culture, always having events. Good place to start your career but I think people become too comfortable and accept the low compensation, at least in my dept. Can't say for others."
good,"Come into work and get pack lists to build pallets with soda. I learned why I don't like unions, you can be the worst worker in the world and still keep your job"
good,"This job offered easy work at good pay. The environment is suitable for those interested in third shift and a factory setting. The management was very good. At times, the coworkers were questionable in their nature."
good,Start day early get to your accounts handle business then leave
good,"I produced quality juice for bottling lines and case count, following a set formula."
good,Got to work at 5:00am and would bust my but trying to get done buy 3:00pm but i wouldn't get off until 9-10pm and would only get about four hrs of sleep before getting up at 3 to be at work at five.
good,"Easy to get along with, very hard worker team worker, Willing to make a change if needed."
good,"Work hard be accountable politic yourself is the key to moving up, people that’s been with company tend to have strife tell you negative stuff about departments cause they didn’t get transferred to the department stay to yourself people run their mouths to much around there it’s a lot of favoritism so be ready."
good,"Lots of outsourcing going on, great work like balance.  Was a great company to work for before they merged but since then alot of people have left the company."
good,DPSG is a good place to work. A lot of turnover. Been there a year and a half and have not been able to take a vacation. Have work Saturdays leaving only 4 days a month off.
good,"a typical job it was ok not a good balance for school i dont think it a good job for women to work "
good,workin long hours
good,"I would work for my former branch manager anywhere forever! As for our DM there, he was a dishonest, lazy person who did things he shouldn’t still be there for. Also, our vending repair man had been there 30 years and was the best! Him and My senior Branch Manager were the only reasons I staid as long as I did. If Current DM has left or been dismissed long ago things there would have worked so much smoother and I’d probably still be there."
good,A typical day involved solving issues and meeting deadlines.  There's always something to be learned if you are willing.  The management and co-workers work together to reach a common goal.  The hardest part of the job is trying to meet deadline while remaining in compliance.  The most enjoyable part of the job is that everyday brought about something different and there was never a boring moment
good,this job is no longer there. the plant closed in 2010 and moved to Victorville.  when I worked there I work 10 hours a day and sometimes 12 hours. great benefits
good,Working for Dr.pepper makes you feel like you have no time for family or any other life related activities. The pay wasn't enough and there are nights you have to work long 16 hour shifts without knowing ahead of time. The inconsistent schedule is what I dislike the most.
good,Dr. Pepper Snapple group was a awesome job due to the culture and people I worked with. Very team oriented because everyone did their part to accomplish the main goal and that was to leave on time!
good,A typical work day I delivery product to stores. I like the workplace culture. I enjoy working with people. The hardest part about the job is the physical work which I enjoy.
good,enjoyed helping customers and provided them with their favorite beverages. i learned that the customers is always right for the most part. hardest part was dealing with our manager who didn't quite know the business so they made it harder on everyone else.
good,"Very rude, unorganized, dishonest individuals they have put on their management team.. No care for their employees well being emotional or mentally.  Great benefits and good pay.. I've been laid off a total of three weeks altogether and they have employees coming to work with less seniority then me"
good,"Can have long hours in the holiday seasons, and can be hard night after night but it repays itself with the paychecks. Great for younger people up to the task."
good,":"
good,"i currently work here. im not saying any more until i dont. but i will say that they have life partner insurance coverage, which is why i took the job with them."
good,Start time for my role is 5 am but have to wake up around 3 am just incase anyone calls in. Phone rings all through out the day while you manage daily requirements and put out and fires that may occur. Emails from 5am until 11pm. Be ready to answer any and every question that may come up. Scheduled off Saturday and Sunday but now required to go out 1 Saturday a month. Must answer phone all weekend long. Vacation you will need to be able to work then too.
good,"I enjoy the workers here. Management in my opinion could use some help. They really need to implement PTO and sick days. Pay is decent, but could be better."
good,"Not a bad place to work. I enjoyed my time there as a loader and driver. Cool people work there, management is a bit too lax. Overall not a bad place to work if your not looking for much advancement."
good,"A typical work day for me is very busy, I am constantly updating the production schedule in addition to ordering raw materials."
good,They where very racist and all management cared was product getting delivered. We worked long hours and was ver dangerous.
good,"crazy long hours, unorganized , treated poorly by supervisor"
good,Just ok Not the same company as it was during the Cadbury Schweppes years.
good,"Great place to work at if your in the coffee business. The people here treat you kind , and the money is o'kay . The twelve hour shift is a bit difficult but we have to do it."
good,At times its good but more often than none its a hostile work place and no concern for the workers or there personal life poor training for new hires .
good,"it was a fast pace work environment with unstable work hours. there were no benefits with no paid vacations or any way to advance in the company, but working at Dr Pepper Snapple has thought me how to be a good sales man and deal with harsh custermers"
good,The type of work satisfies you.It allows you to deep dive into the current trends current technology.Here you grow as a technical being and expand your horizon both breadth and depthwise.
good,"This was a decent job, the managers were nice to talk to and sometimes they would actually get down and help if needed be. The job itself is straight forward but no real room for an outside life and the pay didn't make it really worth it either. People there just wanted to leave, I felt like I was just wasting my potential there."
good,"Answering the phones, taking orders over the phone and putting into the system. Finalizing invoices, filing, faxing, copying."
good,Not enough money you start out at 10 witch is not enough because the other two pop company's make much more money
good,Had a great time working there with my employess and with the rest of the team.
good,Overall Dr. Pepper was a great place to work. They worked around my school schedule and gave me as many hour as the could in the summer. I was able to work at my own pace and take time off when needed.
good,The job was fun the hours varied from morning to afternoon and evening at times. Some long weekends very little help or communication and the pay was lower than others in the field with different companies.
good,Typical days are long just depends on how smart of a worker you are.The most enjoyable part of the job would be a day off. some areas pay for the hard work you do many do not.
good,"Hard Work but comes with the job."
good,"I wish it was better on family time. They could do more to offer men some kind of time off due to a child birth. Or they could set up some kind of male maternity leave, doesn't need to be as long as a female outing. But it would be nice. Instead of being home helping and enjoying my son for a few days i was at work busting out 12, and 15 hour shifts."
good,Great for young.  Slow advancement.  Very nice people. Bed for car. Bad for home life for children. Go store to store meeting new people is a lot of fun.
good,"met new people,work was fast pace but good.management not that good. didn't see going anywhere.working for was good some of the people were fun and got along okay.I left with good record that I could rehire.but,I have to do better like working for your company."
good,"on a typical day we picked orders for customers we had to pick them wrap them and place them at the dock door to be loaded I also unloaded returning trucks, as well as worked in the repack dept."
good,12 hr shifts six to seven days a week great company to work for training and advancement could be better also learned many things during my time at the company
good,Good company to work for but stressful at times. You don't find out schedule until night before. Personal time management is a must to be ale to complete your day.
good,used to love it now I don't. people are good its the management that needs a lot of work. they don't know how to talk to the small guys they think there always right
good,"A small crew to work with but a good group of people."
good,Palletized trucks and loaded trucks. Used an electric fork lift to load the trucks. The work environment was fast-paced and included a lot of heavy lifting.
good,"I worked as a machine operator and sanitation tech; one of the positive areas are there's room to grow; if you want to learn other areas, they look inside the plant first before looking outside."
good,i had fun working here there were some eal hoy days and other real cold days. it can be difficult and stressful at times.
good,"operators of machines or not trained"
good,"Employee sales for drinks, they have free fountain machine for free sodas all day, they have refrigerators with water to drink on every line. Managements sucks. Dr pepper should be number one in the drinking business if they would aversities more"
good,loved working there great place to work I would love to work there again but haven't gotten an interview yet. not an easy place to get hired in at. still try
good,"hard labors job inside ac stores , not too bad . you will be burnt out you will be tires , pay is fast , but not so high. its better than working in the hot sun all day and getting paid 7 bux !"
good,"Limited diverse environment with no real on-boarding process for new employees.  Preaches fair treatment in the workplace, but still a clique-inspired, boys club."
good,Working 5 days a week learning about the Cold Drink business by placing Vending Machines at the locations that would grow our brands at the location.  The workplace was a good place to learn the business and grow a customer base for this position.
good,"this is a good job for starting out but not for a career. less pay, less benefits, not so good upper management, but less work. has its perks but pepsi is better."
good,"* taking care of all merchandise in warehouse and on trucks and watching all products being loaded and unloaded."
good,"Loved the company, hard work but it's fast paced, a lot of great people . Management is terrible,they play favorites here big time . Pay is good Mande good money here"
good,"Good place to work for good money, very little supervision work at own pace. Overtime available when needed. And benefits are great."
good,"The managers required us to create an environment that screams comfort, safe, healthy, and clean as soon a customer entered the door. That indirectly allows our customer's to enjoy our fabulous food and services."
good,"Not a bad place to work, Just a lot of changes without notice, Not A lot of support. Great colleague , at times a lot of fun and free"
good,Working there the benefits was great. The pay was average its just the company needs to show that they care for their employees.
good,terrible hours no time for family life. Always get asked to work weekend at the last min. there is no work life balance. the pay is excellent
good,My position was a contract position. The workload was pretty massive and the hours were long. The facilities were great and so was the pay. This is a place I would recommend anybody to work at.
good,Management training is lacking in this organization. Communication with the employees could be a little more professional
good,not A GREAT JOB WORK/life balance  is not comparable. Low pay been here for over 5yrs and don't bring home a decent amount of money working 6 days a week from 5PM-8AM and over time pay feels like yo
good,"The average day was leaving from home at 4:30 in order to be at store one by 5:15. Fill the shelves and coolers and zone what need not be filled. Then I would write a order, if it wasn't already getting a order that day. Then on to store number two of 6 and repeat the process. I was the representative of Dr Pepper in my stores. Any and all problems came to me and I handled them properly.My favorite thing about the job was the responsibility. Everything to do with my route was on me. i was selling my route after only 6 months of merchandising but never offered a sales manager position. Once I put in enough time to be considered for a promotion I gotten into a custody battle with my ex over my daughter and had to take leave the company. The biggest thing I learned from Dr. Pepper is to be flexible and adaptable"
good,Great company to wrk at but only getting 40hrs but at the same time I am definitely learning alot of new things along the way that I feel I can use in the future
good,Good place to work.friendly people but hours and weekend shifts are tough.The management is fair but since Dr.Pepper joined company benefits have declined.Overall though a good place to work.
good,"great place to work"
good,"If you are okay with hard work, I'd definitely say this job is a good fit to keep you busy and moving, especially around the busier times of the year."
good,I love the team work environment they have. I also really like the degree they have on safety for their employees. The management team will work with there employees to guide them in the right direction to improve themselves in the work place or future work place.
good,Fast paced daily duties that need to be completed no later then 3PM CDT that on some days is very hard to accomplish unless you adjust your previous days and work some sales calls ahead to make time on busy days.
good,Faced paced and competitive environment.  Great training provided.  Teamwork and communication a must.  Daily problem solving required. Good place to get great sales experience.
good,12 hour shifts get old quick every three or four day stretch. It's frustrating to see those with no work ethic promoted because of who they know. It's also hard to keep morale up when these incompetent lazy friends screw things up on the production lines and leave a bigger mess than the original issue for the other workers to clean up after them.
good,Your company is very good the warehouse management is poor it seems like nobody want to work or they don't know what they doing where house is not clean and in a lot of places very dangerous
good,"vary nice job traveling to 4 to 6 stores a day ,cheeking the stores inventory, rotating the merchandise, working with the stores management on displays."
good,"Exciting place to work. "
good,"Good place to work, good pay, fast paced and hard working job. This job has taught me responsibility, and integrity and to go out and fight as hard as you can for what you want. Nice environment for team work."
good,"A typical day at work starts off by going daily stretches, than follow up with our daily objective. I actually learned what they do. My supervisors where great"
good,"Company runs very lean. Operations are sound, but communication between ""street level"" and upper management is lacking. Good people throughout are a definite up side."
good,Arrive at 3am and work till you are done offloading all products at several locations. Have to do reloads when you arrive back after running your normal route.
good,Easy work but ridiculous management. I was a vendor stocking the shelves and constantly had store complaints because my salesman was overselling and overstocking for his commission and of corse management did nothing to correct the issue and I was left with unhappy store managers.
good,"I have been working at Dr Pepper Snapple Group full-time (More than 3 years)"
good,A lot of constant heavy lifting and pushing and pulling. Not a bad place to work for. The job itself isn't for everyone. You start early and finish the day when you are done with your route
good,"Fast pace environment"
good,A good place to work. You fight for cases everyday. You always have to stay on top of you game. you have time for your family life. My manger was great.
good,I enjoyed working here also. I did a lot of customer service and pretty much set my own hours. The only downfall was there were no benefits and it was 7 days a week.
good,"A fast paced workplace, with low employee turnover, an ever evolving product line up, and a premium placed on creativity and teamwork.The most difficult part of the job was driving 125 to 175 miles a day to service the account base. The most enjoyable part of the job was the employees I worked with and the customers I called on."
good,dr pepper is under going management shake and decided to move on and see what options I have work climate in plant is hot and list to get shift choices is long
good,you start your day off going to the warehouse  and receiving your notes for the day then go store to store to stock shelves in your own personal vehicle
good,Fun place to work if you are a direct hire. Well organized. Management could use a bit of work. The plant is always clean and smell great. Overall a good place to work
good,"Depending on department you can gain a lot of knowledge in your field. Casual dress, good benefits, 401k match etc.. Company has on site gym and Cafe."
good,All of the employees were great but like at most job Supervisor have they pick but other than that had a great time their wouldn't mind working for them again
good,Great company to work for but no help when needed. Always under staffed. Had a long career with this company but did not agree with all of their policies.
good,"it was a cool job. hard work but great pay. never with family, job is for young guys who looking to get great money. if you are in school thats going to be hard on you."
good,"Dr. Pepper Snapple Group is a very employee friendly company, that cultivates a professional atmosphere.  The company prides itself on employee development, and growth."
good,"You will learn quite a bit in this department, they embrace new tools and processes within the Category Management discipline.  However it's not unheard of people not being promoted in this department for 6-8 years.  The Directors have never left the department so it's rare to get promoted to. Director.  There is very little path for advancement in this group."
good,"It's not the most glamorus job but they promote from within and in a few years you could be a VP, hard works pays off here. The more you do the more you grow. It is a hard demanding job but it's worth it."
good,Co-workers and supervisors were nice. Great with scheduling if you take classes. Job is rather repetitive and boring but it pays decent compared to other grocery jobs.
good,"Customers to the Highest Satisfaction of our Products, Co workers all have good Environment, Safety Meetings Often....Job duties to Serve our Customers Good attitude..The Hardest Part of the Job is a lot of Heavy Lifting...."
good,"I'd go into grocery stores and sell Dr. Pepper products. I'd 1st take and inventory of the product I have, and base my new order off that. I'd get with buyers, and design displays based on what item (s) are in the ad. Then I'd have my merchandisers build the displays and fill the shelf."
good,"I've learned as being a utility you have just as much experience of a Lead. I learn to have more patients, communicate with operators on the line, Keep tabs more on what's going on far as with the syrup, Gallon count, How much raw material we have on the line for the run.. Its been a great experience learning & being in a major role."
good,"I worked at DPSG for 11 years and overall, enjoyed my time with them. The soft drink category offers multiple challenges in regards to consumer perception."
good,"Es una buena empresa para trabajar."
good,"Enjoyed talking with the clients and helping them resolve any issues that they had. Assisted many customers over the phone, many of them were so appreciative and humorous, especially when called in regards to their brewer not working properly and I resolved their dilemma quickly and simply!!"
good,I enjoyed working at Dr Pepper Snapple Group. The employees were wonderful to work with. I enjoyed the daily work challenges and had great success as an employee.
good,"Overall got 4 stars because the company seems very decent but is not perfect."
good,Great company with great benefits to work with. The district managers are great at helping if need be. I wanted to finish school and add to my family or I would still work there.
good,"This position allowed me to further develop my excel and SAP skills while learning more about the business. Management is approachable and willing to teach but limited as they are located at the headquarters in Plano, TX. Being at a branch location made the distance one of the harder parts of the job. The second difficult part of the job was limited opportunity to advance when being away from the headquarters. Overall it is a good job and one that I found enjoyable on a daily basis."
good,Delivering beverages to distribution centers around Michigan and one distribution center in Toledo Ohio .I learned about the process of the way that business worked from top to bottom. my co-workers were all nice . The hardest part of the job was not having a set start time . The most enjoyable part of the job was the time it allowed me to spend at home .
good,"I spent 15 years at Dr Pepper and enjoyed all of it. The products, people and opportunities for growth were outstanding. While bumpy at times, most leaders were truly interested in the welfare of their teams and clients. More recently, the culture has changed with increased focus on short term results at the expense of long term strategies."
good,"Besides the regular review of raw materials and production schedules, a typical workday consisted of constantly evaluating the effects of changes to our schedules and product demand. Every day there was some new issue that had to be addressed and smoothed out. It provided daily challenges that never allowed the job to become stale or boring. My co-workers were all happy and fun-loving. The environment was cheerful and encouraged creativity in problem solving. "
good,"Wake up at 430, go into work to clock in. After that I would arrive at my first store to merchandise the shelves consisting of; rotating, stocking and displaying the product that was being pitched."
good,The work was Easy and all the workers there are very friendly and very helpfull
good,"When searching for a job I look for how challenging it will be. A monotonous job can get to everyone after a while. I am an efficient worker and seek a job where there is a variety of duties and enough work to keep me busy. Doing multiple tasks and staying engaged while at work is important to me. I am more productive with a solid source of work. In the past I have been fortunate enough to have that in my current position, however as systems change so do duties. I find myself in a situation where policy and program changes to improve business practices, although are great for the company, leave me with less and less to do."
good,"Average numbers of hours worked per week:  40"
good,"I answer any phone calls that come in, cashier the deposits from the previous day. When the drivers came back at the end of the day I check them in. I have improved my customer service skills over the phone. My co-workers are great, I work mostly alone though. The hardest part of my job is probably being alone most of the day, I feel like I am a people person and love to interact with them. The most enjoyable part of my job I would have to say is my coworkers and my boss. The morale is high most days."
good,"Dr. Pepper was a good place to work, in an OK environment. It could have been a great place to work with more experienced supervisors."
good,"I love working, in all weather, delivering to all stores.in all new locations."
good,Employee experience varies by department.  Relatively flat organization (not too many opportunities to move or advance).
good,Great team players. Fun and productive worker. Usually build pallets everyday. I have learned that team work can make a huge difference. My coworker where friendly and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was working in areas with heat but water helped out by drinking it keeping me hydrated.
good,DPSG was a great company to work for! Great Culture/Great people but when business is bad cuts will happen.
good,Going through change but a good place.  Work/ life can be a bit of a challenge but I enjoyed my time there.
good,"10-12 hours days"
good,Dynamic individual who works well cross-functionally and leads licensing activities for the DPSG brands.
good,"Look out for back stabbers, and people trying to set you up.Overall it was OK some room for advancement."
good,"It was a fairly simple and easy job, however the management team is a joke."
good,My typical day at Dr. Pepper was very smooth sailing because i was good at driving the forklifts & picking. I learned very quickly that the harder you work the more respect your managers had for you and also my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was definitely the overtime and the most enjoyable part was getting my check. :)
good,"Travel to several stores and stock the shelves for 7up products. The hardest part were the super-saver sales for 6-packs: buy 3, get 4 free. Most enjoyable were the other workers."
good,Relaxed office environment. Friendly co-workers. Friendly customers. Challenging work
good,Interesting job that requires extensive time from an individual. Great interaction with employees.
good,"I Learned the job fast and was later training the new employees. Some of the co workers will try to leave you hanging with their work, but being a good employee, I never complained."
good,"Company does have great benefits and lot of online resources. People are generally easy to work with as long as you respect and give them their space. The hardest part has been since the merger between Keurig and Dr Pepper. The downsizing in office staff has the remaining personnel keep expecting additional tasks, to their already heavy load. Although corporate has been working on implementing new ways and tools to sustain proactivity. Having too many turn arounds with management, has not helped and left some department heads with the lack of understanding company procedures, therefore unable to properly train, motivate or connect with it's employees. But overall it had been a good company to work with."
good,as long as the machines were running the boss was good and away but if the machine went down another story the co workers were great and from all walks of life
good,"I have worked for KDP for 8 years.  During that time there have been several significant changes.  Enough where I would say I have actually worked for at least three different companies during my time here.  Leadership has changed over often, there seems to be significant movement within the workforce."
good,"kool people, relatively easy work."
good,Lot of hard work and sometimes it feels like the stores we service treat us with very little respect and for the money we get paid it's not enough for us to be degraded or talked down to. But I can't complain they give me great benefits and great pay and at least 40 hours as they brought me on full time! Coming up on 5 years here and have advanced to a few different promotions/positions
good,Was A good job with benefits after 90 days the assignments are dispatched every day and the stores are regular routes. good training and good relaxed atmosphere.
good,Great place.  Keurig merger causing layoffs. Hopefully transition will end up being good for the long term health of the company. Porbably needed a shake up in an older industry.
good,"Its a great place to start a career with great benefits, but the pay could be improved. Workdays go by quickly as you are constantly doing something, but their is so much to do that you will often end up working late. After the merger, many people were laid off with cheap replacements brought in, so it's good to get in and get your experience and get out."
good,"Wages are good, benefits are alright. It seems difficult to advance within the company unless you have contacts within the department for which you are applying."
good,Its a good starting place but very fast paced and not great compensation for the cost of living in the area.Also work hours are not the best for a person with a family because they vary.
good,Free coffee. Was very exciting place in the beginning but has became so much different. Very long work hours. Standing all of shift except breaks. Cultural has changed.
good,the typical day here is very high pace and not for the week of mind or body. if you don't have it in you you will fail. I would advice all millinials to stay away. This job is just to much for you.
good,"The benefits are great. It is a good company to get into and advance your career. Most warehouse positions have open end times, so work/life balance is hard. There are standards that must be met, but as long as you do it, the job can be a enjoyable."
good,"Great place with great people. They have diversified products and are growing year over year. However, there's a high turnover rate probably due to the long hours."
good,"Good benefits, company car and lot of extra way to make extra money from sales goaled. Work isn't hard on your body as a sales manager, the  customer become close to you."
good,"It is a great job for motivated people, you stock shelves in your area don't get much help but the hours are good. Problems are I don't think there's raises our even job reviews once you start no matter how long you work for them kind of sad."
good,"stack shells onto pallets and shrink wrap them, repack pops, janitorial work, management and workplace great and a pretty easy job and straight forward."
good,stocking shelves rotate product  filling coolers management cool working in the stores one of the hardest part working deliverys enjoyable parts were union picnics
good,PLace hads great advancement opertounites.. mangament dont treat u fairly and place favorites dont fix problems cause they say its not in the budget when is unsafe if not fixed
good,"Es buena, pero no esta equilibrado la relaciona resultado- ingresos"
good,"Not a terrible place to work, but needs work with management.  Very little training to employees.  Doesn't give employees enough information to perform tasks."
good,"A very simple job, a bit physical.  Management and coworkers are very friendly and polite. Some of the individual store managers can "
good,"Typical juice plant environment Typical day is full of meetings"
good,found out what you running for today and how many of it the team of people are very great people anyways come to work whit a smile on there faces which.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Dr. Pepper, I would still be working there if they had a location in AZ. The hardest part are the hours that I was required to work."
good,"I enjoyed working there for a summer as a seasonal position.  It was your average production job, very routine with metrics-based performance measures."
good,"enjoyed going to different places and meeting people."
good,"My day at Dr. Pepper consisted of meeting with key decision to discuss ways to drive sales with our brands. I learned significant organizational skills which have carried over into my current career. I worked closely with management to increase brand visibility and product execution. Management provided good leadership and an open line of communication. Team work was a central part of co-worker relationships. Our success was contingent upon everyone executing at top capacity. I managed the merchandising function of my territory. We built strong bonds as a group and enjoyed great success. Career advancement was a challenge for highly motivated employees. However, I truly enjoyed the client/customer relationships that I built during my tenure at Dr. Pepper."
good,"Fast paced environment, must be able to multi task.  Management is somewhat supportive, great peers to work with."
good,"DPSG was not a bad place to work. The compensation was competitive, the benefits were good and the company culture was welcoming to all its employees. Management was competent and the company made a real effort to adapt to industry changes in a reasonable time frame. the bottom line is that I would work for DPSG again in the future."
good,"Provided support to management and hourly workers.  Interacted with outside contractors, vendors and regulatory agencies on the company's behalf.  Provided safety training, chaired safety committee, prepared for internal and external audits.  Maintained documentation on permits and licenses.  Responded to requests from utility providers and maintained records on key business indicators.  Generated reports for internal and external use."
good,Work so much its hard to balance family life. The company has an open door policy but never wants to answer any of the questions or conserns you might have.
good,"great company long hours during the summer , must be ready for heat in the warehouse"
good,"Interesting place to work. I ran various production machines, forklifts and pallet jacks.Good management with hard working employes.The hardest part of the job was quality control issues with raw materials. The most enjoyable part of the job was working in various job fuctions."
good,audit the drivers paperwork for accuracy and fraud
good,"I enjoyed this job to the fullest. It was very hard and continuous work. I drove Forklift and took on a very important part of delivering product to the customers. I learned the importance of team work and really loved my co-workers. Although I was only there a short time we were like family there. The hardest part of the job was the long hours, but the most enjoyable part was the relationship with my co-workers."
good,Typical day at work was sort of quiet and didn't involve your direct superiors for the most part. The upper management could learn better communication but overall not bad.
good,"Due to the nature of the food and beverage business, a typical work-day lasted anywhere from 12-15 hours, lasting between 5 and 7 days per week."
good,This was my first company in the EHS field. I had a great time with my coworkers as part of a start up facility. The actual business did not take off and we closed the plant.
good,Has its ups and downs but you can come to work and just do your job. Your not micromanaged and their are opportunities for overtime. Most of the employees are friendly and the job offers training and full benifits.
good,"Dr.Pepper was a great pace to work when I was younger, it offers you a chance to travel for work daily. The perk of working for them was the insurance where they paid for everything."
good,"A large corporation has very specific separation of duties, which means that there are a multitude of ways that you can fit into the puzzle.  Most managers are very relaxed if you stay on top of your job but there are the one offs that are very focused & micro manage.  Stable work environment until the mergers came through and then hundreds of people from all over the country were laid off over a couple of months."
good,Fast pace love the environment and no one harassing you to work paid every week and management work together and as a team and very family orientated and flexible
good,this is a great place to work and push yourself to the next level of your career through hands on work. there isn't much room for outside schooling and hardly and in house.
good,"The crew at the place was great, the work is fair and getting home everyday is great.  But the amount of work and the pay just dont add up.  If your looking to start somewhere in the beverage delivery culture this is the place."
good,the production and maintenance crews is what kept this company going. the upper management had issue's. all around I really liked working there and hated to leave but my family comes before anything.
good,"Dr Pepper was a fun place to work. Most of the employees care about their responsibilities and adhered to them."
good,Sales are never ever good enough. Every year I was there they wanted to give more responsibilities and take away more pay or salary. They wanted you to work sixty plus hours a week.
good,"I loved working with the people at Dr. Pepper! Once the new plant manager arrived, my position was terminated and was treated as such. They slowly took away opportunities, and responsibilities without which was frustrating until the day they broke the new that my position was terminated which was right before the holidays."
good,"Good people that you work with. Lack of structure as far as management is concerned. Under paid as far as the other drink company's  are concerned.  Pepsi, coke ."
good,Very fast paced work environment.   Good benefits but not s lot of flexibility due to nature of beverage business.  Could be more supportive of female advancement in the organization.
good,Wouldn’t pursue a career here. The only problem is mainly the employees. When one employee doesn’t do their job it leave you double the amount of work on you.
good,"In worked off and on for DPSG for 38 years.  I'm not sure why I was laid off, considering my area consistently led the country in  overall production."
good,Enjoyed the work. Lots of interaction with leaders. Great learning opportunities. Super brands to sell. Marketing programs were exciting to activate and manage.
good,"great place to work and move up the company, always looking to work with to find good managers. company always on top of new ideas, Regional Manager very nice to work with."
good,"I learned the most about being a Category Manager at DPSG.  However, when the Directors are in their role for 10+ years, there's no way to be promoted.  That's how they lost good people over the years."
good,"A good place to work. advancement opportunities. Good,stable and cooperative management. Most employees got along very well, especially merchandising and distribution. The best thing about the branch I worked at was that all departments got along and worked well together."
good,"I had an amazing manger that taught me so much in marketing, sponsorships and leadership.  "
good,Your immediate manager can make or break your experience here. I've had both at Dr Pepper. The company is very focused on results so bad managers can linger if getting the job done.
good,"A typical day as a Merchandising Manager consist of ensuring your employees are up and running by our start time. If they have not yet clocked in by that time, you do need to start reaching out to your employees to ensure they are coming in to work and add attendance points as needed for anything over 5 minutes late. After ensuring your crew is up and running , you will need to prioritize your day based on customer needs and wants, and take care of any paper work that may need to be done as well. Upper management does give you the ability to be very versatile and independent in your days planning(not micro-managed). The hardest part of the job is trying to juggle a healthy work/life balance due to the overwhelming demand of the job in its self due to the fact there is only one Merchandising Manager, so on your off days your essentially still working so that you can make sure everything continues to run smoothly,this is not mandatory, however the other managers have their own department to run as well. A more competitive pay for this position would also help tremendously. The most enjoyable part of the position is the flexibility and independence to run your department and be responsible for everything. I take great pride in my ownership of my department and enjoy seeing employees love their work environment. Knowing I make a difference in a customer and employees daily life is what makes the job worth while."
good,Advancement for in-house employees is something that Dr. Pepper believes in. The production plant is very fast paced but always had a clear view of goals to be obtained in production and maintenance.
good,"Typical day starts at 3 P.M. and usually ends by 11:30- 12:00 P.M.."
good,"Great management, some good salesman, work on your own most of the time.  Displays for store fronts can be rough, always work weekends unless on vacation."
good,I was full time working 40hrs a week. The benefits there are outstanding. The security is great. The advancement there is not going to happen unless you are the best. My manager was happy if you showed up and gave 90%. They worked well with my college schedule.
good,I think the management need to interact more with the workers they barely come on the floor to motivate the workers and the supervisor need to be more a team leader not a friend.
good,like working there with a lot of good people in all areas of the warehouse the loaders do a great job of putting the correct product in the bays and informative with out of stock and  special  promotions.
good,"Life and work is what you make it.  We do what we have to do, in order to do what we want to do.  Not every place of employment is well suited  for everyone.  People are spoiled and have an overwhelming sense of entitlement in this great country of ours. Yes, it's true that in order to get along, you have to go along.  Sometimes that means going a long way to find peace where your feet are planted.  I have worked all my life and discovered we all pick our own poison.  Complaining only makes people feel negatively towards you, no matter what we chose to do for a living. One piece of advice I always give is this.  If you hate what you're doing so much, you are in control of your own destiny.  If all you do is complain, nothing changes.  Either be the change and make things better for yourself, or find a greener pasture in which to graze.  No one but you is holding you back."
good,"Great staff, fun place, flexible with time off. A great place to work but I feel held back.Lots of training to see what other positions would be like but they don't allow me to advance."
good,"Great job, was able to learn many things each and every day. The only problem was the pay. They did not pay overtime and I was forced to work 60 hrs. a week."
good,good guys I work with at 7-Up I enjoyed all the people at the stores on my route it was great experience I gained so much experience from this job it's almost unbelievable
good,"Es una compañía enfocada a resultados que maneja diferentes modelos de distribución que le han permitido posicionarse como una de las 3 refresqueras mas importantes del país, ganando participación de mercado de manera constante y consistente a través de la innovación."
good,Analyzed data from Dr.Pepper's client's invoice and performed audit based on the information. I do a lo of research on why the invoice has a certain amount or check why any amount is missing from the invoice.
good,"Good, friendly work environment with hours varying day to day depending on workload. Great for rookie drivers just starting. You work at your own pace, for the most part, very straight forward in operations with a few kinks as far as organization but that's everywhere. Must be in good shape due to a lot of moving during the shift but if you're tough enough, overall good place to work."
good,"A home away from home. Good compensation, clear business ethics, ACTION at its best. I loved working here, the people are great."
good,load and unload trucks restock the pick lines while order selectors pull product. cut and remove shrink wrap from product. Place incoming product in correct area in back stock. Make room for any incoming product when needed.
good,"a typical day at work consists of ensuring all product on your truck gets delivered in a timely manner, merchandise product, collect/count all cash/checks, give proper receipts. I learned how to properly distribute/merchandise product. The supervisors are helpful. The co-workers are great. The hardest part of the job was working in extreme weather conditions. The most enjoyable part of the job was establishing good working relationships with the customers."
good,"I have to say overall, it is a pretty decent place to work with good pay. Considering the rest of the job market in this field of work."
good,"Being a merchandiser for a pop company isn't the most glorious job in the world, but for a college kid trying to pay his way through school this job fit me well.  I started work usually at 6am every work day.  From there I went to various stores that were assigned to me based on the route I was put on.  A usual day consisted of me going from store to store, taking pop from the back stock areas of these stores and using that to stock both the Dr. Pepper pop shelf and various displays throughout the store.  Almost every shift I am completely by myself which means you need to be very independent and reliable in order to do this job effectively.  I feel like the most enjoyable part of this job is the freedom you have to work at your own pace and interact with various customers and other vendors.  I would say the hardest part about this job would be having to clean up various messes left from other employees the day before. If others don't do their jobs then you need to do you job, plus pick up the slack from the day before."
good,Sort online store orders for customers to be shipped. Managment wasnt good at all rude
good,Other than the starting pay this job is great. Management really tries to work with you and they definitely understand if there is issues and do their best to help resolve them with you the best that they can.
good,"A good place to work at to make overtime."
good,Working At Dr Pepper Snapple Group Was A Decent Experience. Management Was A Little Strict But Not Much Of A Complaint.
good,"Fast paced , great products, early start tines on the go for 8 to 10 hours per day."
good,"The first seven years I worked at Pepper it was great, actually it didn't even feel like work even though we worked twelve hours a day.  Lots of good people to make the day go by faster.  The work was fast paced and busy all the time so that helped too.  The last three years I began to tire of it though and felt I needed a change, maybe for the benefit of both sides they went ahead a made the decision for me."
good,"Great brands and new company culture."
good,"Early Start, Physically Demanding, Lots of Driving, Must be able to read maps, plan routes, good customer service skills needed, very little contact with co-workers."
good,"Fast passed work environment, good and hard working co-workers."
good,"I haven't had this much fun at an office ever."
good,Traveling around from store to store and stocking our products. I'm not too fond of my co workers tho.
good,"learned more on the procduct that dr pepper owns besides soda, learned how to push through long hours of work, met great people who dont mind guiding you through the day"
good,Mostly the work day was a 10 to 13 hour day. This experience help me to understand that your day is not over until the job is done. I also learn to deal with many different attitudes from people I managed. The hardest part of my job was the heat I had to deal with in the summer time. 100 Degree temp in a warehouse without any air. The most enjoyable part of my job was my co workers and going home at the end of a day knowing I had done what I was suppose to do
good,I love my customer and Sales guy but management is a different story.  My customer is difficult but presents a challenge where I have seen many opportunities for growth and improvement. The relationships and trust I have built with my customer are amazing and couldn't imagine not having that type of relationship with anyone else. I have learned so much from my job and that some times not all the passion in the world can change things. Just do your job and do it well. 
good,"Operational Excellence Management & Continuous Improvement Professional.

good,"I like my job, sometimes the sales team can be a pain to work with, but overall the job itself is very easy."
good,It was a fun loving and flat work culture. The company offered so many perks so that you can enjoy everyday at work. I enjoyed visiting manufacturing plants.
good,"n/a            Never worked for Keurig-Dr-Pepper-Inc.  "
good,I was a relief driver when you knew the route you were running that day it would be an easier day. If you didn't your day could get stressful i.e. not knowing where to park at stores or their check in process every store is different. When you didn't have an assigned route for the day you would help out other drivers on ther route which ich made for an easy day. Supervisors  are really good guys sad I had to leave the job cool co-workers
good,trained me on how to use a pallet jack as well as driving a forklift.its a job that tests you physically which is something that i liked.if u hustled n make a your pulls in a certain timely paced youll get a $25 bonus end of the day.
good,"Great employer to work for, competitive pay and good hours. Good place to learn a new skill and put that skill to use in the real world. The job is fast paced so you stay busy which is a plus"
good,"The health insurance alone is a great reason to work here. My immediate boss is one of the best that I've had. It's not all roses, but it's a decent income"
good,Great place to work. I have a great relationship with my biss.. although maintenance issues plague us from time to tone. Would love to have a job closer to home it is a rough commute to and from home for a family man.
good,"It was a great company to work for. I’m just looking to grow more! I recommend to anyone, comes with great benefits fair work environment. Good supervisors."
good,"Great place to work for entry level, opportunity for advancement was slow when I worked there, but overall great opportunity for self development and growth. Compensation was good match for expected work performed."
good,Keurip Dr. Pepper INC was a positive work experience and offered a flexible schedule to it's employees. They have great managers and a great sales team.
good,"KDP is a dynamic company with a lot of opportunity for advancement and cross training. Deadlines and budgets are well defined, but priorities can shift. One must be flexible to succeed, but management is good about coaching and mentoring."
good,Great place to work. You are on t he go from time the time you punch in to the time you punch out. I have created a pretty big tool box for warehouse performance.
good,"DPSU, went from a regional family bottler, to ultimately merging with national brands over the years, remains to market many well-known beverages and strengthen their position with each merger. It was a great experience working there, but I'm sure, became tougher as consumers began to turn to healthier options."
good,Show up 1st store overview what was sold and get a mental image of what might be needed filled 1st. Check what u have to work with in the back room. Organize a cart of product to fill shelves and rotate and fill shelves. Move on to next store.
good,"Structured work environment,  quarterly quotas had to be meet, had to come under payroll monthly, had to train merchandisers as well as salesman. There was pppottunity to receive bonuses if we hit are  quarterly goals"
good,"loved my experiences with the company, even though it was short lived. The diverse and supportive culture was a plus for me. Overall DPSG is a terrific company to work for."
good,"Room to grow your territory. health benefits are excellent. time off policy is inconsistent and managed poorly. Break downs in infrastructure and communication is poor between departments. since recent acquisition processes are even more chaotic. too many chiefs and not enough Indians to help in the field. lots of finger pointing without resolving core issues. "
good,"You start at the first store on your route no later than 6 a.m. You do not get compensated for the mileage from your home to that store, whether it is 2 miles away for 50. You drive your own vehicle and are compensated .40 a mile. You are allowed 2 breaks a 30 minute lunch break and a 15 minute rest break. However you are not paid for this, so it is taken out of your day. You get paid $100 daily at 8 hours when you first start. You can not work less than that even if you are finished with your day. The overtime is only $5 something an hour which is awful when you end up working past 8 hours a day. Other than the pay and putting no less than 40 miles on your vehicle a day it is a decent place to work."
good,good company to work for. only bad thing I can say about it is or at least for the position I held was there was almost never any mover time. and because it was a union the pay was lower than the average market. my salary was the only reason I left the company and if the managers had any controls over that to give me a raise I would still be working at this place.
good,"The company is a #3 player in the market and allows them to do some things that their competition cannot.  They have the portfolio and the ability to be a very strong player in the market and very competitive.  Like any other beverage company, they struggle with goals that are not very realistic on growth which leads to management change"
good,Work days were pretty consistent. Great group of co workers. Drivers were great. Work environment was clean and equipment was in good condition.. New trucks and on site mechanics
good,"Group is okay to work for.  Great benefits and good pay. Very slow paced and minimum effort to do the job.  Long hours.  Work weekends. Has a no fault attendance policy, even with hospitalization."
good,"The job was fun at times due to the fact that it was fast paced. Although, the working conditions were not very good in an old and outdated building with very little space."
good,"Pros"
good,"Good job but gets repetitive after so long. Rite now, is the worse time to join the company due to the cook county beverage tax. Toni Priwkwinkle has ruined the soda industry."
good,"I really enjoyed my time working at DPSG. At times though I found it to be not as rewarding as I would've hoped it to be. You quickly learn who among your coworkers can be trusted to follow through on the job and those who you will constantly be cleaning up after. That, to me, was by far the most frustrating part of the job. Otherwise, I found the job quite enjoyable. I liked the management, the sales staff, the job itself, and the workplace culture that was built."
good,Well Good Honstly I feel like there are other things that can be  accomplish .! I wanted to learn more about the job but it's really as simple as it gets.
good,The culture is wonderful and the in-office perks are cool. The culture is wonderful and management wants to help their teams succeed.  Employees are willing to help and extend their expertise.
good,"a typical day at work consist of great hours and fast paste work."
good,I enjoyed all the people that I worked with.  Some days were long but the other days made up for it.  Only reason that I left was to try and advance my career.
good,"Job security but requires a lot of driving to different cities. Early and late days which are never consistent. Also, you have to work holidays."
good,For my position a typical work week consist of 65 hours per week. I learned many new skills over many years. My co-workers were great people. Most enjoyable part was meeting new people and new customers.
good,"A typical day at work for me was, I got my hand held computer. The next step punch in my personal codes.  The accounts would be loaded on the hand held, so than I had to make sure all the product that I needed was loaded correctly on my truck. Afterwards time for delivering, and satisfying the customers."
good,"The job is not that hard but it is physical and there is really no balance between a personal life and work.  A typical day consists of driving to your first store running the backstock on days there isn't an order, and running the order on order days then condensing and maintaining your area in the backroom. You rarely see your co-workers unless there is a meeting.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working by yourself."
good,they never had enough help and the pay sucked but the benefit package was real good filled all my needs .they where just the red headed step child down here in florida dont know if its mangement fault or the company hard to explain.
good,"Posted invoices using 3-way match, verified vendor data, corrected payment and discount terms utilizing SAP."
good,Great employment Good opportunities to move up in the company The hours are good also the people are friendly The most enjoyable part of my job is that you know you have a well done job and satisfied a lot of customers
good,Solid pay with a pretty good management system. Must work weekends and all holidays so it may be a hard job to hold while maintaining a solid family relationship.
good,Great company to work for. Overall good work environment and promotes from within. Well structured management team. Benefits package is pretty good.
good,learned alot  always worked over 40 hours love riding with different employess. Supervisors helpful at times willing to work with you
good,"I really liked this job, you have all the benefits you need, they treat you very well, they do monthly meetings and they do hear you on your needs. They take care of you like every two months they check your hearing and vision,"
good,Typical day at 7up consist of going to my assigned stores for that day and interacting with key personnel for my accounts. Rotating product and providing point of sale merchandise. I get along with all my co workers. Dr Pepper Snapple Group is a great company to work for.
good,"This company is always exciting to work for, never the same day in and day out. Always updating to improve the working environment."
good,"NOT a good work/life balance, lack of communication, room to move up , good benefits great vacation package, free attire and beverages"
good,I really enjoyed my time with this company.  I was only there contract and when they re-organized our department they let the contract employees go.  I would have loved to stay.  High turn over rate with Temp or Contract employees.
good,"A typical work day would include loading and unloading trucks with your forklift, doing all your work on a computerized system, some cleaning and some inventory work in a fast paced environment."
good,"This place is for serious hard-working people who seek production work as a habit! You are given paperwork with the location and code of the cases which have to be put on the pallet. You are assigned an electric pallet jack for you to use until the end of the shift. You have to pack a total of 1700 cases in an 8-hours performance. If you happen to do over the estimated, you will get bonus pay (which only few could make it)."
good,"Good pay, good management and enjoyed going to work. I would recommend anyone to be employed with DPSG"
good,Great group of people to work with. I learned different postions within the company through cross training. I was able to make changes in my career by applying for postions outside my major and having the oppurtunity to learn them through some on the job training.
good,Starting off an average day would be a meeting with the team leader organizing smaller team to operate machinary such as coating and molding machines. There was really no hard prt of the day besides cleaning staying busy until it was time too go home. The best part of the day was lunch at the wagon food truck talking and meeting the people u work with.
good,"I enjoy working for Dr. Pepper but the hiring process is slow, which is a hassle when the pay is as meager as it is. Management changes have affected how workers veiw this plant negatively. The management team has major flaws, such as connecting with their employees and cooperationg to solve problems."
good,Extremely great opportunity and work environment. My co-workers were friendly and management was good
good,we would start our day in the office with the manager and await our pick sheets for the day. after we would get out forklift riders and start the loads. the hardest part was working in the heat of the summer. best part of the job were the pop sales we were able to buy from.
good,"Work entails leveraging insights to build marketing strategies and develop targeted programs to drive volume and profit. Management and co-workers are good people and like to have fun. The work pace is fast and can be last minute, with multiple fire drills. One must be able to adjust to the changing business needs. I really enjoyed working with my friends."
good,"I enjoyed my time working for them, wanted to work there for"
good,If you are in need of a job that pays according to your efforts think of order picker second shift that earn you a open check to be filled by you according to your hard work
good,"good work place , all co- workers are very supportive, learn more new things at work place . "
good,New repeats the  mistakes of the previous managers - very sad. Do not listen when someone tries to mentioned that this was already checked and does not work...
good,"Good working environment  but long hours plus weekends."
good,It was a great place to work. Highly collaborative working in a cross functional team environment. The pay and benefits was excellent. The only I hate was that I got laid off when the company restructured to from GMCR to KDP.
good,"My time at KDP was definitely beneficial to me in the work/sales force, it gave me a better understanding on how the marketing world is and how I had to promote my company to sale in display to compete against the other big brands like Coke, and Pepsi."
good,"A Typical day at work is answering calls, providing guest with keurig information, placing orders or troubleshooting keurig brewers. I learned how to use empathy and customer care with the guest. The managers were awesome, they coach you on calls to provide the guest with the best solutions. The workplace was also enjoyable, we always had some sort of challenge or competition throughout our section. The hardest part is handling back to back calls or if the system needs to be reset because we documented everything on the computer through a program. The enjoyable part is during the pizza parties we occasionally had or when we were asked to log out for training."
good,I worked has team no matter who/why we all helped out till the job was completed! The manager was helpful and always pitch in to get the job done. We received 5 personal days!!
good,relaxed place to work good hours fun place caring mangers family oriented if you have a opportunity to get in this company i will say take it and dont let it go to wast
good,Productive and fun workplace nice break room. Great benefits and productivity competitions with awesome prizes. Team members ate good to work with and management is cool.
good,"It's a nice place to start a career, i love working environment and the way people work with a minimum supervision, a team work culture from the staff"
good,If you can get hired at the right place it’s good. They do well with sick time also they do give you floating holidays. My advice try to start off in production
good,Great company overall. Currently undergoing acquisition and merger from Keurig which may cause various departments to be eliminated. Great company to work for despite current situation.
good,This company pays well for the area and offers good benefits.  It's quick paced and they offer vacation and time off.  It was a good fit for my family while I was employed.
good,A good company that allows you to have an at home life. balanced hours and only five days a week. tough days followed by easy days I would recommend it for someone not looking for a lot of money but a good job
good,"If you are looking for something to do, this place is great. It really depend on the team and shift you work on. i have worked at different departments, differents shifts, many supervisors and leads."
good,Dr. Pepper/Snapple is a good place to work.  Employees are well taken care of.  A lot of hours and work is very stressful.  Management is good to work with.
good,"It was absolutely awesome place to work before company was sold to Doctor Pepper. Everyone was passionate about Bai culture, product and style of work. Use to be a perfect place to work."
good,Loved working here as the environment was great and everybody was a team player. Management was great and had opportunities to advance. Was only there a year and they was offered a promotion to be a branch manager but was unable to accept due to moving.
good,"Dr Pepper 7up is not a job for lazy duds. You have to work hard, but the rewards can be big.  Perform, and you'll be promoted. Lots of freedom to do your work. Management is weak, but do your work and they stay out of your way. Benefits are best in class. If you're willing to work hard, this is a great job."
good,"My experience working here was positive and negative.  However, I was informed from a coworker that still works there that the specific issues I personally had have been taken care of"
good,Good company. Like many companies there are challenges and wins. DPSG is well diverse and have all walks of life. This is a corporate office so it is fast pace.
good,Not a bad job keeps you in shape fast pace keeps you focused some days better than others but that's like any job but overall not to bad place to work for.
good,kept the bottling lines moving and maintained all equipment.did change over on components and sizes of bottles and cans to the palletizer and forklifts
good,"Was a great job... The Sales Operations department created efficiency and bottom line dollar savings that were never seen before."
good,"My review is that Dr. Pepper route is a great, and exciting environment to work in. Each merchandiser has their own route to perfect in their own way."
good,pays good for the area. not much diversity. can advance in company. can go as far as the good old boys let you. the more butt you bite the further you go. but that's anywhere.
good,"You work by yourself. You respond to your manager and they will call you if they have any questions. You drive your own vehicle and get mileage remburstment. Can be very stressful at times, but you also don't have anyone breathing down your neck since you work solo."
good,"My day consist of entering in several payments and saving them for the auditors to process for payments. Since being at the job I have learned more about deductions, credits, debits, and balances. Management can be improved, but for the most part it is efficient. My co-workers are pleasant to be around and we work as a team. I would say the hardest part of the job is being tasked to do a last minute project as it can take some time and slow down my usual process. My most enjoyable experience at the job is conversing with the different salespeople and vendors and as a result building relations."
good,"Good company my co-worker was great my manager was a little stress,The hardest days was loads days and i learned a lot about the company."
good,"This job was very enjoyable. It takes a bit of self-motivation because a boss is not constantly over your shoulder. A typical day at work included stocking shelves, breaking down pallets, and building displays for grocery stores."
good,"A typical day at DPSG consists of processing free cases, answering calls from our diverse customer base. Plenty of interaction with district managers and allied brand managers. Easy going environment, there's no manager constantly over your shoulder. There are plenty of ""back in the day"" stories which are always interesting and funny. The hardest part of the job is standing at the copier for about an hour, making the numerous copies of invoices that we need to keep on hand. Other than that it is a very relaxed and smooth environment."
good,"Dr Pepper is a wonderful company to work for. "
good,"Great place to work, competitive work industry with enormous potential. Keeps pace with the leading competitors with a generous pay scale."
good,"every day I have a great day, learning and enjoy very thing."
good,"Everyone there is beyond friendly! I honestly can't say there was a single person in the entire building who didn't greet me and smile on a daily basis. I never heard anyone sound the slightest bit disgruntled. They're very serious about their brand, so on your interview DON'T BRING ANYTHING THAT EVEN MIGHT BE A COMPETITORS PRODUCT. Yes, that includes water."
good,A typical day would be coming to work we will get our headsets and start pulling drink orders to be loaded on the pallet in to a ruck wrapped. Management is nice very understanding and helpful. I would say the hardest part of my job would be talking on the head set for 14+ hours some days its like talking to the operator where she do not understand you most enjoyable I would say my co workers
good,work with your salesman to keep your designated stores stocked and up to standards
good,I enjoy working for this company.I have learned alot with the new system that was implemented.I enjoy working independently and with others.
good,"Go to the production office to get a line production schdule. Find my fork lift. Go to the warehouse to find all the raw materials for the daily run. For the line that I,m schduled on.Go to the recycle garbage area to get all of the required bins and barrels for all the machines on the line. Than I go to each of the 4 machines on the line. I start each machines and trouble shoot any problems before the machine operators start. The hardest part of the job was learning so many different jobs. And the most enjoyable part of the job was learning so many different jobs. I learned alot at this job! What ever you wanted to learn they would teach you. A single, double forklift, scrubber, cherry picker. Also all of the 5 computerized machines on the lines. I also learned to run bag in the box. A new process to package pop."
good,"Lots of temp work. Used to me a company one could build a career at but that is no longer the case. Good benefits and work environment, safe, but no longer a company one can build any security with."
good,The company was very good. Had a great benefits grade hours. But the bad part was that. They drop everybody's pay rate and moved it to production $0.10 a case.
good,They are a good company with a many good people. Benefits used to be better but at least they offer them. Good pay and it's nice to only work half the month.
good,This was probably one of my most satisfying work experiences with over 25 years in IT.  The atmosphere was laid back but purposeful.  The people were friendly and management respectful and helpful giving me the tools I needed to be effective.
good,A typical work day can be tough but is done with great reward. My career was filled with great people and a lot of accomplishments. Would not change a thing.
good,You can earn a great living as well as have a personal life. You will need to be flexible with your time and be willing to work some nights and weekends as needed but rewarding vacation and personal time
good,I really enjoyed working at Dr Pepper. The people were really nice and offered to always help an any way. I was very disappointed when we learned of the outsourcing.
good,"A typical day started by seeing some members of the sales force as they met with their respective team members discussing business needs / opportunities."
good,"I loved my job there , and I would to work for the company in the future.They train to work , the rest is up to you.You gave let the opportunities work for you ,and take full advantage."
good,Always on time  get alone with others and finish your task once started my view is to stay focused on the job to meet all requirements thats needed having a good day at work
good,Keurig Dr Pepper was great to me as an employee and has room for advancement along all positions within the company.  Job made me feel very stable and helped me further my career and knowledge.
good,"Co workers were friendly and management easy to approach"
good,Everyone there is totally chill and as lon as you hit your numbers it’s a good place to work. Not much room for vertical advancement it’s mostly horizontal.
good,Great job to work at. everyone you work with is laid back and very easy to get along with. for the most part of the daily job it can get a little fast paced and on occasion you may have to work extra based  on sale and needs of the company.
good,"A typical days consisted of a route with 5 to 8 stops where you check your shelves, locate the area in the back room where your product is and fill a cart to take to the sales floor to fill the shelf."
good,"Union warehouse, hours are long but the pay is great. Management looks to take care of the employees but are limited by the Union Agreement. Will give you every opportunity to advance if you put in the effort."
good,Great job for those who are looking for this line of work. my job was solo going to clients/stores to get inventory and produce an order for delivery.
good,"A typical workday would consist of visiting six to seven accounts a day. I would meet with my merchandisers, take inventory of the stock levels in the accounts and place orders for the stores. I would meet with key decision makers to discuss merchandising opportunities."
good,"The kind of day you will have essentially depends on the time of year. Summer and Christmas are stressful due to high demand, but other than that your day to day work is fairly smooth. I learned how to handle this stress and realize that all I can do is the best job I can for today. Management was fair, at times they will act more like bosses rather than leaders but when the busy season starts up again they are out working as hard as we are, earning the respect of those under them. The culture, at least in my region, was poor. It seemed to be every man for himself and no consideration for who has to do that store tomorrow. This type of work requires everyone to communicate and cooperate, but that was never there at my time there. The hardest part of the job was having to realize that you had to start at 6 am, and would work until 7 or 8 pm every day. The most enjoyable part of the job was the freedom, being able to work by yourself (to an extent) and decide how you want to go about the day, within company lines of course."
good,Dr Pepper Snapple group is a very fast paced but fun job once you get the hang of everything up there.  You will have to dress according to the weather as it is a warehouse job.
good,"wonderful company and benefits, cares about their people. Provides intensives along with a great work environment. Very fair company and a long term benefit to any employee."
good,"You go to work early in the morning, work 9 to 12 hours a day, Benefits are average pay is good. The hardest part is all the lifting. I enjoy working with my customers."
good,"I typically would wake up at 3 am on most work days or 2am for ""load"" days. I worked most my days from morning to afternoon (8-10 hrs.). The starting pay was $12.00 as a merchandiser. The 30 minute lunch break/ 10 minute breaks helped re-energize myself to maintain the fast-paced environment I worked in. Going to 6 stores or more per day to re-stock merchandise comes with experience. I encountered customers, communicated with employees/managers, and developed friendships of all types during my experience. By the time I left the job for focusing on my studies, my improvement was incomparable to how I was when I first started! Best part of the job was the excellent, professional management of the 7up Bottling Co."
good,Great place to work. Freedom to Handel accounts that fit your personality. Benefits are amazing. People you work with are really carrying.  HR had been very helpfull.
good,"I had a good time working with the driver I was with, not once did I have a bad time/day there. the manager was very nice and great to talk to. always happy"
good,So far the job has been good. It is hard work but you are not rushed to get it done as long as you don't go over your Hours of service. 17 to 25 stops a day and anywhere from 275 to 550 cases delivered per day sometimes with a helper other times without
good,I would get to work at 5 am and get with my driver and would start loading the truck for our route. Would visit many stores throughout the day and move product into their coolers.
good,You can work without anyone watching over you so long as you get your work done. Traveling between stores gave you short breaks throughout the day. Must be organized to succeed
good,"Work environment is good, fast pace, pull orders for varies store routes. Replenish products from the dates that they are shipped in. Unload and load."
good,"Enjoyed my time there, certainly didn't plan to leave the way I did.  Good work life balance, very results oriented.  Worked for a great manager and with a very good team."
good,It's fast paced going from store to store until your route is done some days are heavy and some days are lighter not stuck in one store all day everyday decent pay with benefits
good,Heavy work loads but your on your own. You have to work hard but then you also can do that and have fun while doing it. Enjoyed the job. Paid weekly was awesome.
good,"I worked there and really enjoyed the people and the management, unfortunately I relocated so had to leave the company.  There is also good moral, I would recommend this to a friend."
good,DR Pepper is an excellent company to work at. they ensure that your health is taken care of and that you are equip with the correct PPE for the job. they also entourages teamwork and high collaboration between sifts
good,i was a merchandiser in which i stock stores with their products . Worked by myself most of the time an at my own pace. If looking for something right now is a great place to work.
good,"All the free coffee you can drink....if you are in to that. Had great room for advancement within the company, should a position open up. IT manager was great to work with and was always up for new ideas."
good,"I have worked in a few different departments over the year I have been employed.  I have been the Applesauce cook for many years and understand the ins and outs of not only the computer programs, but also the floor lines."
good,It is a simple job. Nothing difficult. Quick paced. Good people to work for. All the shifts are morning shifts. Friendly environment. I did the merchandising and some sales and found it to be easy.
good,I had a company van and enjoyed that. Time went fast because of the type of competitive business. I enjoyed traveling from business to business. I was able to gain selling space in some locations by gaining the trust of store management.
good,wouldn't give me the amount of miles i required to make a living for my family.   good people to work for I enjoyed it.  with my experence i expected more
good,"Working there was ok. Driving a lot was fun but you'd have to drive your own personal vehicle. The job is pretty physical, long days, but the work can be fun."
good,"Good work"
good,Went out and cold call and develop leads for my territory area.  I learn about marketing the brand with my customers in the territory and developed a trust with him in the market place.  The culture was good and hardest part of the job was keeping up with the competitors.
good,Good place to work. I enjoy the people and culture. I think there is a solid work/life balance. There is generally a positive attitude from all departments.
good,fun company... large company.. great pay.. great benefits... great hours... everything about this company is fantastic..... great management... just gotta be able to lift stuff
good,Great place to work. The hours are long and there is a lot of OT available.  I enjoyed meeting all the different people that worked there.  I learned a lot.
good,"I worked in the warehouse for 4 years its fast paced. You are on a timer on a headset. the faster you are the better you are. the only hard part is youre riding a electronic pallet jacket with up to 25 others  buildg orders in a small area with 4 or 5 forklifts replenishing and dropping down pallets so builders can continue. I went to merchandiser on my fifth year . I basically restocked stores and worked pallets that the builders built from the previous day. Its a constant moving job. It can be hectic at times. if you havent done exercise, you will lose weight, Time is money. I learned how to think ahead of time more, and how to tone my leadership skills when others wanted to give in, and definitely drink plenty of water more. Management was cool for the most part, on big count days not so much. It is a very physical job after all."
good,"Good employer, changing hours and opportunities for change.  Would recommend position to someone who is interested in a job that you will have to work hard but have the freedom to travel."
good,Loved working at beverage company - great perks being at the corporate headquarters.   New organization and lots of projects and work at hand.   People were nice and helpful.
good,"Was given the opportunity to learn and progress in my positions.  Had many benefits including tuition reimbursements, on site clinic, quarterly incentives."
good,"I enjoyed the level a responsibility I had, I only directly interacted with my supervisor at the beginning of each day to discuss the daily tasks. I did well with prioritizing daily task to get done with my work day in a timely manor."
good,Fast pase working environment better suited for high school graduate if u keep up u will get paid top pay as long as ure in shape you should not have any problems
good,"i do not want to rate this company. i should not have to rate this company in order to submit an application for another company. Safely and efficiently deliver product to whatever stores are on the specified route for that day."
good,"Was not bad, was pretty fun just be ready for long shifts. Overall a great workplace a bunch of friendly people too, management usually wasn't ever good or logical."
good,"Always keeping busy"
good,clock in with a thumb scan and then grab a headset. pick an order and finish the day. not to complicated but it almost looks like tetris.
good,You drive your own car to various stores and stock shelves. The hardest part is when you get swamped with work around holidays. Early morning starts.
good,I was in control of my earnings on this job because employees are paid by the case and not by the hour. I also appreciated the health insurance plan starting on day one of employment.
good,"Start day early , work until you finish. Help fellow employees complete there tasks, if needed. Great line of products."
good,"Typical day of delivering Products to stores on time dealing with  customers , safety is Peppers main concern. co-workers make job enjoyable"
good,"Good job, good benefits, I enjoyed working with my co workers. The hardest part of my job was not knowing if there was going to be reloads at the end of my route. I wasn't able to plan anything after work. The most enjoyable part of my job was building a report with my customers."
good,"Long Hours but ok pay "
good,Late nights not much training. Had to load trailer of product and deliver for routes. Pick up cash where needed. Utilizing lift gate finding alternate routes to get to customers.
good,"I start at 4am or 5am head to my first store to start stalking , and faces my company's products on store shelves, each and every morning. i merch about 9 to 10 stores each day it hard work but well worth it i enjoy the people at each store i go to."
good,I have been i merchandiser/ truck driver  for the past 2 years. It has been a safe reliable job that i have enjoyed. I have learn every merchandiser route since starting there.
good,"A typical day at work at Dr Pepper is outstanding due to all the smiling faces and great management."
good,I enjoyed being my own boss & getting to set up & merchandise each store with perfection. enjoyed winning the awards for top displays
good,"Enjoyed my time working there. Friendly staff, and manager are very helpful. Always space to grow with this company. Great benefits. Family like environment."
good,Asking for help on days that have big orders and not getting the help. Working harder than the co-workers do to the gender.
good,Great place to work and advance. They were just short staffed when I started. Seems they like to overwhelm there employee's at times. Need to learn to keep employees.
good,I had a ball working for this company.  It was basically a do your job type of atmosphere.  You are your own boss.  the co-workers are great.
good,Delivering sodas to vending machines. Making people happy when I deliver Dr Pepper products.  Making people happy when they put their money in a drink machine and they can buy what they want
good,Snapple is a fair productive company to be an employee. Management is fair and work assignments are clear. Employees work together. Work load is reasonable.

good,"Great place to work you write your own check work as much overtime you want or need as long as you do you job and show up to work nobody bothers you, people as easy to work with if you are easy to work with"
good,"I learned alot in the merchanding aspect of retail goods,how stores would alocate products and spacing.holidays where especially busy with products and pricing and the extra demand for keeping products on the shelf and in order.hardest part for me the size of some stores and the amount of product that was needed to keep on hand,especially during the holidays"
good,Your job experience is honestly going to all depend on what route you decide to take. If you get a tough route then you're really going to hate your job. But I luckily got one that I happen to really like so its been a positive experience.
good,"Had 4 grocery stores that were apart of my every day route,"
good,"The overall job was an great experience, I love working for the company. The management and the team are great to work with. I get awarded for the accomplishments I make."
good,I was a merchandiser and my job was to fill the stock of our product in various retail stores. Speak to store managers and offer product displays. I enjoyed every part of it expect the early morning hours.
good,i learned the skills i need to be a productive driver throughout my career.every day is a different experience.the most enjoyable part of the job is getting off early and still have a productive weekday.
good,"Job requires lifting of cases, stocking shelves, rotating product, filling vendors, collecting money from cod customers, checking vehicles in & out for the day, and doing paperwork at the end of each day.  Some long hour days depending on any problems that should arise throughout the day- ex: delivery times set by customers delayed, break down of equipment/vehicles, bad weather situations that slow down delivery, etc.  "
good,We would show up and have are pre work meeting and then have a short work out. Check invoices to get a game plan then start loading pallets using electric hand trucks. I loved this job it was great.
good,My experience with Dr pepper was rewarding. It allowed me to learn new skills as well enhanced the skills that I've already had. There was always room for advancement but lacked working hours
good,This job has many advancement opportunities if your willing to push management and constantly show them you want to do more. Merchandising was extremely easy and fun. If you don't mind working 20 hr days working in the warehouse is for you
good,"I enjoy my job, i love working for the beverage business, i load pick order... there not to much to tell i work there for 5 years and 18 years in the beverage business."
good,"It was a great company to work for. high pay. great benefits. extremely long hours but i truly enjoyed working hard, fast, and being the best at what i did."
good,"a day a dr. pepper is that you have to be ready to work because they have alot of brands, the only thing about Dr. pepper is they dont pay overtime for merchandiser after 2 they drop you down the $6"
good,"it was great place to work, kind people great supervisiors and employees"
good,nice people and work alone pretty much every day accept two day of the week and the company has a party once a while and also get free stuff if you been there the longest and the hardest part of the job was getting sticky from the pop if it ever broke open on you
good,Management is very interactive with all employees. I learned a lot at this company.
good,"Driving a class A truck, loading and unloading, operating a hand held computer, Taking payments from our customers, I am responsible for getting the product checked in and making sure it is all accounted for."
good,sell soda to grocery stores. I met new customers everyday and maintained relationship with the customers/buyers I already knew.
good,"Reconciled route banks daily"
good,"starting work at 6am, i learned to stock shelvies, build displays, read codes, and learn company ploicies. my managers where ok but need to communicated to each other. i love my co-workers they would always there when i needed them. it alot of physical work. the most enjoyable part of the job is meeting and knowing new poeple"
good,I enjoy fixing what ever needs fixed. I enjoy the employees I work with and having fun. I like having a company vehicle to drive to and from work. I like the benefits we have.
good,"Decent Job to have, very understanding managers and staff. Lots of opportunity for growth within the company"
good,This is a growing company as the acquisition has not changed their business practices or culture. The expectation is succeed. KDP gives you the tools.
good,I loved my relationship with my supervisor and my job tasks. I had an overall positive experience with the company. I would recommend checking them out for employment!
good,During my employment working for Keurig Dr. Pepper my line performed as a family. I really enjoyed the work atmosphere with Keurig Dr. Pepper being diversity. Immediate hierarchy put effort into equality regarding employees.
good,"The work can be tough and stressful during the Summers and the holidays, and it takes a special work ethic to take on every day tasks, this job isn't built for everyone and depending on your mindset it really is what you make of it, physically you will get beat up, so try to be proactive with how you take care of yourself. The pay is better than what some competitors in area want to give in the same industry and we pay weekly."
good,This place gave me a chance when nobody else would. The work atmospher is great. If you are doing your job they will leave you alone. They believe in promoting within the company.
good,"Fun place to work, outgoing coworkers. Good benefits, management is well put, good hours and plenty of overtime during peak season which is in the summer."
good,Very face paced and you have to think on your feet if problems were to occur. Management is great and very great at working out problems with days needed off.
good,Spent a lot of time working. Never really working with a set schedule more or less always on call. Hard to balance when you have a family and kids involved.
good,Dr. Pepper offered a lot good opportunities to grow within the company and treated all the employees fair.And everyone gets along great and are always there to help if needed.
good,"A great company to work for. I would work mostly by myself, if I needed help my fellow co-workers were just a call away. My boss was a very nice guy. The hardest part of the job was getting up so early in the morning. "
good,"Excellent company to work for. You wake up early and go in from store to store stocking merchandise and once the shelves are full and the back room is cleaned up, you go home."
good,"As a recruiter you'll be over certain locations, not necessarily familiar to you, so you'll need to learn the areas in which you are responsible for recruiting for. My manager was ok, but he's no longer there. My co-workers were friendly. The recruiting team in the DFW area is small so we worked fairly close together and got to learn alot about each other which was good. I enjoyed the job, but didn't enjoy some of the managers that I had to recruit for.  I typically worked 8-10 per day and sometimes we were able to work from home. I also worked a few weekends when timelines were approaching."
good,"There is steady work for most of the year, usually not too stressful. There are busy times usually at the beginning of the year. We rarely have to work more than 40 hours a week and if we do its only an extra 3 to 4 hours tops. There are lots of events and activities for the employees that allow us to relax and boost morale."
good,"Enjoyed working there, it has a family enviroment. Employees get special screening of movies that Dr Pepper or any of it's other brands have anything to do with the movie. Dr Pepper sponsers a lot of different things so you never know who might drop by."
good,I enjoyed working on my own schedule.Meeting with customers in the field and helping them with their soda needs.Most of my customers became good friends.
good,Culture of continuous improvement extends to personal development. Room to move up if hard work is consistent. Fast pace of production facility keeps things new and fresh each day.
good,"A work day full of activity in the area of product replenishment."
good,DPSG is a great company to work for will great benefits and very competitive pay. Very strong portfolio to sell from of products
good,A typical day was to work until finish.  I learned that in certain areas of the company there were no set schedules.  Management and co-workers pulled together.  The hardest part of the job was not being able to schedule personal time with family.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with a good team.
good,"Did your own work but everyone depended on each other"
good,Company stand behind their employees. Great benefits-awesome team building and morale building events.
good,I was responsible for on time deliveries and daily inventory of my truck
good,Great benefits and lots of work. So if you like working late  and getting plenty of overtime then this is a great place to go. I liked working there but.
good,The company is very enjoyable and can hone your skills. A good life work balance. If it wasn't for the merger/acquisition I'm sure that I would still be there flourishing.
good,"its a exciting workplace. when i first started, everything was new to me but i got the hang of my work very easy. nice work environment. i learned how to assemble machinery. i did clean up work for downtime."
good,Keurig Dr Pepper was a great place to work i enjoyed it it was amazing and if they had any available positions in Killeen available i would go back i miss the company
good,I have gained alot of experience needed to succeed in the warehouse field. And it was very competitive. And required me to work fast and to have better listening skills.
good,"This job has taught me responsibility, and integrity and to go out and fight as hard as you can for what you want. Dr. Pepper is a great opportunity for anyone who wants to lose weight lol or just get a good exercise. But all jokes aside it’s a pretty good environment for team work."
good,When I first started with Keurig Dr Pepper the pay was pretty low. I love being on my own with no bosses breathing down my neck. I got plenty of overtime in the beginning. I’ve been there 3 months now and I love it more than I did my first day. In my 2nd month we got a $3 raise plus 100 attendance bonus every week. Only downfall with that is now we are allowed no overtime at all! But the company has amazing benefits and you get so many discounts at all types of different products! I have not seen my boss since the first 3 weeks I started. With that said if you go to work and do your job and do it like you’re suppose to then you won’t have issues and will be rewarded! Best company I’ve worked for! Period!
good,"This job is great for staying in shape, it is competitive, fun to represent, it’s all round good hard work, you start pretty early and get off early. A fun way to earn a living. Thank you drpepper/Snapple group for being a great company to work with. Pay raises would of been nice. Overall wonderful job."
good,Received products and packages to be placed on the palates. Receive incoming packages and deliver to desired areas. Take completed palates and put on trailer to be delivered to locations throughout southern California
good,"Working at Dr Pepper snapple group was a very good and promising job, great team to support and help you. Fair management and endless opportunities that help you and the company grow."
good,"If the job would have been more than just a contract job, I would still be there. I enjoyed working for the company. The atmosphere was fast paced but fairly easy to achieve. The only down side to the job is they require you to work long hours, but the compensation was great."
good,A very reliable place to work for. I always have opportunity to work overtime. The company is very fair to there employees. They compensate well with shift differential. They pay for shirts and sweatshirts. They have a great 401 k plan.
good,While I worked for Dr Pepper I learned more then I had at the majority of places I've worked. The management is extremely friendly and understand. I can actually say with confidence that I felt like a friend not just an employee. While still maintaining the required respect to meet an entire regions logistical demands.
good,"Learned about the bottling industry and all the different departments in it, and how they all work together. Strong upper management, with the only downside being sometimes conflicting messages from above to the masses.  Those of us in middle management have done a great job of putting the pieces together and making the business as a whole run more smoothly.  Long hours, but lots of fun along the way as well."
good,"Show up  on time."
good,Very good job good training good benefits and good team and company to work for. Able to move up in the company good hours and great team of people to work with.
good,"For one this company has been around for years and I believe it's not going away anytime soon. Dr pepper make some of the best uniquely flavored drinks in the industry."
good,I enjoyed my time at Dr. Pepper before going to school for electronic engineering. I enjoyed the fast paced work environment and always having something to do and get done in a timely matter.
good,This company has changed very much throughout the last years and was much different back in 2008. The management is good but there is a clear disregard for the employees in the warehouse.
good,Worked very flexible hours and also a lot of freedom when it comes to a daily schedule. Good management and a good experience to have.
good,"Management is great, they are very leniant. If you are looking to make millions, don't go with this company. If you are looking for decent pay with outstanding leadership, I recommend Dr. Pepper Snapple Group."
good,"I started the day normally between 7am and 730am. Since being located in the central time zone, this arrival time afforded customers, and sales representatives the proper amount of time to have questions answered and resolved. The day, other than telephone calls from the field personnel then revolved around evaluating updated sales, reviewing the Nielsen reports to seeing how sales can be improved in a particular region. On a daily basis there were a variety of meetings with upper management. Depending on the day it could be with the President, the Sales Zones Vice Presidents, or a peer under a separate brand that might need help. The hardest part of the job was leaving at the end of the day knowing that a project was not yet completed, even though I may have spent 10 hours working on it. The most enjoyable part of the job.... the people."
good,"in this company is a hard labor job u have to pick case of"
good,"I arrived at Meijer to start my day off. I took inventory of what we needed on the shelf. After looking through back stock, I would take what we had to fill the holes. On delivery days I would unload the pallets and organize them in the back stock area. Once I was done with that store I would move on the the next and repeat the process."
good,I loved this job inside and out.
good,This company is a good company to work for they pay well and they have good benefits they start of at a good rate for a single person and they will treat you wel there
good,Great place to work with good people always willing to help solve any problem you have. They help build you into a leader so you can’t move up within the company
good,"Keurig/Dr.Pepper offers more than just a paycheck/title, they offer growth in a company that takes care of their employees as well as each other. I know I'll always have a place there and look forward to all the successes they've helped me continue to see."
good,I enjoy working at Keurig and love the work schedule.  The people are what make any business go and I really like the people I work with. They are currently implementing Lean Manufacturing into the process and are investing in the Knixville plant by expanding the facility and capabilities
good,"Overall, a very ethical based group. Tons of teamwork would be incorporated to met a certain goal. Whether or not the job was done correctly was questionable to some. Everybody had their role."
good,"Its a stressfull job, fast paced, but very rewarding. Lots of challenges but can learn alot from it. Never had a bad experience or a negative one with a manager or a co-worker."
good,Dr Pepper Snapple was a great company to work for.  Unfortunately when Keurig purchased Dr Pepper my job was eliminated in a down-sizing move.  I traveled often as a fraud investigator and the ability to work from home when in town was a great benefit.  The most enjoyable part of my job was travelling the USA and being able to meet the employees at their local sales centers.  A typical day could involve sixteen hours of surveillance or the typical eight hours of administrative duties.   The hardest part of the job was seeing employees lose their jobs over things they could control and chose not to abide by policy.
good,"Usually fast paced.  Very hard work.  The best part is you are out traveling between stores.  You really make so many contacts with managers of the stores, employees of other companies and the public.  Besides a simple phone app, you are left and entrusted to do your thing as you work.  No one micromanaging you throughout your day.  The sales representatives and management are available when you do need to get a hold of them, though.  The only downsides are that the workload can get quite heavy and then, at other times, be quite a bit slower.  This can make your hours fluctuate.  The main struggle for me is never knowing when I get to clock off for the day.  You work until it’s done.  However, my manager is truly excellent and will always accommodate in any way he can.  Overall I would sum this up as a great company to work for!"
good,Very fast paced always a competitive sport because we wanted to see who was the fastest and most accurate at picking.  Very chill environment humid due to warehouse
good,"this job is easy, its one task, and that is to stock the shelves at different stores. This is a great place for a responsible adult to work. there's no manager hounding you if you work well. you get raises and perks"
good,"It is an exciting time to be part of Keurig Dr Pepper.  Leaders have a strong vision for the future, and co-workers are engaged and passionate.  The work is fast-paced, and there is a lot of opportunity for career advancement."
good,I loved working for Keurig Green Mountain. The employee benefits and compensation were probably the best I've ever had. The only reason I left this job was because of a move.
good,Working for DPSG is physically demanding and stressful though it is a great workout and they take care of their employees id recommend this place to work to anyone.
good,"Usual day at work is pretty smooth for the most part, not too stressful. Learn a lot on the job about products and always more to learn about. Management is easy to get along with and treat you good, and also get raises each year so that’s a plus. Good work and life balance"
good,"Dr. Pepper is a great place to work. Dr.Pepper  has great benefit, great wages, great people to work with and work for. job and be fun if you make fun. you also meet a lot of people."
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job, was serving all customers to best of my ability, and reaping rewards from them by getting extra SKU's and displays into their businesses, growing the business yearly, even with roadblock of big stores closing on the route. Average day was between 9-11 hours."
good,DPSG is an amazing place to work. Great leadership team and lots of opportunity for career advancement. Fantastic brands. Some of the most talented people in the business.
good,"I started 3 years ago as a truck driver and worked my way into a supervisors job. Good pay, good benefits and excellent people to work with. Aggressive training program for entry level positions."
good,A typical day of work at Drpeppersnapple is traveling to many different stores to merchandise. I have learned to pace myself on an hourly basis. Management works well with each employee.
good,"A good fast paste environment to work in. They gave us good benefits, and treat us to good lunch from time to time. We also received bonuses on our checks when we achieve high productivity."
good,loved the people I worked with love operating forklifts fast -paste   company lots of work to be done management is good to you listens to all suggestions
good,Great place to work good people to work with a typical day we produced at lease 10 or 20 thousand cases per shift I learned a great deal about the process of making a very good product
good,Awesome company to work for with lots of opportunity for career growth. Managers are very supportive and HR is helpful with training courses.
good,This is a very good placed to work ..they cross trainee you for more good oportunites to move faword...management is good.
good,A typical day at Dr. Pepper Snapple was peaceful and painless. I learned a lot there about how to work in stressful situations. Management was very considerate and worked well with the employees. The hardest part of the job was not having a scheduled end time. I did not like working without knowing what time I would get off work. That was the biggest issue. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with great people. We knew what the goal was each day and everyone did well working to together in order to make sure that goals were met.
good,"I enjoyed working there. It was a very face paced job setting. I had to be able to organize, use leadership skills and meet required goals."
good,"Excellent pay, all around great place to work. Great managers and team leads."
good,"This was a very good experience, learned how to build store displays. This is a very fast paced job an I loved staying busy, seemed like my day at work went by so fast because I was working so hard and fast."
good,"I've work for Dr Pepper Snapple Group for 23 years.. I really enjoyed the work environment and "
good,I have few complaints about the work environment; my job (delivery) is straightforward and compensated adequately. Benefits are well manage and premium. Some jobs are not paid adequately (warehouse) and have high turn over. Management is slow to respond to business practice issues that are a loss of productivity or sales and sometimes ignore such issues entirely. If you are customer service oriented you will find the inability to service customers completely frustrating. However this is not a reflection on the treatment of employees.
good,"Every day is a fast paced work day, the employees are very energetic, and always willing to work together. "
good,"Very Nice place to work. Business closed. I enjoyed my co-workers and the work. I also enjoyed the customer service part of my job, getting to meet new people dailey."
good,"Each day, I arrive at the first grocery store on my agenda promptly at 6:30 AM. I go inside and make a list of everything I need to fill on the shelf, in the coolers, and on displays. If a display needs built, I build it. Once I finish my first store I move on to the second and repeat the process. If we received a shipment that day, I run everything I can to the shelf and then put the rest of the items on my truck pallet away. It is my job to keep the back stock clean and organized in order for safe and quick job completion each day. I double back to my first store at the end of the day and refill everything. "
good,very good place to work i worked for six years with snapple and transfered to jacksonville florida plant in feb of 2012 and management was not good to work for.They refused to hear anything from the operator who knows the adjustments for certain machines.
good,"salir a campo , checar mercado detectar areas de oportunidad , coaching diario con promotores y supervisores,seguimiento de actividades ejemplo:( concursos de ventas, apertura de franquicias ,seguimiento diario del volumen de venta vs contrato mensual, checar necesidades de la fuerza de ventas ,seguimiento a gestion de proveedo9res de servicios y envio mde materiales , a las diferentes plazas a mi cargo ,retroalimentacion diaria con fuerza de ventas ."
good,Nice place to work
good,"Typically I get to work, check the Maintenance request logs, prioritize which jobs need immediate attention in the different departments. Greet the managers talk to my co workers figure out the best strategy to keep plant in operation while our team works to provide a Safe stable and comfortable day."
good,The work there is easy and laid back. Favoritism is shown and I don't think that's fair to all employees. You work alot of hours. Employees get along with one another. I feel like the pay should be more
good,"Loved my 14 years with Dr Pepper.  Management was awesome and work life balance was great.  Could have offered more work from home opportunities, but they were working on growing those opportunities when I resigned 18 months ago."
good,Good culture. The company is growing and there are a lot of opportunities. Keurig just merged with Dr. Pepper so a lot is going on. The work environment is really relaxed and people are super helpful.
good,There’s nothing I can say bad about my relationship with the company . I learnt more than enough and every day was a great opportunity to be a part of.
good,"DPSG is an amazing company to work for. Great brands, benefits and salary. You feel like you're working for a family owned business, not a corporate business. Team work is the core value and they would reward and encourage employees for your hard work."
good,Nice work place. Benefits and pay scale is excellent. Close to home. Co workers are friendly. Paid holidays and good time off when needed. Personnel works with you if u have any problems.
good,"Honestly this was one of the best jobs I have had, I never intended to leave, I made the mistake of letting personal life get in the way of a job and was to scared to admit my wrong doings and stoped showing up to work and didn't try to talk to anyone about it. Management was amazing the people i worked with were awesome, you got to move around and drive around town while interacting with great people everyday, weekly pay was wonderful too, I may not have a chance to go back but I would never tell anyone anything bad about the job."
good,"Great place to work. Love all the new people I get to meet!! It's a very friendly environment, and room for advancement. Everyday is a new adventure!!"
good,This review is for the corporate office only. Dr Pepper is a good company because the people that work there are more like friends and family than coworkers.
good,same route every week yet its an exciting experience. It provides a great environment for learning social skills.Interacting with different people is fun.
good,The best work place due to its culture and benefits. Plus also work 4 ten shifts to have Fridays and weekends off. With safety in mind always and always going that extra mile to help employees with their education related to your job filed and always appreciating employees for their hard work. Plus excelent bounus package based on job performance and great pay too.
good,Great place to work at with limited supervision if job is done correctly and efficiently. The morning shifts begin at 5am until assigned work day is completely done and some overtime is given.
good,"Great company and loyal employees who are passionate about their contributions to the company and their impact in it. Management is driven and focuses on the employees to make sure that the company and every employee knows how much impact they have on a daily basis. "
good,Exciting work place with down to earth enjoyable management. I enjoy making sodas and learning new things and taking on challenging tasks. The most enjoyable moments were making new and large orders and getting the job done in timely manner.
good,"Run Reports daily"
good,"Very fun environment, loved going to work and being around my employees it was never a dull moment, we knew how to laugh and goof around but at the same time that's how work was getting done in the mist of it all even with the manager he was awesome and very ongoing."
good,"My co-workers were great, when I saw them, and our manager was pretty awesome. Anything you needed for the job, he would ensure you got it. The hardest part, which wasn't really hard at all, was the distance driving and trying to maneuver machines/carts around small spaces. The most enjoyable part was knowing that I was doing a great job at each stop."
good,"-Flexible shifts"
good,Great place to work. Excellent communication amongst all departments. I started as a temporary employee then ended up as a full time team leader and this is an opportunity for every one who works there. I was also recognized multiple times for my efforts at work.
good,"Loved my job at DPSG. I was given a lot of freedom to do my job. I had great managers. I would start the day by determining what artwork needed to be created, set priorities and get to work. Artwork created would be routed to the managers who would then send it to the proofers and others for approvals. Once the artwork was approved, it was sent back to me to finalize. "
good,A typical work day was like going from one island to another discovering a new adventure everytime.
good,"Stocking, Building displays. Great management. Great work enviroment. Flexible hours. Good pay."
good,"Typical work day would start with getting the equipment going and ready to start production, then the rest of the day was making sure the lines kept running"
good,"I love my job, the only issues I have are personal family issues, my girlfriend is pregnant with twins so we have a lot of appointments to go to which interfere with my work, but everyone is very understanding and great about giving me the time off that I need. I honestly couldn't be happier working for such a great complany."

good,I know I have so much more to offer than just being a merchandiser. Don’t get me wrong I don’t mind merchandising but I have a great management skills sales experience communication skills customer service skills but I can offer
good,"I absolutely loved working for the company.. They treat you like a member of a huge family. When my son was sick and in the nic, my boss called to check on him every day and never once asked when I was coming back to work in fact he told me dont worry your job is safe. At that time I had only worked there for about 2 weeks."
good,"I like my job I enjoy speaking with customers. Management is very well trained,and they pass their experience on to me. Whenever I have a question there is always someone there with the answer."
good,Hard work but very respectable and reasonable! I had a great experience working here and I really wish I hadn’t left to go to us foods! But I loved working here
good,"Very enjoyable environment. Company policies are very fair. Management keeps all rules enforced, allowing work to be completed. I really enjoyed the stent."
good,"Joined the company as a start-up.  Went from a $25 million dollar private company to a $5 billion dollar public entity with international office and large presence in North America.  The culture was great until the more current years that the company has lost sight of the every day worker.  They are outsourcing, laying off and placing jobs where labor is cheapest."
good,Dr.pepper Snapple 7up is a very productive and fast paste environment.It is A good first job I recommend anybody to start.They have great benefit and high end advance.
good,"Absolutely loved working at Keurig Dr. Pepper! I worked with the best team of people. Loved everything there was and all the managers and customers I would get to meet while merchandising. Plan on going back hopefully one day soon. The only reason for me leaving for personal reason, and was the hardest to do because I absolutely loved it. But would highly recommend Keurig Dr. Pepper. Hands down the best place I have worked at."
good,Great company and probably should have stayed but the previous company wanted me to come back and help them.  I went back and took over a branch that was slated to lose 1.4 Bil and successfully turned it around.  I would recommend anyone to strive to work for this company they have really good people as well as lower and upper management.
good,"A day at work was always a day of learning. Managing the challenge of troubleshooting and problem solving, providing good customer service and  keeping production flowing."
good,Nice place to work good benefits good pay paid weekly was a plus for me I recommend them to everyone I wanna go back there and work fun events good food as well lol
good,when I was working at the warehouse I learn a lot it was a fast past but I held it there I was moved from in the warehouse to the yard moving the truck it was nice to do that and still work inside of the warehouse the crew and I was on point with the pallets as I move the truck to the doors to get loaded I will move others truck and I as will deal with other trucks that come in the yard to drop off the trailer and I will park the trailer
good,working at Dr pepper was a great experience it taught me how to work at a steady work pace and then how to pick it up and work fast. Working there as well tell me a lot about the soda pop industry. I really liked it.
good,Loved working for this company. Good company to work for and lots of overtime. M-F with weekends off. The money is there if your a hard worker. Training was good as well
good,Best manufacturing job I have ever had. Best plant I have ever worked in. Clean. Organized. They took the time to train me THE RIGHT WAY. They do have a strict point system which ended my job there. Life shows up and point systems are made as if everyone is equal and they forget people are human and everyone is not the same and we don't live the same life. Losing my job subsequently made me homeless. Learned a lot from them though.  I'd do anything to get that job back. Great company. Give them a shot.

good,"When I arrived on day one, I learned that Dr Pepper has ""company values"" like most big companies do. But I was shocked to hear one of the values is ""No Blame Fixing.""  Translated, this means that it is against company culture to blame people for mistakes they make. OK, nice lip service, I thought.  I've been further shocked to see people correcting others when they slip into the blame game. We really live this corporate value. The idea is that to be an innovative and courageous employee, sometimes you have to take risks. And if you are expected to take risks, surely you'll make some mistakes along the way. If the company expects all of those things of you, it wouldn't be fair to be blamed for every mistake. "
