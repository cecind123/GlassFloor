rating,review
bad,"This company was previously known as united supply. We were top dog in our area for industrial Equipment supplies. Then Pepco came in, and it really feels like it’s falling apart"
bad,"When I first arrived I wasnt given hardly any training but was expected to know my job responsibilities (which are many) at the very onset. "
bad,Management is horrible. They speak of a culture that they dont follow. No meetings to resolve problems only individual  discipline for things that the group cant resolve.  Age discrimination is prevalent. The company will fire people who have been hospitalized and have Dr notes and they get sued often with no change.  Horrible company.  It is hard to transfer and as a temp you work for years and they never hire you.
bad,Management wants one thing but have never done it themselves.  When you submit something then they say it is wrong.  Managers will say in one on ones that they will help develop an individual but never do.  The individual is then blamed and marked against them in their review.
bad,Manager that run department have no to little time in the field experience. Take 8 year to become a A splicer.  They will move a 2 year man to Forman.
bad,"I did not like working here at all. What I experienced was that there was zero room for creativity or growth within a position. So what you are doing today, you might be doing for 20 years.Competition for other jobs is numerically rated and very difficult. The place is tightly controlled in every way I can think of. Like many corporations, the rich get richer... A LOT."
bad,"The minimum working hour per week is 48 hours and 56 hours for closing week each month."
bad,"Be prepared to work mandatory overtime but thanks to the union the pay is VERY GOOD. If you are a single mom THIS JOB WILL BE DIFFICULT because there's mandatory OT, and if your late more than 3 times your first year your fired. During my time to many family members being hired including the mother-in-law of a call center manager, and 2 - 3 other kids of other employees. Stay low for your first year to get Union Protection. Current management were once union employees and no the system very well."
bad,"Customers are upset when they get to you because they have been on hold for over an hour..the phone system could not understand what the customer is saying..the phone system is not set up to route the customer to the appropriate department."
bad,"Not your average call center"
bad,Helping customers with their bills and taking payments and helping them with saving programs
bad,"Typical call center environment but lacking diversity and work/life balance opportunities, as well as advancement opportunites."
bad,Has been a decent place to work.  Has great dental and vision benefits.  Currently employed and choose not to offer any further comments at this time.
bad,"Pepco Pays and the work is no walk in the park But the environment is very stressful. There is a lot of drama, the employees are hateful and rude along with the managers and the Reps are RUDE to customers.. No amount of money will allow me to work at such hateful,stressful, place again!"
bad,"started out answering phone, changed to online orders. People will lie, was good, my supervisor was nice, customers, going home"
bad,Employees and the public are often mislead as to the operations of the companies. Raises and compensation are limited for employees while management receives HUGE bonuses and then claims they are simply following the industry standards. Corporate bureaucracy limits the ability to quickly and effectively complete tasks and assignments prompting negative reviews from managers who are undereducated and out of touch with the industry. 
bad,"Need to focus more on the employee(s) work verses personal life, too much cattiness. Poor management, choose favorites over hardworking employees but over all a great place to work to move ahead with the right people behind you."
bad,"As a project team, we were tasked with helping to stand up the cyber security compliance program. The team was great."
good,Lay offs happen quickly. The overtime that is required sometimes interferes with other life activities.
good,Good place to work if you wanna make money. Didn’t really have a life/work balance. Worked there for ten years a lot of good times. If I had to come to work and just do that it would’ve been perfect. A lot of politics though and discrimination. I can only speak for the underground dept.
good,Great place to work until the Exelon merger. Good company to work for! Good benefits. Good vacation time. Good pay. Hope you make friends with the HR lady.
good,"I coveted this job.So when I got hired I was excited. However mangement which is mainly women is very ""katty"" they have their favorites and the best man for the job never trumps seniority. Also you go from probationary temp to probationary perm to a perm position....very long periods without job security"
good,"There's a lot that this company can learn about Agile methodology, hiring standards, and salary requirements.  The pending merger may help the management of information and technology."
good,"Changing programs, Busy days - Staff tunover, department constant changes."
good,"In many respects, PHI is behind the times. In terms of technology, communication and processes, the company needs a great deal of work. Job security is the best thing that PHI offers. If you come to work, perform your job, meet the company standards and requirements, you will have a job for as long as you would like."
good,The training department is not organized and there aren't enough opportunities for advancement. The manager seems overwhelmed and doesn't pay enough attention to the needs of the employees.
good,"Very Busy place of employment.  Easily accessible from subway, bus or public transit.  Near restaurants, hotels, entertainment and shopping.  Company should offer discount parking to temporary employees."
good,A typical day at work consisted of me sitting in my cubicle inputting data. While at PHI Holdings I became more proficient with Microsoft Office and I learned how to navigate different software programs like SAP and Oracle. Management was very loose in how they oversaw subordinates so unfortunately there was a lot of workplace gossip. This sometimes led to work not getting done and having to work in that environment everyday was honestly the hardest part of the job.  When work got behind management would simply schedule the whole department for mandetory overtime. When I left there employees were working 60 hour workweeks indefinitely. That is terrible if you have a family or care to have any kind of work /life balance. The work was straight forward for the most part after you learn how to do it.....maybe even a little redundant.  The building I worked in is in downtown DC and this along with the competitive pay were the most enjoyable parts of the job.
good,A stable place to work with good benefits. Some unionized positions
good,"Contractors dream job, able to work from home. "
good,"I worked 7:00 to 4:30 Monday thru Friday. I learned how to load and unload box,and tanker trucks.I liked working there,but was told I would get a raise after ninety days and didn't."
good,"typical day- rotating schedule, two 15min breaks and one 30min lunch. Call center environment. Easily replaceable."
good,"Lack of leadership from managers, lack of grooming for promotions.  The environment was stressful when quarter ends and year end and last minute changes"
good,"A decent corporation to work for with good benefits (healthcare/education). However, there is little room for professional advancement and hours/work-life balance are very rigid."
good,Good benefits and career path. Great co-workers willing to help you and a lot of opportunity to grow within the company. Good company to work long term.
good,overall it is a good place to work because it was a small tax group.  but their compensation is too rigid.  so good employees would seeking other opportunities.
good,Very good school to work for.  Excellent network of schools.  Strong culture at every campus.  no room for advancement need to be on a need to know who you know to excel
good,"Great place to work prior to Exelon takeover. Current atmosphere is stressful and overwhelming. "
good,"A typical day at work involves checking emails and voicemail."
good,The Company culture is really depends on the group. The group I was in has very strong competition. Working long hours. I would not recommend to someone who has family especially who has younger kids.
good,Can spend lots of time doing grunt work and pushing papers around not getting any real experience. Staff not accommodating to entry-level employees
good,My job is a great place to learn new things. I work with a lot of differant people daily which is fun.
good,"This company is great for one that needs a job with great benefits. However, there is very limited mobility for a career moves. It is an aging workforce with many near retirement but choosing to continue working so not many options from promotion. The culture is currently evolving but it is pretty much about who you know for upward moves."
good,A small office enviroment but the work is on a contractural status.
good,PHI is caught between a big and a small company. Independence is allowed but not celebrated. The corporate business model does not fit the work my division is doing.
good,"One of the best things about working at Pepco is there's no time clock to punch in and out, no one looking over your shoulder."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job at PEPCO was the opportunity to learn a lot of new technologies and an opportunity to configure many Cisco routers and switches such at Nexus 7K series and 4500x switches.
good,i learned how to do data entry while communicating with the clients via telephone
good,"A work day starts early, you must wait to recive your wroute for the day then you can navigate to were you need to go and park. I was able to read a map, read meters and locate them. Management is strict and fare. Your co-workers are very helpful they are your best asset with the company. The hard part of the job is the weather and wildlife you never know what is giong to happen. A perk of the job is being outside working and going to locations that you never seen."
good,"I love this company because of the professional skills I learnt. Great place to work. Accountability and responsibility is promoted. Employees feel overworked and underpaid. "
good,"good work environment, and a very fast pace with the work load. I wore many hats in order to handle the various task. As the PM I also mentored the Mid-Level engineers."
good,"BEST JOB EVER despite some of the managers who were not honest or ethical with promotions.The people were a blessing, great benefits and nice bonuses."
good,"Established accounting systems for seven new PEI subsidiaries including developing and implementing the accounting system, staffing, and training of new employees. Accounting staff mentoring. Provided account management through the maintenance of fixed assets additions, sales and disposals, accounts payable, and receivable and job cost order. Managed the consolidated financial statement. Applied database management software to produce custom reports."
good,"As a contractor, I have had a good experience working with Exelon/PHI.  There have been some bumps in the road with the merger, but my managers have been good and the people I work with are professional and great to work with."
good,Positive family enhancement program. Encouraged parental and child growth.  Goal was family enrichment. It was very rewarding to see improved parenting skill and increased knowledge of child development.
good,The growth opportunity in within the company as a contractor was slim to none.
good,"Fast paced, motivating place to work. "
good,very diversified working environment. Good management personnel and benefits
good,"Task, Roles and Business impacts change daily, however, the work environment is geared towards productivity and my direct manager pushes us outside of our comfort zone for exposure and advancement. Although the results aren't always vivid at the time, you just hope the work pays off in the latter."
good,"Aging workforce in the traditional utility side of the house, lots of opportunity in the future."
good,"Good culture, Learnt different technics for quality testing. Management was very good and co-operative. co-workers were very nice to work with."
good,"The most important part of my duties at PHI, is there is always workand knowledge to learn. Giving my title I maintain the complete Voice infrastructure across four states and five off site call centers. Also Implemented At Home Agents using 1X Agent."
good,Worked there for a period of 6 weeks as a Brit working in predominately Polish office it was easy to fit in but the work was interesting and they were friendly enough a thoroughly enjoyable experience
good,the best part about the job was learning something new. this was a fast past job. I had to manage the upkeep of company vehicle. only part about this job i didnt like was that was temp and i had to drive in rush hour traffic almost everyday.
good,"Great place to work and opportuinities for advancement, if your willing to wait!"
good,"Overall, I would say I did love my job. I make a very decent wage and I am able to earn my degree and the company pays for it. They have great benefits. For the most part everyone is wonderful but there are some people aren't so wonderful."
good,"Good place to work overall, commuting was a challenge however they were very flexable in establishing a home office which benefited greatly as I traveled to many remote location across a huge service territory. "
good,Pepco will keep you moving. Very fast paced work environment but overall great place to work. As long as you're motivated and a team player you will be successful.
good,"I’m very grateful for the opportunity PHI has given me, but at some points you can outgrow the company or the company can outgrow you. The company isn’t the same company is started with."
good,"Very professional atmosphere, I really enjoyed coming into work. Sadly, it was a temporary contract position. Working in the legal department of a utility company is a lot different than working in a law firm."
good,"enjoyed my time there, worked with some fine people in the O&M department.  Was given a chance to excel and we did!  growing business by almost ten million dollars."
good,"best job for me so far  young coworkers young candidates for a college very diverse tasks lots of things to do but low pay, sometimes we did not really know where the managment was going and scared of being fired because it happened many times to other people."
good,Pay was fantastic! Management could be hard to deal with every now and then. At the end of the month billing that was not completed was dispursed to all employees that had already completed their work and it was always the same people. Slackers are never held accountable for their work since they know they can always get help. Driving to DC was also terrible. Wish I could of been offered part time . I would of stayed forever simply for the money!
good,installation of electrical meters also mataine up keep of company truck and kept track of invetory.
good,"Excellent tuition, vision, dental & medical benefits. Company offices in Delaware, Maryland, Washington DC, and New Jersey. All employees have a second role for responding to outages related to storms."
good,"Working at Pepco Holdings was a great experience for me. Since my contract ran out, I have applied for two additional positions with Exelon, the parent company and with Pepco."
good,I am answering incoming calls for my 8 hour day. only get 10 mins of personal time a day to use bathroom or stretch. they monitor your calls and they do 4 qualities on your calls.
good,Great company with great benefits and pay. Work 10-12 hours a day though and drive 2 hours one way to get to work is the only down fall.
good,"My day at work would begin at 6am which requires me to be there 30 minutes early, and I learn how to mow and trim the professional way which I like, I also held the responsibility to keep and maintain my designated latrine clean. some of my co-workers was awesome to work with but some were lazy which me and my other co-workers had to work later and harder to finish our job. The hardest part of working for Pepco was having to cover for the other co-worker(s) who was absent for work without any notice to the company. The most enjoyable part of my job was the getting off from a long days of work and being around my co-workers who was full of fun at least some of them."
good,"Very Busy"
good,"Each control employee has a site to report to in which an assigned job is given such as preventative or corrective maintenance. The system they use to assign work is cumbersome due to all the reports required on a weekly basis. This takes away from actual work or individual training for new employees. The company has given me the basic knowledge and the incentive to increase on my own time my skill set for being able to program, diagnose problems, and build a control system. The most enjoyable part of the job are all the high end customers I get to work with and the numerous control systems I get experience with."
good,I learned a lot about energy efficiency and renewable distributed generation.  I successfully sold several high dollar contracts that led to additional business opportunities.
good,A job at this company is usually a career for life. All of the employees have been there for over 20+ years. Very laid back and relaxed. Super flexible.
good,"Small/ mid-sized organization which provided a good and quality product. Company grew too fast, over-extended and paid the consequence. Acquired by larger company."

My responsibility includes developing large-scale renewable energy projects (5MW or greater) activities located on Army installations in the United States. I am a team player, extremely motivated"
good,"Working at Pepco has been a great experience for me. A typical day at work, I was stress free, learned to be objective, managed personnel relationships, my co-workers were laid back. The hardest part of my job was not finishing a task and the most enjoyable part of the job was that it became my home away from home."
good,"Great Place to work this has been a enjoyable experience. There is so much opportunity. Working in a production enviornment has became challenging and rewarding. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company."
good,At Pepco Energy I get an opportunity to work on challenging energy projects that involve a right mix of field work and office work. There is a lot of learning on the job each day and working with a supportive team of bright colleagues makes the work enjoyable. The team is a led by a supportive manager who is knowledgeable and inspiring. Overall a great place to work and grow the career.

good,"Typical day at work involved performing credit checks on various energy trading companies, negociating contracts and finanilizing contract details, assisting in billing and AR issues, managing staff toward goals. I learned the complex area are energy trading and deriviatives as well as the contracts that relate to this.

good,"On a typical day, I would"
good,"I was an intern at Pepco. It was a great place to work and gain experience. A typical day at work for me was talking to my supervisors and getting the directions I needed to complete any projects that were assigned to me.

Their were tough projects that I had to complete, but all the directions were clear cut, and if I had any questions my supervisors would explain it to me."

good,Positive workplace culture and provided plenty of training opportunities to build skills set required for job requirements. Dealing with the DC commute is the hardest part of the job!
good,Good company with an emerging culture. With the merger with Exelon the future is bright for this company. I know that they will continue to be one of the best utility companies in the country.
good,"I really enjoy sales, especially when I need to convince people about a product which initially they did not consider to buy. One of the retail shops I used to work for allowed me to enjoy my secret passion to sales. A typical day at that store would involve organising all the shelves so that the product looked appealing to the potential customers. It was great that I had the freedom to arrange according to my own opinions and ideas, for example place some of the reduced price items at the front of the shop to attract the customers to come in and hopefully buy some other products."
good,"Welcoming my employees as the arrive for work.  How to be much more patience when dealing with the public and their outrage attitudes and complaints.  Should and could  be better.  Very friendly and very helpful.   Not having my supervisor supporting my position and my job.  I loved what I did, interacting with the public when they came in and needed information, my employees that were under me as  a supervisor and just the idea of getting up in the morning and being able to interact with people."
