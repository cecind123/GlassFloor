rating,review
bad,"Would be a great place to stay and work till you reached the proper retirement age.If Kraft Foods did not merge with Heinz,and or you did not loose your company pension."
bad,Title says it all.  Once purchased by heinz it was all over.  They are evil and cut-throat and think money alone motivates.  You have to be brazilian and hate your family to succeed there.
bad,"Environment at the end was extremely unstable with a great deal of turnover.  The cultural shift brought by 3G Partners may work for them in the long run, but alienated and displaced much of the institutional knowledge that can be helpful.  The enthusiasm and decisive posture of the new leadership was exciting and they weren't afraid to make changes."
bad,"Everything’s a trap, from what you say to what you do. They’re always looking to hinder you. They said you’ll get a bonus if we hit our numbers, bonus time came around and all we heard was excuses and no bonus, even though numbers were exceeded. Sick days were basically taken away by that I mean, you could use them but it might cost you either by losing your job or not being able to advance in the company. The HR department isn’t there for you, they’re there to back up management and corporate. You are quickly labeled a liar if you question them. The overtime expected is outrageous in a 5 to 6 day work week you are expected to work up to 4 days of overtime meaning 4 12 hr days. So not much work life balance if you like to sleep at all."
bad,"Kraft hired me at a level higher than most new employees because of my experience. However, I was terminated because of a medical condition they misinterpreted."
bad,"they do not like helping family out when in need, the moral there is all about making the quick money, they like to make you  come in on your day off even if you had plans they make it mandatory"
bad,The management at the plant that I worked for was poor which reflected the culture of the hourly employees.  The plant was eventually closed and bulldozed.  Maybe other plants within the company are better.
bad,"cold and wet all day 43 degree or less "
good,Kraft foods was a challenging work environment.  I gained a lot of experience with customers and SAP erp systems.  Our management team was hands off and allowed the employees to manage their customers and issues.  We worked in teams and there was a lot of cooperation with coworkers.  The hardes part of the job was the long hours that were required to meet the demands with the lower head count demanded by the company.  I will miss the people I worked with.  We were able to get along outside of work as well as in work.
good,Rewarding but fast paced work environment. Good benefits and encouraging colleagues and managers. Fast paced work environment can put some stress now and then.
good,"redemptive work it's fast paced, learned quite a bit about machinery. work culture is fast paced and work together. hardest part is keeping up, the people were decent to work with most of the time."
good,the assignment they had me doing was making boxes for starkist tuna packets. then they had me place shaving cream and lotions in boxes. then the assignment was completed.
good,"I enjoyed my work experience at kraft foods, they provided all the juice you could drink. the atmosphere was relaxed and cool. I enjoyed all the different people that worked there"
good,Kraft foods is a good job but I didnt they they payed fair it was a slow and tiring. I like a faster past job the supervisor are cool but just cant work there
good,"Seasonal citrus bottling work.  Busy, impersonal, shift work.  Kraft has sold the plant awhile ago.  There is not much to say, since I worked only a short while."
good,"typical corporate environment.  Employees are very nice and professional.  Overall work is interesting and is a good learning experience.  But with the 3G takeover and merger with Heinz, the environment is poor and the company does not treat you well."
good,"Great general management training, iconic brands, a lot of responsibility early on"
good,"The current culture at Kraft is that they want to bring in new talent and get rid of people who have been there awhile.  So it's good if you are new to Kraft but be wary that you don't stay too long.  "
good,Very challeging environment. Enjoy working on projects and shaping change.
good,Good leadership and good products.  Kraft spends a lot on quality and assurance for quality products.  The leaders tend to allow people to develop and grow and don't necessarily do a lot of micro managing.
good,I liked working at Kraft but wasn't getting enough hours and then the store stopped using merchandisers so I was without a job unless I wanted to move out of state.
good,A typical day was fast paced. I learned the importance of proper hygiene and good manufacturing practices in a food plant. The management was good. The workplace culture was good.
good,"A typical day at Kraft starts with your green meeting letting you know what the last shift did and what needs to be done, also what machine you will be running what flavor is to be run if you will be changing flavors. They also let you know if any accidents and if it affects you or the company. Hardest part is sometimes the flavor doesn't want to run on certain machines and the heat in the summer plays a part also on the machines. The enjoyable part is the people for the most part work well together we even had a lot of crew dinners together which was fun."
good,Kraft Foods work atmosphere was great and our team was a tight nit family. We shared best practices and assisted team members during critical annual planning periods.
good,Kraft foods allowed me to grow as an employee. It provided me with many transferable skills that I currently use now in my everyday life. I had a great experience..
good,"There was room for advancement but favortism was shown ,who do you no and what will you do .Not a good place to work for a true Christian. Morals were tested every day Sad but true."
good,"Nesta empresa desempenhei atividades mais técnicas e atuei como Químico responsável. Aprendi boas práticas de fabricação, importância de alto nível de controle de qualidade. A cultura erá voltada a segurança alimentar e ao controle total de segurança. A parte mais agradável foi o sentimento de pertencer, de importância. A parte mais difícil foi implementar no time a alta rotina de auditorias e indicadores exigidos."
good,"A typical day involved packaging cheese, or operating a fill room. I learned a lot while working at Kraft. I learned how to operate a fill-room and I was one of the only temps to have learned one. Operation required a lot of attentiveness, attention to detail, and responsibility. Management was very strict but never seemed to have any idea what was going on for the next week. The schedule was never up on time, they where always adding people to work days and then taking them off. They never let anyone know when they had added them for a specific day. They would schedule people to stay after but would always have enough people to cover the shift so you'd end up standing around trying to keep busy with nothing to do. My co-workers made my experience at Kraft worthwhile. I loved the people I worked with and created a lot of great friendships through work. The hardest part of my job was training to learn the fill-room because all of the responsibility, dedication and hard work required to do the job. The most enjoyable experience I had was operating the fill-room. This was because I had put so much time and effort into learning the job, that the satisfaction I got from finally operating made me feel achieved and like I'd accomplished something worthwhile."
good,It was easy and I can go in at night anytime . I loved seeing the customers got to know a lot of people I helped getting customers their product from the back during the holidays
good,"Loved my time with Kraft. The company provided me with a great career, paid for my education and enabled me to raise 3 children on my own by paying me a good wage + benefits. A lot has changed since 2015, and I wouldn't go back now but legacy Kraft will always be the best company to have worked."
good,Each position has good pay. It’s a good company to work for it the Kendallville IN area. If hired in there company they have good health insurance for employees.
good,"Kraft foods was a fun place to work. I use to love working for this company until I was hurt at work and they did not treat me fairly. As a employee coming to work giving 150% every time I clocked in, I expected to be taking care of if I was ever hurt. That was not the case."
good,While I was there I enjoyed loading the trucks everyday the people all worked together to make sure that the job was finished on time and we made sure that we worked safely
good,"Overall, Kraft Foods group has been a great company to work for and has offered many opportunities for advancement.  With the current Heinz merger, I wish them luck obtaining growth and sustaining brands"
good,"great company to work for.....before the Heinz merger. Prior is was very team oriented and a culture of values. After, it was nothing more than cutting costs and hitting a number."
good,"I very much enjoyed my time with Kraft/Veryfine. However due to corporate decisions the facility was closed. I feel that had they remained active in the area, I would still be working there today."

good,was a great place to work unfortunately our plant closed. would recommend Kraft Foods to anyone wanting great benefits and good pay. Unfortunately you would have to relocate
good,"Received a world-class marketing training while working here.  The company culture was awesome pre-Heinz acquisition.  Post acquisition, not so great.  Lost all of the stars who made the company a great place to work."
good,Just been at kraft really showed me how to work quickly and fast it was many of time where I. Line was going fast in every tray I didn't miss one it was a safe place to meet other people and learn from them
