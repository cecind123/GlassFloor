good,"Easy going days, learned about every position before management, friendly co-workers. "
good,"Worked for 7years...started as a cashier. always trying to improve or extend my work experience. Volunteered to train or assist in other departments.   Guest Services, Softlines and Food service and stock."
good,"Target is a great place to work, management was great! Compensation is low. Your always meeting new people. I assisted with questions regarding products and services within the store, helped cashed out customers when needed. Co-Workers were fun to work with....Theres alot of excitment from the workers and the customers, especially during the holiday season"
good,This is a decent place to start working when you are younger. They will give any decent job candidate a shot. You have actual chances for promotion and getting into management roles with hard work. I would think of it more as a job not a career.
good,"Empresa da qual aprendi bastante e ate mesmo aprendi a lhe dar com pessoas de pavio curto. Por ser de atividade educacional, tive o privilegio de ter esta experiencia na ramo educacional e deixar muitos pensamentos críticos para trás. Ambiente agradável de se trabalhar. Porem tive um diretor que fui obrigada a apreender a me dar com ele, pois ele e uma pessoa as vezes difícil de se lhe dá, porem de coração muito bom."
good,"A typical day at work includes ringing guest up in a timely manner."
good,"Great environment, not enough hours hard to move up in company"
good,I enjoyed the experience in High School and College.  When I came back after college I wanted a full time job and to get the hours I need I ended up working six to seven days a week.
good,The most enjoyable part of my day is when I help a guest find exactly what they came to store to find.
good,"Target hires fun, energetic people. I enjoyed working here and made a lot of good friends in the process. Other than being understaffed, its a good company to work for."
good,I came in every day to work and completed the task at hand. I learned copious skills to add to my everyday life and how to work with others . My co workers were excellent. Management was very efficient. The most enjoyable part was interacting with customers and growing from every experience in customer service.
good,i loved my co workers but the pay and hours are not enough to live on
good,my co workers were very nice. I enjoyed my time working there i was able to meet a lot of new people.
good,the people were a delight to work with I just wish it had ben more than a seasonal job
good,Worked with machines that unloaded product from pallets. Loaded semi trailers by hand from floor to the top of the trailer in an unair conditioned building. The co-workers were fun to work with and helped each other. The best part of the job was the people I worked with and it was fast paced.
good,"I really enjoyed working for Target, however they tend to promote too early into high vis jobs, i.e. DM. I have seen too many DMs unsuccessful because they lack the leadership maturity level to do the job successfully. This lack of maturity hurts the stores and the team members they oversee. Target is a very easy place to work for - Just do as I say and no need to think strategically our outside the box to drive sales."
good,"Located and marked down merchandise for clearance (Price Change) They cut my hours on that position so I moved to Plannogram, Resetting isles and merchandise. Cashiered when called to the front. The Target in Hickory is a management training center, management was constantly changing. Co-works were pleasant people to work with. There was nothing hard about this job. The most enjoyable part were the hours."
good,"Easy work,Learned how inbound works,Bosses were nice,loved the people I worked with,lifting very big heavy boxes,liked working with a team of people."
good,Target is my first job. So i can't say nothing.
good,Target did not make it easy for cashiers to advance and pay rate was only $8/hr. Management was not eager to cross train employees. Good job for some one looking for a part time supplemental income without a ton a pressure.
good,Was forced to work in kitchen when i applied to work in stock room
good,My co-workers are like family and when you join the team you are sure to become family.
good,Lots of hardwork and labor. Became an eye for details when it came to stocking shelves with different products. Not long shifts. Come in do your job and you're usually done for the day unless they ask would you like to stay longer.
good,"I enjoyed working here. I worked nights and cleaned the grill. we had many people come in from differant walks of life and it was interesting to meet them. The scariest part was wondering if you were going to be robbed. The store was in a bad part of town. My co-workers were very helpful, we worked as a team and cleaned and stocked the store while taking care of the customers."
good,"Good for people who dont have any jobs, like kids out of school."
good,"Like all jobs, it has its pros and cons, but overall it's a good company to work for. I'm working here while I am in school and they are very flexible with hours"
good,My orginal experience with target was awesome. But the last few transfers were the worse. The management was horrible and needs to learn how to actually respect their workers instead of assuming they dont have lives.
good,"My first year at Target was good, but as they started implementing “modifications” they were unhelpful to employees. They cut hours of full time employees just enough that they wouldn’t have to give out the benefits for full time"
good,"Was hoping for more work after the holidays, but not considered for any other position.  Got a feeling of being set up to fail with unobtainable company goals without the proper training to obtain those goals."
good,"Working there was nice, not too stressful. The work itself was not difficult. However, management did not particularly care about individual employees and we were always aware that we could be replaced."
good,Working at target taught me many things but more importantly they taught me guest service. I was also taught to work in specific group and help out as much as I could. Great work experience.
good,Worked seasonal and it was great. Only a couple leaders would I say were great. The main leader of the front end definitely picks favorites. If you’re not on her good side. Well forget ever being noticed for your hard work.
good,They are very inclusive but they are also a bigger company and do not seem to care about each employee individually and because of that I did not enjoy working at target
good,"Typical day at work is busier during nights, around holidays and weekends. I learned that you have to have a lot of patience with people because they tend to be difficult. Management doesn’t honor you availability and constantly schedules you outside your availability or will decline availability change. Hardest part of the job was being able to work through the long work days or dealing with rude people. Other employee’s were fun to work with."
good,"At Target I would unload trucks of tstore products into specific pallets according to aisles and number, then unload the boxes of product onto shelves neatly and orderly for customers. Also assisting any customer who needed it."
good,"Good starting place, but disorganized management.  Very inconsistent in hiring good employees.  I saw new people every day and people quit within weeks.  The hiring process is sort of a dice roll.  Dont expect any raises."
good,"Target has one of the best leadership development processes around. As a leader you are required to build a cohesive understanding of your team’s strengths and weaknesses, and use these  within your action plans. If you work in the stores, however, you likely aren’t making a living wage."
good,"Its just ok, depending on your bosses it could be a good time. there can be lots of drama depending on location, AP is pretty effective though with proper management"
good,"I don’t remember a lot about working at target but it was very open and inclusive. A lot of lgbt+ workers and it felt safe. Though I was made to do things I should not have been allowed to do, overall a fairly good work environment"
good,The company overall is not bad. I was working there during a time when the company was transitioning from one business structure to another. It was a little messy but overall a good company. There was not a sting management staff there but they store director and logistics management where good managers. The gap was just too wide with the level on competence from supervisors and managers.
good,After working there for a long period of time you feel very stagnant but it's great at the beginning. You will be worked until you have no more motivation and the constant modernizations make it hard for work to get done properly.
good,"While my two years at Target, all I can say is that it's a very inconsistent job when it comes to work load resulting in stressful days. I was able to learn more into logistics, setting up planograms, and how to sell to customers despite being just a retail job."
good,Pretty good place for a beginner job. Good place to learn the tips and tricks of working retail and how to take care of customer's needs. Coworkers are friendly and easy to get along with.
good,It may have been my specific store but the environment is not good.  I recommend this job for younger people who may still be in school even though not even then. This really isn't a place you want to get stuck at.
good,"My location has terrible management, uncooperative supervisors, unclear conversations, they dont listen to your actual problem before giving a solution."
good,"Work environment was fast paced. Relaxed dress code. The work isn't hard, just busy and that passes the day by quickly. They often provide food and that is always nice. It's a fun place to work, but they cut hours alot and even full time employees feel it when that happens."
good,It is a great place to grow and learn new things. They will give your opportunities you did not think you had in front of you if you work hard for them. Good benefits.
good,It was mindless work and I found it pretty relaxing. It was like organizing things in a quick pace. I worked from 4-8. No customer interactions unless I was asked to stay longer which was often but my higher ups never pressured me. However if there was no staff you were expected to work harder. Still was my favorite place to work wasn't demanding but the pay wasn't good nor were the hours. They always made sure I was below full time so they wouldn't have to give me benefits.
good,"Target is my first job and it’s been a year since I got the job. Overall it’s an okay job but the store I work at is always busy and hectic, not only that a lot of the guest are rude. This job does help you become more assertive but it can be stressful at times and can dampen your mood quickly."
good,It was a great part time and it was flexible for my school schedule but it had very little room for growth. I felt like management did little to help me grow in other areas or move to other departments.
good,"The job itself isn’t bad, and actually I quite like how fast paced it is. It makes the days go by quicker, however I feel that some people in management positions often act like high schoolers. Gossiping and creating a hard environment to want to trust or even talk to and interact with those leaders."
good,"Target is a decent place to work, but often the management will ignore your availability and have you scheduled to work shifts you aren’t available for. They then assume no responsibility for it and you have to trade shifts with a coworker or risk being fired for not showing up. Not cool to say the least."
good,A typical work day is 8 hours for most employees and 4 for cashiers. I learned how to pack boxes quickly. Management was decent. I made a lot of friends there and go back to visit sometimes. The hardest part of the  job was walking 7+ miles per shift. The most enjoyable part was getting the chance to talk to my co-workers while we worked. It made things more enjoyable.
good,they offer a very supportive work place and good work training in terms of phone use and cashiering. they also offer free employee counseling. overall it was a nice experience
good,I was still in high school while I worked at Target as a seasonal employee and they didn't work around my school or sport even though I told them at my interview about my prior commitments and the told me they would work around that. There were many times i would have to find someone to cover my shift or would have to call out because they would schedule me in the middle of my school day. I tried telling my higher ups but no one ever fixed my schedule. I obviously didn't stay after my seasonal position ended.
good,"easy job, hours were flexible, bosses were nice, they cared about your wants and needs, customers easy to deal with, no real negative thing to say, management was genuine"
good,"Job is easy, the raise system they have sucks and is an insult to all who work there."
good,After the 1st month their expectations and treatment of employees were the worst that i have ever experienced. After 3 years of making me feel likeCrap i could no liner handle the decline it cause my health and family life
good,"Working at Target was a pretty easy job. There were no truly ""difficult"" tasks. The big drawback and only one for that matter, was that the manager and leaders of departments were horrible with working with you on getting time off for personal or school issues. As a student, this was horrible for me, and is what led to me leaving. The people were nice, but the organization and HR department was awful."
good,"Stand the whole shift.  If you get bored easy not a job for you. Rotated on self check out, machines were a problem.  Not much communication between management.  I always was asking for more to do. I straightened and cleaned the cashier stations, etc."
good,Target was my first job ever and I thought it was a good starting point for me. I had friends in the job and I also made new friends so the work environment was really friendly. The work aspect of the job was really easy and straight forward.
good,"i really enjoyed working here at target. the management is not the best but yet you can surpass it by just doing what you have to do at work. i worked with a lot of great people and it taught me to branch out and speak up when its needed. over all the work load is not bad because if you like a fast pace job, target is the place to work in."
good,"It was a typical job, greeting people, keeping the parking lot clean, getting carts, general work. Management was helpful with my learning skills in many departments.  The hardest part of the job was to  try to decide what was the most important thing to get done when I was called on the walkie.  Meeting different  types of people that come in and out of target with the diversity of the world"
good,I would recommend this job to anyone coming right out of high school because there is really no need for experience but it does help you get the job..
good,The most enjoyable part about this job is the team that I got to work with. They truly treated me like family and always guided me from right and wrong.
good,Nice place to work but management not very good berated employees hours inconsistent  pay low no benefits unless you were upper management or full time and rarely got full time except during holidays
good,I have been an GSA for target for a year now and never felt appreciated at my job. The pay here is jacked. I’m a supervisor with 10x the responsibilities and got paid the save as seasonal people and cashiers. They act like they give you raises in April (ex i went from $12 to $12.35) and they are like YAY RAISE! And then in June they take us to $13 which is minimum wage for the company so our “raises” don’t mean anything. I love this job but I’m tired of getting treated unfairly.
good,"I liked working there, but it was only a Temporary Seasonal position,  unfortunately.  I would work there again if they had a position open. The employees were so nice and helpful."
good,Management sucked. Two mangers sat me down for an hour telling me I needed to quit because I was taking someone elses slot and they couldn't hire anyone else. they dont know how to treat their employees.  Needs new management.
good,Clock in get your my device and go to your work area. stock and help customers. very easy to get along with everyone. make sure things get back stocked correctly.
good,very great place to work as long as you can get your job done you do not have any problems with you job. Very friendly and uplifting place to work at.
good,i love shopping at Target and still do. I loved the managers and fellow employees. My only problem as trying to get the hours I needed. There were alot of cashiers and getting the hours i needed were hard.
good,"It was a nice starter job but it got very stressful at times. The manager was decent but seemed like he never wanted to be there."
good,"When I started, I loved it and would pick up all the extra shifts. It was great pay and benefits and I loved the people I worked with. Then the culture changed and all the nice, supportive people were pushed out. Since I had worked there a while, I started cross-training in other areas thinking it would allow me to pick up shifts in other areas if I so chose. But, in the end, the managers used that as a reason to jerk me around to different areas and make me do all the work for the same amount of money. When the ideas of promotion came up, I was knocked down because they ""really needed me where I was already."" Also, I loved the company wide raises... but that also meant that new team members who only worked in one area made as much as me who was doing work for Team Leaders. There is room for advancement, but make sure you are in the ""in circle."" There is a lot of gossip and drama between management and their favorite employees and you have to be in that circle to get moved up."
good,"Friendly atmosphere fast pace nice team leaders funny boss "
good,New managers are generally hired right out of college with little to no work experience.  Store managers set the tone for the entire store- with very little oversight from district leadership.
good,"Great place to work for teenagers and young individuals who go to school or need some money in their pockets."
good,"My actual job was great and I learned a lot. Loved being able to train people and work in Home Dept."
good,"After almost 7 years with them it started going downhill. Management was changed every 6-12 months it seemed like, it became a place that wasn't as fun to work for."
good,Target is a great place to work if you are starting out in the working class or just need some money while in college. But target's scheduling can be difficult of manage. I am constantly getting split shifts and it makes it tough for me to manage my personal life
good,"Target is most certainly a job for those who are going through college or those who are willing to sacrifice their lives for advancement. You will however learn essential skills for the future, such as: "
good,"Working with everyone was great, until the new co-team lead arrived, which quickly turned out to ruin the job for myself. The HR team was great and understanding. My primary team leader was very fun to work with and got along with most people. The newest team lead when I was working there completely alienated me and made remarks that I was apparently not good enough to work with him."
good,"I like my job at Target.  Pay is less than I am accustomed to.  Hours are not consistent.  My typical day at work is fast paced while visual merchandising products.  Some team members are not dedicated to the overall presentation of the store.  Don't feel like management allows for growth.  Team member accountability is not apparent."
good,I love the people I work with. Management is not strong. They hire inexperienced people for jobs that don't suit them but look good on paper. I work there for 15+ years. They were a great company to work for. Now the lack integrity.
good,Culture is great and the hours are flexible. Not a lot of advancement opportunity once you hit a certain level. Overall a decent company to work for and the people you meet are amazing.
good,"I was hired for their seasonal help. Unfortunately target is such a big company that they can pay their employees well. However during the holidays they hire a ton of help but, then don't keep many people if any. I went 3 weeks with my name not being on the schedule before I was contacted by my supervisor and told thank you for helping during the holiday rush but that they weren't keeping any of the seasonal's in that department."
good,the target i worked at was very poorly managed and 'yes i would recommend it for a starting out job but not as a life time career. they don't train you for everything and they kind of just throw you out on the floor and expect you to know everything. they also put you in areas that you have not been trained for and expect you to be able to know how everything works.
good,It's a retail company but the job is fun because of the people I'm working with. Though no overtime and they cut your hours when they wanted depending on the season.
good,"It's nice when everyone works as a team,but one specific manager did not rally people together. So, the work is incredibly stressful. This manager was disrespectful and unappreciative of her employees. You dread going to work. It would be helpful to get raises more often."
good,"Excluding the truck unloads, work is fast paced, trying to get out of the way of guests. Hardly anytime to actually think for yourself. and no time to actually do your job thoughtfully, only quickly"
good,Good job difficult management. Played favortism . Good hours and schedule nothing to bad . Just like high school drama we’re suppose to be adult .. ...
good,"It was okay, the management was terrible but I made the best of it. The team leaders loved to tell you to do things they would never do, or ask you to help them with things you shouldn't be helping them with."
good,"Management really makes a Co., Target 1006 lost.out of my 8yrs. 6mgrs..  The learning experience was great ,team work, patience. Just the overall retail/grocery."
good,Everyone was willing to help if i needed help and the environment was friendly. Everyone worked efficiently and had fun while working very hard. Willing to take time to teach you about new areas.
good,"Target is a decent place to work. The pay is decent. The perks you get when working here are pretty good as well. Management is often too worried about the ""customer always being right"" to realize that the associates are people too."
good,Great place to work but the hours where very long. I would put in more that 12 hours each day and sometimes would not get days off. I had started as a Team member making it all the way to Executive.
good,"Target is changing and changing a lot. Some people are great at handling changes, but many of the leaders are struggling with it. This then is a trickle down effect to all team members."
good,"I made a lot of friends through target, but I was always stressed coming to work. When I worked in Starbucks, my lunch and breaks were more often than not forgotten about which got me in trouble. There is always drama going on, which makes things interesting as long as you aren't involved in it."
good,"It's not the worst job ever, however management in this location could be better. They are not how management should be, they do not listen to their employees. Sometimes it could be a real headache working here."
good,"I absolutely love working at target, but I don’t get nearly enough hours as I need. Even though I’m still a young adult, I have bills to pay for. So when I’m scheduled only 10-12 hours per week, I struggle with paying my bills."
good,The culture has really changed. Just not the company I started with and wanted to work for. I understand times change and you have to stay competitive. The culture just wasn’t for me anymore. That’s why I chose to seek other opportunities. Plus side though; some of the most amazing people I have ever met were team members!
good,"I enjoyed most parts of job, except for less hours and never allowed to advance due to favortism. Ienjoyed the people and the merchandise, but never got  the oppertunity to advance because I  didn't work there long enough. I like inter acting with the customers and helping them find what they are looking for."
good,"At Target there are slow days as well as fast passed days due to it being a retail industry. I feel that, as with any retail position, each work day depends on season, promotions, and guests that are present at the time."
good,"Leadership tends to look towards team members to lead others to success for the task at hand, while putting in little to no effort to ensure success. ""Development"" plans are never put in place to benefit the team member interested in moving up, but to make the LOD's day as easy as possible. They do not care about internal promotions, because if they did, the plethora of positions opening in other stores as well as our current locations would be filled by existing team members. Instead, they hire people 100% new to target, and have the team members train them to show you how to do your job. I cannot speak for Target as a company, but I can speak for Express format's career mentality."
good,I worked at target for hardlines for about 7 months I liked working for target. my hours started dropping after the holidays which was very inconvenient for me
good,"When I first started, Target was a good place to work.  Now they added more jobs onto my workload and they expect you to work faster and without help and the Management is younger and younger, and they don't care."
good,"Target provided good hours and good pay, however management could use a little more work. Coworkers are friendly and the work environment is very relaxed and not stressful."
good,"Inconsistant number of hours scheduled week to week. Poor management/ leadership. Hours and shifts are not flexible after you've submitted your initial availability. Good pay. Discounts only available with RedCard or cash purchases, which could be inconvenient for some. Friendly co-workers."
good,Worst place to work. Very horrible management. Not very flexible with hours. Managers are beyond rude. Forgets you breaks and lunch isn't guaranteed unorganized .
good,They give you a good training window. You know what you are suppose to do when you come in. Management is decent but could be more hands on. Workplace culture is always about the customers. Was let go without being told.
good,"One the sales floor things can get a little crazy, but your team holds you up no matter what. Not all of the leaders are the best, but that's everywhere I guess. I like what I do for the most part, Its just not worth it to me for the amount of things I am asked to do compared to others... If that makes sense. I just love talking with guests about health and beautyproducts, I could give makeup tips all day!!"
good,"management refused to discipline people, if you are reliable and go above and beyond you will be taken advantage of and you are unappreciated. raises were basic and not that impressive either."
good,"Target was a great place to work when I started there. I had a set schedule worked out from the get go and agreed to work 2 Saturdays per month. From September to April I ended up working every Saturday. I was disappointed that the management didn't stand behind what they had promised when I was hired. That is why I looked for a different position. Other than that, I really enjoyed my work at Target"
good,Working in customer service taught me how to solve difficult problems effectively to satisfy the customers needs. Advancement opportunities were another positive aspect of this company.
good,"Target was a good experience even though it was a temporary job it was good working environment. A typical work day is pretty basic as far as duties. Make sure the store is clean, restocking the shelves and helping customers. The management was fine i did not have any problems with hours or working with others."
good,"I really enjoyed working at target. The bosses were great. The coworkers were just in the process of finding other jobs. I tried to find room to grow in the business but it was next to impossible."
good,Great work place. Team members had great attitudes. Team members were very helpful. My hours were terrible. the work was fast paced. but slow at times.
good,"It is a basic, unload a truck, sort inventory, stock inventory job.  I found the people I worked with really made the job enjoyable.  Managers were pretty relaxed about work pace.  If you go on their bad side though..."
good,"Target seerved its purpose for me, but I enjoyed the people and time there, I was disappointd in the management there as they offered no room for advancement for employees based on work ethic, simply employees who were friends. Compettive pay, haard work."
good,"It was an okay, workplace. But the employer's depended too much on the more lowly workers. Other than that, I'd definitely recommend working here, if you just want a quick and easy job."
good,Upper management is unaware of issues at the field level and did not care when they were told. Its all about doing and not asking. You work every holiday and have very crazy hours plus you are held accountable for other departments that you have no say so in.
good,"The products that I cooked in the food court was really good, most of the employees bought lunch from the food court. Customers loved the cold as well as the hot sandwiches."
good,"minimum wage basic cashier job. nothing crazy or too strenuous. basic stocking and scanning, bagging, and pricing of items. just wish they paid more per hour."
good,Over all a good place to work. Sometimes can get very slow but it gives you an opportunity to learn new departments. Gives you more of an appreciation for people that work in retail.
good,"This job can be largely self paced where you can spend the time on what needs done, rather than what a manager tells you to do. It is generally a supportive team helping you if a guest asks where something is. Managers work hard to motivate people."
good,"Presentation Team is a good team to be apart of, my boss is really cool. It's the store manager whose attitude could use some readjusting. Some weeks you work full weeks, some weeks you work one day"
good,"Pretty simple, clock in get your assignment for the day. work on that and then you leave for the day. not to much to it , just show up and work. easy work daily, not a lot of room for growth unless you are willing to suck up to the right people"
good,"Although Target brand is fun to work for, ever-changing direction takes big toll all everyone."
good,"Good place to work , flexible hours , overtime pay when allowed,  two fifteen minutes break,  half an hour lunch break , friendly staff,  poor management,  paid sick time off."
good,All I can say is that everything you read online about working at Target is TRUE! It's a very shady place to work. The management is poor at best. There is very little training at all. There is no room in the back. Target is often out of product. Just a very sad place to be.
good,"I got hired on during the holidays hoping to be a permanent team member. I started up as a cart attendant, work was high paced and stressful. It may seem impossible to complete all the tasks, but I was able to get it done no matter what the weather conditions are. The only reasons why I left was because I wasn't given the hours I requested for."
good,the people you work with make or break your work day for me personally. But overall it was a great experience and an excellent stepping stone in life.
good,"Target is a great place to work and grow your skills.  It offers a fast-paced team environment where the guest comes first."
good,I worked with a lot of nice people but our hours were early and there is a lot of heavy lifting. Management was nice but they lacked initiative when guiding their employees.
good,For the most part it was decent. But there's bot much room for growth unless you have some kind of degree. Eventually it gets really old being in the same department.
good,They're really pushy about Redcards and some customers are really rude when coupons don't work out in their favor. But overall I enjoyed my time. Management was okay except for the holidays when they became really bossy
good,Worked the early shift.  Loading and unloading tractor trailers.  Stocking shelves as well as organizing the warehouse and other general duties. Enjoyed the work.
good,Overall your day at work is peaceful but always over work people with short staff. Some Management lacks communication and understanding their employees that keep daily operations at go.
good,"Expected to work 50 hour weeks, every other weekend and one closing night a week. The hardest part of the job is the amount of rollouts the company is all releasing. You aren't expected to be sitting on the job but theres a significant amount of reading about upcoming promotions and so on. To be knowledgable it feels like you are often times expected to exceed your 50+ work week or you aren't committed. The best part of the job is the team."
good,"This particular store has sketchy managers who are very quick to reject someone for hire based upon their mental disabilities. They allow team member harassment and have favorite employees that they protect. Otherwise the pay is great, the hours are great, and the work is so easy its boring."
good,The job was not fun but the people working made the difference.  I worked overnight and it was a difficult switch and completely ruined my social life.
good,"I was part of the 3AM consumables team, aka grocery stocking team. I really enjoyed my team mates, but I had a lot of problems with management. From poor training to poor communication and poor scheduling, it was difficult."
good,Coworkers become somewhat family. There are a lot of positions to learn. Shifts all throughout the day. Target is just a cool place and is overall a decent place to work.
good,"This is a great place to work if student or non head of household earner. They are very flexible in scheduling around classes or kids. Allowing for days off when needed. Which also makes it an easy place to get stuck when you are comfortable. "
good,"a typical day at target would include when arriving be ready to hear your Red Card goal that you should meet for the day, be frequently asked how many Red Cards you sold and stocking front end while also maintaining friendliness with the customer when checking them out."
good,"I had a blast working at Target, the people were super friendly and helping. The most stressful part of the job was when customers had an issue and I needed to wait for a supervisor to help me, or angry customers. The most enjoyable part was whenever I would get someone to open a Red Card, I would get recognized for it."
good,Very laid back. Failed management. Inconsistent hours. Couldn't give me 20 hours weekly. The managers don't give much effort to know people. Wil promise hours but can't give over 20 hours.
good,Target constantly has positions available. There is always room for advancement. there is a dress code but nothing extremely strict. They make for a fun environment to work in even if the pay isn't the greatest.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job for me was being able to come up with a solution to a problem when one was needed. I was generally the most knowledgeable about the logistics side of our store. My only regret is that I wasn't allowed to advance up in the store to help better the company.
good,"Target overall was pretty good about work life balance.  Quick pace meant you were busy the whole time you were their.  Enjoyed working with many people over the years and the responsibilities of my job.  Unfortunately Target took the view if you were too old, made too much or with the company too long you were out."
good,The job was alright. The people were average. Nothing exciting about that. All in all I left target because I was getting paid too little for the job I was doing.
good,the organization has great benefit but there wasn't any upward movement those who want to advance their career.there is no promotion within the local area for the nine years i have worked there.
good,"Target was a great learning experience for the short time being, however not the career I'm interested in pursuing. I grew with customer service and value that skill as a future business owner."
good,Target was an ever changing environment which gave me the opportunity to work in many different departments and a wide range of individuals.  A strong fast passed work place.
good,while working at target i felt like time wen fast because i would Have a lot of guests to check out and at the time of employment it was Christmas. And we were extremely busy.
good,Thoroughly enjoyed being able to meet new people each and everyday. The management at the one I worked at was constantly changing and the hours were inconsistent. Though the uniform was simple and work was easy.
good,"This job was fun and easy. I worked at the starbucks as a barista as well as cashiering, both of which was pretty easy. This is where I learned that customer service is the most important part in any company. Management was friendly and helpful when needed. I did see mostly moms that would come in to the establishment majority of the time customers spoke about their kids. The hardest part of the job would probably be closing down at night by yourself. The best part would be the kids coming through and seeing their faces brighten when mom would get them something nice."
good,"Throughout a typical work week, there is plenty of opportunities to pick up shifts in other work centers. By cross training, it ensures each employee is guaranteed hours."
good,Was on the planogram team from the day I was hired and that position itself was great. Staff was great overall it was really fun. Over time the executives in charge of the store turned sour and the fun environment died out and the job turned into a chore.
good,"I sold the most red cards at Target. However, I don't like that I felt pressured more than I could because I was going to school full time as well which was an issue to them."
good,It was my first job and for that it was the perfect job. However I know many people that still work there years later and they haven't moved up much. There is room for advancement but you really have to start at the bottom and work your way up and move if necessary.
good,"Work hard , I learn how to get better at the work and get a different and better jobs for my future.I don’t know , I don’t know.The hardest part of a jobs is to know how to maintain stability and make friends at work and have good conversations with the people and be capable to entertain the visitors."
good,"I was happy there, but they don't give enough hours for people to survive. It also gets slow after the holidays and during the summer so they cut hours, but train new employees at the same time."
good,"Unloading daily trailers, sort and categorize pallets and boxes, put product on display throughout the store. good place to learn how companies with big corporate setups run."
good,I had a few cases of harassment from one manager. when a new head of office showed is when things started running alot less smoothly and they started firing people left and right for almost no reason.
good,"Definitely not a terrible job, but the work can be somewhat demanding. Little appreciation where it counts, and management doesn't exactly back your decision, but customer service is a priority so it is understandable. Overall, I enjoyed the work place."
good,Being a cashier wasn't really my thing but i enjoyed working for target. Just wanted more of a full time job with a more reliable schedule. I would work a few hours one day then a few less or more another day.
good,"Some of the direct Seasonal Cashier Supervisors were very rude."
good,"Training was amazing! Store assignment started out amazing then took a turn for the worst with a store manager shift. There were so many things wrong with this store when I joined the team that no one person could fix them all in the short time I was there. Not to mention, ETL's (Executive Team Leaders) are expected to work way to many hours."
good,Early Start be prepared to work extra hours this was a part time position. Greet customers with a smile and ready to assist.Stock shelves making sure everything in in the correct place
good,Target was an ok place to work for. It was hard to get into the company and even harder to advance. You tend to stay stagnate at where you are hired while new people are brought in above you with no skills or knowledge.
good,"Depending on what you do, it's often very busy. Hard/softlines are constantly moving. Backroom and Flow even more so. Management is often lacking, varies store to store. Hardest part of the job is practically being forced to be inefficient because it's ""policy""."
good,"The best part of this job for me was working around only my coworkers and not unpredictable customers. It might just be my personal preference but it made a big difference. The stocking work was simple and manageable, even without the higher ups breathing in your ear. Good entry level work"
good,"I've worked here for 4 years, it's easy work. It's a job and has its pros and cons. It's comfortable once you learn whats expected. This job is mostly for part time students/ retired people who need extra money or work."
good,"When you don't have much work experience, this is a good place to start. It's just not a place to really STAY. I worked all the way from high school and through college here. I was trained in several places, the pay never went up a significantly decent amount for all I was able to do there. I started at $6.50/hr as a cashier (before min. wage bumped up) and I left 9 years later not even at $10/hr. It wasn't a career place for me, but it was a good first job. You have to start somewhere!"
good,"If my husband didn't get sick I would be still working, they dropped my hours down to 15hrs a week , I also have my flagging certificate so I wanted to get into the Road Construction Field."
good,"Target is an overall great place to work, but unless you want to dedicate yourself to a position in management there it is not a great career choice for most people."
good,It's a part time job with benefits and it's not bad but they're starting to cut hours right after the holidays and that's not good. I would stay for a long period of time if I could be guaranteed decent hours
good,The one thing I enjoyed at Target was the benefits. It was nice to not have to worry about having benefits for my family. The one thing that wasn't clear when hired was what position I was hired for.
good,"Targets a generally fair place to work,the atmosphere is a mix of fun and craziness.Some days team members get lost in the shuffle due to multiple members of management giving the same team member different tasks to do at the same time.Very hard to communicate over the walkie system due to constant chatter.Hard to advance up the promotion ladder due to applicants/open spots ratio."
good,Every employee has high work ethics and wants to do a good job. Management creates a casual environment to help employees feel comfortable at work and provide them with diverse activities to promote a welcoming working place.
good,I enjoyed my time working at target. The management and other staff are very friendly and they keep an open mind. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting different people every day.
good,"Great people, cool environment, flexiable hours. They always makes sure that their employees are happy.. anytime that I had an issue they tried to fix the problem rob the best of thier abilities"
good,"This company understands the value of teaching and training their team to grow with the business. Promotes a Fast, Fun and Friendly work environment. A great place to work."
good,This company needs to value their employees a little more.  Nice place for job stability and to make new friends.   This company should focus more on advancement for everyone.
good,At Target we worked 8 hours doing data entry and i learned to be fast and accurate at the same time to produce reliable information. The management there was good and we worked well with my co-workers as a team. The hardest part of the job was that i could get carried away with work and being reluctant to shut down the computer and stop working. The workplace was productive and i enjoyed learning how to use packages like SPSS and CSPRO.
good,"A typical day at work would begin with clearing the parking lot of the stray carts that accumulated over the morning and filling in the store. I would back-up the front lanes by cashiering as needed and guest service for their breaks. I learned to juggle different responsibilities and different tasks as they were asked of me."
good,"A typical day encompasses, running reports, determining needs, placing Purchase orders, checking on them, working w/sales reps, customer service, AP&Credit depts.  I have learned to maximize profitability while streamlining overhead.  Management is decent but more communication could be used.  Co-workers in my department are good and easy to get along with, on most days.  The hardest part of the job is trying to please everyone.  Most enjoyable are the co-workers."
good,"The guests can treat you very well or they can be very mean. There is A LOT of pressure to push the Red Cards, every day, ALL DAY. And if you don't meet their so called quota, there's something wrong with you."
good,"Co-workers are amazing, if you do your job you'll have a better experience than others that don't. Sometimes the work load for one person is overwhelming but you can always complete your workload."
good,"Working at Target was fun . Hours are good only in summer and in holiday season . Sometimes Management only give 10 hours a week     and they expect us to pay bills and be happy at job."
good,Their would be days that would be good days and some days that weren't. There were two different team leaders one was a very good person to lead and she knew what she wanted done and the other one was so confusing to understand what she wanted or needed she would tell you to do one thing and she would change her mind and when things weren't done on time she would blame you for it.
good,Target being the big name brand it is should not be hiring or accepting other Target employee transfers without giving its home employees the appropriate hours.
good,Target is an ok place to get beginners experience Its great place to work if your in school as well. Target is an overall cool place.i would recommend
good,"Normally, I would work a 35 to 45 hour. The job was fairly simple as long as you knew how to talk to another person about phones, why they should get one and stand for hours at a time. I learned how to handle aggressive customers in a setting where we have to be proactive in our approach (needless to say, not everyone likes that). The hardest part of the job was determining and preventing fraudulent activity"
good,Had me as a full time employee and only had me working 10 hours a week. couldn't pay my bills still can't.Did not give you your breaks on time. Enjoyed the coworkers but its bad management.
good,I mainly worked in the human resources department.  Advancement opportunities were to work in other areas of the store.  I miss the culture of working in human resources.  I enjoyed onboarding new team members and making their experience enjoyable.
good,"I like Target it is different than any other retail environment I have worked at. Good place, The pay is horrible. Management alittle disorganized. Other than that I like it. Great group of folks"
good,"A get up and go job, being on your feet all day and making sure every customer is helped to the best of your ability while also making the store look great. A lot of multi-tasking and thinking on your feet. There wasn't great management once the original store manager left."
good,"Fast and fun workplace with supportive team members who are always willing to go above and beyond. Driving sales is a competition at my workplace, we don't always reach our goals but its a blast to see who can be the best sales driver for the day."
good,"Provide great guest assistance and maintain a clean, great-looking store."
good,Target is an great job if your not really looking to advance in this type of industry. This is an great transitional job depending on your position in the store and your managers
good,Most days you are consumed with being backed up because others don't care about their job to get it done.  So while your picking up slack your needing to get your own tasks done and managment is never ever helpful
good,target is a great place to work at but what makes it bad is the management. they play favorites a lot and choose who they move up even if your the best at what they are looking for. co workers are the best cannot get any better and the hardest part of my job would have to be dealing with the management
good,"I basically worked in a storeroom filling orders, doing backstock of orders from  store floor, inventory, stocking shelves and filling hourly needs for store floor"
good,"a overall good place for work, the bad is you work during holidays no time off unless you put in for vacation....their management is always changing and each manager has their different way of working..."
good,"A typical day at work as a cart attendant starts off pushing carts and cleaning bathrooms, but can turn into a backup for almost anything. Cart attending is a great job for people that enjoy being outside, but it is not very laid back like everyone might think. There is plenty of management at target. Really an overwhelming amount of managers every day. Co-workers are very friendly and nice. The hardest part of the job is having to help everyone else when no one else helps you after you have spent too much time away from your primary job. After that happens it turns into a game of catch up trying to get enough carts in before your shift is over. The most enjoyable part of the job is to actually be outside pushing carts."
good,"Other employees were fun and friendly. A lot of fun to chat with, but management was different some of the management team was ok but the rest demanded unreasonable goals that would take more time then what was possible or what they demanded it to be completed by   or was a pointless and unnecessary task that was a waste of time spent on more productive tasks"
good,"Super Target was a fantastic place to work in. The areas I worked in was the most crowded, Grocery Isles. On a daily basis I had the chance to work with a variety of experienced sales members, as well as interact with the various guests that came to the store. "
good,"I first began wolrking at target as a cashier and was later offered the position at the service desk after I returned from my maternty leave. Typical day at the service desk consists of returns, exchanges, store pick ups, reshop and defecting items out of the system that are defective. My goal is to make sure every guest leaves our store not only satisfied but with the hopes of returning. I always want them to have a posive impression of our store when they visit us."
good,"I have been with Target for 14 years. Things have changed recently, but I have to say I am very grateful to Target for hiring me and I have learned a lot from working at Target. The best part of my job are my amazing coworkers and the networking/mentoring program at Target."
good,it was a fun place to work. The people you work with are nice people including management. if you are happy staying at the sane job tittle the entire time you are there then you will enjoy it.
good,"Typical day at work was the same every day, only thing different you might be working in a different area of the store but doing the same thing. Very repetitive, some days boring and some days fun. "
good,Empresa iniciando ainda suas atividades com um contrato de cinco anos com a br distribuidora. Ainda tendo muito a colaborar com seus funcionários.
good,as long as you show up everyday on time and do your job its your average job decent pay decent hours youll meet great people there and actually have fun most of the time
good,Target is a great company to work for. Target provides great training and there are many opportunities for advancment.
good,Always a busy day pulling product and back stocking product in the back room. I learned working here to just mind your own business and to just do your job. Management is sometimes unprofessional and has no communication at all. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the management. I mostly enjoy certain people that i work with.
good,It was a busy place to work. Focus was on daily tasks and not long term.
good,Every good experience but hard on the back when loading carts
good,A typical day at work is assisting guest with whatever they need. Putting items back out so that guest can have a great selection. Providing the best guest service possible.
good,Too many people trying to run one show. I felt i was discriminated against in many ways
good,My Typical day at Target is working overnight from minimum one day to maximum four days a weeks at the hours of 11:45pm to 7:00am in the soft-line department. I work with up too three employees. There are no management over in the soft-line department. The hardest part of the job is pulling plastic off of merchandise out of many repack boxes and finishing up by 1:00 a.m. to start the replenishment process. The most enjoyable part of my job is socializing with my other.
good,I help the customer that came in to do the shopping for whatever they wanted. And I did the cooking and server the food and did the clean-up and the stocking-up.
good,Everybody at target is really nice and try to create team building events such as bar b quest and free food in the break room. The team members are usually cool and nothing about the job is really that challenging. Just don't expect to get paid money. Hours aren't scarce just raises and starting salaries aren't comparable to other jobs you could find.
good,"A typical day at work for me would be the enjoyment of interacting with the guest."
good,"Target is a great corporation overall.  Unfortunately, they cycle through and promote managers every 18-24 months.  If you get a group of ""bad"" managers it makes the work week very difficult and lowers overall moral."
good,"I would do cash, put away re-shop (items customer's left at the cash), customer service."
good,"Very busy during holiday seasons, but not a guaranteed position available after the season is over"
good,"Great starter job. Work here, buy here. People constantly leaving."
good,"I would unload, stock, sort electronics and p-fresh. fast paced and you can learn a lot in a short amount of time."
good,"this was my first long period job, granted I was part time but it was worth it.. I enjoyed going to work everyday and seeing my friends that I worked with, its where I made friends that I otherwise would have missed the opportunity to have, a few of the front end managers were a bit pushy with breaks but overall a great place to work.. I would love to return but one of the former managers lied to corporate about how I left, and now he is no longer managing this store."
good,Target was good to work for.  I wish they would be more flexible with the hours.
good,"While advancement is nearly impossible unless youre best friends with someone higher up, I didn't HATE coming to work everyday."
good,"Started off my getting my workload in the morning, getting my cart ready with things that i'll need through out the day. Then I'd go to the section of the store I'd be merchandising and start working. I usually started off by tearing down the displays, then I'd put my shelves and peg hooks in their new locations and put the merchandise back up"
good,I enjoyed my work there but it seemed a little unorganized. Young Management and seemed indecisive.
good,"Its always nice place to work. We work and have FUN on every Friday, This makes us to be productive in all aspects"
good,It was fun in general. I worked there when I was young and I made lots of friends. The managment was nice. Benefits were decent. the hardest part of the job was the unhappy customers from time to time.
good,a typical day at work my be we don't finish stocking to floor. or we may get the floor stocked and the backroom is full of what wouldn't go out and back room can't keep up. management may not be at door when it is time to go in making most late and not giving punctual time frame of five before and five after. hardest part is making the unload time of a truck loaded floor to roof any were from 2400 peaces to 2000 in one hour and a half to two hours. I learned that the way the company has the unloading is smart but the way they do it in store is not always safe or smart. I loved some co-workers more then others but could find a way to work around the ones that had a bad day or for age reasons bossed me around. the main thing is to do what your boss tells you. I enjoyed being busy the most and working overnight was a highlight at Christmas. it was turned from that to 4 am and 2 am in christmas. Management is not the same long enough to know the right way to do a job. it would change with each person and store team leads are even still changing.
good,"If you ever worked retail it can be good or bad depending on the seasons. Some days are good, while others can be crazy. Target expects a lot from their team members sometimes too much of the amount of pay. Some days they will over fill your ""plate"" and expect you to get it done no matter what or you will get talked to if you dont complete your task."
good,Process truck deliveries; Replenish shelves with stock; back stock excess items. Provide customer service.
good,I love working at target but the place was just all over the place.
good,Management is horrible. The company encourages a light and friendly environment.
good,I had a great time working here. I was let go while on medical leave. This was an oversight due to bad management  but I am in a better place now.
good,"Target is a great place if you are 16 and looking for your first job. It is really hard to advance and it is mostly for part time work. Also, sometimes it can feel that there is not any equality within the ranks of management and team members. I feel this corporation could improve greatly on how things are done."
good,"I wanted to work for a company that has been around for many years and has a long future. Target being with in the top 50 of the fortune 500 would be most promising. The over all well being and treatment of employees is standard with some differences depending on where you work and what shift. I did enjoy working in many different fields with in the same store and with in the same day how ever the lack of communication between the many ""team leaders"" or bosses can be troublesome. The over all experience will change from store to store so its best to be flexible and willing to make big changes."
good,"hardest part , stand on your feet for long. the work is great, co workers are lots of young people ,good place , not enough hours"
good,"Giving good customer service is the majority of my position, making the customer happy and giving them a reason to return to the store"
good,"This was an ok job. co-workers were friendly, management was cool, the hardest part (none) the most enjoyable (none)"
good,"Came in Early, scannedned in Inventory and learned pricing and logistics. It was a great enviornment with fun loving co-workers"
good,"You have to struggle and beg for hours. Barely above minimum wage. Be prepared for younger high school kids to get more hours that the more experienced ""full time"" associates. They'd rather have Pizza Day than give more hours to those who are willing to work."
good,I enjoyed that the manager work with the employment
good,"Good co-workers, unorganized company, nice atmosphere and good dicounts."
good,".I learned to work at a fast pace, independently as well as with others and efficiently. I enjoyed leading a successful team of employers that ranged from a staff of 12-17 employees."
good,"I have been a team member for Target going on a year now, and i have never worked in and environment where employees have to fight over hours or if your no ""in"" with the staffing managers you are not guaranteed decent hours a week. I am a college student with the responsibility of paying for everything myself and target salary is no where near enough to get by let alone struggle for hours."
good,"Target is a great company to work, they have a high level of team work that makes you feel like part of a bigger picture."
good,"Team environment, flexible scheduling, very fast pace, jogging different task"
good,No two days were alike. My co-workers helped when ever you needed it.
good,*Friendly work environment
good,"I loved selling phones for ATT, Sprint, and, Verizon was so much fun. There was a lot of connecting with customers. It was a fun experience and I learned alot. I memorized each plan and device."
good,"A typical day at work consists of assisting guests with their needs and concerns, while supervising and coaching other trainees. I've learned that you will encounter different personalities, while serving the public, but you must maintain composure even in the most frustrating situations. I also observed that management was frequently inconsistent, but somehow all of the employees were able to resolve conflict in an orderly, productive manner. The hardest part of the job was trying to go above and beyond to meet the needs of the guests when they were dissatisfied. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to assist others and provide the most pleasant shopping experience as possible."
good,"Run cash register, greet customers, maintain cleanliness in area, answer phones, assist customers with returns and exchanges and refunds, process damaged merchandise, assist with baby registry, cash in and cash out balancing of register, assist in maintaining the store in organizing and prop designing and set up, Upsale store credit card. Management was okay some less professional than others, Co Workers were fun, nothing was hard about the job, I just enjoyed being able to do different things and experience going to different departments to help out."
good,A typical day at work you have time you start early and some day you start late.
good,The executive management team relies hard on the small team of managers below them to supervise the team leaders and the general employees. Annual raises are a joke.
good,exceeded expectations on a regular base. Was well like by the team
good,"Target is a great place to work until it isn't.depending on which department, my department expects us to get everything done at once and doesn't give you enough time to complete tasks."
good,I really liked to work at target but my job is seasonal. I strongly suggest people to work here. There is no encouragement from the team leader and very partial.
good,Just looking for steady hours more like the morning shift and out of work by 4:00pm so I can go home to my baby and more  Opportunities in the Job field
good,Great starting point for an asset  protection career. Everything revolves around numbers though they tell you you're a presence when you get hired but every month they review your numbers. There is not a quota or an amount of theft you are required to prevent but if your numbers dont match previous years then you will be scolded until you bring them up to match them no matter the reason or will be put on a pip and replaced.
good,"Overall the work environment is great and easygoing but the management is absolutely HORRIBLE, that being target of Orange, CT. Worked there for 7 years and got fired for a misunderstanding.."
good,Worked there for only a couple months and by the end of my time working they were only scheduling me for 2 shifts a week which where almost always 4 hours only
good,"The employees were nice. Most of the managers were okay. Jobs were clearly defined and easy to accomplish. Cross training was common and improved potential work hours. Scheduling was mostly flexible-- outside of holidays and weekends-- and the company did charity events. Unfortunately, some of the managers decided to force turnover by harrassing senior team leads into quitting, randomly changing policy and not logically or equally applying it, and ""enforcing"" rules when clauses say they should not."
good,"Although target pays better than most retail stores, 13.00 an hour is straight across the board no matter what position you have.  Seems a little unfair as there are some jobs that are more intense than others."
good,Benefits and management are not the best. You could definitely find better jobs. If you’re looking for something with part time hours and don’t really care about getting payed a good amount this job is good.
good,It depends on which departments you are apply for. It is good place for students and candidate seeking part time employment. Wages are good  but no full time hours are provide unless necessary.
good,The work is hard depending on the department.  To move up to management was tough and they looked for a certain 'type' of individual. They were a stressful environment when staff is low. Which is all the time
good,I love working at Target because there is always something new to learn there and they're pretty good abut giving you the chance to do so. I have worked in almost every department but that's only because I was desperate for hours and in one department you will never get the necessary hours to get by. That's the only thing I do not like about Target. Other than that the atmosphere is great if you do exactly what the managers want from you.
good,This company hires  for part time positions.  Especially in areas of customer care and unloading  the truck. This is  usually means under 25 hours a week.
good,"Target is a fun place to work, however, it's very difficult to advance without the support of managers who like to play politics with each other. This makes it difficult to find value and meaning in the work that you do."
good,Target was a great place to work. It just didn't have the hours I needed to survive. It's a training store so I went through several different managers.
good,"moving products from trailers, storage and remove items for racking to prepare certain quality to be shipped to distributions and store for our customers"
good,"I’ve only worked here for about three months so far but every day I go in with a goal in mind, and I feel confident that I can get my job done. My coworkers are great and there’s a real sense of family there. The only thing is that it’s such a big store, sometimes I don’t see my manager as much as I’m used to in smaller stores."
good,"I enjoy working for target. They have flexible schedules, weekly pay, 401k benefits, team appreciation dinners, good hrs. I would recommend the job to others"
good,My coworkers help me get through the day when customers come and and are extremely rude to us. Management is decent but they definitely don’t compare to the people that are on the front of the lines
good,Good place to work temporarily.  I enjoyed working there.  They were very welcoming and remember feeling included.  Some things that I didn't enjoy about the job was management.  Sometimes didn't feel valued.  But as long as you focus on the positive it will be fine for a temporary job.
good,"Bringing joy to guest, by helping them look for items . Answering questions for guest if they are unsure where to find and item or to buy a particular brand that the store holds."
good,I have worked for Target as a cashier and shelf stocker for over 3 years. I have experience in dealing with customers and making sure that they are comfortable and making sure I assist them in any way they need. I am a student at the university of north Carolina at Charlotte studying economics. some of the management neglected me and i felt they did not acknowledge me at times or respect me
good,"It’s a great job honestly, just since they remodeled and changed their management they’ve completely forgotten that their employees are humans with lives outside of work."
good,"target is a welcoming and fun experience, it is slower paced and you can work at your own (reasonable) speed. fair with breaks and time off, pays well and schedule is flexible."
good,You get what you expect. Don't be late or call out. Paid well and free train passes but the work is ok if you dont mind rude people. Management are all young and inexperienced.
good,"I worked for Target for 11yrs  When I started I had a great team and I has a good experience working for Target.   I was pushed out, my hours were cut drastically and I felt as if I wasn’t appreciated.  I was very thorough in whatever they I assigned me to do  My last 2 weeks they scheduled me where they needed to have Things done the correct way  I was pushed out  again it "
good,"The hours here are inconsistent and the management is constantly changing and they're never on the same page with each other. Typically you will interact with a rotating three managers through out the day and each of them have their own idea of what they want you to do. The company as a whole is constantly changing and trying to keep up with online retailers like Amazon and Walmart. The constant shift in what we are to prioritize can lead to a multitude of problems for the employees. However, the work itself is not too taxing or difficult, but it requires you to figure out time management for your work area on your own."
good,"Work life balance is difficult the more you move up. It is very fast paced and there is always a constant pressure to adapt and get things done regardless of what you may or may not already have in your plate. "
good,"I loved working there until I accepted a job as a team lead, then it slowly spiraled down. The people are nice and the guests can be a hassle but are appreciative of what you do. It’s just the upper management doesn’t understand your situation or fails to stand up for you when a guest gets upset. They put their job above integrity."
good,A clean environment but the truks were so out of order sometimes we wouldnt finish on schedule because managers didnt know how truck unloading goes and messes up the flow of the day
good,"Co workers slacked off and felt like I was asked to do more than others for the same or less pay. Overall decent, got 10% team member discount, pretty good pay, usually got free food during Christmas black Friday times, rewarded for getting people to sign up for redcards."
good,"I could see hating the job if the people I worked with weren't awesome."
good,It was easy to get in but depending on what job you can get it can be drastically different from person to person. If you’re on the bottom you’re expected to be at the job at 4 am and yelled at the whole time to make you move faster. If you can prove you’re reliable and move up take the chance. It gets easier.
good,"I was apart of the truck team. I unloaded the truck and then bowled aisles and stocked. I learned the store very well, where products are and able to bring customers to where they need to be if need be. Management was not great. but it's retail and it's not a shock. My store seemed to be not completely about the customer, and we're customer service, so that was my main priority.. my store also didn't work with my school schedule for college so I ended up quitting. Work culture was great. I appreciated most of the people I worked with and how helpful and the friendships I did make while there. Most days were a happy work environment. hardest part was the repetitiveness off the bowling the aisles. "
good,Typically if the store is busy then the environment at work can be really fast paced. It can be overwhelmingly if that isn't for you. Scheduling isn't always catered to a person either. Sometimes you work a lot of hours and sometimes you work none. Overall it wasn't the worst place to work but management at my specific location wasn't entirely the best either. I think it comes down to personal preference whether you like it or not. Some people love working there and some totally hate it.
good,"a regular day at target was stressful, but only because some customers are super rude. the worst part about working at target was sometimes the managers had no idea what they were doing and there was a lot of favoritism. the most enjoyable part of the job was the people that i met there. i stopped working there almost 10 years ago and i am still friends with some of the people i met there."
good,A typical day at work was waiting in one spot for a guest. If a guest finally needs to check out that’s when you not bored. The guest are also rude to people that aren’t their race.
good,"You are given a specific section to work in per day, and to help customers within that area. Cleaning, organizing, and downstocking is for you to do after your customers have been taken care of."
good,"Nice people, diverse, busy but tried to make it tolerable."
good,I worked for Target from 2014-2016 - overnights. I left because I got burnt out from working overnights and I just got fed up with the favoritism and lazy employees.
good,"Target is ok to work for. They are very progressive with their hiring policies. There pay is going to increase to $15.00 per hour which is ok if your not the breadwinner of your family. Expect to work very hard if you work in the back or on the floor. Customer service is very important. They offer employees a 5% discount, 10% for healthy eating. All in all a good place to work if you enjoy part time"
good,I loved working with my team but the management was very rude. They didn’t care about anyone but themselves. The back room is always a cluttered mess so it’s hard to get your tasks done. The devices rarely ever worked.
good,I worked as a cashier and also I work in the back were I did pick up order and delivered at a manor time frame I also shipped Oder to the client in a timely frame
good,The job was very toxic with some managers seeing things out of context and abusing power. However while others  were more fair in the standards of work
good,Target has excellent people working for them. I met so many people from all different walks of life and cultures. Management works real hard. HR is not employee friendly but I’m old fashioned and feel their role is to help. All they want to do is provide you with numbers and websites. Overall it was a wonderful place to work. If your a hard worker and want to make money. I’d recommend it.
good,A typical day consisted of filling in where ever there was a need. Had to adjust your time according to what was happening at that moment. Always busy
good,"A typical day at Target consists of unorganized, poorly managed, stressful hours. Managers take the strongest employees and work them to the ground while the slackers piggyback from their productivity. Hours are limited unless you're a leader, minimum of 13 hours per week is a typical schedule for entry level employees."
good,Learned about sales. How much your brand was up and down in sales and what you needed to make for the day to meet sales goal. Minimum hours given. Most enjoyable part was the employees made it easier to work. Learned teamwork.
good,The only reason I actually like working there is because of all my fellow team members. We're like this one big family. The leads expect a lot but you're getting paid to do it.
good,Since  I work for a contractor the management was very poor. They didn't communicate with each other. Every day you have to wait more than 30 minutos to see in witch  area would you be able to work.
good,"I left this company before my store gave up on itself. Also, I’m glad to hear my former manager who declined one guaranteed day off with my blind father, was finally fired."
good,Hardest part of the job is Standing for an entire shift.  I like that the Shift Supervisors jump in and run register when needed.  No one seems to be above anyone else.
good,"Working for Target is great you'll love your co workers at times and get along great with them."
good,Nothing really to comment about working at target. This was a good place for students or others looking to start their career or get into the job market.
good,"I was hired for the Christmas season, which, as you can imagine, was quite hectic. I hardly received any training, which was probably a result of my prior experience working in customer service. I worked primarily at the register, sometimes being sent down to guest services to help with returns. Clientele was generally quite nice, but some were a little crabby with it being the Christmas season. Management was almost nonexistent, with the only ""managers"" you'd see being your supervisors. Overall I would not recommend this to someone who has no experience working in retail."
good,"Target's workplace environment was great. Everyday wasn't the same for me. They needed help everywhere, so one minute I might work in the food ave, but then the next I could be working in soft lines."
good,It's hard to open a card everyday but I managed to constantly open a card maximum of 12 Target cards a day.  Sometimes it's stressful but it's part of our job.
good,"I enjoyed working at target. I wish that I was kept on but, it was a seasonal job. It is a fast pace store. Sometimes they didn’t give you heads up on the sale promotion for the holiday season."
good,"I was hired as a seasonal employee to assist with ship to store orders. It was a job that I would have continued to work at if I had been offered a position. My personal belief is that I was not offered a position because I got severely sick right at the time they were looking at who they were hiring on. I had wonderful management who would assist me if I ever had questions and made every day a good day. Only complaint I ever had while working, was the lack of equipment that was needed to efficiently do the job."
good,Train employees. Listen. Better communication about goings on. Hold leaders accountable. Make a fun environment. Be on top off all new job rollouts. Better hours.
good,"Nasty attitude Managers and ETL, LOD.. "
good,"Just like any job there are good and  bad points.  As a cashier and customer service employee you learn to deal with all sorts of people.  The new management expected more from each employee without understanding what was involved with each individual.  I was training, doing cash office reconciliations of the previous day and under a time crunch to accomplish this and train someone at the same time.  Many tasks became my responsibility even if I was off tor the day.  I felt it was in the best interest for all parties that I remove myself."
good,"It is hard to review Target as a company because each store is different in its own way.  I worked at 9 stores through my career spanning different cities and ""districts.""  There were stores that were off the charts amazing in all facets, the work-life was great, the opportunity for advancement was phenomenal, the atmosphere was a dream.  There were other stores that were the exact opposite and I saw more ETL's and STL's fired and hired than I could count.  The experience you walk away from Target having is outstanding, they really take time to invest in those that they hire.  It is extremely clicky and it is truly about who you know not how well you do.  I would recommend this job to anyone that has the flexibility to relocate and throw their life into their work with the possibility that it could really pay off.  Understand that there is an expectation that you are going to work a minimum of 60 hours a week and if you break down your hourly wage it will start off below the supervisors you are managing."
good,"Target offers a lot in terms of Pay and Benefits. At a salary position there becomes ZERO work life balance. You eat, sleep, and breathe Target. It is an expectation that the Store comes first and your life is on the back burner. It becomes worse if your manager is not a good one and quite frankly its the luck of the draw. There are really great ones out there and some terrible one."
good,"They completely over hired during holidays and even though I was meeting goals I was cut for my lack of experience."
good,"They were very Understanding about my situation Health problems. It was a fun place to work at, but at the same time the HR was more than hostile towards me."
good,"Working for this company was really fun. The work was easy the management could of stayed the same.The workers all got alone well. The hardest part about the job was when management kept changing. The most enjoyable part about working there was, I knew what I had to do and was trusted to do my job without being looked over."
good,"Target has a really diverse culture, which ensures that all employees are welcomed and accepted. Great experience for work, but it does have their limitations."
good,"Working for target was okay if you need a part time job specially if you a student, dont get many hours which makes a bit hard, sometime hours are cut without notice then all of sudden you be getting calls on days off to come in to work."
good,"The workplace is decent and kind. However, it is not the place to go to if you want to advance. A typical day doesn't exist. They will have you cover other department's shifts often. you never know what the day is going to look like."
good,"Definitely a workplace to gain a variety of skills, and experience with customers as well as others. Great place to start a career and promotion opportunities."
good,It can be very fast paced. The managers can be inconsiderate. Coworkers are very nice people who are willing to help you. There are times where you have to do two jobs at once.
good,Target is an okay place to work. The pay is okay but the hours are horrible you can’t get any over time and they give hours to who they want to give hours to.
good,Em um dia típico temos flexibilidade de horário de chegada. Aprendi bastante sobre legislação  aplicada ao transporte de produtos perigosos.
good,"It is overall a good place to work. I loved the people I worked with and the management was always willing to work with any issues that arose with scheduling conflicts that arose. With that being said, hours were never consistent."
good,"The pay is good for an unskilled job, but the hours are never enough to do what they want you to do, or stable enough to give you a good idea of how much you'll make in a given month."
good,"Target was a nice place to work. Friendly environment, lots of hours during holiday season.  The customers are decent and everyone works together for the most part."
good,It's like any other retail job. Really depends on what you make of it. It had simple everyday tasks to finish. How your day went really depended on the manager and the team since it really is a team effort. Management needs a huge improvement. The lack of effort they now put it and how much they really care just disappoints.
good,"My day would start with making sure my employee's had their breaks. Making sure everything was stocked and filled for the day. I learned how to multitask, and delegate. The management was good, but I didn't feel like I could go to them for help or advice. I tried to keep the culture up beat in my department. The hardest part was learning to walk away for the day, and knowing the department was going to run smoothly. The most enjoyable part was interacting with the customers."
good,"A typical day at work starts with your own department's agenda which is over ruled by the manager's agenda but not abolished by it so if you happen to get a manager that has no idea how to manage their own time or who doesn't work specifically in your area then your area suffers for it. Luckily you're the only one scheduled and a guest wants to take up about 45 minutes of your time deciding not to buy a particular item they asked you ten questions about which causes your lets say ""personal sales"" to drop which will reflect poorly upon your performance. Even though you have completed your daily tasks which had been compounded with the whims of someone who is only looking to improve their own standing within the upper management you also must stay vigilant because theft and walkouts are probably a big thing in your area so be sure to not look too busy and say a friendly ""hello"" to all of your guests because the only sure fire way to stop a thief is to be present during shopping hours."
good,Busy days but very fun and interesting. Management at that location was very complicated. The workplace ( A&A team) on the other hand I love dearly the best working women I've ever met. We had a tough place in the store but managed well with out team lead.
good,"-stressful workplace"
good,"Great job for first timers. Pay is a little low and yearly raises are pathetic, I got a ""great/excellent"" rating and was given an 8 cent raise one year and a 12 cent raise another year..."
good,Great company will really give you the tools to succeed. The hours are rough and things are constantly changing for the better or worse. May not be good if you have a family
good,"Target was very fast pace and competitive... We had to sell and sign people up for "" Red Cards""... There was a certain goal you had to reach each day at target"
good,I ended on a horrible note. I stopped caring. I loved my job and what I did but the management really was horrible. Called the hotline and they fired the store manager instead of the person causing the trouble. It doesn’t make sense.
good,"Really enjoyed my time there, you can move to any department if they have an opening. They treated every one with respect and also the Hr was very understanding"
good,"Target is a nice place to work at the pay is pretty good for a retail store, they also do yearly raises so that is a bonus. They just need to work on management and improvement in the store."
good,"I began as a lower level employee and was attracted to Target because of its tuition reimbursement program. After earning my degree, I have learned that Target very rarely promotes from within. I have also learned that to be promoted from within, there is a specific path that they try to ""encourage"" you to take. My degree is in communications and I wanted to interview for an advertising position, but was pressured to apply for a management position at the DC instead. I refused and was later told that if a position opens, I will have to just apply and that there were no programs in place to help current employees move up in the company. I thought this was a bit strange considering that the company paid for my education. I do enjoy my job and wish there were more opportunities for advancement."
good,"I loved the pay at Target, but a good amount of the Team Leads are hypocrites. They will tell you to do one thing and once you do it the way that they told you to do it, they tell you something different from what they said."
good,I really like the fact that people can be themselves. Tattoos and hair color aren't a problem. Same with facial and body piercings. Good system to get the job done.
good,"Working at target was both fun and stressful-stressful because you may have to stay past your scheduled shift-fun because the customers made the experience great. Some of the management was disorganized. If someone did not come in for their shift you may have to cover until someone else comes in. "
good,Target always had a very clear objective and goal we were workin towards. Management always makes sure we were comfortable and aware of what we were to be doing. Also very safe and take employee concerns very seriously.
good,This is a great place to work overall.  With any retail position there are ups and downs when it comes to scheduling.  I was in shipping and receiving toward the end of my time there and it was extremely stressful trying to get the team members to do their part in keeping a safe backroom environment.
good,"The environment was always changing. As far as retail stores go, its fairly standard. "
good,"Work flys for me, there is always something to do. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t mind working at Target, I just wish management was different and people actually cared and didn’t throw you under the bus. Other than that it’s great."
good,Working as the restocking overnight crew was fun and simple. They had one manager that only spoke Spanish and as I did not speak Spanish i did not get along with him.
good,"Hours are few, management is usually clueless, but the job is fun. The best thing about this company is that they accept everyone. It sucks that there are not better discounts for employees and more benefits for part time."
good,"night shift, early morning hours, stocking shelves, meeting people, doing the work, finding stuff, cashier, working at night, food area, unloading packages"
good,"It was a fast paced environment "
good,Target hires and lays off based on past business. Your position is never really secure.  Was laid off and called back many times.  Finally had to find something more stable.
good,"Gstl/managers at target in miramar are horrible to you unless you speak Spanish , They put you on the schedule and take you off last minute without letting you know and against your schedule that you have set."
good,Target was interesting. Placed different places all the time so there was not really a lot of consistency in that manner. Management was okay. Pay is the best part of the job.
good,"I worked as a cashier and it was pretty great for a retail job. The only problem I had my managers. They would stand right behind me, making both me and the customer uncomfortable. They would then pull me aside (even if the line was packed with customers) and tell me what I did wrong. Usually it was weird stuff like not making enough conversation. In my opinion, the customer is there to shop and I am there to work, and constantly pulling employees aside isn't good for either of us. I, as well as other employees, have gotten 2+ ""employee check ups"" in one day. The job itself is awesome, but the managers made it absolutely awful."
good,"Working at target is just as you'd expect. You work as a cashier and ring up items. It is a good entry level job for highschool students and such."
good,Need more companies with various works of life working for target!! In my mind with different people working there things could be way better environment!
good,Constantly interacting with customers and management. Relocating from cash register to different departments. Keeping all areas of the store clean and replenished. Friendly demeanor at all times. Team player.
good,"The place has a lot of favoritism. If one person is cherry picking, and you go up to manager to report it, they won't do anything about it as long as the person gets their daily production quota."
good,"It was a nice place to work, enjoyed the culture. I disliked the sales approach, I felt it was unrealistic for the company. Target is a store that sells more than just clothes. People do not come to target to get styled by employees. Target doesn't have a big enough clothing department to even try to do this approach."
good,"Target is a good place to work. They strive to teach you new things outside your comfort zone. They take your family and time into consideration. The hardest part about the job was not getting off work at the time you are supposed to end. If you are scheduled to close at 9PM, there is a good chance you could be there until 11PM."
good,It's a very chill and relaxed job and i liked what i did there because it requires physical work. You are definitely going to work when you come here.
good,"Job is not difficult, just having to stand for 8 hours is hard....but it's all good.  Team members are like a family and for the most part work well with each other"
good,"I been employed for target for most 6 six and they have been amazing. I strongly recommend. "
good,It was ok. All i can say is i wish they provided better hours and better pay but overall my experience was exceptional at target i dont have to many negative things to say
good,"Work day stressful,  how to work cashier friendly customers, able to help customer. not good communication with management. nothing steady talking to customers"
good,Not all targets are the same but the location in meyerland had poor management. the cut hours a lot the good thing is they gave a raise but not enough hours. the culture was growing but a etls were bias
good,"The title pretty much sums up everything wrong with this store. If you find yourself in an ULV store and you want hours, RUN.. Run very fast.. If you just need like 15 hours to survive off than this job isn't so bad... Sorry, you could pay me $30 an hour, but 15 hours won't cut it Target..."
good,"Working by myself in my department can be a challenge which I occasionally find overwhelming. I have learned to handle it and get compliments from guest on it. I enjoy meeting guests, watching the children as I greet them by name. I enjoy my co-workers and we usually have a good time."
good,"Most upper management was pleasant to work for, though there was some level of micromanaging. Co-workers are generally friendly, as were most customers. The job itself isn't very complicated or difficult but you can expect any of the general frustrations that come with working retail."
good,"I enjoyed working at this job a lot,. Relaxed atmosphere and good benefits. I enjoyed what i did and other than it being far from home i loved going to work everyday."
good,good place to work.  ETL's need more hands on training. they dont have a good idea on what it really takes to complete tasks.  workload can be too much and too much is expected of the team
good,"This position used to be fun and exciting prior to the new ""direction"" the Assets Protection pyramid is going."
good,Hours were the worst part of the whole job. They always hire tons of new people for seasonal positions and cut your hours where you won’t work for up to two weeks
good,"The managers there are lazy "
good,I believe every target is different but i felt as if i worked too much for such low paychecks. I was also a high school student working here but they will only let you stay until a certain time and would never have a set schedule every week. They are also very strict on the workers there.
good,"You are always on the go, most days there isn't a slow down. Coworkers are easy to get along with and if there was an issue (there wasn't) you could work with them to resolve the issue."
good,I really enjoyed my job. Learned a lot by hands on. I am very proud of the that I did. I felt that I was under utilized and it was taken for granted that my flexibility was unlimited.
good,If you're going to work in the sweat shop that is retail Target is probably as good as you can get. Great atmosphere and friendly managerial staff make working with customers a breeze.
good,"Of all the jobs i've worked I found target is rather laid back but if you show yourself as a go getter they will use you to your limit and as long/much as they can and if you do any work ower than that average of your best then they tell you could be better, its frustrating knowing that they demand your best and then some."
good,I originally decided to apply at Target because I really like the store and the environment. It certainly lived up to my expectations. However it's not a job you can make a living wage at.
good,"In general, it's a great company to work for as a first job or part time job as they're flexible with schedules and time off and have a lot of benefits. At my store in particular there were a lot of culture and morale issues among the management team, but I don't believe that's the case at every store."
good,"The GSTLs are very different and that makes for either fun days or stressful days. The hours will also be very inconsistent, as an example i would have almost 40 hours one week and about 20 the next."
good,Good place for college students. Not a good place for someone with a family. Hours aren’t consistent. Favoritism. Hard to move up. Once you move up you’re next move it out.
good,It wasent as bad as the navy but its good for someone who is getting started in the work force. it teaches you about time management and how to work with people.
good,It's a great place with a family feel for your coworkers but if you step out of line once it's hard for you to get back to where you were in the beginning.
good,"Pay is great but if you are looking for advancement within corporate security, there is nothing. You are either a Security Specialist or a top manager."
good,I like working with others and in a fast paced environment. I tend to get bored quickly and it keeps me focused. It was a great fit for me i was employed seasonal!
good,"Would not recommend Flow Team lead. Extreme amount of stress and frustration relative to your compensation.  Usually made a key holder which holds you hostage from calling out even when dreadfully Ill when you're the only one who can open doors for the truck and backroom teams in the morning.  Experiences can vary between stores but at mine most of the etls were poorly trained in their workcenter. There is also a very toxic almost middle school like work environment with a lot of backstabbing,  rumors, and going behind each others backs. And the management was very involved with a lot of this atmosphere.  Not to say it's all bad, you meet a lot of good people and it's a good job to start but definitely not for a career."
good,"You will be constantly moving, those that are just standing around are on break, but trust in me they will be right back to constant movement shortly. Management was good, stores are run and operated efficiently and without redoubt."
good,Inclusive environment. Great learning opportunity. Perfect for student job or 2nd income. Flexible scheduling as well as discount and time off. Benefits once requirements are met.
good,Stocked shelves and assisted customers. Part time seasonal position. We worked as a team. Friendly workplace and nice customers.Christmas Seasonal job. They did not keep on after Holiday.
good,"A typical work day at target is a fun experience, yes it is a lot of hard work but it feels good to know i did a good job. Over the past year I've learned how to deal with all sorts of people. Working at target has really expanded how i see people. The management at target is alright, they don't seem to really care about the employees as we are easily replaceable, but they provided a fun work environment."
good,"Each day is different as it is a retail store so each day changes according to the guests that come in. I learned how to communicate with guests and conform to their desires. The hardest part of the job is to keep an open mind as to what can happen in a shift, while the most enjoyable is being able to meet new people and find a connection with that person."
good,"Target was a great experience, but they don't allow you to move up or train other positions.  It's a great ""first-time"" job, but I personally didn't feel like I was going to advance with them."
good,"Overall a good/learning experience and ok place to work, gain experience and get the opportunity to not only be a employee but also become a corporate owner on the ladder of the corporation"
good,"Front end is the easiest part of the store to work in. Friendly leaders make it easy to love working there. However, dont expect to be getting a lot of hours, even if you have worked there longer than your managers. Pay is great compared to other jobs. Benefits are only available to those who work 30 or more hours, which is nearly impossible to due unless youre management."
good,Poor management. Too many managers over to many areas. Poor communication and retaliation against team members who report misconduct at higher levels.
good,Good place to work and even good hours until they hire seasonal pea pole then your hours will get cut a little. But if that is fine with you then perfect job!
good,It's entry level. The environment can be fairly aggressive and they expect you to pick up everything super quick and get a bit irritated if you don't. I only briefly worked there because their 3 day absence policy in your first 90 days and I got into a motorcycle accident and therefore was let go due to my exceeded number of absences. The store manager at my location is notorious for being a bit of a micromanager. You can't get your employee discount if you don't use cash it red card and you have to sign up for a red card to get the full discount which was super annoying.
good,"It was a very positive work environment, but responsibilities were not evenly distributed and that caused it to be very stressful on myself. I have problems with anxiety, and being one of 4 people trained to work in a cafe, leaving one person per shift, made it very difficult when there was a call in or no call no show. There were many times I was forced to work double shifts and work through the lunch and dinner rush by myself, and then close by myself which interfered with my ability to get home."
good,"Fast paced job. Has to be aware since is a store. Build customer service experience and communicative skills. Team memembers are great, management had it’s own group of people they liked and let do what they wanted while other had to pick up for the ones doing nothing."
good,It was a great job to work but it was hard waking up at 5 A.M. to be ready for work at 6 A.M. it was a very labor intensive job as well. With very strict and hard to please management. It was also an extremely stressful job am very fast paced.
good,Worked as an overnight remodel team member to re-arrange the store per management instructions and layout sheets. Work lasted until the project was completed.
good,"Target is a great place to work as long as you don't mind working long retail hours. I work 10+ hours a day 5 days a week. Closing rotations are exhausting but worth it for the pay. I work security and the job is grinding at times, dealing with the less desirable of guests and TM issues."
good,Over all I loved working at target  beside everything that went on around me it didnt effect me from completing my job.I was crossed trained so I used that to an advantage to get a head
good,Not for the faint of heart. If you dont think you can handle 36 hours in 3 days of being at work doing physically demanding lay or this job isn't for you.
good,"Depending on your position the work day can look different but what is consistent is creating a family like environment for the client. They are called ""Guest"" not customers."
good,"Everyone who works there is extremely nice and the work environment is very friendly. Not much opportunity for advancement, and getting enough hours to secure benefits is almost impossible."
good,"I made some of my best friends working at Target, it is a great company to work for especially just starting out into the retail world. As long as you listen to GSA's, be on time and work your butt off you'll be fine."
good,"I worked here as a seasonal associate and they completely did me so wrong. They told me as long as I showed up on time and I did my work, that I would be offered a position to stay on. They fired me after my seasonal position even though I had never missed a day and I was one of the HARDEST working people at the company. I was very shocked and very upset."
good,"There is a big need to be fast paced and accurate. Even if you are good at both, management is not the best. Your hard work could be recognized by one lead, and the next lead will say it's not enough. The variable workload can be stressful especially when short staffed or when management does not have the work hours to distribute. My employment and workplace culture was very enjoyable for the most part until I was working with new team leads who would constantly breathe down my neck. Overall it was a good job, especially the fellow team members I worked alongside but management became unbearable after a few years and also I was not given a fair raise for my accomplishments yearly. The best thing to do there is constantly check in with management to see what you can personally improve. Once you're appeasing their expectations, then your 110% effort will be recognized, hopefully."

good,Target is a decent company to work for. Many employees also had other jobs to make ends meet. No over time. Easy to trade and give up shifts if needed
good,The management is good but I don't see a place for advancement for me.  I like the job for the most part but it does require some heavy lifting and it is faced pace. What I have an issue with is the hours that they give you.  Trying to get 40 hours a week is tough and sometimes it doesn't happen.  I have kids to take care of so I need a full-time job.  The people that I work with make it a nice place to work but I also don't like working weekends.
good,It a place where people order stuff off online then we box it then send it to nearby target store near the customer they also deliver to the perseos house
good,"Everything is ok, but not a forever job. They woek with your schedule, so its perfect for atudent life. Not many advancement opportunities. Favoritism is shown"
good,I was managed very well there. There was a lot of nice people to work with as well. I found a better opportunity at Walmart.  The opportunity was in their Maintenance department. Yet that department only fit me temporarily.
good,While working with peers is enjoyable and the work is reasonably paced situations occur too often of excess workload without proper time provided to complete said workload.
good,"Target is an alright retail environment to work in. Management was acceptable, but I felt intimidated and talked down to frequently. My skills weren't desired nor my input wanted on many issues regarding my department. Availability was scattered and favoritism prominent."
good,There are a lot of pros and cons working at target. It's a wonderful place to work if it's your first job. The experience was wonderful and working at target will help you gain and improve skills.
good,Ok place to work if you work at the right store. It can be a fun job but also very stressful as certain managers go to far when it comes to micro management.
good,The most enjoyable part of this job is the team and always having something to do. It is a very demanding job though and requires you to be on your feet nearly all day.
good,Target is an enjoyable workplace however it is on you to make it fun and to enjoy what you do there. You have to be patient with guest and with co workers.
good,"Got hired for seasonal with very high promises of the job becoming full time with higher pay. Job was fun, fellow employees were great to work with, management was unorganized and uninformative. I didn't find out that they had laid me off until the last day of my job there. Minimum wage not worth the work I was doing especially for seasonal, but if you need a job in a pinch like I did and would like something active and don't mind the pay, it's not a bad choice."
good,"The job can be fast paced, and sometimes trying to meet with the expectations of the job make you feel as if you are being pulled in twenty directions at one time.  The biggest issue I had with my experience is the expectation that if a customer needed assistance you must immediately give it to them, even if you are already in the process of assisting another customer.  It felt as if you must continuously push the current customer further down the quay of assistance in a never-ending cycle that left each one dissatisfied with their service."
good,"I enjoyed my interactions with customers and I took pride in being quick and accurate in ringing people up."
good,Target payed me very well and I loved my job there and did not want to leave. All of my coworkers were very nice. The only downside is there was an awful lot of lack of communication between managers.
good,"Enjoyed working there, I feel the training could have been better. They had a process that seemed to work well for them. Their scheduling was fair with rotating weekends and night shifts."
good,Good place to work for retail. Hours were good. Management at my store needs work. No room for advancement in my position though. Other employees were great to work with.
good,"I love our guests and everyone super friendly. Howerver there was poor commuication. And the hours were not enough for me to make a living. And no advancement opportunities. But they were there when i needed them. If this is you first job, or if youre in college it would be fantastic."
good,"If youre looking to make a quick buck for the time being, its a good job. Crazy hours during the holidays but you'll make good money. Its retail so that comes with the territory."
good,"I would help unload the morning truck at 6 am which would take just over an hour, then put the new products out on the shelves throughout the day. You work with a team of people and job can be physically tiring, but if you work with fun people the job is fun too. One of the best parts of the job is if you start your workday at 6:00 am you end it by 2:30 pm."
good,"Target is a great company to work for, very solid. I enjoyed my time there, management made sure it was a fun and productive workplace. Target has many benefits and very fair discounts, indeed."
good,"No teamwork, look out for yourself, work hard and fast, trust no one, get the job done, and go home. If you don't make quota, you won't be there long."
good,"it is often expected that you do more than you are capable, while managers barely do anything and only streamline their work to other. it's very easy to work in management. and everything seems to take forever: promotion, any changes,.."
good,"In the beginning, it was difficult to get used to the overnight schedule. Although, once you become adjusted to the schedule, it's no different than working any day job. For my seasonal, remodel position there were established deadlines, because of this the work environment demanded speed and accuracy. The position helped to develop these qualities in my work ethic. I also learned how to navigate a computer to locate specific documents, as well as how to read and follow a planogram document. The overnight shift is difficult at times, but the pay is good and this position will push the boundaries of your maximum potential."
good,"Overall I had a blast interacting with the customers and my co-workers. Fast paced environment, always amazing helping people throughout the store and be appreciated."
good,"As a contractor, typical day was development activities during regular business hours and then production support late in the evening and night. With good support team from Syntel offshore, was able to complete all deliverables."
good,target was my first job and I loved every minute of it. everyone got along to a degree and I made plenty of friends I still keep in touch with to this day. target is a decent place to work
good,"Target was my first job, and like any job, it has its ups and downs but I could always trust that things would be relatively stable to the very end. While it is true that some of the managers were very adept at wasting my time, and the hypocrisy at work is nothing short of breathtaking for at least one person involved, once I got into the groove. I managed well"
good,A typical day at work started at 7:00 am i would take care of the cash office duties first. This included balancing tills from the prior night and running the numbers through a computer program.  hen i would move on to the pricing team for the remainder of my shift.
good,"Working at Target has not been awful; however, working from 4am to 12:30 pm 5 days a week has had detrimental effects on my social life, particularly due to the fact that I have yet to receive two days off in succession. Not a bad part time or temporary job, but I would not recommend making a career of it"
good,I would come into work at 6 am to 6 pm everyday with only two breaks. I think unloading trucks all day was the hardest part. Going home was the most enjoyable part for me.
good,"Wasn't busy there often."
good,This is a great place for someone's first job. I would highly recommend it for someone who is retiring for extra money. Anything other than entry level positions you have to learn how to adapt to their Target culture to move up in management.
good,"Nice place to work. Hours and days aren't the best, l had trouble with starting time. Scheduled stating time was the biggest problem. I had to work around newborn and my husband."
good,"temp to hire job, fast paced, and willing to teach and expand job responsibilities. Nice environment and people. Nice place to grow and meet new people. Advancement is possible."
good,The management is very friendly with customers and their staff. Some work days were crazy and stressful and others were slow and relaxing. The best part of working for Target was being able to meet all of the customers and building relationships with them.
good,"Basic retail functions. Stocking, cashier and finding items that were left behind by a customer after they decided they did not want it. I also worked in the food court. duties were; cooking, cleaning, taking orders and restocking."
good,"If you enjoy a fast paced, competitive environment, Target Distribution is for you. A typical day is spent packing items securely and quickly into boxes and sending those boxes onto a conveyor."
good,"Your general mix of lazy incompetent workers and hard workers with airy management. Expectations were low, and no punishment for the workers who barely did anything. Okay job otherwise."
good,"The days went by really quick, hours were decent but you had to be willing to constantly be pushing redcards. I didn't really like harassing my customers, so i couldn't do it. The managers and co-workers were nice. I didn't really like or understand the shift change policies."
good,The people at target are very rude to other people as far as employees. they say they are a team orientated business but in actuality they are all self players and only care about themselves
good,"As long as you have 2 managers that get along, then all is good. If both managers turn in their resignations on the same day, nothing good will come about. But overall, I enjoyed my time with Target."
good,"Working for target helped me explore my organizational skills, as well as commitment as i was there for 2 years. They are very flexible with there schedule which was helpful as I was a college student."
good,"•Stock shelves, help guests, organize shelves, sometimes backup cashier."
good,"All of the employees (known as team members at Target) had almost the same tasks; stocking, zoning (organizing, though the majority of the time it wasn't started until shortly before closing time), team lifts were quite frequent since it was Christmas time ( 2+ people lifting/ moving one item at a time), and almost all employees usually did more than what was expected. Since Target was my first real job, I learned how to have good customer, how to deal with difficult employees, how to work a cash register, work as a team, and all the minor things employees have to go through for training. The management, unfortunately, was not good. Two of the three managers were rude to a lot of the employees, even when they were doing nothing but the job tasks, and also expressed favoritism, making it known who they ""liked more"" than others. They were not very professional. The hardest part of the job was the constant running around the store to assist customers, back up the front end (registers), and the very large amount of things that had to get stocked (there was never not anything to be stocked, until after the New Year). The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to meet and get along with the other employees, along with being able to get job experience, considering it was my first job."
good,I loved working with my other team members to keep sales up and customers happy. I had a wonderful team with me and would gladly go back to working for this establishment.
good,this job is great for a first job but if you plan on moving up in life or work this isn't the place they tend to only move up those who are favorited not those who work double the amount of others.
good,"Working at Target wasn't the best job I've had but it wasn't the worst. I never met the store manager, not even once which I though was a bit ridiculous. I feel a a manger should at least greet their employees and keep in contact with them every now and then."
good,Target strictly is company based. There are times where all you did was be the company. Which may be fine for those who want to work 10 plus years but for me it was not. Great people to work with that is on your same level. Management is hard to understand.
good,"the thing i loved most about target was their flexible hours. however, this ended due to a manager error and also my father passing away? made no sense ."
good,Target is normally relaxed when it comes to it work load. The hours are easy to snag if you want more. There isn't much room to move up in the company.
good,"no support from team leads or higher management,  issues with maternity leave/loa approval resulting in having to resign"
good,"Clock in. Look at assigned area for the night. Management was decent 80% of the time. The hardest part of the job was zoning 3 parts of the store in one night.. alone and reshop. The most enjoyable was the discount, quality of merchandise in the store, and flexible schedule."
good,"Typical day at work would be assist customers on any questions, and ring up their items. The work environment and management  was great. Although, the hardest part of the job was to get my shifts switched for finals week."
good,"I did not enjoy the time that I was there, but they have gone under new management! When I was there, they were hiring for seasonal and they laid a lot of people off"
good,I have been working for Target for a total of 9 months now. I have learned so much in costumer service and working with the team leaders. I have over all really enjoyed my time at Target.
good,Pleasant environment with fun people.  I enjoyed my time there.  They do offer incentives when you are able to sell a Red Card.  They were accommodating with the hours I requested.
good,"i worked there for 9 yrs and i was the best person that they had. but this past ocober would have been 10 yrs and that if they gave me the pay rate that i needed when i was there i would not have left plus with the hrs. its just a job for teenagers to work,."
good,"Change of management, whole chaotic change in work environment. The long term workers there become nasty, decent pay but, sometimes can be fun, if your a student working here and have no other choice, then its good, but here in charlotte there are plenty."
good,"Target began making cut backs to stay in budget. They did not give employees notice and began cutting peoples positions. I talking about people that had been working there for 10+  years, They got them to train these new groups of people that would work for less and then took their jobs."
good,"very little flexability on work schedule. Requested hours seldom followed.  employees and managers were fantastic, some assistant managers had a chip on thier shoulders and on a power trip."
good,"I've worked at two different Targets, and they are both completely different in every manner. It really depends where you work. It can range from an awful environment to a warm welcoming one. Choose location wisely."
good,"Working at Target is like working at any other retail place. It has your basic pros and cons. Management could have been better, and training should be taken more seriously. Once you've been there for awhile and learn the ropes, it can be a pretty laid back easy job. When starting out, people tend to make things harder than they are, but with time it gets a lot easier."
good,The Target I worked at could not keep a manager or other Team Members long. A lot of the ETLs formed cliques and it was just very childish for someone to have a college degree to form cliques and talk about other ETLs and Team Members behind their backs like they were still in high school.
good,"I wish target was better about schedules. I want designated days of the week I'm working. Unfortunately, that is never given to me. Management is always great and they always work as a team."
good,this is a very personalized review because I personally don't like the feel of working for a big company because it's as if you're not really important because when you leave there's a lot more people willing to take your place
good,"I started off as a team member. It was definitely fun and it's not hard to learn other areas. If you're interested in promoting it's just a matter of being a good worker and communicating those goals with your Store Team Leader."
good,The first five years were great. The management were great people that did everything they could to make my job safe and enjoyable. The last three years were pretty bad. Management turnover was crazy i couldnt keep up with all the different names and all of their new rules. Some wanted me to break rules i knew would get me terminated.
good,"Start real early in the morning.  No guarantee hours.  Need to work almost every weekend.  The pay is just above minimum wage.  I person does alot of physical work, for little pay."
good,It is a reliable store with fun working people.  The hours are flexible and have a understanding of work life balance.  You also get a store discount.
good,love working with people it was fun the people were friendly the hours were good helping customers is always a good thing it makes me feel happy and brings a smile to my face.
good,not a bad place to work with the right management. and placement of personal but needs better organization and time frame of duties that have to be done for the day
good,"Target provided a foundation to work with and manage people.  This is a fast paced, evolving environment in the retail industry.  The high volume pace requires people to work with adversity on a daily basis."
good,The management was not the best they were way to harsh on everyone and if they could punish us they would. It was nice having them provide free food all the time.
good,"good job"
good,"I really enjoyed working at Target, I enjoy working with people face to face and helping customers.  Target's benefits and compensation, while better than many in the industry leave a lot to be desired.  The labor is also physical, which is not a bad thing, but days get long and it can be exhausting."
good,"This is a job, not a career. Not a bad place to work, but it depends on what you do their. There is a lot of stress put onto cashiers especially to sign people up for credit cards."
good,"best management"
good,The Company treats the employees well during the holiday season.  The work schedule is flexible and accommodates every employees specific needs and requests.  The only downside to this position is the continued promotion of the red card.
good,Not bad overall. Unpredictable hours and scheduling and trying to request time off. Benefits are pretty low. compensation is slightly above average in the industry.
good,I learned how to maintain a clean environment at work and kept a steady pace. General management needed work but the the other management was great. My Co workers were friendly and helped each other out.I enjoyed it because it was easy.
good,Every day I was doing something different learned about plumbing issues and how to make each department satisfied .setting up rooms for the talent watching and helping to get the preformes and watching the preformes getting set to preform
good,"Work is fast and impactful, management is erratic, and your career is heavily reliant on your manager.  Like any large corporation, it has its share of political maneuvering, but it isn't always about the work you perform or how well you can do the job but who you know."
good,It falls to whether or not your store management is decent. The relationship with the store management controls the quality of the working environment and culture.
good,"Managers can be very cutthroat with very unrealistic goals for the work day. However, it can be a great place to work at and employees are usually very helpful."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company as I learned how to set new displays and place it in such a way that it appealed to the customers."
good,Managers do not recognize the good you do and have done. From my expirence they only seem to wanna say you dont do any work and keep bringing that up no matter what you do
good,worked as a cashier for the holiday and stayed on as a stacked of the shelves. co-workers were helpful .the hardest part of the job was straightening the shelves after the customers.work in a  retail environment.could work either days or could work nights.
good,A typical day starts off very fast paced as management is trying to have us unload the truck as fast as possible. My co-workers and I would take direction and listen and learn from our managers input and apply it to our work. The hardest part is meeting the extreme expectations the business has on getting things done on time. Very unrealistic time hacks. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping a guest get exactly what they needed and informing them on other products that might enhance whatever it is that they are purchasing.
good,"The company as a whole is great. The store I worked at did have old vs new employee politics, but otherwise a great working atmosphere."
good,Enjoyed working with the team members. Accomplished many good goals. It was great to have contact with customers and assist with informing them of locations of products though out the store. And finalizing their visit as the cashier was also a satisfaction to me as I was able to make their visit successful.
good,Clear daily work expectations. Generally a fun place to work. Little acknowledgment or appreciation for excelling in work performance.
good,"HR doesn't pay much attention to availability or hours desired. Depending on the managers that day it could be amazing or an absolute disaster. The worst part by far is how management does nothing about the amount of call outs in a day, week, or month per person."
good,"Target is a great company, and the company values their Team Members. However, the management in my store does not. It's a very fast pace, customer service oriented, entry job for All-ages."
good,"Some days were difficult but for the most part, my job was pretty easy as a hardlines sales associate. I actually loved that job when you compare it to anything else I've experienced."
good,The department leaders and other co workers are fun to work with and are very helpful. I like meeting new people and the only problem I have with Target is not having enough working hours.
good,It was great working with guest. Only thing is getting cross trained or getting a raise was kind of out of the question. I never hit forty hours while working there and therefore never received any benefits.
good,"unloading trucks then stocking shelves making sure material are up to date,co workers were nice to work with,strong team"
good,Responsible for the Logistics department for the day to day routines. Overall the job was very enjoyable but the work life balance was nonexistent. The store was overall very divided we went 12 months without store manager and department managers were all out to blame each other. I had zero support even from my boss. The only support I had was backroom team leader. Target as a company was great but the store i was at was absolutely horrible.
good,"Provide guest assistance resolving any questions or concerns quickly and accurately in a positive helpful manner. Operate computerized cash register, process cash, checks, and credit and debit transactions."
good,"My job was unloading the freight and stocking the floor, keeping it clean. Taking care of customers needs. Cashing customers out with their purchases."
good,"very fast and busy work days, holidays are the worst."
good,"A typical work day for my position at Target includes: organizing mine and others duties that day, setting an isle according to a planogram and pushing product onto said isle. Other duties also include: helping guests, cashiering and assisting other team members. "
good,"I have worked with some amazing pharmacists and pharmacy techs.  A typical day at work starts with right of the bat with filling the auto prescriptions that were already in the queue... Helping guests as they come in for new prescriptions, counseling and/or OTC questions.  Basically doing the daily routine pharmacy core roles, but mostly concentrating on patient health.  Management can be tough at times because essentially your paycheck and raise depends on how well the store (Target ) does. And you're dealing with management who are not pharmacists and don't exactly understand what it is to be a pharmacist. The hardest part of the job is dealing with insurance companies over the phone. It can take a lot of time to even get to take to a representative and solve insurance problem.  The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing your guests happy. Especially when they tell you how much they love this pharmacy team and they would never go any where else for their prescriptions."
good,Working at Target was enjoyable. Interacting with the customers and helping when in need was the best part about Target.
good,Would come in the morning and put last nights returns away. I would fill any outs on the floor. Make sure signing was updated. Made sure all high priced items were securely wrapped. I would push merchandise through out the day to fill the floor. If any vendors would come I would assist them and learn about their product to teach our guest. I would partner up with management to update the department.
good,"First time working in retail, great experience working for Target. Had the opportunity to work with a great diverse team of people.We worked hard to make sure guest were satisfied with shopping experience."
good,Company as a whole is aiming for positive image but on a store level management needs huge improvements. Environment is extremely busy and it's hard to balance personal and work priorities. Benefits were reduced dramatically to only full time team members with more than 34 hours average per week and packages are way more costly now.
good,"The store I worked at, you worked very hard and there was not much recognition for your hard work from upper management.  Custmer service was a big area of my job duties."
good,"I went in, i did exactly what they told me to do, i went home. Nothing more, nothing less , kinda easy. My management wasn't the most knowledgeable about everything they should but they knew enough to tell us what to do"
good,Sometimes I helped unload the trucks. Usually I was dividing up the merchandise into carts to be distributed to the different aisles to be put up in its proper location on the sales floor.I would put up freight & take trash & back stock to receiving to be processed. Sometimes do challenge.
good,It's a good first job while you're getting through school. Unfortunately they don't promote hourly employees to salaried positions. Instead they hire almost exclusively interns from their business college.
good,"The work environment was really laid back. The management overall was terrible, but there were a few who were amazing. I learned that there is truly no I in TEAM. They believe in teamwork."
good,"Target was very client, team focused environment. Staff who started at the same time, breaked at the same time. Safety was also very important, while working in the warehouse safety boots were a must. We were encouraged to work quickly yet also provide customer service to all guests while on the sales floor. Daily huddles were a must in order to communicate how well the store was doing, what needed to improve and how to always engage the guests. The work which included lifting, sorting, and stocking was hard and was time management based. What I like most was the team camaraderie, the visibility and approachability of management, and the push to provide an hassle free shopping experience for the guests."
good,"Employee culture made the job fast, fun and friendly. The employees willingly help one another out without having to ask twice. The guests were the most enjoyable part of the job due to them being so thankful when you went above and beyond to help them get what they came into the store to get."
good,"I manage the front end department of the store. "
good,"I enjoyed my time at Starbucks/Target. The managers were very helpful, the customers were nice, and I had amazing co-workers. I would recommend this job to others."
good,"Target was a decent place to work if you can get passed the fact that some managers treat everyone like little children.  Also by saying ""flexible schedule"" they mean you need to be willing to work when they say.  You must be available 24/7.  If you are not expect very low hours per week.  And say goodbye to weekends!"
good,"Target was a very hands on company. I had to make sure that I  complied to all there changing standards day to day ( Ie.) Asking for red cards, stocking shelves and end caps and bagging areas. Keeping my area's clean and organized. Helping reshop at the end of the night. Greeting costumer's and pulling them in for sales and helping them find merchandise. Mentioning weekly sales and implementing them to company standard's of sale tactics . The hardest part of the job was staying on top of my daily duties with a floor manager who at times had a attitude issue and was a little too aggressive with employees about red cards and working sometime right through my scheduled break times. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting various people and making lasting relationships with amazing coworkers and costumers."
good,"My experience at Target was nothing but amazing.  A typical day at work involved lots of collaborations and opportunities to solve problems.  I primarily focussed on individual projects in the audit space but branched out to communication and marketing as well.  During my time I developed new processes, testing and implemented new technology for hundreds of team members and got to lead various initiatives.  The most challenging but rewarding aspect of the job was the critical feedback, sometimes it got excessive but was mostly done as a way to help foster development.  My co workers were by far the best part of the experience.  I learned so much and look forward to transition those skills to my next employer."
good,"A typical work day includes striving to drive sales daily by assisting guests in looking for the item they seek and also informing them of various ways to save additional money through shopping experience by offering them to apply for a Target Red Card or show them how to use the Cartwheel mobile app. During my time at Target, I have learned a great deal about team work and building relationships with co-workers. I have learned that if we all work together the job will be more efficient in providing more products that will be made available to guests. The management was great in making sure that the work environment was safe and friendly for employees. The hardest part of the job was not having an item in stock that a guest needed at a particular time which caused them to shop elsewhere. The easiest part of the job to consistently interact with my co-workers and be able to take directions."
good,"Target is a retail company which attempts to differentiate itself from competitors by having an inclusive and fun culture, and emphasizes guest service at its core. They generally care for your well-being. However, there is a lot of variability in the management style and the supervisors are hit-or-miss depending on the day, or store. Some of the policies change frequently. I've had some of my best and worst supervisors while working there."
good,"My typical day at work consists of Daily Routines:"
good,"Great team, great culture. Always FFF..it was a culture that we all lived and breathed. Target offered great training but not enough time for the team to practice it before they were thrown on the floor. You had to be flexible and adaptable,  as Target constantly changed routines and practices. If you couldn't adapt and keep up, you would break.  "
good,"I am a little jaded as I was impacted by a reduction in force after 15 years of dedicated service."
good,"Help customers and keep the area clean and organized."
good,A typical day at work was fun and exciting. Target provided a good atmosphere for happy people to work and enjoy what they do. I learned about leadership development and the number one thing that makes a business like Target successful…excellent customer service!
good,"Target is a fast, fun, and friendly place to work. Ok that is just their motto. I did enjoy working at Target but I do feel that some of the management tries to take control of situations that don't require control. There does tend to be a lot of gossip amongst the younger employees, but I did have fun and felt that I was valued."
good,Typical day starts with the team unloading the truck and placing store product on pallets.  Afterwards we stock the store shelves with everything that came off the truck and anything that cant fit on the store shelves we store in the backroom.  The hardest part of the job is unloading the truck and the most enjoyable part of the job is helping a guest find something there looking for in the store.
good,"-A typical day at work consisted of dealing with customers, restocking shelves, tidying up and organizing merchandise."
good,"I love a face paced job, however it seems like no one has time to explain things to me adequately, or give me a chance to discuss any further cross training. If given more opportunity to express myself to team leaders, i would be much happier."
good,"i loved target, i loved every moment working here, what i didn't like was the management it was very poorly arranged. they were very unorganized. almost like chicken without their heads and when you needed one the most you could never seem to get a hold of them. but absolutely loved everything else."
good,"I liked getting involved with the customers on a daily basis, however my coworkers and upper management seemed to try to hard to get in customers personal life. I don't like people who try to hard which makes customers feel uncomfortable."
good,This job was really good as far as cross training and the willingness to train their employees in other departments. The co-workers were wonderful and management was easy to get along with. The best part of the job was being able to help out so many different areas of the store.
good,"My typical day at work consists of hauling loads of delta rock from the pit where we blasted to the primary rock crusher. I have learned alot about the different types of asphalt rock, as well as how to operate a Catapillar D770 Haul Truck."
good,"The company itself is good to work for, it is the store in which I am in that does not follow policies."
good,"This job has allowed me to grow and see what my strengths and weakness are but right now in my life, I need a job where I can blossom."
good,"A typical day at work is when I arrive in the morning at 5am and start my day off putting up labels on the Sales Floor. I've learned to work at a fast pace and get everything done in a timing manner. Some of the managers are okay, some are nice and some are mean. I mostly keep to myself. It's very hard to trust some of the managers since most of them gossip. I love the co-workers on my team, they are the ones who I can trust and relate to. "
good,The training process was pretty much learn as you go and teach yourself which is something I personally don't enjoy. I like to be taught the job assigned to me so that i can do it to the best of my ability but you have to ask a lot of questions. The job though is fairly easy and simple.
good,"I worked here part-time while I attended school, company did a great job working with my school schedule."
good,This company has good leaders but it is extremely difficult to move up within the company as an internal employee. On countless occasions I had leaders that were hired externally with less education and experience than myself.
good,"A well established staple in the retail industry when compared to the likes such as K-mart, this retailer is a great starting point for the entry level person wanting a retail career."
good,"i used to be shy but target really molded me into a better more confident person, loved the atmosphere, the coworkers where all one big happy family. expect the management was not too great."
good,"I unloaded and loaded trucks."
good,"Target is an excellent job for someone who is looking to pursue retail. However, they do not promote, they make each employee interview for any promotion. If you have been there for an exceeded amount of time, promotion is even less likely. I got along with all of my coworkers, who were very laid back. The management was alright, but it always changed. No one WANTED to be left with the responsibility we give our managers. Any managers that stayed were at a high stress level and very hard to get along with. I worked many departments, but ended in Food Avenue. This was by far the most enjoyable."
good,"flexible scheduling, but heavy workload for time allowed. No room for advancement without a 4 year degree. no guarantee in hours."
good,Seems as if the management was trying to hard to impress employees although they fell short.
good,"Very fast paced Job, strives to getting things done in just the right time."
good,Working at Target taught me a lot about how to be a team player. I have several co-workers that I work with on a daily basis and it is important to Target that we work as a team to get the job done. The hardest part of my job is getting off late at night. The most enjoyable part of my job is there constantly being something to do.
good,"Target was great for getting out of the house after I had my children. However, the pay was not that great and there was no room for advancement."
good,"Very high-stress, high-volume work. Management rotates every 18 months. Very small advancement opportunity."
good,I've been at target for years. It's always been a good job to work with a full time job. It's a hard work.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Target, I liked working the cash register and meeting and greeting new people all the time. My only regret is that the job did not last after the holidays."
good,"Punch in at 4am , help the flow team unload the truck , where always great by 8! Get everything off the floor that we haven't pushed out! Go for lunch with the amazing co-workers. I learnt that time is money and money is time. The most enjoyable part of the job is going home and knowing you'll see your amazing co-workers the next day!"
good,I enjoyed working with the team most were fast fun and friendly
good,Over all Its the people I work with that makes it a good place.
good,"A typical day at work is busy, which at the end of the day you may experience lack of energy."
good,Managers no longer liked to be on the floor to assist when there was only a few team members and there was a lot of work to get done.  Bringing inexperienced managers made it difficult to work with.  They would try their new ways instead of what Target stood for.
good,I left this company while in training.  Communication was lacking.
good,Target is a great place to work. My fellow team members are both helpful and friendly. I just require more hours.
good,"Target is an awesome place to work. The envioronment is great as well as staff, but the hours are low and the pay is fairly low. A typical day is a 4 hour shift, store stays busy so time flies by. All in all its a good starter job for anyone but not everyone can get satisfaction from working at target. I am enjoying working here but it is just not my area."
good,it was a great experience I really enjoy the different culture there
good,"Ever changing work place, A decent starting job, moved on when college finished. Managers were willing to work with me for a flexible schedule."
good,good place to work but if your under 18 its the stupidest place to work especially on cashier
good,I had a great experience jumping into a human resource role but the environment of a retail organization doesn't provide a great work/life balnce.
good,"Zeer gevarieerd werk van serie productie pc's tot reparatie op componenten basis ( SMD techniek )"
good,"One must be on his or her toes at all times, able to multi-task, and maintain an energetic attitude."
good,"At this company, the team members are extremely friendly , concerning, patient. The managers all seem to be very eager to teach and give you a chance to learn. The job is pretty easy, no hard parts about it."
good,"I would pull stock for hourly Cafs ( merchandise that was sold every hour) . I learned alot of about how a stock room should be organized and ran . Management was very helpful and fair . co workers for the most part were very hardworking and nice .Hardest part was when team members called out and I had to do all the work by myself . Working in a fast pace enviroment , with hardworking team mates would be the most enjoyable part of the job ."
good,"target is a place that will challenge you in different ways each day. there is an issue that needs to be resolved each and everyday of work. the hard parts of  being at guest service is making sure the guest is being helped in every way, no matter how angry they are. the most enjoyable part is knowing that i helped or put a smile on a guest face before they leave the store. "
good,"I loved working for Target!"
good,"They help customers locate items, explain product features and specifications, compare and contrast different models, explain the terms of warranties, anticipate customers' needs and provide recommendations. Those who work in retail stores may also be responsible for working the cash register and handling return or exchange"
good,keeping customer quotas and courteous checkouts with great customer satisfaction.
good,"I began this job thinking of it as more of a career until I transferred from one state & store to another. When that happened, I was no longer appreciated for the things I could and did do, but instead was chastized for the things I was unable to do due to being somewhat disabled. I learned that this company needs to take part in training it's management in how to treat people."
good,I enjoy working for Target. I've been there for about seven years now. Being a supervisor allows me to display my natural leadership abilities. I also love teaching and working with others to complete a task. My night starts at 9:30pm and normally ends around 930am. I'm on my feet for the majority of the night checking on team members and working freight. The hardest part of my job would be working the third shift. I feel like I've sacrificed a lot by working overnights. I'm not really satisfied with the pay either.
good,the job was flexible and good start. But I am looking for something more challenging.
good,"Very well organized compnay when it comes to presentation. Co workers were all friendly and work well as a team. The hardest part of the job was when a customer will call in and was told that a specific item was in stock when it wasn't and as a customer they will sometimes get upset. Most enjoyable part was interacting with customers on a daily basis. While working here at Target I got to perform my duties as a sales floor assosicate and when needed help in the front I was able to do cashier, and help out in the jewlery department."
good,A very diverse group of teammates that make and help the day go by quickly.
good,"It has a nice environment, but the hours are unpredictable."
good,The training is information that is needed to be known working in the retail/customer service field.
good,The job is very physically demanding but they pay is worth it.
good,Its a good work environment and friendly people to work with.
good,"Responsibile for filling merchandise, waiting on guest. Took all the merchandise and shelving down, measure the shelves for the right size to put the product on."
good,"Target is a very good place to work when starting off a career in life, it has very good starting positions and is a very accessible place when in need of a job."
good,i enjoyed the coworkers while working there we had great customers but the Management was very poor it seemed to me there was no moving up in that company i asked repeatedly for more responsibility and training in different departments and got unfulfilled promises and excuses on why i could not be trained for other departments.
good,"I worked at Target close to six years. For the most part I loved it, I worked at two different stores and each offered something new. I enjoyed my coworkers, my team leads were easy to talk to, but few actually resolved any issues that were brought up. Advances weren't always ""legitimate"" a coworker went from being a regular team member to a department manager in the course of 2 months sometimes. I learned how to give great customer service and perform multiple things at once. Skills that will help me in the future. I can't condone the company as a whole because it REALLY just depends on the store and the people working in it. A job is almost always what you make of it. I would work for them again if I needed to."
good,Learned how to endure extreme conditions with little or no recognition all while completing my job to the utmost potential everyday.i was able to perform my tasks everyday even with malfunctioning equipment.
good,"I worked long hours at Target and normally worked about sixty hours per week. I had a great staff to work with, but we were all tired. My feet were always in pain."
good,"First off, the most enjoyable part of my job is the customer service. Being able to assist someone in person or over the phone was rewarding. This is was I live for. I played a major role in this store. I was found in almost every department there is while working here. I trained and cross trained almost every department. My main area was soft lines (clothing), the fitting room, the store phone operator and pager. I cashiered a lot, even on several days that I had off and loved it, but talking on the phone was more me. This store was always busy, due to the fact that it was located off a major highway. The hardest part of the job was leaving, due to overwhelming amount of clothes and other merchandise that had to be put back on the floor to be presentable for opening the next day."
good,The job is actually a pretty good job. Descent pay but management can most defiantly use some work. Constantly over staffing departments and causing current employees hours to get cut. Overall its a descent part time job
good,i always came into work with a positive an enthusiastic attitude. My typical day at work starts off with being assign to a task and giving my all. and making sure the customer leave with a memorable moment
good,"The people were great, and the environment was full of variety. We never did the same exact thing everyday. I was a cashier, but would switch positions frequently. I enjoyed the surrounding very much. I often seen people I knew, and always met new people. I actually enjoyed this job. I just wish the pay would have been a little better. Within the first month of being there, I was being trained for multiple departments. I learned very quickly, and got the job done above standard requirements. It was a seasonal opportunity, but they offered a permanent position. They have great opportunities to advance your career, and pay rate."
good,"cashier,food service, co workers we're like family.I enjoyed waking up and coming to a job that made me happy"
good,"Typical day at work usually involve stocking merchandise, assist customer with merchandise, cashier in working with a fast pace. i learned a lot of communication skill, in conflict resolution, in working hard. Management is ok but they never have enough co-worker on the floor for we can assist our customer. but the hardest part of the job is that the customer come in with attributive in the store. i enjoy the fast, fun, in friendly pace in the store always in good clean conduction,"
good,"I started working at Target before it opened, stocking the shelves and then working at Food Avenue there and later on, the Deli, and I also cross trained at Starbucks. For the first three years, working at Target was ""Fast, Fun, and Friendly."" When the recession begin and management shift, so did the work environment. Overall, I've gained much experience from being a team member for Target."
good,"My work day begins with me cleaning up the mess the night crew left behind. As I am doing this, various vendors are coming in who need their goods inputted into our system, which is my actual job. I load the cardboard baler, mark out defective products, etc. My co-workers are fun and hard working people. The hardest part of my job is constantly having to keep up with cleaning up after others, which can sometimes put me behind on the things I need to do. I enjoy almost everything else about my job (other than the pay and benefits), and really like working with the various vendors who come in throughout the day."
good,Target is a good place to work. Management is great. Depending on the day it can get very busy.
good,Everyday was a challenge at work but it helped me grow as a person and employee.
good,Target is a good place to work to get experience and extra money for school but its not worth it in the long run if your not a kiss up.
good,Company good for part time workers but not very many full time positions available.
good,Enjoyed working with others and public. Helping people had always been in my nature
good,"Target is a great company to help build experience, however not the type of company you would want to grow old at"
good,"i worked for target for almost 7 years and if i didnt have to move . i would prob. still be there. the company gave a raise every year even if it just took care of the increese of benifits. i had a lot of friends and team players in my area. we always got the job done before end of shift. in warehouse. u picked orders to be sent off to other stores . the technology of the telezon is out of this world. u find a location on it and print out labels for that date at the day or night u work and then go to locations and scan lable and location then pull from rack and put labels on items. then someone else came and took it somewhere else to be prosessed. we alturnated equipment dayly .so u did not get burned out . we had team meetings every day before our shift started to let us know how we done the day before, where we stand for the week and how good we done for the building. safety was a very big thing."
good,Typical day consist of picking orders placedthrough the app. Relaxed environment with minimal guest interaction because most your time is spent in the backroom or running the floor.
good,"Good coworker and friendly environment ."
good,Unfortunately at the time I worked there I had the pleasure of working with the not so great leads.. and felt set up for failure.  But the other managers and leads were helpful
good,"all in all i think that this is an excellent work place with very little to complain aobut. Those that i worked with were professional and friendly, and the management stayed of top of task and work loads."
good,Working here requires a lot of moving around. They are very detailed when it comes to maintaing the stores up keep. We aim to make our guest feel at ease while shopping.
good,It's not a bad place to work for during peak season but slow season expect to go home alot.. management is ok.. they will help u be the best your can..
good,"As far as retail goes, this job was pretty great. The people are friendly and hard working, the guests are usually great, and the work keeps you moving. You learn a lot and really get to have an appreciation for anyone who does customer service. But management and corporate can be huge pains. Nobody's on the same page, and there are constantly new procedures and rules thrown at you without explanation, and they like to pick favorites. You can work your butt off and not get any recognition or incentives, but someone who goofs off all the time might be a leader's favorite worker. It can be disheartening and frustrating. Work hours can (and will) also be cut, so it doesn't feel like the most stable job."
good,"A very basic experience with Target. As a ""Guest Advocate,"" I would interect with customers and enjoyed the job despite its monotony. I would gather handheld baskets and got to meet very different people who would stand in my line."
good,"It was just seasonal, I worked here for extra money during Christmas time. Overall it was an okay place to work. Management didn’t care about the workers, that was the only downside."
good,"Target will give you great pay! You're expected to work every hour, min, second, till you clock out for the day. Expect to do things outside your job description."
good,"A typical day at target would include speaking to a team lead about what needs to be done, or what has already been completed. Each team member is double trained as a cashier which helps you learn better customer service skills."
good,This is a good part time job with good pay to work in retail but the management can be a pain at times. The hardest part of the job is the rude guests that can come in.
good,Typical day at work is anywhere from 12-14 hours.  I have learned a significant amount in regards to continuous improvement and the positive impacts it has on the overall flow of the business if done correctly.  The hardest part of the job is meeting the competing priorities of all departments while keeping your business and team members at the front of every decision.
good,"I think Target has been a great place to work. The team environment has taught me so much in the past few years, but it seems to be less focused on the team recently."
good,"I honestly can't say if this is a store by store problem or if it's an issue through Target as a whole, but at least in my situation, the company itself was great. The benefits and the pay and the expectations as dictated by corporate were awesome. It was management that left a lot to be desired. The store director was overly involved in certain departments and under involved in others and definitely playing favorites. The department managers were  possessive and didn't want to allow transfers (and would even go so far as to sabotage them). Nobody trusted the HR department to keep their secrets. That particular store is not an environment I'd encourage anyone to walk into without a firm backbone and willingness to endure endless amounts of infighting."
good,Working for this company started out great but after 4 years the job and the managers got lazy. I was doing way more then my fair share because other employees weren't doing their job
good,"Coming from a restaurant and automotive setting, this was the easiest job I've had. Management was awful however. Training was also awful. Basically in short, there is neither of the previous depending on which department you go into. Lots of drama in the backroom.. if you work in market, try to work mornings or day shifts because closing sucks. Zoning and cleaning up after your coworkers is pretty much the whole shift."
good,"people arevgreat to work with , guest are happy and pleasant but the company tends to change to much making changes disrupts the work flow and the pay rates example I make $16 an hour been there 10 years and they hire a person off the street at $14 an hour how is that fair."
good,"After getting to know many colleagues a typical workday can become very enjoyable. Many tasks are expected to be completed, I learned a lot about patience, managerial, and backroom experience. Workplace culture can be friendly and also blunt. The hardest part of the job at times can be the guests and also management. The most enjoyable part of the job is working in a friendly environment."
good,"The place and the work itself was good as well as most of the customers but the management sucked, too many people trying to be a boss and no one communicating with each other about what needs sone"
good,The job experience with the company i was there management atmosphere is not that much well. Amenities which we were getting there is not much well balanced to accommodate ourselves .
good,"Show up for work every day  work hard  "
good,A lot of professionals within cross functional teams. Management was there to help remove roadblocks and set workforce up for success. The most enjoyable part of the work was providing solutions that allow the organization to meet its achievable goals.
good,"Typical department store job. A typical day can either be very busy and stressful or somewhat laid back and slow, never an in-between. Workplace culture was okay, most co-workers keep to themselves. Management was almost always disorganized or hard to contact which was generally problematic. Hardest part of the job is having to deal with overbearing customers. Most enjoyable part was that there was usually snacks in the break room to take advantage of during 15 min breaks in shifts."
good,Job has a lot of pressure to perform but it is manageable. Managers are usually fair and respectful but do not always have time to devote individual attention to employees.
good,There’s a lot of ups and downs with this company some times I feel like I’m finally doing something and other times I feel like I’m unappreciated and taken for granted but overall the staff is good
good,"I worked during the holidays, and it was a great place to learn how to work in retail more. The pay was worth it, and they supplied many hours during the Black Friday week."
good,A typical day at work consists of pushing stock to the floor and zoning shelves in order to make the store look good. The most enjoyable part of the job is that I get to help guests find what they need in order to accomplish their shopping trip.
good,Most of the fellow team members were great to work with. Management was a disaster and helped very little. Most of the time we had to figure it out ourselves.
good,I had a lot of fun for the first 2-3 years but a lot of changes were made and it made the work frustrating. They were understanding about a lot of my family appointments but later on it seemed like they didn't care at all and only wanted the job done.
good,Basically the company was good but some of low management did not treat employees with respect and often lorded their position over subordinates making the work situation less than rewarding.
good,"It's a fast paced environment, the drawback is they push you to make people try and apply for their credit card, and you have to continually bug the customer, making them unhappy. Once is enough. Sometimes it's same customers daily and they'll start by saying ""don't even mention the target red credit card"". Making people unhappy isn't my cup of tea."
good,"Very tiring, the employers overworked me and my friends. Day consisted of cutting boxes and stacking merchadise with only an hour break, while our working hours were around 8 hours"
good,Target is flexible working with you and your schedule. However I have had some issues with upper staff members being insensitive to cultural and diversity issues. I’ve worked at two different targets in two different states and have had a very good work experience at the Target 🎯 in Atlanta Ga and a very bad experience with the target in Anchorage Alaska. All I can say to racism is real
good,Got hired as seasonal and was told they wanted to keep me on when the season was over but then only began scheduling me 10 hours a week while still interviewing and hiring people. That's obviously not sustainable so I found a new job. My new job was not good so reapplied this year and didn't even get an interview. Would rather work 10 hours at target than at my old job. Hours were kind of all over the place esspecially with holidays but it was a nice place to work overall.
good,The work environment is fantastic. From my experience very little drama and my co-workers and management have been great. The downfall to this job is that there are no benefits unless you work 40+ hours a week. It is also very difficult for them to give you any hours. I would recommend this job is if you're looking for part time.
good,Target company was very nice to us and feed us lunch some days the customers were fairly nice and the staff was very easy to get along with. The hours where great and it didn’t take much time to get familiar with the computer system for the cash register
good,"I think the experience you have with target definitely depends on management. I wouldnt say that there is consistency through corporate. I worked at a Target in Utah and I loved all of my fellow team members and my leaders were phenomenal. They did everything they could to help me see my visions through to benefit the guest. I felt that they really cared for me. At my new Target location, I dont feel the same support. I would say a majority of my team member feel the same lack of support from management. Personally I find it tragic because the entire dynamic of the store is brought down. But we do our jobs accordingly."
good,Target is a fun environment to work in especially for those aged 16-24. It tended to be working with a lot of people my age. The job wasn't hard but the expectations were too much.
good,"Should just go to work and do your work and the job is amazing. It is retail so there will be guests who pick and poke at you, but it is overall a reasonable job. You will put back misplaced items and zone and help guests."
good,Target is a good place to work.  Trinity FL HR needs alot of improvement. There are favorites & with the same HR Manger things will not change. I have nothing else to say about this company I
good,It's a ok job environment. Love getting paid wkly. They need more methods of valuing workers. We also need more holidays off. However its not tge worst job to have just have to deal accordingly.
good,Very busy in the stock room. There is always something that needs to be completed. If you completed the backroom tasks they would send you to the sales floor to help stock shelves.
good,"Preparing the store for opening, making cashier lanes were ready for the day of business. I work at Guest Services, backroom, pulling orders."
good,"Not bad, they did allow for my disabilities, I never said no I won't do it."
good,"There’s a general work culture at Target where there’s always work to do. Personally, I was always made to feel that I hadn’t done enough and that the work that I had gotten done was disappointing. I chalk this up to the management culture at Target as well as who my managers, or Team Leads, were. Simply put, working part-time does not provide enough time to do all that was asked of me on a daily basis. It got to the point that I had developed the mentality of “ if I really wasn’t doing a good enough job, they would either confront me or fire me,” neither of which happened. It can be a frustrating, pressurized work space. That isn’t to say that my coworkers weren’t under the same pressures and disagreed with my mentality. Most, if not all of the non-manager or non-Team Lead workers shared this mentality to some extent. Some of the best interactions I have had are with guests and coworkers. The hardest part is not letting the pressure get you down and make you feel like you’re not doing enough."
good,"I loved working here at the beginning. I made a lot of good friends and learned a lot about guest service and being global. I loved when I am able to decorate cakes, as I love baking and decorating."
good,Each day is something new. Whether it's helping our guests or teaching and training team members there are plenty of opportunities to challenge your critical thinking skills.
good,"Having a determined selected amount of time to complete all your tasks with in a short few hours is OVER WHELMING! They expect one person to complete 2 tasks which is pulling from the back to push to fill the floors under a selected amount of time and to top that expect you to complete the truck load which could contain three to four heavily loaded six wheeler carts that could have up to one to two extra shelves on them with products to push to the sales floor. Then to back stock what ever doesn't fit on the floor has to be back stocked under a selected amount of time before your shift if over."
good,I give the rewiew because they need to support more the team and work as a team. Also hire more people and train them properly so they can meet target expectations.
good,Fast paced and busy. I learned that as long as the guest were happy that we was doing a good job. The hardest part of the job was when they would mass hire and then employees hours drop less than 20 not enough to receive benefits. The most enjoyable part was working with a diverse team.
good,"Some of the management was really a pleasure to work for, but policy changes in how the company operates is negatively affecting workers and productivity."
good,Was your typical retail environment.  Enjoyed helping people and giving the best customer experience. Management could use a refresher course on how to work with associates.
good,"I worked in the beauty department for almost 2 years, I loved the job.. at times it was very VERY stressful but there were more good days than bad and I couldn’t complain. Although the job was great, they did cut hours a couple of times. The management was Poor, it’s like they didn’t know what they were doing."
good,Being a barista there was fun! Made connections with my team and coming in was almost always a pleasure. You can get pretty busy and be alone sometimes but its alright
good,I like target because of the people I work with and managers are really nice but the hours are awful and they are not very flexible with the hours you can work with
good,I wore many different hats while i worked there for 6yrs. Mngmnt was decent and accomodating to necc schedule changes. Worst part was the constant pressure for red cards.They went so far as to post a note on the time clock that if you don't get a red card during your shift...you had to see the store manager at the end of your shift. They made it a hostile work environment. I left there 5yrs ago but I'll never forget that.
good,Target is a good company to work for and a good job to have to hold over and support yourself until a more reliable and steady place of employment is found.
good,"Target was a cool place to work at for about a year. They dont give great hours unless youre a Team Lead or kiss up to the Management. The pay is good at first, but the (raises) they give yearly are basically non existent."
good,"During my time at Target, I spent a lot of time speaking with our guests and making employee-guest friendships along the way. Most guests are very friendly and exciting to talk to. The superiors were very friendly as well and understanding. It was a great job except that the hours were very random and inconsistent. For instance, one week I could work 30 hours and the next week 10 hours."
good,Was a barista for the Starbucks section.  They changed executives every twelve months to eighteen months and they are fresh from college with no work experience and using a manual with power on the brain.
good,I am currently employed as a Barista at Starbucks. I like the culture there it is very diverse. The  balance of work and home life is not always ideal .
good,"A typical day includes operating all kinds of heavy machinery, building pallets and receiving freight.  I've learned about the warehousing and shipping aspect of distribution.  The culture is very fast-paced and requires my full attention every day.  The hardest part of the job is being on my feet all day with little time to rest.  My favorite part of the job is seeing all of the things that Target sells."
good,The mount Laurel Target is a good place to work. Hours are difficult to manage as a mother of 4 and 2 grandchildren. Not a lot of time to spend with family due to the scattered hours required. Most team members try to do their jobs the best they can.  The hourly rate is a good start rate for a cashier but they don't give raises to team members that have been promoted. If you are promoted to a position that gives you more responsibilities and more stress and pressure there should be some incentive to take the positions.
good,"Working at target as a Customer Service Representative was pretty straight forward. You attend guest's questions, concerns and dealt with their returns. The only reason I didn't enjoy this job was because they would heavily suggest that we should sell the red card (Target's credit card) to the customers. Felt like a sleazy car's salesman every time I tried to up sell a guest  the red card when they are just trying to get a gallon of milk and move on about their day."
good,Target was a great place to work at. I worked I the Electronics department. I always worked the orbit shift from 7am-3pm. I will come in and go to the stock room to check and see if we got a new shipment and bring it out to the floor and fill in any empty spots. But as the day go by I'll be helping customers and making sure everything is put away.
good,Co-workers were fun to work with and management was not so bad. Can get very busy at times and if you are a cashier good luck standing up all day. It cam get very tiring standing in one spot.
good,I’ve always loved the company and shopping there for their amazing prices! When being hired there within a months time I felt like there was no structure. I was hired in by a bunch of high school early aged adults that felt like it was very clicky and had no management focus.
good,I enjoyed most of this job other than a few leads who would haze some of the employees. Never really had any bad customer experiences. They are kinda unprepared.
good,Day to day hours changed loved the fact of helping others in the store. All team members  were helpful over all rating the experience was good. You learned how merchandise is keep and distrubuted and stocked.
good,"Hours are flexible. "
good,good for a temporary job or moving up into higher positions but not long term it can be very draining and tiring but i always loved everybody i worked with!
good,"While working for Target was a mostly pleasant experience for me, it did have its negatives. Mainly that in the 3.5 years I was there management changed a lot. While most were nice, there were always the ones who tried to make themselves look more impressive by standing on the backs of their workers, some would even break policy. The biggest downside, if you become a cashier, is how much they push the Redcards."
good,"Target was pretty good especially when you have family situations arise they are willing to work with you at the time that I was employed, you can gain hours by switching with other team members if approved by management."
good,An fun job for someone who likes to be kept on their toes. They have many opportunities for those who wish to move around in different department or can try to move up in management
good,"The work was easy enough. Poorly staffed during peak seasons. Normal Barista duties such as brewing coffee, crafting persona espresso drinks. Good job, although poorly staffed during peak seasons. In complete cross training."
good,"Good place to shop ,some of the people are ok not all. I left cause I graduated and moved out of state ....but it's ok. I  still think they are too over priced."
good,"Target corporation is a great job and career opportunity. I've outlasted my position and years at Target and would like to grow and advance with a company. Currently there is no advancement opportunity for my position with the company. The overall job culture and moral can use some improvement. Overall I am happy with my area, manager, and position. Looking for something new."
good,"It was fine for a first job.It was only temporary during the summer, so it depended on what manager you had each day would determine how much fun you would have. Of course in any retail job, there is some difficulties but not too terrible. They give amazing breaks!"
good,"Toxic work drama. As a barista at target I don't get tips, and I'm not compensated for the lack of tips. The work is fun, and its easy to widen your horizons and get trained all over the store which is cool. All around, a good first job."
good,I would say that your experience at Target varies by location and staff. I also worked there 10 years ago. I wish that I could go back because I really enjoyed my job. I only left because the HR lady at the time tricked me into abandoning my job and now Target won't hire me.
good,Worked in a very large Target in a busy area. Was never guaranteed constant hours and shifts were short so I had to work many many days a week and often doubles in order to make enough money. Pays well but my management were not good people.
good,"Working there was okay for me. I quit early because the bosses are not fair with the rest of the team members. I’m glad I quit, I escaped at the right time."
good,"The work was fairly easy, very tedious and repetitive and it did get pretty boring at times. The teamwork aspect was great and I met some pretty cool people working there."
good,"It's not a bad job, they just dont give minors alot of hours from what it looks like. I used to work at least 20 hours a week now I only work about 4 hours a week. When I asked about increases in hours they say they will go up soon and they never do. Other than that I've had a good experience at target, the pay is good and they are a very understanding establishment."
good,"Working at the Starbucks, there was a lot of self-discipline. All work was done by the baristas, as the team leads were usually not present. With that, regulations on management were scarce to nonexistent. Multiple issues with harassment across three stores, as well as issues with professionalism. The work itself is not terrible, but if you're looking for an employee friendly environment, this is not the store."
good,The problem with retail/department store jobs is that there are too many chiefs & not enough Indians. On a dailey basis i have at least 3 different people breathing down my neck to do the same job 3 different ways.
good,"I loved the job itself but management needs to work on communicating with each other. Could have just been my location, but often when I visit other targets, you can tell they are just as confused as my location was. I hope someone higher up in the company can come up with a plan to keep every area in order."
good,working at target was fun and full of learning experiences. target being my first job it was my first step into the real world. i learned the rules of retail and great customer service.
good,"Management is not on the same page most of the time and lack basic supervisory skills. When it comes to working as a team, the staff seems to be following their own agenda and management doesn't step up or in to help with anything, unless it escalates to a complaint."
good,"My main criticism is that every week, I was scheduled too much per week and they could never find who did it. I was also there for 6 months and I trained people and was often praised by my managers, but I was never offered a raise. Also, no one approved schedule change requests in time unless you pestered them. It's a nice environment though and fairly laid back where not much is expected of cashiers."
good,"Target was a decent job in my opinion but the supervisor or ""team leader"" as you may call them would always have an attitude and I don't know if it was something I did to her or if she just didn't like me but she would seem like she was annoyed."
good,"Great job to work, team members were awesome, learn something new on the floor or back room, the pay was ok but not for all the extra this game we had to learn for other parts of the store and hours weren't all ways a full 38-40"
good,"Target has been an interesting job. It started off well enough; my area had the hours and staffing we needed, and had reasonable expectations of us. But as time has gone on, corporate has been more focused on making more money, and it has resulted in them making stores cut hours and staffing, while expecting us to get more done"
good,"Management is poor and tends to hover, however i enjoyed the people i work with. They pay well also especially for teenagers. There was not a ton of flexibility with hours , as you have to work 15+ a week."
good,Quick paced and always moving. I was always on my feet to find things and never got a break. I would take my 15min break but would always have to find someone to cover for me
good,"This is a great place to work for, you’ll gain lots of experience. You have many departments to choose from and learn about for future jobs. The hours are terrible weekly! Well at least In my area."
good,"A typical day at work consists of stocking shells in the entire store"
good,"They provide good training, I learned alot about dealing with customers. After the christmas season they reduce your hours to 2 or 3 days a week, you are forced to apply for unemployment to compensate your original full time schedule.  They squeeze the employees that way, it causes employees to have to quit and work elsewhere."
good,This job really lets you see the whole aspect of retail and how a company operates. From truck process to floor sales and expectation. Management  is a little on rough side. High turn-over rate. Short training period. But you always have a support team.
good,The work place/culture of target is fun for awhile until you realize the managers have no idea what they’re doing. There’s also a lot of favoritism that goes on amongst the managers and the higher ups.
good,"Honesty, I didn't work here nearly long enough to give a good review. This was my first job in high school, and I was trained well and set up for success. Management was fine, from what I remember. Minimum wage."
good,It's hard to write a review about a company that has so many different changes in the past three years. I department I was in is no longer lead by the same people. From what I hear there is still a lot of changes going on.
good,"Christmas time is the worst thing ever working there but after the holidays it's pretty chill. Not a lot of room for advancement, and the starting wage is pretty low compared to others in the area."
good,To climb up the ladder in this retail job can be difficult. Your work is mostly not recognized. I continue working here because I love to help out in every way that I can as much or little as I possibly can.
good,fast paced work environment. flexible scheduling. ability to move up in company. managers take time to teach employees the correct way to do tasks. daily meetings helped make store run effortlessly.
good,"Like any company, it depends on your manager whether or not you'll want to keep working there. They are flexible with scheduling but it is difficult to get promoted without jumping through numerous hoops, again and again. If you're a student, this is a great fit for you, because you won't be committed for a long period of time. On the other hand, if your an adult looking for a career and you're hoping to get promoted quickly internally, even with years of experience, this is not a company that values that."
good,"Unloading freight by placing the merchandise on labelled pallets, stocking shelves by department, and keeping my work area clean. I learned how to keep invetory in proper rotation."
good,"I enjoyed working at target, I met alot of nice people.  The workplace culture is positive.  The executives  set themselves apart from the hourly staff.  I loved working with my co-workers, we worked hard but had fun.  The most enjoyable part of the job would be the people.  The hardest part of the job was not getting enough hours and having to pick up hours in other departments to make a good wage."
good,"For an overall review of Target,  I would say that the environment is very nice and your coworkers are amazing but as far as management goes there is little to be desired."
good,It was nice. Overall the people i work with are really great and determined. The guests are usually really nice and understanding when you give them directions to a certain item. Management ain't great tho.
good,"Target cuts a lot of corners these days, not enough help, hiring executives straight out of college who have never worked before, etc. That being said, it's still a pretty good place to work (and shop)."
good,Target was a great place to work. A typical day looked like a busy day. Staying on top of making drinks making sure we were always stocked and helping out guest as fast and efficient as possible.
good,"average place to work, nothing special. terrible work life balance but lots of potential advancement if invested in the company. recommend as a starting place giving you time to find a place where you really want to go."
good,"A typical day at work was busy, always a lot to get done. Half the time there was help. I learned the ins and outs of Target and how the business worked."
good,Target was a great place to work as part time. The staff was awesome but the management was often rude. I had issues with changing schedule hours and that’s ultimately what made me leave.
good,This was by far the best place that I've worked at my coworkers were always so helpful. I never had a bad experience with guest. The store is always clean. HR are always looking out for the employees when it's cold the bring hot beverages and soups. When its hot they get the employees cold beverages and ice cream. the little stuff they did brought the employees together.
good,Retail at target isn't all that bad as long as you don't mind pushing the store card or working random hours at all times of the day and night. Management at the target I work at is amazing but that can't be said for all targets.
good,Target was a fast pace job with many great people that work there.  Management seemed to be concerned about the employees and what they were doing.  Target did provide training for me when I worked there.
good,"Fun, competitive environment for people to learn new skills and learn about themselves. Cons are: not many positrons for lower staff to move into, there’s team leads for every department and that is all, no shift leads for departments. Also harder to get into any management with out being there for many many years."
good,"En général j'ai trouvé cette période plutôt agréable malgré le fait que la compagnie a du fermer ses portes, un an après avoir été intégré au pays. L'ambiance avec les collègues se passait bien ce qui rendait cette job plaisante."
good,"It's retail in one of the few competitive markets left, it tends to be pretty fast paced as to the marketing and getting out whats needed for the guest to maximize sales."
good,Management is nothing but catty infighting. Your LOD is not your friend at Target. Shifts are massively disorganized and the store never runs smoothly because management is busy chatting amongst themselves. Don't bother working here.
good,"Typical as any retail work environment. Helping guests with returns, exchanges, and complaints. Closing shifts feel the longest. Flexible hours if you are a student. Every team member welcomes you with open arms."
good,Target does a good job of preaching work life balance. They try whenever possible to promote from within which helps build morale. A lot of team engagement events in the break room also help.
good,Good job culture but not as a career. Not for yearly living inconsistent wages. Excellent for college students while target does work with flexible hours for students but no benefits and can be fast pace working environment that requires multi tasking and changing gears from floor sales to cashiering.
good,Target would rather bring people from the outside then too move up the people within. The company overall is a good place to be but I wish they would do more.
good,"I worked the night shifts as a stocker and I completely hated it. The work itself was easy, but working at night was not for me at all. It was not my intention to work at night (11pm-7am) and the manager wasn't exactly clear that those would be my hours; I was desperate for work so I just dealt with it considering it was a seasonal job. I had 2 department managers, one is really nice and approachable, the other one is the complete opposite."
good,"Well the workspace at Target is one that varies. For instance, the employees, other cashiers, are great to be around, but the store managers, and department ""managers"" have to work on their attitudes. They need to work their ""people"" skills as well."
good,"Constant flow of temporary workers, fast learners do the best. Show up when you have to work or you will not work there long. They can work with any schedule for the most part."
good,"Target distribution Stuart’s draft va was the most stressful job you can have. Running full speed 100% of the time. The ART section sucks. Stacking boxes on pallets constantly. Always pulling products from the conveyor belt over and over for 10 or 12 hours. Some people working others not. Unloading a full 53 foot tractor trailer by yourself. And unloading tractor trailers by yourself and making pallets is awful. Not a job I’d ever recommend to anyone. It’s hard, it’s 10 or 12 hours on concrete, it’s very complicated mentally to withstand the issues that come along with the electronics, it will wear you down. I lasted 6 months! And I couldn’t take anymore."
good,"For the most part Target Cafe is well-paced and exerts a relatively low amount of stress on the employees outside of the holiday season, but the cafe is usually manned by 1 person at a time which can be stressful on particularly busy days"
good,"Leadership at Target treats people with respect. Job environment is safe and clean. Expectations are extremely high, challenging to meet them. Life balance is difficult. Long days and working nights, weekends, mids, holidays. Often changing plans to meet expectations."
good,the location i worked for was fun and a great place to work! i was fired from my position after i was sick for a week with the flu and unable to leave bed and was told it was because i was 'temporary' when there was no indication that i was temp when i came on.when i went to get rehired at a different location they never called me back or followed up after my interview.
good,Everyone is very rushy does only what they do and leaves work for others for later in the day very helpful mostly when you have a question not my favorite environment
good,"The company has so much potential to be a great employer - technology, team-member support, and decent compensation. However, my particular store was very poorly managed and made it very hard to be both a student and a worker."
good,"Worked with potential clients by phone or face to face, managed front end, assisted customers with check outs and returns.  Quickly resolved all questions and customer issues."
good,It's an okay place for employment. There is room for growth in management if you are seriously interested.  Management is often replaced every few years. Management is not genuinely friendly and shows  favoritism towards certain (NEWER) workers.  There is an undertone of stress and  rudeness. New team members are started off with higher wages than previous years. This has changed the everyday functions and payroll for daily store setup. There are higher expectations with fewer workers.
good,The pay is not worth the stressful days the store manager don't really play as a tean they don't visit as often as they should the team member are good
good,Good place to work only can’t make a living on the hours. Hard to get full time hours. No benefits were offered because couldn’t get full time hours. Only time to get more hours is peak times during the year.
good,"Although I loved working for Target as a company overall, I did not fit in well with the culture of my location.  I did enjoy the company's mission and core values.  Target has great work life balance, promotes from within and tries to cultivate a positive work environment."
good,Target offered a great work culture to provide customer experiences unlike other companies. It is a nice place to gain experience for younger entry level workers.
good,"For an individual working at a Target location for nearly a year and half, i really enjoyed it at first. Hours were reasonable and picked up during the holiday season but later on hours began dropping and so did the drive to work. People began calling off of work more frequent and this affected all employees work load. things only got worse when management changed. all team leaders and even the store manager began talking behind each others backs and always contradicted each other. I was a closing team member of the backroom meaning i was a one man team whereas sales floor teams all consisted of 5+ team members. It was okay since that meant i could focus on work but my worklaod was diffent each other day, never consistent. I was hired as a temp during the stores remodeling process and was asked to stay as a permanent team member in the backroom and enjoyed my job a lot but recently i left after my requested paid vacation, between thanksgiving and Christmas, was not only ignored but not acknowledged till the week of and they demanded that i work during my vacation. no point in giving employees paid time off if they cannot or not allowed to use it."
good,"Decent part time job, however management was very inconsistent and expectations were usually very unclear. Corporate level is always making many changes that affect the job negatively."
good,"I really enjoyed working for Target."
good,"On the truck unload team, we began at 4 am and it was fast paced. During the holidays, didn't have the help needed to get the job done. After the holidays, hours were cut for months."
good,"I felt like there was some job security there, many of the employees I met have been there for years and they liked working there, overall a decent place to work, and you get alot of breaks."
good,"In America it is common place to expect employee's to stand for 8 hours.  It is very hard on the body.  The culture has to change to allow cashier's to sit and rest when business is slow.  "
good,Target was very fast pace and the time went by quick when there is work to do. Offered a lot of overtime that's a plus. Everyone helps each other out.
good,Working at Target was stressful at times but the Team Members at Uptown Target were all fun to work with but the Management was a lot inexperienced at times
good,I was hired as a seasonal work & the experience was mostly good. I worked on the sales floor which was one of the easiest jobs & never stressed me out
good,Targret used to be a place that appreciated its employees; now it is becoming like so many retail stores where bottom line and competing against Amazon are the their basic priorities. It is a 100% better job then working fast food and other retail stores. but it is mostly for the young and has quickly become the spot for 16-19 years old to work. of course the problem with that is customer service begins to lax.
good,Lots of nice staff and management. Fun work atmosphere. I really enjoy meeting new people and helping them with their items. Pretty relaxed job when it is not really busy.
good,"Fast pace, always changing, modernizing environment. Leaders are a tight knit group that work well as a team to make a store the destination for all families to shop."
good,"I am sure it depends on each store, but overall Target was a very stable employer. When i asked for less hours because of school, Management was very understanding."
good,"I was a cashier until I was promoted to sales floor and cafe, I was struggling mostly in cafe because management kept firing older workers and bosses so I was constantly on my own the whole shift. Missing materials and the new boss is rude and arrogant and doesn’t take criticism to heart. I was denied a management position because the magemwnt said I was childish even though I pulled my own weight during the holiday season when there was no manager for cafe."
good,"Target is a average job with higher pay then most sales associate jobs in the Fort Walton Area. The down side i would say is the lack of management from the higher ups, to many managers and  with a broken unload system."
good,Working at Target was very fast pacing. I love how they work as a team. Meetings on a daily basis helped the working environment. The holiday hours are long and very busy!
good,"Great place to work for if you are supplementing income unless you are lucky enough to move up and become a team leader or higher. Fun environment with support and encouragement anytime you need. There is some favoritism that is not fair, but the opportunity to try to advance is always there. The hardest part of this job is being on your feet for extended periods of time and having to finish your assigned areas on time to leave at a decent time. Management is tolerable but needs improvement. The most enjoyable part of the job is your coworkers and most of the customers are pleasant."
good,"can't get your work done, too many team leaders telling you what to do,  constantly pulling you to do something else. can't finish what you originally started and you have about 10 task your doing at once."
good,Had a very great time working at Target. My manager always accommodated me to my school schedule and never complained about me working overtime. Really great work environment although the Store Team Leaders can get very irritating and get a power trip when entering a new store.
good,"I did enjoy my time at Target overall and got to work with a diverse group of people and managers that were able to teach me throughout my time there. I did however struggle with the work life balance. I appreciated the same day off and rotating weekends that management got, however when it came to general time off it was often difficult. Living away from family it is hard/impossible to travel anytime after Oct until the new year. Ultimately I left because I needed more time at home with my family and a flexible schedule to travel."
good,"I worked for Target for a Holiday Season and was placed in Softlines (Clothing) and worked mostly Infants and Infant Hardlines. (Infant Clothing, Walkers, Cribs, Maternity Items). It was a fairly simple job. Put items away on the shelf that were returns. Any freight that was brought out was put onto the shelves. You had to pick up anything that guests had dropped on the floor, picked up spills, help customers and occasionally help with cashiering up front."
good,"I enjoyed working at target, I felt I was able to develop good Costumer service skills there and got to work with many other cultures. I also had fun even at stressful times during the season."
good,"A typical day would be where you come in and start restocking the shelves, zoning and making sure the isles are organized when the front would need help you would run to a register and help out until you were no longer needed. "
good,Working at Target has created a mind set of great work productivity. The company is very dedicated to allowing sales representatives to actively excel in communications and styles.
good,The pay is nice but I would only recommend for first jobs or college students. The pay is only sustainable for upper management. You will often be asked to do more than can be realistically be done in a day.
good,"It can pay some bills. There is a cut throat, vengeful, upbeat, smiling, polite otherwise, team oriented culture in Niles. I was told by another employee that Boardman was better."
good,"Good work environment. Plenty of work to stay busy, good for anyone who enjoys customer service. Good employee discounts. Many opportunities for cross training in all areas of the company."
good,I enjoy my job at Target. It is very competitive and a safe place to work. Target encourages you to work hard and strive to learn more. The pay is very competitive for the area.
good,"Good company to work for, if you just need to support yourself. It's not full time so it not meant for those who rely solely on a paycheck from here to provide for a family. Otherwise, management was good and coworkers were generally easy to get along with."
good,"Very easy and upbeat work. At times very stressful due to the lack of tools to help you be successful at your job (example, technology is very old). Everything is run off excel and only a few people in the entire supply chain can use it. Work life balance is great you work your 3 day or 4 day shift and that is it, nothing more is expected. Very little room for advancement once you have been “labeled”. Overall a great place to get your feet wet."
good,"It was a fun Christmas job. I don't do well with over night shifts, so the Thanksgiving night shift was hard.... Friendly coworkers. Helpful and nice bosses."
good,"Target is okay. Everyone is friendly, and it is always clean. Co workers are nice, bosses are knowledgeable, and the pace is fast. There is always something to do"
good,"i enjoyed getting to share my product knowledge with guests .I am a big people person working at target with the beauty products ,  it gave me the opportunity to connect with the guests on a personal level."
good,They promise positions and then they do not deliver the promise. i have been on the bench for a position for a year and still won't deliver even having a position available.
good,"In the began Target was a fun place to work. we were all one big family. Then management change and Team member was transfer out. As a cash office team member, I enjoy work there, after finishing up in the office I would come out and supervisor."
good,"Get reasonable experience in the working world."
good,can be very fun. sometimes it can be fast paced or very slow depending on the day or time of day. everyone was very nice and accepting of others backgrounds.
good,was a high paced job that required more of you that what was shown by managment. In the beginning I was happy but I was told by a manager that I was not good enough to work in a specific department and that I was better in the kitchen. that is not motivation or giving an employee encouragement to advance in their career. so I left the company all together.
good,"how to be really quick with retail work, kept me on my feet and kept me healthy, was a very fast paced atmosphere, challenging , co workers were fun and easy to get along with"
good,"I think Target is a great company to work with but I don’t agree with the new management. It’s very very poor..  Not all the ETL’s, STL’s and TL’s talk and interact with team members and others around the store. They don’t seem to really care about their employees.."
good,so i only got to work there for a few months. it was okay but not the best.  i was a stocking associate and there during christmas.  daytime was busy as always but great customers.
good,I worked a temporary position and was promised a position afterwards that my managers failed to deliver on. In addition to this my managers talked very badly about employees when they weren't around.
good,I love being able to be my authentic self and that they do provide so many benefits. I do not like that my role is paid the same as the people I am supervising.
good,It was a good job with good pay. The management needs some work. Good workers !but overall nice and steady hours.everyone is nice.very busy.good breKs
good,Overall it was a good place to work at least for a first job I think that would be a good base place to start off if you have no experience in customer service but overall it was great
good,"Just do your job and have fun. Learning your responsible areas will help you to better help the guest."
good,It was a decent job at first but honestly it was not worth it for uptight some of superiors were over a piece of plastic and how anxiety they gave me and to my other co-workers.
good,Everyone was nice. The people were always finding something for us to do. It hurt standing for long hours sometimes but it was a nice part time job. I would recommend.
good,I actually loved working at Target. One of the best environments I had worked in and I was able to meet amazing people. Unfortunately I had another job opportunity and I had to leave but I wish I hadn't
good,"Clocked in at time clock, then straight to cash register. Greeting guest, and helping guest were the highlights of the job. Worked eight hour shifts with one 15 minute break and a thirty minute break. Sold Target Debit/Credit cards."
good,"It was really great to have a consistent part time job while I was in school. But it is retail work in a popular chain store, so it can get rough especially around the holidays but some people thrive on that."
good,"Average place to work, however, hours were inconsistent and they cared very little for their employees especially during the holidays, but it was a corporate store and I made pretty good money as a cashier."
good,"A day at work would be helping guests and stocking products."
good,Target has a great place for work and the time you need to get the job done by the end of week it also has a great vacation benefit program and Target has a discount for their employees
good,"you have some overwhelming days, and some slow days . management did what they could to show appreciation and most of the employees got along pretty well"
good,Overall Target is no the worst place to work. You make some good friends and they do offer some advancement to those that they like. hours can be a struggle for in retail people are needed at all times throughout the day. Pay is fair and work culture is completely depended on the store you work at.
good,"Loved working for target. I like that it was fast paced, and i enjoyed getting to interact with the guests."
good,It’s  an okay place to work. Everywhere will be different but some management is extremely immature and not worth your time. Over all it was an okay experience
good,This place was a great first job. Was able to get some real-life experience. Management was very resourceful. potential to grow is there if you really put your mind to it. Enjoyed the years put in.
good,"The manager that I worked for was awful. He took credit for the work I did, threw me under the bus for things he did, all while I never ever saw him do much work (until the big boss came around). He was sort of a brown nosed guy. Always sucking up to the bigger guys. He didn't really treat us with respect or understand that we had lives outside of the workplace. But other than that, it wasn't that bad. But bad managers are the worst."
good,"Target pays great for a part or full time job, I just found that the managers are a bunch of whiny losers that do nothing but complain. I was encouraged to quit because I couldn't work the schedule they gave me."
good,I have enjoyed working for Target. It has been a great starting point for me to advance within my career. I am grateful for the experience I have been given. I work the daytime shift and have daily routines with communication to my managers almost everyday
good,It's an okay place to work at if you can stand the rude guests that you get from time to time. They don't teach you where the items are located when you first start out.
good,"Overall, I have loved working for Target. I have felt successful, because I have had good records achieving goals and I have great relationships with the guests. Management styles vary, though, and there can be a lot of stress."
good,Great company to work for but that is the extent of the comments taht I would like to leave at this time. It is not professional to leave comments that can no longer be backed.
good,"On an average day, I would clock in and get straight to my station, which I was assigned to and get right to work. It is a fast pace job for the most part but at times could be slow and lag."
good,I loved that I got to work with all different type of people. It was a great experience going through a remodel. It was like we got to see two side of everything. Also the customers love the way it turned out.
good,"I am working as purchase officer, per day 8 to 9 hour duty. collect 3 quotations and report to the manager. I am reporting to the procurement manager. i am working in Ajman head office. and i am enjoy my work."
good,The managers at my store talk to employees as if they are nothing. When you disagree with anyone of them you are subjected to termination even if they are wrong which is most of the time.
good,I liked most of the other employees. Did not like that they expected so much to get done in a very limited time line. The manager was very understanding and kind.
good,"Pays not bad after as many years as I have been there but the hours are not enough going up and down week to week, some people are Favorites and get hours if your in good with others but real hard workers most of the time are over looked"
good,Great company to work for overall day to day process are fair. After years of service I still believe Target will be the greatest company of all time.
good,"I loved working for Target. I was able to build my resume and learn a trade that will allow me to continue to connect with people, which is something I am passionate about.  I learned the value of team work and the importance of inclusivity across all work levels. Target helped mold me into the leader I am today."
good,I enjoyed working at Target. It was beneficial to me to get my foot in the door. After being there for over 5 years I could see that it really enhanced my customer service skills.
good,"Very repetitive, and not very fulfilling. New management doesn't seem to know what they're doing and has changed so many rules in the store, the employees have a hard time keeping up."
good,Team members fill a varity of roles. They need to be flexible and dependable.They interact with the public on a daily basis and need to he the skills to eal with all personality types.
good,"I worked there 3 yrs ago for the spam of 6 yrs. You tend to work with multiple people covering different departments with walkie communication, so if your new to the place you got a lot of support. Management can be two face as in friendly for the most part, but extremely aggressive when it comes to the ""Red Card"". It's all one big competition for them and the store but for us being force to push these sales they don't give us any reason to care and they praise and show favoritism to anyone that gets red cards constantly, favoritism in the form of unnecessary over walkie praises and more hours."
good,I learn that every job has different pace of how you become part of the team. I learn that you may not get hire with the company even if you've been with them almost a year.
good,"Target is high paced. Some of the managers suck, others are great. I worked here in college and they were relatively flexible with hours. There is no true advancement opportunities or it takes years."
good,"At first I was not going to apply to Target when I left my previous job but I am glad I work here now. The days can be stressful from guest assistance to some managers making the days harder instead of easier. Most of my co workers are easy to get along with and are from all walks of life. Target makes you realize how important it is to work together with everyone no matter how different people are from each other. My typical day as a cart attendant can be stressful because I have several roles in my store. My job is part housekeeper, janitor, guest service and cashier. I move from getting carts outside to assisting the lines for the cash registers and cover the guest service desk if necessary. I was somewhat cross trained before I had more responsibility but a lot of what I learned was on the job training from my own experience."
good,"The work place was an organized, and well regulated machine.  People were trained well and afterword were expected to continue about their assigned tasks with little to no need for micromanagement."
good,Working the overnight restock was a fast paced job. All shelves needed restock in a limited time. Although fast passed but not stressful. Overnight shift had little contact with day shift witch made communication sometimes difficult with what the direction of the store was taking week to week.
good,"Great place to work with flexible hours, great for students/retirees and as a part time job. If you are looking for a set schedule or a solid 40 hour work week then this job may not be for you unless you are part of the management team."
good,"Really laid back, and a perfect job for college or high school kids. Wouldn’t really recommend to anyone other than that. Super chill place to work, honestly."
good,"Good place to work."
good,its fast paced always something to do . pay isn't great but there is always the people that want to keep you there because they're great.overall its a good place to work
good,"I absolutely loved the energy and fast-paced work environment. I loved working with the consumers and trying to make them happy. I had many opportunities afforded me, while working at Target. The only negative I have is that, in order to be promoted to an Executive lever, you had to have a degree, in anything. There were many qualified people passed over, due to this."
good,"Target was at first was a great place work at, but over time it became harder to work there as they expected you to do more and more work for the same pay. The hourly wage isn't horrible though."
good,The job is fun and easy but lack on hours. no benefits and very unwilling to give you hours even when u want to work longer. the managers are easy going.
good,".Liked working with the public."
good,It can be stressful due to call ins on the weekends. This makes the people that are there have to work twice as hard. The pay isn't fair. I've been there 12 years and there's people coming in making the same as me or more. I believe that's not fair. They also don't schedule enough people on the weekends as well.
good,I had just returned from California which is my home so I had to find something in Florida quick and Target is what I got. Night shift. Unloading trucks. Nothing special.
good,"Good company, lack of work life balance. I enjoyed many aspects of the job, it teaches good leadership development and how to work with a wide variety of people."
good,Target is actually a great company to work for! It can be fast-paced and stressful sometimes especially during the holiday season. It takes a while for job development though and sometimes the managers can be unbearable.
good,"Working at target is very fun because you work with a lot of people. There are going to be people you don’t get along with and usually it’s your GSTL. But the co workers are amazing and always there to lend a hand. The job you’re doing gets old very quickly, unless you’re sales floor or in consumables."
good,I am a hard worker and had to multitask all the time all of which I enjoyed. Target was an enjoyable place to work they kept you busy you were never bored
good,Could be a very busy store with lots of customers and lots of work but you also had to deal with management that didn't always help out. The employees were awesome and the work environment was good
good,"I enjoyed working there during my time employed....the store was always a fun place to work at during the change of the seasons..."
good,"The hardest part of the job was probably dealing with all the customers that came through. We were required to ask them if they would like a Target Red Card, and that could get very difficult because customers would get angry at you. They also don't schedule many people for a full 8 hours. They would give me 5 1/2 hours a day, because they would rather not give you lunch, and getting a lunch required 6 hours of work. They made sure  that I was given my break which was one of the nicest things. The supervisors could be very rude at times about how you were cashiering and about how many Target Cards you opened. They will not hesitate to take an employee into an office when they are not opening cards."
good,For the past year and a half the experience at Target corporation has been positive with a steady pace to grow and learn. Overall I recommend working for Target
good,"When I worked there, I was contracted through Radio Shack. The commission structure was horrible. If you didn't sell enough, you didn't make enough to survive and some weeks there just weren't enough customers to make goal off of."
good,The job and pay were fair. I was passed up twice for a promotion. I feel that the job advancement possibilities were unfair and biased. I don't feel that they took previous experience seriously.
good,It was an okay job didn't really have anything to complain about the only thing that i didn't like was that the management team was very unfair and let me go because of a situation i couldn't help.
good,"When you start your shift you have to check in with the LOD ( Leader on Duty) to see if any adjustments to the work day will be needed for instance if the Dairy coolers seem low in stock to replenish those before you start on your tasks. They are pretty flexible on the hours so if you need to go to college and work, they will work with you to be able to go to school and work at the same time."
good,Target was very was very centered on achieving goals and keeping their employees motivated. The work days were repetitive and demanded focus to stay on course to achieve your goals.
good,great place to work.  have been trained in many different departments just a few that Ihavent been trained a mentor is always available to help you focus on a plan to be promoted to a team lead.  they give to the community always
good,Fun people to work with.  Customers were great. Learned a lot about the retail community. I worked in an office as an Administrative Assistant for 4yrs and an Accounts Payable Supervisor for 9yrs.
good,"The challenge on the daily job was monotonous. Very nice people to work with, however the job itself got quite repetitive. That being said, I did enjoy my time working there."
good,"Hired on as seasonal help, hired on as long term employee with Target, I liked the management very friendly staff, very much enjoyed interaction with guests."
good,Liked it some managers abused their power had a great work experience they change schedules on the spot to fix around other peoples schedules could of have made it fair
good,I like it better than my other job and I made a lot of friends. Everyone who works there is great and the job isn't very difficult. I would just like to add maybe not limit the employee discount to be used with cash or red card.
good,"great place to work,good people stress free environment. "
good,"Typical day you reshot all clothes from fitting room and make sure all clothes, shoes, and accessories are perfectly organized. There was no serious hard part about the job."
good,"Fun, friendly people. Great place to learn to interact with customers. Target really cares about their brand and how they are represented, and it shows in what they expect from the team members and management."
good,"20-25 hours per week.  Part-time work, hours are very dependent on store sales.  If you are in need of a part time job this may be for you.  Not really a way to make a living wage though."
good,Constant nagging from customers who believed to be privileged that carts are not dry during rainy or snowing seasons. Besides that other guest are awesome.
good,"As of current changes, I recommend not working at the Target in Lake Stevens, Wa, unless you have a lot of patience. "
good,"It was a great job for someone who just getting started in the world.  I had a wonderful experience working for Target. "
good,Depends on were you work and which store you work at. Some managers can be rude and also favorite more people than others which shouldn't be allowed..
good,"Overall, working at Target was a good experience. But it isn’t really the place for intensely creative minds and hands on workers/learners. Tasks are simple, but tedious and only few are recognized for their work. The HR team has messed up schedules often, making things for team members harder and increasing numbers of call outs and team members quitting."
good,"Never enough payroll. Expectations are high for some but not for all. Accountability is non existent. Advancement based on popularity not skill. Team leaders are shown much more respect than team members. A lot of drama, mostly created by management. Confidentiality among executives was poor. Most enjoyable was the ability to make friends that were trustworthy."
good,Target was very challenging to work for. Payroll is tied to sales which makes it difficult to maintain standards of the store. People are great and so are the guests.
good,"My experience at Target was unpleasant due to the poor leadership in my store. My Store Team Leader was non-responsive to issues within the store, and made work stressful."
good,"A typical day at Target involved stocking and restocking, as well as running errands for customers and contacting sister stores to see if they could help where we could not. I learned the importance of truly stopping and listening to the customer; a question that you may have heard thirty times already is often times the first time this particular customer has asked it. The management are very friendly and cooperative; they understand if you need help completing a task and will send the needed help your way. The culture of Target was very inviting and caring; we made sure our fellow team members were never without. The hardest part of the job was probably getting multiple tasks done while you are also running around to assist customers that would prefer that you walk them places or physically bring the an item. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to put a genuine smile on someone's face whenever they felt adequately assisted."
good,the managers are really nice and easy going. I really enjoy working with the electronics and my work days go by quickly. Plus I get to help guests every day and that is rewarding for me.
good,Constantly busy on your feet and underpaid. Sometimes the managers have outrages expectations when they themselves couldn't reach to goals/expectations at hand.
good,target is a great company and most of the managers are great there are a few that aren't the best but over all the work is fun and the people are great
good,"By far a great place to work. The customers are great, the other employees are great. The only problems I ran into was the upper management. The store manager seems to be able to do and say whatever he pleases. I may be just a bottom of the barrel worker, but I won't stand for that. I started working there before he became the store manager, and when he arrived the store lost a lot of great employees because of him. I just couldn't take him making others, and myself included, feel inadequate, when I know we do our jobs to the best of our abilities."
good,Target is a good place to work at everyone is very friendly it would be a great job to stay out if they gave you 40 hours a week. unloading the truck and stocking is good because you know what your job is everyday the manger dont have to monitor you as much.
good,It was an ok place to work but your feet paid for it the most. I met some great people working there and still keep in contact with those people. Work environment was very busy....I hated working on holidays though
good,"Working for target is pretty cool. The uniform is not to strict, the franchise is huge and one of the best companies. Overall target is a decent job to have."
good,you have to make this job fun... depending on what store management is different. Also depending on location on how busy your store is take in consideration that it is a fast pace job.
good,It’s just like any other job you just have to figure out why you are there stick to your plan .. always opportunities to advance you just have to be willing to become a global team member
good,"needs better management in some cases but all around not bad. work was busy almost always it was go go go , there was constant restocking and no place for everything to go."
good,"If your looking for a job to get back on your feet, this is the place for you, I don't believe this is a lifetime advancement job, however it is a good job for temporary."
good,A typical day at Target was very fast paced and fun! engaging the guest and making sure your environment was clean us a big plus when working there. Target also has many other benefits besides the regular ones to help their team become better not only at work but also at home.
good,"I started out at the Guest Service Desk, then promoted to Photo Lab, then was promoted to Guest Service Assistant.  I also worked in the pharmacy and food avenue.  I worked on the floor where ever I was needed."
good,"Being a temp at Target.com in Brooklyn Park, MN is not good. We are not treated nearly as well as employees and do not receive any benefits including holiday pay.  I would suggest putting in an application at Target.com instead of through a temp service if you would like to work at Target.com"
good,Amazing company! I love this place and what it stands for. It is one of the very few places where costumer service still exists. Management can be a mixed bag but very veteran friendly!!!
good,Some of hardest working people in the business. A great place to work and learn. Most will excel given the chance. The most enjoyable part of the job is the hard working people.
good,I started at 16 and over three years I worked there. I received good development throughout my duration in the company but by the end i was not treated properly. Nor was the opportunity of job management to climb due to non employee development from leaders.
good,I like the management there but I don't think its too fair to bring in new employees and pay them more than their current employees. They could also up their game on the employee discount and not make it so hard to use it.
good,"A typical day at work was sales floor or cashier. There is one general manager then multiple leaders of a department. The workplace was stressful and messy. I felt as much work as I did, nothing was good enough. The hardest part of the job was being criticised for your work performance. There is never a slow day. Most enjoyable part of the day was being around coworkers. My coworkers were always very helpful and pleasant to be around."
good,I enjoyed working for target and there was a lot of opportunity but the pay was always very low and the raises were o ku about 10 cents a year. That does not get you very fare.
good,Really not a bad place but Target is kind of full of itself. Management at the store I worked at was all over the place and favoritism was at it's finest. Management could be hired in because of a degree with no retail experience.
good,"Target is a okay place to work as your first job, it is nice and relaxing for the most part. Nothing too stressful as long as you keep working and take breaks on time."
good,"A typical day of work at Target is you come in, assemble your work equipment, and start working. You must take you 2 15 min breaks and a 46 min lunch if working 8 hours. The management here work with you and they have an open door policy. The hardest part of the job is when you are getting close to completing your day and you have more work that needs to be done. The most enjoyable part of working at Target is the different activities they do for their team members."
good,fast paced low pay. hours not worth the pay. very fast paced sometimes feel unappreciated. no benefits which can be a downside but pretty easy to move up.
good,"This Target store is very enjoyable to work for. I enjoy the guests and my co-workers. The management is friendly and fun to work for. Since I know this is temporary, I'm happy i chose Target to work for. They are very accommodating with my hours and they are they same every week. I enjoy it here but I'm ready to find a position which will utilize my skills."
good,"bosses are nice, and flexible.  co-workers are also nice and super helpful. meetings were always fun and kept workers in the loop as far as sales and losses."
good,"I would recommend working there if the person is interested in making it a career.  The employees are very friendly, as is the management.  There is a huge lack of communication between departments as well as between the headquarters and store level."
good,"At Target a day as a cashier looked like ringing people up, getting asked a lot of questions about discounts and anything else, bagging groceries and other products, dealing with difficult customers, and making the 'guest' as happy as possible. Since it was my first job I learned how many hours I would typically like, I learned how to cashier, and I got a better idea that working is about showing up and doing a good job no matter what. The workplace environment was very supportive, any help you needed was just a couple feet away. Everyone there was very nice and welcoming, the other employees were really the best part of the job."
good,I worked in the back room at Target. The only real complaint I have is that I was promised that I would be put on as full time after the holiday season and when that time came around they said they couldn't afford to put me on as full time. I thought that being full time was going to get me more hours but really all full time means at Target is the state minimum 32 hrs per week.
good,The team leads are great but the logistics hinder the entire process and waste time. The schedules are very inconsistent and the human resources doesn't really work with you.
good,"The work itself was never the issue, the fact that in a college town the management couldn't work with student's hours was the major problem. As far the job is concerned, it's not a hard job most days, the co-workers are amazing, and it's a very cool place to work. However, there were multiple times I had to talk to the my boss about overlap with hours, and I know other people had the same issue, yet it was never resolved."
good,Management expected us to stack shelves and complete it within an impossible time. I liked the job just didn't like the management. Workers always work they but off.
good,"The store was new and we were the first team that was hired. Place is decent but management was not that great. I had two jobs and  even when my shift should be over around 6am, supervisor wont let you leave. jobs wasn't really assigned and it can be chaotic "
good,"There are a few positives things about this company. For starters, you get paid weekly, the benefits are awesome and your shift doesn't interfere with your life. You'll either work four day and have three days off or you'll work three days and have four days off."
good,"Team work culture"
good,I don't believe it's a job that you dream of but it's a great milestone. I went to work every single day and I really like working with others. The problem was they didn't appreciate all of the extra work that I did. It became more of an expectation.
good,Target is a great first place to work but the management was bad and they didnt care about you. I met amazing people there and it taught me a lot of things.
good,"In the beginning the work environment was good, however they made to many changes concerning staffing and managers. Never had the same supervisors for more than six months at a time. It was extremely cold in the winter and overly hot in the summer. Overall it was a good work environment."
good,target is a good place to work. there's a lot of people on staff and they'll help if you need that includes customers. You'll be on your feet most of the but breaks are given during the shift.
good,overall I would say that things we're ran very smooth and the environment was calm and friendly however the lunchbreaks could've been longer due to the distance having to walk to get to the break room but overall it's not a bad place to work
good,"The ping pong table in the break room brings up a distraction which pulls most team leads, and etls off the floor during productive times to play turnements against each other. while on company time. not on breaks and not on lunches. Also the team leads take credit of all the employees work under which the the employees below the leads do all the work. Although being in the Pfresh department is fun and exciting department to be in and work."
good,i had fun working for target but they pay and benefits weren't good enough to super almost any body. The work isn't that hard and the environment is positive for the most part
good,This is a Great Part Time job. Flexible Schedules ability to be cross trained in different areas which can allow you to learn many different skills. Team work is a must.
good,"Morning huddles are very informative, getting started is good all day is  normally pretty good, Work most of the time is plenty more than time will ever allow some of us to finish. I have learned how to handle and deal with new and constant changes, new managers, team leads, ect. work place culture is fine adapting to it is easy. The hardest part of the job is the part time, I have done this for the first time in my life and in all my jobs, and for 10yrs i still can't get use to how it works. for some and not for others. The most enjoyable part of the job is loving what i do and the challenge's that are sometimes given me."
good,"The place is in Downtown Los Angeles, which means it will always be busy. But that is a good thing because you will always something to do. Some employees are more mean than the customers."
good,hardest part of the job is maintaining sections while guests keep coming and messing it all up  and asking for things and having to do go backs all at
good,I actually enjoyed this time being with a team that got along very well and because we where always having a good time doing our job with the customer.
good,Good job if you enjoy working retail for a striving company. I've learned a lot from it and have recommended it to a few people in my years of working there.
good,"I spend a lot of time working , I was known for always doing doubles to make extra money. I enjoyed working at target , always kept me busy and I loved interacting and helping customers. Also enjoyed helping out co workers when help was needed."
good,I get the ball rolling by unloading the trucks to get the freight to the floors we can push and come clean before the store opens up and make sure its in order for the day shift
good,"Overall it was a good work experience.  The management and lack of consistency involving training and basic expectations was disappointing.  Communication is key, and due to a influx of department management shuffling or simply a lack of consistent managers communication suffered greatly. And job performance expectations shifted drastically week to week depending on who was management in your department."
good,"Our store had weak management, which created a hectic work space. The full time store staff were more educated than the management, and we lost and gained several new managers in the span of a few months. It caused a confusing environment for the workers, and inconsistencies in expectations of staff made it difficult to flow smoothly as a store."
good,I enjoyed working for Target. The only problem I had was the fact that I was a seasonal employee. Since I was only hired temporarily there was no job security. I was a hard worker and was recommended by many customers and co workers as a after seasonal hire on but I was not given that opportunity. When the Holiday season ended they notified me that I would not be hired as a regular employee and given notice of my last day.
good,"Stop bye the mobile tech department and get a new phone upgrade gift cards great customer service and some"
good,"Most of the time you come in and you stand in one place for a little more the 4 hours before you leave from your shift."
good,"I really did love working here. Besides it being a simple hire, I just hoped the managers were more organized. The other coworkers were all amazing and energetic."
good,"It's alright, the section leaders can sometimes be really judgemental. The pay is really great, but you also run the risk of getting asked to do too much he work in a very short period of time and with little to no recognition."
good,good experience and got a lot out of it for the time that is was there was offered part time work because they were impressed with how well i worked but was unable to take the offer
good,"I was only part time at Target Portrait Studios but the staff was very friendly and welcoming and made the experience enjoyable. There were only two things that I did not agree with and one was an assistant manager that would not do her job unless it could make her a sale and there wasn't much of a raise. Other than that, I really enjoyed being a photographer at this studio and gaining more knowledge about posing people and getting the right lighting. I feel like this has really helped me!"
good,"a very typical job. "
good,"a typical day arrive at 4am pull orders for the day in grocery and for everything on the floor. also backstock everything that comes of the semi daily. keep backroom stocked and clean. the most enjoyable part of the job were my team mates all were wonderful people to work with, taught me allot"
good,"Target is a very good place to work as long as all you require is part time work. It is bright, friendly and upbeat. Fellow team members and supervisors are extremely helpful and understanding​."
good,"Organized merchandise on selling floor and in fitting room."
good,"Target was actually great in the beginning, even great in the evening. When you first start out you literally get 40 hours per week but the longer you been there and the more new people get hired your hours drop alot."
good,"I have only worked at 1 store. I have seen lots of different managers come and go, some good some better, This can make a difference because it does trickle down."
good,i would came in look at this bored that had the area that i would be working it would also tell us when to clean the bathroom and ho turn it was at certain time.if i was assigned to a register then i would clean and dust my area before opening my lane  check guest out take care of extreme coupning customers
good,Nice evorinment to work in good benefits. Advancement is not the good but sometimes fair. you can learn a lot if interested. Its a great opportunity  to meet new people.
good,"The work itself is pretty easy, and it really doesn't take much to work there. Due to the people I was working with it was a very political place, and that made the work itself more stressful. Management was not very helpful when it came to the issues between coworkers, and it was not handled the way it should have been."
good,My day would start literally as soon as i clocked in. There isn't much time for talking or communicating because nothing would get done in time. I loved the work pace. it made my day go by faster than normal. The management reminds me of the cool kids in high school. They stick together. Hardest part about my job is the amount they want done in so little time. Most enjoyable part of my job is that i complete my task before i leave almost every time. Makes me feel successful.
good,"Target does a lot of things right. My decision to leave was mostly due to a particular supervisor's unwillingness to do her job. For the most part it is a good company to work for, just be prepared for some serious political drama in the upper management scene."
good,"A typical day would comprise of taking returns and exchanges helping with order pickups and answer telephone inquires. I have learned how to work as part of a team and also improved customer service and customer relation skills. The direct management is great they are helpful and insightful, however upper management is quite different as in they expect you to do more than required to lighten their own workload and show no appreciation for your efforts. The hardest part of the job is dealing with irate guests in the store and extra tasks given by upper managers, the most enjoyable part is completing said tasks and handling tense situations or irate guests in an orderly fashion."
good,"Target was a fun place to work and relatively laid back.  They are quick to provide advancement if you work hard.  Also, discounts is always a plus at a place like that."
good,"If retail is your passion, Target is the best place to get your career started.  Target promotes great culture and diversity in its development and growth of its team members.  The best part of the job is the great interaction with team members and creating a great guest experience. As an ETL work life balance can be tough. Overall Target is a great place to begin a career in Apparel all the way to the top as a Store Team Leader."
good,Been here for a long time and have been seeing a decline in overall customers leading to less cashflow for store leading to less hours for workers. Rough market.
good,macys was ok to work for . i worked part time and worked close with the human resources team. i liked it overall. i loved the holiday decorations that went up around Christmas time !
good,Target is a great place to work if you need a part-time job or if you are in high school. The schedule is flexible and you get your 10% discount. The pay could be better.
good,"A typical day would start off by getting into the cashier line and waiting for customers and then processing their orders.I learned a lot of communication skills, small talk to keep the customers going and how to deal with tough situations. Eventually got moved to an item stocker position where i would check if the products were there and if not then put in an order from the system that that Target provided for us. Management was decent, they took care of you as an employee but also let you know that you were replaceable. Workplace culture was very fast paced and it was like get your job done on  time, make sure to finish your job first and do what you  are told."
good,"Job that's fast paced that keeps you on your toes, Friendly Co workers, Busy Location, Management could use some work Too much turn over at the end,Early Morning hours can get some getting usedto"
good,I worked at target for 10years it was a 40hr /week job. fast paced fun yet disciplined environment.  The job after forth quarter -January-may the hours the last 2 years got extremely low and the management kept telling us that the hours were going to be returning to normal -however after the hours were consistently low we were finally told that  they had no intention of giving us back our fulltime hours.
good,"I have worked in other retail companies and Target is one of the better companies to work for. It does have its drawbacks but overall a decent place. Management is ok depending on who you deal with at the time of your shift. It seems sometimes like they want you to commit like everyday to the store, but can understand if you have other commitments."
good,When I go into work my goal is to make sure that everything is done so that when the next person comes in to take over for me their job is easier not harder! It's all in helping each other out.
good,"Target is simply an amazing team to be part of.  Target aspires to put people first and does everything possible to make that happen.  Values, reviews etcetera are all focussed around the people.  That's a big win.  Unfortunately, the nature of the business requires a solid, laser-like focus around task to the degree that it can be difficult to truly be as people-focussed as you would like to be.  "
good,"Prepare yourself for the RedCard. If you are cashiering, the supervisors only care about how many RedCards you got that day, and if you don't meet their ""goal"" they've set for you, you get a lecture. "
good,"Overall the work atmosphere was pleasant, but benefits were sadly lacking and job security was unsteady. Job advancements were almost non-existent in this store and management could have been trained a tad more on how to handle certain situations."
good,"Target is a fun place to work, the employees are nice and friendly.  The management, depends on who it is.  Overall I had a great experience working there."
good,Assisted guests with purchases. Restocked sales floor and organized sales floor. Re shop items from customer service and sort out into location and categories.
good,Sort and inventory products for the correct departments. Work in teams in order to tackle sections safely and time efficient. Clean up areas before store opens.
good,"This job would be beneficial for those beginning in the service industry. It gives you experience in guest service, while driving company goals as a team."
good,Ok place to work could be better. Great shift only three work days four off. Twelve hour shifts it's nice but could be better like everything in life overall.
good,"Cashiering can be chaotic, but guests can be enjoyable to work with in a fast paced environment. I have learned time management, verbal communication, teamwork, flexibility, conflict resolution, listening to guests for opinion"
good,"Management is not very well here, there are problems with workers calling in sick daily causing workload issues. Work not being done and you will have to make up their work on top of yours."
good,Job was pretty relaxed for the most part and the customers were never much of a problem. They also had great sales while i was a member as well which allowed me to take full advantage.
good,"Steady work environment, positive faced past place to work.  I learned alot about order picking and would have loved to be able to stay in this position however it was only temporary it was a very positive experience."
good,"Overall, a strong leader in retail.  Good place to start your career in retail management.  Company gives back, cares about the guest, and tries to give the guest the best service.  Most enjoyable part of the job is free range of owning your business and being creative."
good,"i would come in set up for the morning by doing the food prep, setting all the tables and drink stations up. pre warming the oven, i would set the cash register up and get the pop corn going and make sure my are was all claen and safe to be in."
good,"Working here was actually a huge blast and i loved it a lot."
good,"target was a good job , they taught me how to actually work. it was easy at first becuase i just saw it as a part time job. but when i wanted to move up and get promoted things just wernt easy. target is a bug store so theres always going to be other people trying to get promoted to, its just hard to get noticed.but other than that it was a nice chapter in my life."
good,Target is okay to work for. Red cards are the Bain of your existence so if you are thinking of applying here try to get onto the sales floor. Decent starting pay and a lot of networking opportunities
good,"Great company, managers are reasonable to work with benefits and pay could be better overall pretty good company to work for"
good,Started as morning stocking and advanced to backroom member. Liked to organization factor of this type of job. Disliked the turn around was so high due to poor management and training. Quit because of health issues with my pregnancy.
good,Target is a very nice job to work at if you are just starting out to work. The managers are nice the coworkers are friendly and the pay is okay.It is also a very easy job.
good,"A typical day included stocking shelves, pricing, enjoying serving customers needs. Fellow employees were friendly, helpful and the supervisor was nice and understanding."
good,"This corporation is wonderful, they stand for a lot of good things. i had a lot of fun working for target and would absolutely recommend it to other people. its amazing pay and amazing people to work with but it does come with a catch. if you miss a certain amount of days no matter how good you are they cut your hours or even try to get you to leave the job, they dont make exceptions even if you have valid reasons not to be there. your mental or physical health is pushed to the side even if you experience a panic attack at work thats bad enough to need medical attention. if you're mentally stable and in perfect health then you'll be able to hold onto this job just fine as long as you do the work. i do recommend this place tho, it taught me how to be confident and help others when they need it."
good,"A typical day of work includes unloading the shipping container, stacking pallets, moving the boxes to each aisle, and stocking said aisles. The workplace culture is quiet and efficient. Each employee focusing on the task at hand. The consistent muscle strain would be the biggest hindrance of the job. And the fast paced work is enjoyable."
good,Hard physical labor but good compensation. Unloading or loading trucks for 10-12 hours a day. Be ready to work nonstop for long periods of time. Large building makes breaktime hectic.
good,Target wasa great opportunity at the time when i needed a second part time job i worked on the flow team unloading trailers and stocking shelves and made $12 an hour ( 10 was minimum at the time
good,"I applied at Target because I needed a place to work while I am going to school. I live very close to the Target I work at so my commute after school is not bad."
good,"working for Target was an all around good experience, the managers were friendly and understanding and created a calm work environment and didn't make you feel stressed out and your coworkers are easy to work with"
good,Friendly coworkers and nice environment. Good management. The hours are pretty short only about 25hrs/week. That's it.
good,"Working at Target is a great experience. The pace is quick, and there is always something available to work on. The employees are kind and very helpful, especially towards newly hired team members."
good,"Some managers are stressful and the hours are incredibly unsteady, same with benefits. The actual job is pretty good though and for retail, the pay is pretty fair."
good,"I worked for Target for 9 years, in that time I witnessed massive management and team member turnover. In my experience most people make it at most to the 10 year mark more likely the 3 year mark before the lack of work life balance sends them on their way to hunt for employment elsewhere.  If you are just getting in to the work force target is awesome, usually plenty of hours and  easy work."
good,"Fast paced work place , great benefits. Managment isn't all that great . The pay is awesome . I learned more about line monitoring. The hardest part of working there is people slack in their work that you have to pick up on."
good,"Unfortunately my experience with store management was another experience of poor management. I enjoyed working with my team and coworkers, but upper level management was subpar, training was lacking, and theres was no development."
good,"Tons of hours.  Called in on days off, spent the night at the store on many occasions, but good pay.  Simply didn't have time to see it!  Thanks for the opportunity to review."
good,Target was a great place to work because I got meet many customers and and co workers from many places around the world. I got to learn about different cultures.
good,"was a friendly place to work, retail expects a lot of work from it's employees and most of the young workers lack the experience to deal with customers so it was a fun place to mentor these kids."
good,"Good management and co-workers, very customer friendly.  Flexible with scheduling.  Company is very community involved."
good,"Great place to learn team building skills."
good,"A typical day at work suggests helping customers find what they need, listening to their concerns regarding an item(s), folding/picking up merchandise and putting away. Most of my coworkers were fun and nice to talk to. This job is nice to have but after awhile, I started to feel unwelcome because I am going through a tough time and my managers do not understand. Sometimes it makes me feel bad. But overall this job is very nice."
good,"The hardest and most tiring job Ive had, you really hustle and move to continue the steady flow of product.  The people make it fun and exciting."
good,"Target is actually a good first job, or some one looking to make some extra money on the side.  As far as a career goes, unless you have a degree of some sort you will never advance past the level one entry."
good,"Simple enough job to work. Main struggles include helping guests and the feeling of doing most of the work by yourself. Overall though, they pay well and work very well with hours while going to school."
good,"I worked in the stock room, keeping products on the floor that were selling and backstocking whatever was not. There was a lot of blatant disregard for safety rules, but we always managed to get the job done without anyone getting hurt. I always tried to obey the rules, but I was commonly chastised for it by my co-workers and even sometime by lower management, but it did not phase me. I enjoyed my job and the pace at which the day moved. I would have gladly stayed, but, alas, the position was only seasonal."
good,I loved the work. the management played favorites and even dated people under them and above. There was special treatment and no acknowledgement for hard work.
good,"I only worked here briefly. But, I absolutly loved my experience "
good,This job consisted of stocking the shelves overnight and working the floor when the store opened. I was pretty neutral about my employment there equal pros and cons.
good,"Target is a fast paced, team oriented environment. On a daily basis, I am responsible for whatever area I am assigned, to ensure the cleanliness and organization of it. I am expected to handle guest questions, calls, and complaints. Honestly, management at this particular location is not the best at communication. My co-workers, although they come and go, are a joy to work with. We work as a team to get the job done. After almost four years of employment with this company, I find it difficult to get the training I need to advance. I have mentioned this numerous times to my supervisor but have yet to receive any cross-training. Overall, I find joy in knowing that I have accomplished my tasks on a day to day basis to the best of my ability. I enjoy working in a fast, fun, and friendly, team oriented environment."
good,"Great place to work at to when i was looking to increase my skills of customer service and retail, but slowly changed and management started to shift away from the family ideals and move toward treating everyone as subordinates."
good,"I currently have a Good supervisor. there's nothing hard or difficult about working at Target, it's pretty nice. I learned a lot about team work, and dealing with challenging day to day problems. It's a good place to learn how to problem solve. It can be really hard working with co-workers that are pretty lazy and unmotivated"
good,"Great cast of employees, fun culture and fun experience best job I have ever worked, teached me to grow in customer service."
good,"Great place to learn what it's like to work in a corporate atmosphere.  Wonderful for entry level employees who want to learn specific skills.  Very difficult to get managerial experience.  Commons area has ping pong, video games and has seasonal events."
good,I like working here but  I can't see my career advancement. I feel I am over qualified for the role. So I am seeking for better opportunity.
good,"Target is a friendly environment, employees are always there to help each other out, the work there is fast and fun and easy."
good,"The company is great with working around schedules, however they don't offer much incentive to move up in the company. The hours are terrible after holiday time, you will be lucky to get 4hrs a week."
good,You will have a nice social experience working here. You will make lots of friends. Work load is tough sometimes but overall its okay. There always food in the break room! and management often treats us to party and hot food.
good,"Target is a great company to work for if you dont mind working a ton, that includes nights, weekends and holidays no matter what position you are in."
good,"I like Target's company morals, how they treat guests, how they treat employees, and the progressiveness they strive for. I don't like that they push the Red Card issue so much, pushing employees to pester customers and giving bad reviews as part of that isn't fair. I would much rather make sure the customer feels welcomed and appreciated than spend my entire encounter with them being pushy about something that, honestly, if they don't have already they probably don't want."
good,"They provided for on certain occasions like meeting huge goals or working with a rough schedule. Some management was helpful, others not."
good,"Target is a great place to begin your career, especially if you are interested in exploring the business world. There is a very robust training and continued training/onboarding programs when you begin as well as when you advance. Depending on your team, work/life balance is flexible."
good,despite the working at 4AM shift this job was pretty cool. Especially if you're a college student just trying to survive in school this is very perfect. Some of the ETL and team leads don't know what they are doing but besides that it was a cool job.
good,"It is a fun place to work and I have made many friends. I would apply here again, but not as cashier, maybe back room or strictly service desk or sales floor."
good,"Clean environment and dependable work place.  Enjoyed my fellow team members and management."
good,"Working at Target gets you accustom to working with people handling tense areas especially during the holidays and also teaches you how to multi-task. Management is good as long as they know how to talk to there workers and guests, so talk to them not at them. Its a great place for people to learn good work ethics and habits."
good,"The company has amazing benefits for the employees and very diverse.  The company offers full medical and dental insurance along with a 401k plus a company 5% match. There are other corporate discounts."
good,"Every day was different with being yelled at in 20 different directions from Supervisors and LOD's (Leader on Duty) who had absolutely no clue what was going on. Going back there today I can see not much has changed. Imagine looking both ways before crossing the street and then getting hit by an airplane. That is what it feels like to work for these people. None of them are willing to work with you if you need time off, it gets sent into some computer system, and whenever corporate people come for a visit the ""LOD's"" go crazy to try and cover up their mistakes that they consistently make all day. No one with any position of power there is willing to work with anyone and I have even see them mock people and make fun of them. In fact.. How some of them even got into a leadership role forces me to question Targets promotion policy. But besides that the co workers are great, hours are terrible, I learned a lot of patience, and enjoyed making friends."
good,Interesting place to work. All about the results. The best part were the team members who I had the opportunity to work with and accomplish great things. VERY POOR for management in regard to personal time including lunches and breaks. Management around me also faced the same challenges but most had only worked there and did not have another point of reference
good,"Team oriented working environment with time-set goals. Assisting in stock, product location, guest assistance, and cashier responsibilities. I have learned how to talk to guests under strenuous conditions, as well as attention to details."
good,Clean and fast paced work environment. Good benefits for employees and families. Room for advancement in different departments.
good,"Good work environment, great staff and management. However, the hours are unreasonable and guests tend to be rude. My coworkers are the best part of working in this retail store."
good,"A day start with meeting and what needs to do with a day."
good,"This was lot of years ago, shifts were pretty straight forward and you knew it 2 weeks in advance."
good,"Out of all my high school jobs, I enjoyed working here the most. I just wished they did not force us to speak about red cards to guests, because it often resulted in guests getting upset with us."
good,Target is a great company. They have flexible schedules and work in a team environment.This company is great for someone that wants to work in a call center environment.
good,"No hours if you are hourly. Learned how to cashier. Management is always revolving, you get to know one manager and then all of a sudden they are gone. Coworkers are great, gossip is everywhere. Hardest part of the job is time management, so many projects and not enough time or people to complete. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the completion of a project as well as seeing the guest smile when you help them out by going the extra mile."
good,"Every day consists of basically lots of cardio since my department walks roughly 10+ miles a day. It is a great thing really in my opinion. Management is hard to deal with at times because it feels like my department has to walk on eggshells many times. Life as a team member can be good most days, but when there are bad days, they can be really bad. If you can look past the attitudes of some people, its not that bad of a job. The benefits, good people when you find them, and being able to become an asset to the store is refreshing. I'm sure that most of this can be said of a lot of jobs, but this is really just an opinion of my current workplace. It doesn't have a lot of bias in it as it could have. Especially since the whole point of trying to be a professional is to be as unbiased as possible."
good,Great brand. Customer. Great team of associates. Great relationship with management. Low compensation and benefits were mediocre. Little room for advancement.
good,Unloading the trucks while stocking the shelfs before the store opens. Make sure the team gets out at a certain time before we go over our hours.
good,"It isn't a bad place to work, but there were times when management would not listen to employees.  This resulted in a lack of communication between team members and executive team leads.  The best part of the job was working with people that are dependable and fun.  I always knew I could count on them.  The hardest part was working with a bunch of minors that still have overinflated egos and that are full of excuses."
good,"High focus on guest satisfaction. Team based work groups, learning about different work areas in the store. Adapting to constant changes that are suppose to make the job fun, trendy and quick."
good,Everyone that I work with are extremely nice and willing to help if needed. It is a lot nicer then working at other places. The atmosphere is more upbeat. Everybody is extremely supportive.
good,"I love working in my job, the atmosphere and environment with my co workers is nice. I am gaining experience working with a diverse population and hands on experience as well."
good,Target is a fun place to work but not somewhere to make a career at for a pharmacy technician.  There is not room for growth.  I have learned a lot there since this was my first retail pharmacy. My co-workers are amazing.  The hardest part of the job is being under staffed every day especially during the summer months.  The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the smile on a guests face when you tell them you have saved them a lot of money by finding them a coupon along with their insurance.
good,I start my day by going through my task list on my I-Pod. Which involves counting merchandise. I help with guest questions and directing them to areas around the store. I back-stock merchandise and also stock the floor.
good,Overall I enjoyed working at Target. The pay was okay. At the time I should have sought out other positions before I resigned. I still patronize the store on a monthly basis.
good,"open clean "
good,"This job has good flexibility for college, the pay is decent and some of the people i worked with were awesome. The management wasn't the greatest. I learned how to enhance my customer service skills."
good,The best co-workers ever. The job was fun and you get to meet new people everyday. Hardest part of the job was keeping up with everything the managers threw at you while keeping customers happy. Multi-tasking is definitely a must.
good,A typical day at work is a punch in and some busy work with the off chance of recognition from a leader at the daily huddle. The hardest part of this job is accepting that you're stuck where you are and that you have a very small chance of moving up.
good,"Target has allowed me to hone my skills to prepare me to move on in the workforce. The couple of years that I have worked there, I've enjoyed many of my co-workers and learned a lot from them. The hardest part of the job was being able to get full-time hours. Management is effective when the management team communicates with one another."
good,"If one does not believe that gay marriage should be sociably and culturally acceptable, then do not work for or do not speak against management.  Target has said to its stockholders to leave if they do not believe an acceptable views of gay marriage."
good,Store Manager is very kind and friendly to all employees. Enjoy working with my fellow colleagues but pay is not the greatest.
good,A typical work day would be unloading the truck. Put merchandise away. Restock shelves. And occasionally be a cashier whenever needed.
good,A typical day at work starts at 6AM until 6PM. I have learned many different things during my tenor at Target. We have a great team of managers who are very approachable with questions or concerns. The co-workers I work with are very helpful and hard working. The hardest part of the job are the long days. The most enjoyable part of the job is working in a positive and professional atmosphere.
good,Most of the management care about the numbers and not about employees. They try to provide opportunity for hardy working good employees that kiss the right bum to move up.
good,"Good job for student or first timer , clean and upbeat environment . Definitely better then Wal-Mart. "
good,A typical day at work would be a fast paced work environment. There is always something to do. Guest assistance is very important.
good,This was a school program that I was in. I gained valuable insights on how to do things and how to be a leader though. Fun to do and good experience.
good,Target is a great place to work and offers its team members many opportunities to advance within the company. Upper management does a good job of balancing work and personal needs for their team members.
good,"I really enjoyed Target! It was great place to work with great people. The company is going through a lot and this is making it not quite as enjoyable place to work. They don't promote based on results, but rather in image which is ridiculous and some leaders seriously don't have a freaking clue."
good,"A typical day at work would involve meeting the vendors that came to our back dock doors, and sign their shipments and take temp, on the food products. check for damage or expiry on all the shipments. we would get lots of DVDs and CDs in a day that i would have to check and count and put into our inventory system, then i would receive it into our system. i would have to bring the food shipments (milk, and starbucks shipments) to the coolers and or freezer depending on where it needed to go. "
good,Target was a great company to work for and I loved my job. Everyday was a new learning experience. I learned how to be a better supervisor from this position and how to learn my team. The hardest part of my job was keeping my team motivated when they knew the store was closing. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my team and the community.
good,"What was once described as a stable place where you could expect solid job security has has experienced 4 rounds of layoffs in the two years I was employed there. I believe that the company is making difficult decisions that will pay off, but the current culture is chaotic, volatile and uncertain. "
good,"Motto Fast, Fun, and Friendly, these three words represent Target uniqueness, however, sometimes management and Target policies made the work experience a nightmare. The atmosphere at target warehouse was like a prison. It was nice in the beginning, but eventually it became a sad habit of oppression for a lot of workers. Management felt like a kinder-garden once again because senior workers used to teach everything they knew to management that change constantly. The called Group Leaders are recent college graduates in their earliest twenties and thirties. After receiving a proper training, managers turned their backs on workers and pushed them over their physical capacity in order to finish the job. The overall productivity and expectations for workers was insane ""Impossible.""  The hardest part of my job was not been appreciated for what I used to do on a daily  basis. Salary was good, but I would have given away a couple of dollars of my hourly rate in order to get a better treatment as an employee."
good,Good company however definately played favorites and it didnt last long in canada thus making a bunch of us lose our jobs.
good,"Typical day at work Greeting Guest with Fast Fun and Friendly attitude and making sure guest are issue free and happy as they shop with Target"
good,I would come in and zone the store and help with customers. I learned how the face things and a great deal about time management.
good,"I am always needed, great co-workers, the hardest part of the job is getting there. I love going to work every day."
good,The position taught me so much about inventory and team managements.
good,"A typical day at work is actually very simple. Clock in, unload truck with 2,000-2,800 cartons of freight, boxes go down a conveyor belt line and we have a person in each section putting boxes on the proper palettes for different sections/areas of the store, once we are done with the unload we take the remaining palettes to the sales floor and ""bowl the boxes out"" meaning you just put the box in the location where it needs to be stocked. Once the palettes are clear we all start at once side of the store and move our way over stocking merchandise. The team leads of the store are great however i am not a big fan of management and how they see the small picture of getting everything done however they don't look at the big picture and see why it takes a little longer to stock the product. My co-workers and myself find product in the wrong locations which we have to fix to put the actual product there, when the store is open customers always come first so we get distracted by helping the customers instead of doing what we were hired to do. Which I don't mind however I do not like getting put down for my work performance when all the team leads and management say I am one of the best employees they have and they want to promote me but they are concerned they will have nobody to replace me. The hardest part about the job is dealing with my co-workers, I am a nice person to everyone even if I don't think they deserve it. The best part about the job is they let you listen to music while working (while the store is closed)."
good,"Most days are cool and go by fast, how ever most days they don't have enough employees on the schedule and we end up short during closing time and have to pretty much pick up some one else work"
good,"Target has received very mixed reviews as it has tested the Canadian market."
good,"I enjoyed working at Target while I was there, it just wasn't for me."
good,I enjoyed working at Target in that it allowed me to learn many different aspects of retail and to work many different departments. I loved the people I worked with and leaning how to interact with customers.
good,Lots of hard work. Managers pick up the slack for lack of payroll the company provides. Great training for becoming a great manager. Perfect for later jobs in your career
good,"* Great people but low pay (assistant teachers were only getting paid $9 hr to care for 6plus children all day, and school fees were pretty high)"
good,"Seasonal work, was fast paced and friendly. Management was very understanding and up lifting. Hardest part of my job was finding out where everything went on the sales floor."
good,"I believe this is a nice job for a person straight out of highschool, helps build responsibility and character."
good,"Work days usually are busy, as a backroom team member we are timed by the hour to pull all items that a pda tells use to retrieve for the floor that hour. Some times there can be 6 hours or more worth of work to do in one hours time. Over time I've learned to not stress out under pressure but to keep my cool and try my best in everything    I set out to do. The backroom must act as a team in order for success our team can only be as strong as our weakest link so we all strive to do the right thing. The hardest part is the fact that we are currently understaffed so we have to take on a lot of work alone , which is a challenge at times but it only makes us better at our job. The most enjoyable part about working at target is how important my job is to the entire store , without us the store wouldn't be stocked and organized."
good,"An okay place to work at, but as for stocking it is quite a heavy workload."
good,"Target has been a blessing to me while I've been on track these past 4 years in earning my degree in business mgmt.  My typical day at work would include putting out stock, providing guest service and knowledge about the many products we carry, and also recovering the store during closing hours.  My co-workers are what make the days most enjoyable.  Target seems to find employees that always mesh well.  Management as of late seems to be a little down ever since the target breach a year ago which is sad.  I've seen the cuts trickle down from corporate and now to individual stores and its hard to watch the management style shift towards a not more desirable route.  Hardest part of the job would be that we are under staffed at almost all times of the day.  Lastly the most enjoyable part of the job is that Target does a great job at recognizing its team members for doing a good job."
good,It was constantly busy.  I learned how to really set up a store.  The management was pretty flexible.  There wasn't a lot of time to make friends as there was a deadline to make.  I didn't really know my co-workers. The hardest part of the job wa not knowing when you werew going to work again.  The enjoyable part was traveling to where I need to go at the time.
good,"A typical day a work is fun and friendly."
good,"Unload truck, bowl products to floor, push products to shelf."
good,"It is all about driving sales and ensuring our guests are taken care of. My role is to ensure that happens through coaching, planning and execution."
good,I loved working for target.. Great Place to work. Dealing with customers and helping them with their purchases.
good,Great fun place to work.  Supervisors and managers work  in a team spirit.
good,Typical day would just be like any other traget. Check out customers and make sure that they have a good experience shopping there. I learned more about customer service and patients dealing with the public. I really didnt get to spend much time with the co- workers but they were always friendly and easy to talk to when i did get the time. the hardest part about this job i would say is dealing with traffic control when you check out line go extreamly long. This is because people would get impatient. I enjoyed this job because mamagment was very flexible in working with my hours because i was a full time sudent at the time so i really enjoyed that.
good,"Good team work.  They maintain the store very well."
good,Target is a nice place to work with good management. I love my co-workers. The work load is too much for the compensation. The most enjoyable part is interacting with the guests.
good,I did not care for the management while I was working there  pregnant.
good,I love target. it was 10% discount and also free gifts too. it was a lot of fun things to beside work.
good,"I have been at Target for 4 years. I have learned a lot of things from this company. Through my hard work and dedication for my job, I have move from cashier to a leadership role in a very short period of time. My job is not hard, but I have the opportunity to guide and push other employees to the best of their abilities. As a team we are great and we are like one big family. I enjoy help our guests and building relationships with others."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of helping customers find the merchandise that they needed. It was always fast paced which I really enjoyed and made sure I always maintained a fun and friendly environment not only for the customers but my coworkers as well. Each day I had a goal to reach and I never failed to achieve it. I think the most enjoyable part of the job was whenever I interacted with customers because I am very sociable and outgoing. I also love the idea of helping others. As far as the hardest part of the job, it was that sometimes my goal was not as easy to reach, however, it only made me work harder and become more determined and dedicated to my job."
good,I like the cleanliness of the store and the friendly co workers.
good,"Good job and safety culture, but a very high turn over rate in upper management, which can lead to instability and mis-matched expectations."
good,handled interpretation between clients and translated any documents. answered the phone and left voicemails
good,great place to work i enjoyed my time there and the culture is great to be around
good,"The job wasn't too bad an average day was come in help guest, stock shelves, and pull stuff forward. Most of the people who work there are cool but some of the managers suck. Another thing is that they ask for you to do pointless stuff and have high expectations."
good,"I had the pleasure of helping to open this location and I formed some great relationships there, even though I no longer work there I still visit the store and the associates every chance I get."
good,"Target has had to change with the economy to be competitive and thrive. Unfortunately that translates to a stressful, borderline hostile work environment, with exceedingly unrealistic expectations.The silver lining though is that from district to district or even store to store things can be drastically different so things could be better near you. "
good,Very busy.Flexible hours. Potential for advancement with right background. High turnover rate.
good,"A typical day at work will be pushing go backs in other words returns & keeping the departments, aisles & store clean & up to date. In this job is were I learned how to work in a team & how to arrange the price tags & decorate for seasonal specials.The only problem with management was that they didn't know how to communicate with each other when an employee spoke with them about a problem or they will just take there time in fixing the problem and when it came to security they had awful service it wasn't even safe to go out to lunch or to your car. The co-workers at Target are really friendly & nice & very helpful they go beyond when it comes to helping the guest."
good,"Working part-time evenings typical work schedule would be stocking merchandise on shelves. I worked during the Christmas season, so it was very busy. Also organized and clean up messy areas by straighten up merchandise on shelves.  When store was really busy then I would cashier as needed.   I learned how to work with customer either by assisting them to find something on the shelves as I was stocking or providing excellent customer service while on the cash register. Worked great with my co-workers."
good,"Like anywhere else one might expect, working at my Target store has its ups and downs, there is good and bad at all levels from the cart attendants to management, and everyone in between, fortunately on the more populated levels, the people without drive or purpose don't last very long, the people who don't feel like doing their job at all last even less time, occasionally there are opportunities to volunteer, which I like in a company, however, due to the pay grade I usually had to work whenever those opportunities would become available (this didn't surprise me though, as I had no applicable experience when I started), most of the team leaders (lesser managers) are good, respectful people, but there is one that had a steadfast place in the store who is difficult to work with on most days, further more, the rumor mill is alive and well, it isn't going anywhere, but as long as you mind your own business and do your best at the workplace you don't need to worry about it, also under those conditions you will see the best in your coworkers, the hardest part of the job is when customers (referred to as 'guests') want to harass the cashier about coupons or sales that are for one reason or another inapplicable, that, and occasionally work-related sneakiness becomes a factor in your hours as well as how the higher level managers treat you, but as I said earlier, if you work hard and mind your own business you'll be fine."
good,"everyday is something new, Management works with team members to help them grow with the company."
good,"Overall my experience has been great.  As with most companies, Target is reviewing all positions and looking for opportunities to save and outsource.  My position was eliminated.  The culture has changed tremendously.   As another teammate expressed to me and something Target has forgotten, ""Happy cows make better cheese."" Hopefully they will remember that and it will become the company it used to be."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of managing store product and stocking teams, and a lot of walking. I learned a lot about management. The hardest part of this job were the hours. I worked overnight shift. However, I did like the environment."
good,high stress job . all your numbers are elevated to high to reach
good,"Lots of work to stock a store overnight and be ready for the morning opening, but we got it done each night.  Need to pay worker more for the work done overnight."
good,Working at Target was a very enjoyable experience with consumers and coworkers were always nice. If I ever needed help someone was always willing to help. Target was always well kept and organized also. The hardest part of the job was having the biggest part of the store all to myself and occasionally needing help with other tasks while helping consumers. The best part of the job was always knowing that I truly helped someone in need and made their shopping experience better and faster.
good,"The work environment is fast always going. Sometimes stressful whether it has to do with being short staffed or short tempered guests. It is easy to get to know my co-workers because I see them a lot, although the faces do come and go. I have learned to multitask, deal with difficult situations with co-workers and shoppers. I have learned how to manage time and maintain control over those under me. The hardest part of my job is trying to be in two places at one, and figuring out the best solution for an issue. The most enjoyable part is meeting people, sometimes seeing the same faces and them knowing who I am and giving complements on my professionalism."
good,"It is hard to balance the job, life, and school if you do not have a set shift. Since shifts range from morning,mid, and closing any day could be different  The company is great as well as the job when you are in school and trying work a little.  They try their best to work with your schedule.  This was my job while I was in school and now that I am finish I am search for other opportunities."
good,Learned a great deal about leadership and development while employeed with Target. I really enjoyed the managment team I worked with. Unfortunity all the upper level managment that I really enjoyed working with left the company all within a few months of eachother.
good,"As a Barista at a Target Starbucks my typical day involved taking guest orders and preparing their beverage. I also maintained constant cleanliness in and around my station. Occasionally I would also spend my time training new hires & going over future promotions & sales with my direct manager. We are a small team, less than 10 so we rely heavily on each other pulling each others weight but it makes us a tight-knit team, able to communicate varying needs and concerns with each other. The most enjoyable part of the job is connecting with a guest and getting them that perfect drink for that moment."
good,"work would start off with truck unload, then box separation throughout store, then stock shelves and take overstock to back room for restocking. management was great, co-workers were a blast to be around. hardest part of my job would be the early morning hours. the most enjoyable part of my job would be the early morning breakfast breaks."
good,"I learned a lot working for Target. I learned how to be responsible, I learned to make friends outside my age group, and I learned to work hard. Target asked to much of me. It was the summer and hot as heck and they didn't lets the cart attendants catch their breathe, they just asked for more and more."
good,"The team is like a big family, but the managers are distant, reserved, inconsiderate of our thoughts or feelings jerks who work us too hard for how little we get. Our annual turnover rate for 2013 was 39 hired, 34 fired, so we currently have a skeleton crew that is continually berated for ""not doing good enough"""
good,"A good place to work with , with lots of employee benifits, fun loving enviornment."
good,"I enjoyed working at a fast paced place such as it was at target and working in the backroom I enjoyed it alot. Sadly we were very under paided for how hard we worked and how much we did. The fast,fun,friendly way it was around the place is just a front of how the management wants you to be yet its hard to be that way when you are miss treated a lot."
good,"If I could do it over again, I wouldn't work at Target. Don't get me wrong I love to shop there but as a company I wouldn't work there again. Management couldn't discern between friendships and working relationships. The pay wasn't great and I worked overnight shift."
good,"I really enjoyed my job.I was mainly at the customer service desk where I assisted customers with purchases and returns,but I also was trained in just about every other department. my direct supervisor was great, very supportive."
good,"I loved working at my job at Target as a service desk team member and a guest service attendant.  It was a very rewarding job for me because I got to experience new challenges every day.  Typically, my days would consist of preventing fraud in all areas of retail, offering people returns, exchanges, or helping people find alternatives or shop for registry gifts.  "
good,"Everything was well organized and we had our normal routine everyday. Everyone was also very friendly and since the job was fast paced, the day went by quick. The hardest part of my job was on our busy days, we had to make our pulls (i worked in the backroom) by certain times everyday. There could be up to 50 batches of pulls but only two people pulling them. It became a little stressful."
good,"Unload the 40 to 42' delivery truck everyday.  Put away stock what didn't go out on the floor was stocked in the store/stock room. "
good,"typically at work every one is together as a team and we split the work load evenly. "
good,Target is a great place to work. They are team driven and the employees are hard working.
good,"worked there for a few months. I felt used, they let me go as soon as the holidays were over."
good,"Working at the Target Cafe area can get really busy, but if you organize and prioritize the daily task, it can be done until the next person comes in to work. Team members in Target Cafe area are amazing and adapt quick to current situation regardless of it being overwhelming or slow. Management lacks communication skills in communicating to Target Cafe team members due to the fact that there is currently no Team Lead. Hardest part of the job is during lunch rush and there is only one member in the work area. Most enjoyable part of the job is when you get a happy and satisfied customer."
good,Target was a good job. There are many advancements but the management should take a little more consideration in there regular team members and the hard work they do.
good,Backstock merchandise from the truck for future pulls.  Fast paced environment with friendly staff and management.  No A/C in backroom leads to hot summer days in the backroom.  Sense of humor shared with backroom co-workers made workdays enjoyable.
good,"Worked with great team members but did not like working evenings because we were off around midnight every night. Always busy, on your feet."
good,"Depending on what department you're assigned to, you clock in and either stock items or face aisles or even put up sale signs."
good,I was a cashier and worked the customer service desk. I processed returns.
good,The overall work enviornment was great with other employees.  The workload was steady and the maintainence was not that dificult. I really enjoyed the team that I worked with. The hardest part of the job was getting use to the cold enviornment. I learned alot about working with automated equipment and conveyors. The Management did not work well together to maintain a true focus. It changed depending on who was in the building or standing in at the time for another manager.  The company had great pay and good benefits. The management also had a tendency to be more personal than professional with handling issues. Their personal feelings toward a person would be how they judged and rated rather than work performance and dedication to duty.
good,Making change for cashiers. Giving breaks in a timely manner. Opening and closing of the registers.
good,A lot of lifting and sorting to skids. Evening work your not home tell late.
good,"*typical work day is unloading truck, push freight, backstock, scan instocks, do price changes, set plan-o-grams .  Ring register, make schedule, straighten shelves (zone merchandise), return product to sales floor locations."
good,"I loved my job. The Teamwork was excellent."
good,"Fast, fun and friendly. stocking, cleaning, cashier, daily duties."
good,"I was a night employee so I would go in handle any reshop, straighten shelves, greet and assist customers, act as a back up cashier during busy hours. I really started developing my customer service skills here and learned how to be less introverted and more outgoing.  My co-workers were all friendly for the most part a few I am still friends with to this day,  The hardest part of this job was the night time hours with little ones at home.  I really can't pinpoint a most enjoyable part as I had fun working this job as a whole and only had to leave because my husband got sick and I needed full time emplyment with benefits."
good,Its just a normal day in the work place and it very stressful.
good,Working for Bulk Barn was a learning experience in my mind. A day at work I would make sure things were clean while assisting with customers. The management was good for the first little bit then things started to get cliquey as well as there seem to be a lot of favoritism. The hardest part about working in this enviorment was the students who didnt actually work. This made more of a job for me. The most enjoyable part of this job was seeing kids faces when they walked in and seeing all thecandy there was for sale.
good,"A typical day at work is very casual. I was basically behind the register all day unless it was my break. I didnt really learn anything at target. My co-workers were very helpful and easy to get along with. The hardest part about my job was trying to sell target red cards, and the most enjoyable was the free food in the break room everyday. Management was always very nice and  treated everyone with respect."
good,"I enjoyed working for target until they cut ,my hours down.  One week I would get  32 hours the next I would only get 4."
good,"my day was generally spent behind the cash register in the front of the store, management along with other store employees where always eager to help the new hires learn and excel in their jobs. If you had a question all you had to do was ask."
good,"Being a newly graduated high school student, I didn't last very long at this job, but I did learn that you have to compromise with your employer about constructing a work schedule that doesn't infringe upon your other responsibilities to much."
good,Target is a good company and all. However they told me they were going to keep me after the season and they did not. Also they told me to reapply at the 2012 season but they did not hire me. 
good,"Typical day includes maintenance of apparel departments, assisting in pharmacy, working in many different work areas.  "
good,I was only there for a brief time but it was a blast to be a part of such a great place.
good,"A typical day, starts at 8 a.m., greet customers as they come to check out, I try to check them out as quickly as possible, as most of them are on their way to work, or on lunch break, or on their way home.  I am very friendly and I find that most people are also friendly if they are approached with a smile.  Management could be better, I enjoy most of my co-workers, we get along well and work as a team.  Hardest part of the job I feel is when we have to push individuals to open a credit/debit cards.  Very few want credit cards.  The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the same people come to my register, the repeat customers, we chat about family, weather, etc., for a few minutes."
good,"Typical day was making sure area (hard lines) was neat and in order. I also went between sales floor and cashier as needed, put up stock. i learned how to use a handheld machine that showed you how and where to put up items in timely order. I enjoyed the management and co-workers. Hardest part of job was sometimes getting some funiture items off shelves. the most enjoyable part of the job was finding a item in stock that wasn't on the shelf especially around christmas that a child really wanted."
good,"The best part of working at Target is the guests. And your employee discount because Target is a GREAT place to shop, & every penny helps. Target takes good care of its workers. All the people are friendly & courteous."
good,A typical day at work is: when I come in I clean my register area and start checking out guests. There are times we can leave the register and help in other departments.
good,Typical day was fast fun and friendly . The hardest part of the job was working with a different pharmacist all the time which made it hard for patients to adjust with different procedures.The most enjoyable part of my job was putting a smile on the patients face after having their prescriptions ready and on time and making them feel important.
good,a typical day at work is me unloading the trucks and stocking the shelves and enhancing with the customers
good,"Depending on what I had to do that day, I ran the cafe, cashiered, or stocked shelves while maintaining excellent guest service interaction. I learned everything within a few months. The most enjoyable part of the job was cross training to different departments in the store. The hardest part was running the cafe on a busy day by myself with no support from management for an extra person on that shift."
good,"The coworkers were pleasant and the work was super easy, I don't really have any complaints."
good,"I started working here right before college. They are great with working with your schedule for the most part but that is due to no hours being given. I have been at one store for five years and anytime I try to move up or anyone else for that matter, we get shut down and they hire from outside the company. Raises are once a year and unless to do the best job, you get about 20 cents. The best raise is about 30 cents."
good,Good job to have while in college. Just don't expect any job advancement.
good,nice to start out. Don't really see a future there unless you move up to management
good,i worked at target for 2mths and got let go becouse i could't work mornings but it was a good place
good,did whatever was needed to make a Target store run efficently
good,"Fast, Fun & Friendly was the way we all worked, just wasnt inspecting to be terminated after the holiday season."
good,A typical work day constantly changed by the hour which made the day go by quickly - we were constantly doing things differently. I obtained a vast knowledge of the retail business. My co-workers were always helpful to complete a task in a timely manner. The hardest part of the job were the long hours during the holidays. I thoroughly enjoyed doing volunteer work in the community for Target.
good,"I did alot in this job, which would be working as a Cashier, working in the guest service department, sometimes in the photo department and help out in the sales floor to restock items."
good,A typical day is never typical. No 2 days are alike. You meet a variety of people each day. It was a fast upbeat and constantly changing environment which I really enjoyed.My co workers were fun and friendly we became like a family. Management tried its best to meet employees expectations.
good,"Fun and pleasant place to work. While enjoy repeated elderly customers talks about their daily lives and activities. Enjoyed meeting and learning new experiences of different cultures from customers. I also enjoyed my co-workers and my lead manager (LOD). The hardest part of the job was saying goodbye. The most enjoyable part of working with Target was the games that was played to win time off, products, and etc."
good,Taking on a strenuous remodel of an existing store and making it better for Erie!
good,While working at Target I found very little that I had no control over. I worked with people who enjoyed their job and liked to help the customers and the new team members. I believe that the management was at time overbearing but this was only to push us and help us exceed expectations.
good,"The training process was not the best, until I finally was paired with someone who really explained how to do everything and did no mind answering questions and was a great teacher. Some of the co workers were great others did not want to answer questions and would treat you like you were stupid, The hardest part was figuring out how to know where things go. The good people."
good,"Unloaded truck, stocked freight, helped customers with questions usually about where a product is."
good,"Day shifts are okay. You get a walkie, assigned to a section and you keep that section in order, and do restocking as well as helping customers. simple as that. Here and there you will get a call for cashier back up, hey that's fine too. There isn't must to be stressed with during the day."
good,"* A typical work day went like this: I was a cashier and was mainly the only one working it because people either called in sick or just didn't show up. So that got really frustrating over time. I still had the supervisor to help me out though when it got really busy. I also worked on the sales floor. Mainly in what they called ""Section C"". That section was made up home improvement goods. For example in my section there was bed sheets and pillows. Plus light bulbs and stuff for your car. Another dutie that I had was an operator; answering phone calls and answering peoples questions. The hardest part of the job was working the cashier plus the sales floor at the same time when I had to get my section clean and organized by the time the store closed. The most enjoyable part of the job were the people I worked with and the people who came in and out of the store, especially the babies and kids. They always made my day."
good,"A typical flow team member job consist of you arriving at 4:00am to start your shift. You will either work the first 1.5 hours on the line in the warehouse(unloading the truck) or on the sales floor stocking shelves/sorting freight. After the truck is unload, the whole team stocks the product. That is the flow teams job. If you are a muli-tasker than you will probably help the backroom back stock all the product left from the unload process. The co-workers are friendly, but the management is another story. The best part of the job is the pay. The hours are good, but you're not guaranteeing more than 24 hours a week."
good,work went pretty fast when working on the sales floor and the people were nice.. the hardest part was having your area done before closing for the night.
good,"Seasonal Position as a Cashier & Sales Floor , Was a good experience and met nice people. Mangers where friendly"
good,You can meet some amazing people in Target however the direction in which the company is moving with lower salaries and more work is not motivating.
good,"It was a good experince. target store always busy.i learned how to stock merchandise certain way,be fast,fun,and friendly.go workers were nice.hardest part but on a smile when you had a bad day.enjoyable part meeting new people every day."
good,"I scan each box that is in the trailor to acknowledge we have received it, once our truck unload process is done I then go to the floor and bowl boxes down the appropriate aisles and then push the product onto the shelves. Once done in an area, I make sure to clean my cardboard and empty carts and then take backstock to the back of the store for the back room team members. I then go to another department and push the product and help other team members until every department has been taken care of and once the floor has been all cleaned up, go home. The hardest part of the job is the physical work it requires every night. I enjoy working with some of the team members. I have learned the retail side and how the stores make sure that customers have product to buy."
good,My day is usually the same by helping the overnight process and scan the store of out of stock items to fill the shelves. I learned my instock process and also backroom process to help the guest even more. The management is okay. It seems some team members know more than they do. The hardest part of my job are the angry guest. But i know how to deal with them. The best part are my employee friends and the interaction with other team members.
good,No work life balance
good,Let my Team members know what need to get done . Not every onw work the same some are slow. When I need them to be faster. We all work to gother has a team to get the work done.
good,This was a very fun job! I met a lot of people and found some great friends.
good,"Preparing foods and salad, working alone, my coworkers made the job fun"
good,"A lot depends on the team leads you have to work with. Some are good and some don't have a clue.Hardest part is not having enough staff that makes customers wait in line to check out, or not enough floor personnel to help. Retail is tough to keep a decent working schedule, switching around hours too much."
good,great job for a single parent. Co workers was very helpful excellent team work
good,Closing shift you come in a clean up the store. Back up cashier when needed. Doing put backs so the aisles can be nice and full of merchandise. Customer service and assisting when needed.
good,"A typical day included many dutie. First and foremost, I am a leader, and my main responsibilty is to lead others to sucess. I've learned how to be an effective leader, not only at my job, but in my personal life as well. I loved my co- workers. They were more like family to be than co-workers. The hardest part of my job is the stress of the workload on my family life. The most important part of my job is making the guests happy."
good,I learned how to as part of a team
good,nice surroundings I just want better pay and advances and move up
good,"A typical day at target is fast, fun, friendly, learn differents things everyday from customers to employees."
good,Alright place to work. Like most of the people. Wish they paid better though.
good,Just going to work in order to make the store look good for the customers. That included aliging things on the shelves and putting things back where they belong.
good,"Hard working, productive work place, Friendly co-workers. I enjoyed working there."
good,"The two years I work there, I have to say, it was okay. I worked as cashier and I use to love the contests we have to stay GREEN. GREEN means you scan your items and receive cash from the guests on time. Which help move the lines along the way. And when it came to the holidays, they always feed us. The only thing I didn't like was the standing. I have arthritis and I couldn't stand for long hours at a time. Even though I been gone for quite a while, I wouldn't mind going back there on a part-time bases."
good,A typical day at Target was fast paced. I learned how to work in a fast pace environment.All co-workers were nice. I didn't find the job hard at all and I really enjoyed working there.
good,This is a good company for younger adults trying to gain experience in the job industry. It provides a great structure for jobs to come.
good,Very nice work staff and always available when I needed them. I was always precise and my drawer was always correct at the end of the night.
good,Good place to work when going to school. Fun people to work around just not enough opportunites to improve or move up in the company.
good,"A typical day at work while cashiering consisted of providing customer service to guests and to ensure their visit and experience ended with positive checkout. While working food avenue, a day consisted of preparation of pizza's for the next day while maintaining a clean work environment while ensuring food was being processed and set on time as well as customer service. Work associates were friendly and worked together as a team, management was consistent and provided excellent aid if needed to ensure the guests were satisfied. The most enjoyable part of this job was the outcome of making our guests feel happy and satisfied with their visit to Target."
good,Great place to work. Customer service is key to such a great corporation like this one.
good,"Everyone is helpful, incl. training when you first start. The staff majority is very friendly. There is little hierarchy regarding advancement so despite how long you work, your finances do not increase all that much. Also full time does not exist unless you are management so benefits are not really existent. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with all the customers ruining your area's neatness. The most enjoyable is assisting the customers."
good,"I liked the job in the beginning until I go hurt and they kept taking my hours away. I was still able to work my job but, they kept giving me the run around. I enjoyed working with new people and I also love their products. It was a fun job over all while I was there."
good,Target was the perfect place to be emplyed while I studied to further my education.
good,Since I have been working at target for over a year it was okay when I first started but now they cut the hours very much which is not very nice for a person who actually does there job.
good,Work can be productive and easy to find tasks to do. The management can have their cliches but just stick to yourself and you will be fine. Every store is probably different
good,This job is a great way to get experience of the job world. I enjoyed it due to the fact that the workers were helpful as well as open to making sure you are successful.
good,Target is a wonderful place to work for but they are not very flexible or caring about their workers management always have extra negative unnecessary things to say when members of the team have to call In from being sick or just normal life things. ( I never experienced this situation just hear it from my other coworkers)
good,its fun and works around your hours if you want a job that is fast paced and works with your time work here because it is a good benefit to work at a place like target that sells clothes food and merchandise that some places don't have
good,The job was great. Loved the management and people I worked with. It was just the guests in the area I worked in were really demanding at time but that wasn’t Target’s fault.
good,Very diverse and easy to get along with people. Normal days start with huddle where all employees meet to discuss numbers and how the day should go. They also try new things to make the days fun and easy to deal with.
good,It's hard seeing loved ones when they get to a certain age and they start to lose themselves. It really is. Working here gives you an appreciation for life and your own loved ones. Taking care of the cherished family and friends with the coa was one of the most fulfilling community service projects I've ever been a part of. Creating the art activities for the sunshine group as an artist in residence was a rewarding and privileged position to be a part of.
good,"I worked in the clothing area.  Your assigned a location and the job is to make the place look perfect for the next day, help customers locate items and support your team. The people are great.  I have never met a nicer group of women.  You will work nights, weekend and holidays and moving up is difficult.  For a starter job or a second job. it's good."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company! I worked for two separate locations and had great experiences with both. Managers understood that I was a college student home for a small period of time and made sure to give me hours that allowed me to make a decent amount of money, all while being able to spend time with my family. In addition, they were very understanding of family emergencies and great with approving time off. Overall, a great experience."
good,"good job just badly ran and scheduling was a consistent problem for the workers and myself, overall is a good job.would recommend to younger people not really a job for older people"
good,It was fun and nice to get work experience and learn more about how working in a sophisticated environment works. I liked meeting new people and helping costumers.
good,"good Company to work for "
good,"The people at target (managers, team leads, team members) are all great to work with. Everyone is so nice and makes sure you have everything that you need to get your job done. Right now we are not getting the hours needed to be able to work therefore needing two jobs to pay Bill's."
good,Ok place to work not enough hours don’t want to give cashiers lunch break so you only get 5 1/2 hours a day you get more hours working the sales floor that’s where all the hours go
good,"While it has been some time since I was employed by Target I remember the environment to be extremely friendly and welcoming, despite my position being a seasonal one."
good,The company told you what to do and you did it. They had very clear and cut operation procedures.  Management was not as cut and clear.  Many times different supervisors and managers did not communicate among them selves.  This caused confusion in hierarchy of tasks especially among those only on walkies.
good,This job you always have something to do. I personally liked the people that i would work with we where all close friends before i started working here again so it made my time go by every fast.
good,"Target is an awesome place to work. My team is the only team that specializes in all departments. Basically what that means is we help out in grocery, hardlines, cashiers and assist with guest services. Although, guest services is a department needed to be trained in for specific things, we help with carry outs, any possible questions a sales floor member could answer. The environment feels safe and open. We are able to rely on our leaders for assistance on anything."
good,"Target is a good place to work if you're young or a student. They're very flexible with hours. The atmosphere is generally good, but very fast-paced and can be chaotic."
good,It is a typical retail career with options to try and work your way up. They do expect a lot from each employee however as long as you stay on top of your work it isn't too overbearing. One issue that is noticed among most employees is the unsteady hours. Some weeks you can be scheduled 40 and the next week you have less than 20.
good,While working there management changes so fast some of them I liked and some I didn’t. I think morning shifts and evening shifts are literally like night and day. Morning since there are more management it gets pretty chaotic whereas night is slow paced.
good,I was a seasonal member hired on to help with fulfillment during the holiday rush. I enjoyed the type of work that i did and my coworkers were extremely great and helpful. There were a few problems but most of the time management was very helpful
good,Team leads during the day were not as helpful as the afternoon and evening team leads. The guests (customers) were always pleasant and fun. Sometimes it was challenging to get an answer because of the volume of guest during the holiday season.
good,"Most of the time I worked in consumables restocking the shelves and the produce, which I liked because that always kept me on my feet. I really liked working as a cashier because I got to interact with customers. The hardest part is when they push you to sell Target Red Cards."
good,The job was ok but when you can’t find items they want you to look everywhere which wastes time that is needed to give the customer their orders. Manager was rude to me I was trying to leave once and she she told me not to leave my cart in mission when I had to leave and that I need to take care of it tho I have to leave at a certain time because I am a minor. at
good,"Workplace was pleasant, nice team members. Only problem was that when you were a new employee managers would treat you as if you worked there for years and be upset if you didn't know their work terms or where things were even after telling them you just started working there....very strange but okay.  Otherwise I may or may not want to work at a target again. Most people were very nice and helpful though."
good,"The job was okay for the lost part, everyone was really nice and got along but the managers played with peoples hours. The hours were never consistent"
good,"target was a great company, lots of benefits and great customers. Supervisors and other employees were nice and helpful to new workers and anyone who needed help"
good,a typical day at target would be coming in and getting straight to work. The team members are so nice along with the management. The overall job is pretty easy and straightforward.
good,"I very much enjoyed working here, however, this review is irrelevant as Target Canada is no longer operating in Canada. Very sad, as I did like this company"
good,I would highly consider returning if there were availability. The team members were great and the best thing about the company is how flexible the staff were with working hours.
good,Not bad if you like to be on your feet and constantly helping people . There are a lot of customers who are tough to handle but just follow your training and you’ll be fine
good,You have to form your own opinion. It was ok when I was there but I worked with different people and the environment is what made the job fun. Pay has increased so that is a plus.
good,"It’s wonderful to start at Target to dip your toes in the water of retail! Management was very biased and played favorites, sadly  luckily I was one of them"
good,Flexible schedule and fun atmosphere! I would definitely recommend this job to my friends as a first job experience. Very easy going staff and managers.
good,"Fun place to work. I really enjoyed my job with this company, but in some aspects they are unprofessional. My job in the company could become stressful at times, but it's much like any other job of the same description."
good,"The target workplace was engaging and enjoyable. The management was understanding, flexible, and helpful. The job increased my communication and team building skills."
good,"Fun, great place to work. Steady job, never anything unexpected. Flexible. Seasonal work is good for those that need a little extra to get through the holidays."
good,Not enough communication between managers and employee. Seasonal help was not told ahead of time when their last day would be. Best part of the job is helping customers.
good,I learnt how to deal with the different people with different mindset. Nice and friendly environment to work and flexible schedule. Good work-life balance.
good,"It went already worked within the front lanes as a cashier, quick training, long nights and lackful hr when coming to understand my school schedule. Ok."
good,"It was a decent start off job as a beginner getting myself through college. The tasks that were given were understandable and we were offered help if we needed to understand what we were  tasked with better. However, the managers had favorites and didn't often acknowledge the good work you did.  yyodespecially when"
good,I really enjoy working at Target. The work is low stress and I really enjoy working with my team and my guests. Each day is different and that is fun to me. The training is a bit lacking-no real structure.  Hours are really minimal though and there is a sense of favoritism here. I really don’t understand why Target doesn’t hire full time for all positions. A company like this should be able to take care of their employees a little better than that.
good,I just started a this job but I really enjoy it so far. Everyone there is very kind and helpful when needed. I didn’t know where things were at first but all you need to do is ask questions and anyone is there to help you
good,They had very flexible work hours for students and the pay is some of the highest in retail. Target is def a good starter job. Working there was a good balance of fun and feeling accomplished that you were able to assist customers.
good,Target.com was a seasonal job if I had an opportunity to become a Target.com Associate; I would love to work for that company. The only thing was the management was not favorable to me for the employees. Management need a little more training themselves; because if the are not on the same page for as company information. Everyone had different answer for you.
good,"It's a good place to start, friendly work environment. Good place for people who like to interact with other people. You have to work fast because your task have to be done in a timely manner."
good,The workplace was quite nice and enjoyable and i have learn quite a bit about what goes on as a worker there and the enjoying part about it was the packaging the items and have them ready to ship.
good,"I thank Target for the opportunity they afforded me, and after working steadily for 5 years in multiple positions, I made the decision to leave to pursue further education. This is a retail position only suited to those very capable of creative problem-solving and a positive attitude toward working with the public. I never felt my job security was in question or threatened with Target, but neither did I feel the environment was ideal or that my efforts were rewarded by significant promotions or added benefits."
good,Loved working for them staff there was so nice. The hours were not consistent but it's retail. There wasn't much room for growth there but overall was a good place to work
good,Target is a good place to work overall. The  cons about this company is the scheduling and hours. The advancement is somewhat challenging but once you achieve it the pay is great.
good,"Learned multiple skill sets very quickly. Picking, unloading, scanning, prepping, and put away. Learning something new everyday. Lots of walking and lifting."
good,Great opportunity in retail. Training is well done. Room for advancement. Team oriented job. Great benefits with great resources. Flexible schedules for students.
good,Stay away from the drama and the job is more fun and beneficial. Great place with friendly faces just hard to move up and around in the company. Good workers are overworked and carry the burden of the rest of the team members when prod is lacking.
good,"Great place to work, but it totally depends on the store. Managers that work for challenging stores, have a more stressful time, less balance and same pay."
good,Unloading the truck. Helping customers as well as helping coworkers. Working 5-8 hours a day. Getting paid every two weeks. Managers and supervisors were helpful!
good,Excellent management staff. Poor salary increase. If you like stacking and keeping a place neat looking Target is the place to be. Target requests Stacking as well as cashier replacement at any time. Time goes fast and you are busy
good,great place to work. pay is great and schedules are standard. I had a great time here.  the only thing I disliked was that the only day you get off is Christmas and well most of us have familys for the holidays but it was never there priority.
good,This was my second job and I worked 12 hour shifts but when Christmas came along they dropped my hours so I wasn’t really working anymore. And it started at 15 an hour and dropped to 12 an hour
good,Target has very flexible hours and understands that life happens. All the managers are very kind. They offer help when needed and encourage a steady workplace environment.
good,"Typical job, go in, do the work and leave. Nothing really special about it. Management was pretty good at letting you try out different positions if you different feel comfortable in your current one."
good,"Too hierarchical, demands a lot from hourly managers/leaders without much wiggle room, can be unfair, unrealistic time constraints and management. Work/life balance just ok"
good,"I always enjoyed each day at Target because it was different each day and my coworkers always made each day enjoyable. The hard part about Target was leaving because I always enjoyed each day. The best part was the support of my management. They made me feel welcomed and when things didn't go the way for me outside of work, they helped me."
good,"Overall, I enjoyed working at target due to working in a department that I enjoyed (entertainment) and due to the company of those around me. Direct management were normally okay to deal with, but upper management could be incredibly difficult. "
good,"I’ve been with target for 4 years through the operating model changes. Currently lead a team of 150 to enhance guest engagement and grow sales digitally and in-store. Fast-moving company, constantly evolving to capture market shares. Great experience thus far."
good,"if you can deal with being micro managed ten hours a day, four days a week, possibly three day weeks with 12 hour days. Then this is the job for you. You will be under surveillance from the time you enter their facility until the time you leave. The building it’s self is kept in good condition, lunchrooms are well maintained along with the restrooms. Management in general comes and goes at a pace that leaves a person to wonder if they are actually needed at all, or just passing through on their way to better jobs suiting their skill sets. Target’s motto is, “If it works, break it.” Management will follow this credo to the letter and eager to prove their willingness to show their obedience. Their are many good people working at Target, seek them out and learn from them, you might just survive and enjoy your job."
good,"I loved working at Target. I already spent all my free time there shopping, why not get paid to work there? It was my first time in retail so it was very overwhelming. It was also during Christmas time so it was also very demanding."
good,"Expect to be busy! The days went by quickly because there is always something to do. My team worked together very well, so it made the experience pleasant. If an area needed help, someone was always there and willing to do so cheerfully. It was an environment that we were all focused on the customer having great experience. It is a lot of walking and other physical activities. The best part of the job was satisfying the customer and they walked away happy."
good,I loved the job itself a typical day was picking up items people ordered online. The hardest part of the job was the people that worked there it was a lot of drama.
good,Working for Target was a delight somewhat. Majority of the guests were a pleasant especially when you them save or catch the deal at was going on. The environment was a safe and friendly environment.
good,"I enjoy the company of my co-workers and managers. There are some managers higher up in the food chain who can get annoying, but the direct managers actually on the floor with me are good people and I like having them as my boss"
good,"Organizing the product staging area for daily business"
good,"The work can seem tedious but my fellow team members make work entertaining so the shifts fly by. The schedule can be inconsistent with varying hours weekly, but you can request any days off and get them."
good,"Cool place to work for the type of pay and work required . Some days are busy, but those are the best. Customer service is key so always be helpful. Easy going, just keep busy"
good,"Ringing up customer purchases, directing customers to the product they were looking for, keeping the register area clean and fully stocked. Helping out in other departments when needed."
good,"Target has a culture that is very diverse and gives a sense of belonging with respect to individuality. Target is a great place to experience multiple departments which can expand the skills on your resume and help you discover what your strengths and opportunities are as an employee. Target is a fun and optimistic place to work that gives frequent recognition to team members."
good,"L'environnement  à Target est assez dense et quand la compagnie veut générer plus de profits, les employers travaillent plus dur."
good,It wasn't flexible for me working there and but I did enjoy working with my managers and Co-workers that was working with. It was the fast pace that I like.
good,"I enjoyed working here as a first job, I learned a lot about customer service and using a register. They will also cross train you in different departments if needed. The only thing I didn’t like was how much they made us push the credit card on people"
good,I enjoyed working at Target because it gave me the opportunity to meet different people and expand at the job. The managers were fair and respectful. The pace  of the store was always different depending on the days. Overall great place to work.
good,This was a great place to work will I was in school. I felt I got paid fairly and the people there are very nice. They also cross train which I thought was cool.
good,When your a cashier you will be on your feet all day ur breaks will go pass fast the people there are very nice and will help you with anything you need help with
good,"Target is a great place to start if your looking for a job , however you don’t have a set schedule in the beginning but later you will be able to have one . I enjoyed working and shopping at target"
good,"Nothing was too hard at all, Target cares about their employees. I met so many coworkers and people who were just buying groceries. I was able to help minimum one person a day and that made me extremely happy."
good,"Overall, Target was a good place to work. I would like to go back. Need some improving with managers and/or supervisors relations communications when new beauty/apparel arrives."
good,The work can be rough but the people there can help you get through the hardest of shifts. They train you with everything you need to know in order to achieve success. The management could be a LOT better though.
good,"Target is very fast paced, constantly updating itself, and reinventing retail.  There are plent of opportunities to move work areas or divisions once you are onboarded."
good,"Unloading a full 18-wheeler full of 2000 boxes everyday simply took a toll on me physically. My managers and co-workers were all extremely nice and it was a fun atmosphere because of the people. However, I just personally did not enjoy the job."
good,Fun place to work and a great place to network. Lots of room to grow if you dedicate yourself enough to the task at hand and show interest of growing.
good,"Good team crew. Very few hours , but nice atmosphere. I started as a stocker now I do much more. Stocking, unloading trucks, pet Dept, I also train new employees, cashier at times."
good,Target is a great company to work for when you are a team member. Management is pushed to their limits at times and I have seen many managers quit due to the excessive workload.
good,for target to be my first real job it was a good start for customer service and janitorial cleaning services. i actually wont mind working there again
good,Working in the cafe' was fun and exciting. The other side was Jamba Juice which made for very particular guest. The staff was amazing mostly college kids there for a school break which made them excited to have a job and make it fun but still following standards.
good,This employer worked well with my busy college schedule. They were flexible with hours. This employer had very fair wages and benefits. The environment was positive and teamwork encouraged.
good,"Retail jobs are often looked down upon however I have nothing but great reviews for working at Target. I enjoy the team and the management. There is no ""barrier"" between the leads and team members but more of a collaborative experience."
good,"The Target Protection Specialist or TPS is basically a subordinate to the actual Loss Prevention Officer at each Target store. The TPS has to perform all the grunt work in a store while the AP officer sits in the office and watches the cameras. This position has no legal authority, and can not realistically go ""hands on"" without an ironclad justification."
good,I started there and really loved it for the holidays but afterwards struggled to make ends meet due to the lack of hours provided for us. Work was good but managed poorly when corporate came to evaluate.
good,When I was working  at target I learned communication  skills an most of all how to deal w poi th difficult custerms  an how to go aboutbthknga in n a different  ways
good,"Busy with go-backs, fixing products on shelves (zoning). "
good,"Target was a nice place to work at. They used to really pressure us cashiers to try to get customers to apply for ""Redcards"". I was very good at this so they liked me. Unfortunately since I was around so many sick people, I got sick alot more than normal. Then they would get annoyed even though others got many more days off sick, than I did. I would not mind working there again but they won't let me because I got sick alot?!"
good,"Target is a great place to work and build a strong work ethic. The environment is fast, fun, and friendly. It can help your customer service skills as well."
good,"Enjoyed working alone an on my own pace. Helping the customers with assistance when needed. The management an staff were amazing when needed help. Working for Target, was fun an taught me that working alone actually made my day go easy an fast."
good,"Very easy job, sometimes it can be a bit too slow. It's easy to make positive connections, as there are usually a lot of people to work with. You can learn valuable customer service skills in this job."
good,I appreciated the diversity of staff and the inclusion of male and female leadership of all ages. HR is on site to ensure compliance. Team building is encouraged.
good,Not a lot of space for advancement. Good hours good pay. Not a lot of extra demands outside of work position. Part time work lucky to see 35 hours. Great place to start out
good,"I really enjoyed working at target but after about a year working as cashier, I asked if I could possibly be trained in another department (clothing) because I wanted to move around a bit more than I had been. They said they would get back to me on it, and never did. I got disappointed but it was okay. And then I had some family issues going on and I had problems taking time off or would get talked to when I came back for taking so much time off."
good,"They have some nice employees, I tried to call in a couple times due to having to take care of my grandpa because he was sick they didn’t really care."
good,"it a great place to work. it flexible and the people I work with fun, friendly and respected. some customer are nice some are very rude and very nasty."
good,The workers are friendly. They tend to help one another very often you meet great people. It is a fast pace environment so dead lines must be meet and the job must be done on time
good,"This was a fine place to work. It has a large amount of people working there, so it exposes you to many kinds of folks. They pay quite generously for how easy the work is. The only had part about the work is that its physically demanding and repetitive. A lot of running around and lifting things. Some of the managers are wonderful and some are just okay. The ones that were okay were somewhat passive aggressive about explaining things. It can sometimes be hard to get hours because of how many people work there. Not a bad job."
good,"Target is not a bad company to work for,however management is not the greatest. Managers come and go, don’t really get to know employees. It’s an easy job. They just play favoritism a lot."
good,"Help customers on a daily basis, either with locating products, or seeing if another location has the items available. Managers make morning gatherings fun."
good,"Target is a great place to work. Great place to meet new people as co-workers "
good,friendly place to work loves gay people very clean prices are reasonable great staff great place to work for love to shop there great pay bathrooms was clean
good,The job area I see very competitive. People are not very honest. They choose their favorites and they are not willing to help others move up if they will surpass them.
good,"Definitely a great company to work for if you enjoy customer service. That being said, target customers can be rude at times and the team can be so large it’s hard to find a place to fit in. Also, they really push up selling the “Red Card”, which is obnoxious."
good,"I worked at Target for 17 years. Target as a company is fantastic! Really good benefits, decent work/life balance, and they give back to communities which is important to me. It’s each individual stores management that makes or breaks stores integrity. Unfortunately that was my reason for leaving after so long. Also, not being given the opportunity to continue growing without a certain amount of education I believe is unfair."
good,"I loved my team and my coworkers, I worked well with management, I was dedicated to my work, I was promised a certain amount of hours I did not receive them, which lead me to give my two weeks notice before I left."
good,This was a great job it was just seasonal. I worked a couple of seasons there but eventually left for a permanent position elsewhere. Very relaxed but organized company to work for
good,"I appreciated my work experience there, and learned all that I could. I think they need to be more realistic with distributing hours. Don’t hire so many people and then only give one day to some people while others are getting 30 plus weekly."
good,"Good job and awesome people to work with, the hours are inconsistent though and when you ask off for something your hours coincidently get cut as well..."
good,"it was fun for the time, lots of fun people work there and an overall super fun working environment, people who come in and work there are generally nice"
good,The team members are more than extremely exceptional and the guests are wonderful! The job can be stressful and overwhelming sometimes but you’re never alone. You can always guarantee that you will be able to joke around with your fellow team members. The hours are very flexible and target tries their best to fit your job schedule to your already existing schedule (if you have one).
good,It's a nice place to work.  Not enough hours though...... I was told 20-25 hours per week when hired. I'm lucky to get 15 hours lately. So I'm working as many shifts I can for team members requesting a day off.
good,"I think Target is a nice place to work at. What originally sold me was how lgbt friendly the company and stores tend to be. The people I worked with were nice and the general atmosphere of the store was pretty friendly. They're very flexible with students and class scheduling too. "
good,I was working for target over christmas of 2018.  My short time here i got so many online orders fullfilled for ups.  We had to use these scanners to scan everything and than put everything into boxes for the customer.
good,"always busy not slowing down, there was always something to do. management was great, very one was very helpful and willing to teach you how to use the equipment."
good,"Job is strictly based on production numbers, accuracy and attention to detail are always second to production expectations.  Safety is stressed heavily while making accommodations to safely perform job duties was ignored completely.  If you enjoy a fast paced, production based job target is the place for you.  Home/life balance is a struggle with very little time around holidays to prepare at home"
good,"Typical day coming in checking standards base on sales, organized area and equipment are working great for your day. Working well with other's keeping a friendly environment. Taking on task and planning them out just to be ready and prepared. Seeing our guest happy is our enjoyment as part of our job."
good,"Though Target used to be a great place to work at, that is slowly starting to change. With the recent change in pay, lots of changes have occurred which have created a stressful work environment. As someone who takes even the simplest jobs seriously, it pained me to have to leave some work undone due to the ridiculous workload dropped on us sometimes."
good,I only worked here for seasonal and it was i great experience. If you love the holidays this will be a great job for you. Some shipments are better than others( can get pretty crazy)
good,I enjoyed working for Target in Denver. It was a fun job with lots of nice co-workers. The management was good. My typical day was organizing items on the floor as well as maintaining the fitting rooms.
good,Target is a good environment to work in and is very fair to their employees. They work around your schedule and provide extra shifts if you need them.
good,"I would recommend to young ambitious people looking to get work experience on their resume.  If you like it and want to stay, be careful.  Job security is not there.  You are replaceable so follow company policy and don't buy into the lies of career advancement in a timely manner"
good,"I worked at the starbucks which is a completely different experience from working on the floor. Overall, fairly easy but can be fast paced. Being starbucks and not on the floor, management tends to show less care for Starbucks. Managements priority is on the team members on the floor"
good,It’s not a terrible job. You just have to be willing to put in the effort. They are serious about making prod numbers. There is no extra compensation for making or exceeding prod like other warehouses. The people are nice.
good,"Listen, being at Target is awesome. At least, for my store. My co workers (for the most part) are pretty chill. But the hours? They’re terrible. I am trying to save up and move out, but if you’re already living somewhere paying rent, this job won’t help you save at all. The benefit is holiday hours that are coming up, but after that you’ll be put back at 18 hours a week or so (unless you manage to cover someone else’s shift which is hard because EVERYONE needs hours). Management is a bit irritating. They get on us for silly things when I catch them all relaxing up stairs on the clock talking about things not relating to work. But the customers for the most part are nice! I met a lot of good people. Just don’t let the $13 an hour fool you. $13 is great BUT you don’t get many hours so the pay isn’t really worth it. I’m currently looking for a full time job. But if you want to get your feet in the door and don’t have bills to worry about as much...this place is perfect!"
good,Target is a great company to work for is you need a part time job. Hours are minimal but you can ask for and pick up extra hours. Peek season hours are from October through December. Employees at Target are friendly and are required to provide great customer service.
good,Had no complaints about my interview! The only thing was that I applied for one position but they were filled up on that so I was offered a different position but the overall process is great
good,"This company is amazing - and I have met the most amazing people here. I have seen more positions filled by external hires, however, instead of the roles being filled by people within the company. That is one downfall - it is HARD to move around at Target. Other than that, the work life balance is amazing and the people are so fun."
good,i loved when i worked at target but i had to be let go because it was interfering with school so that’s the only thing i feel bad about doing when i was there
good,a typical day at work would consist of putting clothes or any other item back in its correct place in store. By the end of the night you would have to make sure your job was done and complete correctly.
good,"Honestly it was not the worst place to work at, it is not bad at all. You kind of just have to learn to have thick skin if you are going to work customer service. I would recommend it as a temporary job because they dont tend to try to move anyone up."
good,As long as the general manager likes every one equal it's fine. However if they like some one more they will allow them to getaway with things that you could not. Once you get wrote up they tend to find more things to write you up for even if you don't do it .
good,"Overall it's a pretty good place to work, it's a great place to get experience and continue on with your plans for a career. I would just say don't expect to climb the leadership ladder."
good,Target was cool but the San Dimas location management was intolerable. They don’t give enough hours so you have to hope there’s shifts to pick up. They always supplied dinner and snacks during holidays and events
good,Target is great place to work. It's fast past and upbeat. The only thing is I don't get enough hours. The pay is decent. I would recommend to anyone to work here. The best time is seasonal.
good,"always fast fun friendly face with a smile."
good,"I like work there customer was nice and got along with my coworkers! Had "
good,"Checked in, and started restocking shelves with merchandise.  Assisted customers in locating merchandise an served as back-up cashier.  I learned the stocking method Target uses.  The management was very good.   Then the management changed and things changed a bit.  Several staff were let go or moved."
good,"If you can work hard, keep your head down and get through the shift, you will have longevity there.  Pay is adequate for the work involved.  Benefits are decent."
good,The experience in the job was wonderful it help me get a feel for a mainstream retail store during the holidays and how busy it can be but was a lot of fun and would work it again.
good,Loved working with most of my coworkers. Since I was in a small department it was harder to get people to trade or cover my shifts. I had a very erratic schedule at times and did not get scheduled when I was available most of the time.
good,It was a very easy but the problem was that one day I went out of town to handle a family and I was unable to contact them and when I got back I had a voice mail telling me I was fired for not calling them
good,A typical day at work was filled with customers and rarely quiet. I enjoyed working at the Guest Services counter because I like to help people with an concerns they may have. The hardest part of the job was keeping calm when the lines were long and there was little assistance from the team.
good,What you expect from a cashier job. Pretty easy and pleasant experience. Management was nice and associates were super friendly. The 15% discount was very nice as well unlike other cashier jobs you get discounts when you shop at the store
good,"I loved my experience at target. however, there are issues like most places. they don’t offer benefits unless you are full time and they will make sure you don’t stay full time very long. inconsistent hours unless you’re a manager, and your schedule changes rapidly."
good,I did have experience but management was an issue. The actual work was really great and the pay was very good. Time off and hours were pretty flexible.
good,"Very good pay, hours can very, you can work 40 hours one week and then the next you can work about 8. Best time to work is seasonal because the hours are good and the work is easier, but if you work year around management takes advantage of you. Employees tend to be very depressed."
good,Hard to grow even showing capabilities and qualifications. Its a good learning environment and honestly would like to grow more in the company and hopefully one day at the corporate level.
good,"My experience overall was fine. Just low staffed, changed the way to do things a lot, worked multiple positions. Won’t always get the same scheduling or time of days."
good,"I had a fair experience , it was very stressful at times. I had no problem doing my job but sometimes the workload was outrageous. The manager there is not very friendly and very demanding."
good,"My role as a cashier was to help people self check out and also be on the cashier desk alternatively. I had to deal in cash register due to which i learned about how to receive payments through checks, drafts, cash and card. Sometimes I had to pull carts and work on the back side to help other teams. The fun part was whenever there was an event, kids would drag their parent to buy stuff which parents would eventually had to. But at the same time it would get so fast-paced that we needed to be really active."
good,It’s okay place to work can potentially be great but feel lack of value for employees and pay could be better for all the work you potentially do for the company.
good,"decent work experience for beginners learned and it was okay fun and fast paced. target is a okay company very balanced, doesn't excel in anything doesn't lack in anything either."
good,Really gave me great time management and just simply management skills. I loved the workplace culture. Most days were hectic but my coworkers made me that much easier for me.
good,Front-end cashiering and sales-floor occupations are great positions for first-time job seekers to acquire a basic foundation of skills required for every job.
good,It was fun and relaxing. The day starts out slowly but then picks up its pace so it will be tough but once u get used to it it will be alright. I would recommend working there.
good,I need something that’s closer to that’s why I had to stop you guys were nice very understanding but some of your workers are rude and very judgmental I did not appreciate that
good,"I worked in the seasonal fulfillment department, picking purchases, prepping them for shippping."
good,"An employee must be able to work with customers (""guests"")...the good and the bad. Management at the particular Target that I worked at was very competent and friendly."
good,I worked at Target during their seasonal shifts. They really want to take care of their employees as much as they can. The job itself is not super hard as long as you are willing to wake up early and put in the work.
good,"Great company to work at for a summer. I don't know about the future of the company, it for now its a fun place to work at. Lots of young people and good cafeteria food."
good,Overall I like working here. Just wished they paid more for tge tasks they make me do. However a lot of other cool people work there and you can build strong connections and network.
good,good working days fun and hard work everyday was fun and exciting everyday we lifted and stocked the floor we went to different parts of the store and cleaned
good,"Hey overall this job is hard-work no matter if it was a slow day or fast paced day not only did you have a set period time to get something done, it was multiple tasks. Payed very good."
good,"As far as ""entry level"" or basic retail jobs go, it is well paid and relatively easy work.  It pays competitively to keep employees from going to competition."
good,I liked that I got to do a lot of different things. It was very interesting and never got boring. The only thing I didn't really like was we all had to take break at the same time.
good,a typical day at work would be checking the scores from the day/night prior. Go to my department and gathering the team up to talk about scores and what we can do to improve and bounce off ideas.
good,"The management could have been a little better and a bit more understanding to people's situation. My situation was very tough, and she didn't care to here about it."
good,"The people are welcoming and love to help when you’re new. "
good,"Depending on the store management can be great to awful. "
good,"I worked for Target for 6 years, I started out as a part time cashier and worked to a team lead. I enjoyed my time with target, and enjoyed the many volunteer opportunities, to work with my team and for my community."
good,It was a good job. helped a lot. was a lot of fun. very cool. helped me. I had a blast. very good job it was. so nice to work. it was a nice job to have.
good,Flexible hours and team oriented the pay is at the top of the scale for retail it has good benefits if you work over 32 hours average a week and they work with students schedules
good,I worked at Target when I was just getting out of high school for a couple of months. It taught me some discipline but at the end of the day I still decided to join the USN to make a bigger and better name for myself.
good,"Just like any other warehouse honestly. It's a great place to work as long as your productive and in decent shape. They had some good benefits and incentives, but they never trained you on new things when they said they would and turn-a-round was high which put more work on everyone else."
good,I learned how to scan items and use the cash register. I also learned sociable skills talking to customers and coworkers. At the time I was on high school so I could only do certain hours but now I’m ready to take mornings and overnights.
good,My experience at target has been good so far. They are a good company to work for and offer many opportunities to learn skills that are critical in the workforce.
good,Never had a manager who was so dedicated to his job that he would come in with a newborn baby just to see how the team was doing on his days off before i came to Target. I heard he got fired and it was probably for best. Average workplace overall
good,Worklife balance was great and great benefits. Does a nice job developing it's leaders in role. Hire very driven managers to lead their teams. 401K program is amazing.
good,"People there were friendly and high energy level. Very good team working environment.The best part of the job was you never felt like you couldn't ask questions, everyone was very helpful and kind."
good,"I enjoyed working there for Christmas season. Would have liked"
good,The $12/hr was great but the job had no excitement at all. It was interesting working with people I didn’t know at all and I was the youngest. The early days and early nights came to and end quicker than I thought.
good,You will be micromanaged and get different directions from different managers. Hard to advance from within as most leadership roles have been hired externally.
good,was a great company to work for. The store manager was was great to work with some management was a little much standing around doing nothing was the reason I left.
good,"Target was a good place to work in terms of company relations and expectations, they keep you busy for sure. The biggest downside to me was managements lack of concern for employees."
good,A typical day is started with meeting a team lead and discussing the overall plan and goal of the day. There is ample room to move up in experience with hard work and trust.
good,Target is an okay company to work for. The work life balance is not always what one would like but it is average.Most retail businesses are quite similar in wages paid and hours worked.
good,"The most enjoyable part was working with guests and your team. Management was not so great and they favored certain team members over others, which was not okay."
good,Target was a fine place to work especially for a retired individual. Part time early morning hours were a great fit for a grandparent. We opened a brand new store in Gambrills. It was an empty building when our team arrived. With great urgency we assembled shelving and displays in preparation for merchandise to arrive. We stocked the entire store in record time.
good,it was good thought about going back to work at Target. usually when I got there I would start cleaning the areas that I was assigned. I learned about teamwork.
good,Very great place to start off with. Good company with hopefully better benefits now. Always liked how it was organized and scheduled. I’d recommend. Thumbs up
good,"My experience with Target was a pleasant one. Coming home from college, Target really helped me gain some work experience while cooperative & moderately-paced environment."
good,Some parts are better than others. Some days are better than others. Great coworkers Con: lack of communication between higher-ups on giving consistent answers to us in the front about what to do in certain situations. New hourly wage is nice though.
good,"although my job was seasonal, I really enjoyed my time there with the employees.  "
good,"Organized and calibrated building materials, instruments and tools required for the job responsibilities, maintained a safe and clean environment and received and responded to customer’s requests and complaints."
good,Collaborating with coworkers and team leaders was fun and engaging. Customers were usually friendly and enthusiastic to approach for help. The pay for a retail sales floor job was better than most other places but it was hard to get average hours per week above 30 which is required for benefits.
good,Target worked with me to make sure I would attend all the college classes I was taking at the time. They did a lot of cross training which would put you at an advantage because you could pick up shifts in any department and promotion would be easier
good,Offers advancement opportunities to both male and females. Stores throughout North America. Periodic reviews to help boost employee performance and growth.
good,"I enjoyed my time being part of the target family, the volunteer the give aways prizes. Just being apart of the team that opened the 34th st location."
good,"It is still retail, there are things that definitely are not great. Pay is decent for retail work, most managers seem pretty good. Foster open conversation and expectations are usually pretty clear"
good,"I believe they have increased the pay recently. I was working at two jobs--75 hrs. a week. I had rent $2500.00 outstanding. I worked overtime to try and pay rent. At one time a worked a total of 80 hours between two jobs. I left my part-time job. and the there was a change in management and I was down to 6 hours a week for a while. I managed to pay my rent until it was $1400.00 and then I got help from somebody who gave me $1000,00 to pay the rent and I relocated where I stayed in an out of code building for two years rent free and enrolled at college. I was about to get more hours but decided to stay in college. I could not do both. So I concentrated on studying and starting from 0, I just graduated in May 2019 with a Bachelor's Degree. I am now retired but I am trying to get back to work at age 71."
good,Didn't work at target long but did enjoy the time I did. Fun when working on the back room and enjoyed helping customers when I could on the sales floor. Management was nice. If you like retail work then it's great.
good,"Working part time isn’t the most fantastic thing ever, full time is much better, but they were very well put together. Pay was fair. They weren’t very flexible with my schedule and my supervisor specifically wasn’t great, but other than that it was a fantastic job. I loved working in the beauty department and all of my other coworkers and supervisors were fantastic. Perfect pace, great starting retail job. Unfortunately I was terminated for a health issue, so be aware of that if you live in an at-will state."
good,Worklife Balance and increased hours worked during the holidays.  Management team has high expectations and be prepared for constant change and focuses to keep them relivant
good,"I actually like working at Target. Although at times it can be somewhat stressful with maintaining a zoned area in the clothing department, I like a challenge. My coworkers make it worth coming to work."
good,"Cashiering requires great customer managements. At times, customers can be in a rush or frustrated so must be patient and prompt in managing them. Keep station orderly."
good,"Great coworkers. was dedicated to my department. I wish I was thanked more for the hard work and dedication. Some days are stressful when there's no backup. I felt managment depended on me rather than training others to do SFS."
good,I currently work here and the hours are really unstable. Everyone is really nice and cooperative but I averaged about 20 hours a week and then they dropped by 6 and a half hours. i emailed the HR person for the store about this and then she gave me 30 hours. Everyone who works here is experiencing cuts in their hours and its really difficult for everyone.
good,Typical work day is helping a lot of people with their questions and helping them get products.The hardest part about it would be when people would try to go and steal stuff.
good,"I was hired on seasonal and signed my contract that said I would be notified a minimum of 2 weeks away if I was not going to be kept on after season. However, I was told they day before I was being let go that they weren't going to keep me on. I did not have time to look for a new job and was left asking friends for gas money."
good,"From start to finish it was an experience. The initial interview challenged me with questions, the job provided an opportunity to show my potential and the supervisors further challenged me as well received my input and thoughts as to how I can better the position."
good,"A typical day at work for myself consisted of making sure there were no expired food items on the floor and stocking those that needed stocking. Additionally, I had to place food orders, document arrival of food delivery truck and unload it. I also trained incoming employees and supervised them throughout their shift. Also emailed food vendors when an issue arose regarding their items.The workplace culture of target was team oriented. We made sure to help each other when one department was falling behind. This job taught me to think critically, how to manage stressful situations and how to communicate with not only fellow team members, but management as well. In terms of the hardest part about the job was when team members would call out and the work load that was to be done by them would be given to myself on top of the work I already had to do."
good,I enjoyed my work at Target. I loved working with the customers. Helping them shop getting them what they needed and kidding around with them were some of the best perks to me.
good,"We all work as a team. The entire store is always organized since we all work to accomplish the same goal, even if we are from different departments, we care about to accomplish it."
good,The team I worked with knows their jobs well and can handle all situations professionally.  Breaks are given in a timely fashion. The attitudes of the workers are flexible and helpful to customers.
good,It was an amazing job opportunity that promoted growth. Everyday started with a smile and ended with one. Management were very friendly and helpful whenever needed.
good,"While my time working there was short, I didn't have a bad time working there. Working with the customers was a pleasant experience, and if there was anything I had trouble with or had a question about, Team Managers were available to help and teach me along the way."
good,It was alright and the pay was extremely well but the management was some of the worst I have ever experienced. They will leave you in the dust doing certain tasks and think only of themselves.
good,Target was a nice simple retail job.  You always know what is expected of you and have a wealth of resources if you find yourself needing more clarification.
good,"It’s a good place to work for High School Students, if you’re attending College 13.00 an hour less than 20hours a week biweekly Pay on Friday’s but if you have a family to feed, bills, rent, etc to pay it’s not enough no full time position available as a cashier but it is a great place to work at no one is on your back it’s a laidback environment workers are respectful towards one another"
good,Target isn’t a good job to be a permanent job because you don’t receive much benefits from it and they certainly start to cut hours and it becomes unfair as to how differently they pay different departments from the store.
good,Sorting of recieved merchandise onto inlays for correct merchandising in the departments. Originally trained in order fulfillment picking orders for on line customer sales
good,It was quiet was fun because I was moving everywhere  scanning stuff walking to a diffrent spot I don’t has to see people and the hours was fast to Can be out
good,Target was my first job right out of high school and it was a great experience. Learned so much about customer service that even to this day it helps.
good,"Target overall is an amazing company to work for. The level of diversity and innovation they strive for is great. However, Target on a store level can be a trial depending on your location. If you are fortunate to work at a store with great, collaborative, and supportive managers then you will stay for a long time."
good,Great environment and co-worker. Felt satisfied with the group I had to help me throughout my journey. The managers were very understanding and great people to interact with.
good,Las Vegas Nevada is a tourist attraction and Working at target here in Las Vegas you meet people from around the world. All my coworkers are great to work with and everyone helps each other.
good,"Flexible working hours especially if you're a student. "
good,"Working the overnight shifts, it was hard to get through the work hours after the store was closed. With minimal coworkers and the absence of customers, the work environment was unbearable."
good,It was a fair honest job. the location was smaller than most target's that are non super-targets. The community of shoppers were pleasant to provide service to.
good,"I started at Target in Softlines, organizing the clothing section and answering the phone. After showing I could work, they put me on the Planogram team and I came in early mornings and reorganized aisles, unloaded trucks, and stocked new items. Softlines could be tedious and drag, but I enjoyed Plano because there was more tasks and thinking involved."
good,"Target has given me the skills to improve my customer service and retail knowledge. Overall the workplace is high paced, and you always have something to do to keep you busy. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to me new people every day and feeling confident in helping them pick something out. The management is great and make it easy for you to ask questions when you don't know how to do something. The hardest part of my job is not being able to get the hours I need, so if you are looking for a full time job that Is not a management position I recommend looking else where."
good,"I enjoy working at Target, my coworkers and leaders make up the best part of working there. My only concern is the hours, besides that everyone has an opportunity to move up and it is a great place to work at. I work both service advocate and checkout advocate and a typical day at work is meeting and greeting customers, tending their needs and concerns."
good,"good place for a part-time or second job. the environment is really team oriented, everyone is up to help everyone. they are really open when it comes to scheduling and willing to work according to your availability."
good,it was my first job and I totally recommend this job to anyone. specially if is your first job. The only negative side about this job are the customers. some can be very rude and very demanden (they want to be treated like kings)
good,very friendly and everyone is willing to help/work together as a team. Trained for every area in the store so all the employees can work together to fit the best needs of the customers/guest.
good,Target Distribution has really good pay for what you do. They have really good benefits as well such as them paying for your Uber if you don't have a ride to work but you cannot abuse it like using it everyday. The people I've met there are really cool and chill.
good,"After over three years at Target, I've realized that the goals I set for myself are not so attainable. I loved my job and the pay is more than fair, however, when I asked my manager about moving up, she responded by telling me to apply elsewhere. It definitely felt like a slap in the face."
good,"Easy, laid back, and yet competitive at times. the last quarter of the year was the best time to work for it allowed people to work as many hours as wanted, as well as holiday pay."
good,I was a seasonal employee for Christmas.  A lot of young people work here.  Management was friendly and always willing to help.  Pay was pretty good for what was expected.
good,"Its not that bad. Just mainly a political game just like in life. Meet the right people and you’ll succeed. Meet the wrong ones, good luck. Its the same thing everywhere."
good,"It was a decent part time job. The managers weren't that great and I would get out at insane times. Some days I would get out at around 3 or 4 am. Besides that, it was fun."
good,I had a lot of fun working for Starbucks/Target. I enjoyed the fast pace environment and had fun interacting with my customers and building relationships with them.
good,"The work day started at the crack of dawn with most of us breaking a sweat shuffling boxes and product around before the store opened, and then cleaning up the mess Coworkers were nice and reliable. During the holiday season however, our shifts started at 4AM which made it a bit more difficult for social stuff the day prior."
good,"I loved working here, I loved the discounts meeting and greeting new guest everyday explaining the products and helping new people.I would recommend Target to everyone because it's always changing to meet the needs of everyone who shops there"
good,"4 years after I left this position I still recommend it to friends looking for work. I've had a few friends, based off recommendations, get jobs there, WELL after I left."
good,"In the beginning, I was very nervous. The managers seemed very intimidating just by existing, but once you got to know them, everything just seemed to flow naturally. Eventually, I worked there long enough that the front end managers and I would discuss how we were going to position people for the day, even though I wasn't a manager. It's nice to know that people respect your ideas in a place that made it feel like you were an ant walking among giants. I enjoy working with the people I work with, but we all agree that the amount of work we have to do is not equal to the amount of pay we are given, but I don't complain because I'm there to work and make sure that things go smoothly. At the end of the day, I can always confide in my managers because they respect everyone and are always willing to listen to any problems you might have. I've always enjoyed the people I work with and have become so proud of the friends I've made along the way that have moved into a managerial position."
good,"I worked for backroom, usually I fulfilled online orders and picked up any slack that needed to be done around the store. the Workplace culture is very friendly and teamwork oriented."
good,"I wasn't there for too long because it was only a seasonal job, but the time I spent there definitely wasn't bad. It was easy work and for good money."
good,Working at Target meant working with a team. I loved being a Target team member at my Target store. I knew I could always count on a fellow team member to help me if I needed anything. The Target culture is unlike like any other I've ever worked for.
good,It's been years since I worked here. I honestly don't really remember what it was like. It was very busy and I wasn't trained on the rest of the store. I just did front cashier work.
good,With my experience I always had a good time with my fellow team members but when I’m scheduled in an area I don’t like I’m not very productive and maybe that’s just a personal thing but I feel it’s not because if touch don’t enjoy the job you’re doing I don’t think you’ll do a good job at it
good,"I enjoyed working as a cashier at target, as I seemed to always staying busy with the guests. I also liked how customer oriented they were as we were not allowed to call customers customers, it was required to call them guests."
good,"Plenty of opportunities to grow up to a certain level."
good,Target was a good place to work for someone starting out in the work force.  Ever changing landscape of retail provides lots of learning experience for anyone working in the field.  They hire quality people which make working there a pleasure.  Overall Target is like any other big retailer where you need to work hard to get anywhere within in the company.  They are great at providing customer service training to the toughest of learners.
good,"I was able to work at two different Target locations, and definitely saw both sides of the spectrum. My first store that I was with for about 7 years was an absolute dream. The management was perfect, the team was great, everyone was on the same page! The second store I was at was not run well at all, completely understaffed, and did not promote employees that should have been given the opportunity to."
good,"I would've continued working here if I hadn't gotten a better opportunity, and if I would've been able to work full-time. The pay is great, the schedule is flexible."
good,"Working at target was not difficult, i had good manages and coworkers.it was fast paste and reasonable to do list each shift for each employee  and staff member ."
good,It was an easy summer job for a high schooler. Overall I did like my experience there and I would definitely reccomend Target for High school to Early aged College kids.
good,"I learned a lot while working at target. During my time, I was able to see what everyday cashiers and store team members go through and this made me appreciate all workers. Target taught me life lessons that I will also be able to use as I further myself in life."
good,a typical day is greeting guest and working with team members to ensure that the store stays in decent order and make sure that all guest are taken care of in a timely manner.
good,"I absolutely love working as a Hardlines team member. Usually, I'm stocking, maintaining a good zone, and keep up with re-shop. It is a multicultural environment, and all of the employees have cordial, if not friendly demeanors. "
good,"It is long hours but fairly simple work. They are very adamant about working your expected schedule and there is no sick time so if you call off because of an illness you still may get disciplinary action for it. The benefits for employees is outstanding. Tuition reimbursement, employee discounts, fitness discounts, the list goes on."
good,i enjoyed the store that i was at. the management team was very hands on and effective in communicating with the staff members.Made it a great work environment to be a part of.
good,A typical day was never really stressful. Everyone was really nice. And very flexible hours. Management was very nice and always helped out no matter what the situation was.
good,"Job wasn't that hard, once you understand what you're doing it's pretty easy. After just a couple of hours with a trainer I understood what and how to do my job."
good,"Co-workers are freindly. Manager they are freindly too but somtimes they're fake. Always the Manager, do not tell you when take off your hours, there is no communication."
good,The working environment at Target was very inviting and if you have any questions about your task of the day you could ask your superiors to clarify. One thing that is worth mentioning is everyone at Target is trained to work a cash register incase of busy days.
good,Target is a place where you grit and grind from the start. I was a Team Member and what we do is pull the store stock off the morning truck's and go stock them in the store at a timely manner.
good,"I worked in Softline but I helped with Stocking, zoning, and truck too. "
good,"Target has been the first job that I’ve had where I can say that the employees really treat each other like a team, or family. It is a pleasure working with such great people."
good,"I learned Time Management and routine building but also flexibility in that I had to answer calls for team lifts, carry outs, or spills.  Physical Job."
good,"I was the cart attendant at a super Target and enjoyed.being by my co-workers, but there are definitely a bunch of customers who did disgusting acts. Like keeping all of their trash in their carts when they left, or if I was cleaning a bathroom, they would ignore the closed signs and walk right in. The managers did listen, but there wasn't too much they could do with the problems I had to face. And the sundays.. They were just way too busy for my taste. Overall a great place to start out at."
good,"I enjoyed working at Target for many reasons. My fellow coworkers were all nice, management was always well organized, and the work environment itself was very friendly. I enjoyed working as a cashier for the time that I did and if I could, I would like to work there again."
good,"Target is a great company to work for! The company is very inclusive, and it has a lot of benefits available. The people are more understanding about issues than most places are, in my experience. All in all, the culture is what makes Target so amazing. I truly appreciate Target and the corporate drive behind it, and though each store is different, I really love how my store is handled. The managers truly care, and the work is rewarding."
good,the hours arent ideal but it helped me have a job and go to school at the same time. they dont force you to work overitme and want you to work your full 4-8 hour shifts
good,It was better than Firehouse Subs. As soon as you clocked on you started working. And there was always something to do. Never a boring moment at Target.
good,It was great working at Target. I learned how to be an even more personable person working there. I interacted with many people on a daily basis and learned how to do tasks more efficiently.
good,"While the people make it fun to work at target, the pay and the hours are not worth the amount of work that they give. Sometimes 8 hours a week, other times 29 hours a week, which makes it inconsistent. Minimum wage is what you start off at and cannot go up until a year later. It is a good job for a student. However, if you can find something better, go for it and do not look back. I wish I had more opportunities to advance at target, even with a bachelors degree they did not look my way, they would rather high from outside than promote from the inside."
good,"Target is not a bad place to work for, except for the fact that you get barely any benefits besides the discounts on the things that you purchase. Work environment was laid back, pay was nice, and the tasks given were never too hard."
good,"I worked under a woman who was not great at her job. She's had a few evaluations and she's been investigated. She's had many complaints from her own team and even others. However, the store manager has not done anything about it. She would cut hours if you made her mad and she was very harsh to us over the walkies. Still, Target is a great corporation and they typically treat their workers great. I just chose the wrong one."
good,"Holiday seasons make for busy work days that go by relatively fast. After the holidays are done, days can be extremely long with little to do throughout the store. For the most part your coworkers help make the days go by faster."
good,"The job was stressful only when it's rush hour, other than that everything was seemingly easy. Sometimes, you have to make sure that your work station is clean, whipped down! Depending on your management team, if you open up a certain amount of red cards, you get prizes! For example free Starbucks, or candy. Some management can write you can recommendation letter for college as well."
good,"Working at Target was pretty fun, it was an easy job although hours were difficult to come by after the season. The only thing I didn't like about it was some of my coworkers, or honestly most of them. Target, at least the one I worked at, felt very cliquey. Like I was in high school again. The ""popular"" kids were allowed to lay around and do nothing as long as they wanted while on the clock and the team leads never cared, but if you weren't one of the ""popular kids"" you'd get in trouble for even just checking the time or saying hello to a passing coworker."
good,"So I started working there towards the end of the summer and as such I made sure to specify that I could only work after 4pm (when I would be getting out of school), but they kept asking me to come early and to take other shifts. Since it was still the summer I didn't have a problem, then a few weeks before school I informed HR that they would need to make sure to stick to my prefered schedule if they wanted me to continue working there. I reminded them twice a week for 3 weeks, but in the end they didn't and I choose school over being a stocker. Other than that the working environment and coworkers were great, fairly easy work, and lots of hours."
good,"Target is a great company to work for, unfortunately it doesn't mean that the leaders you work for are true representations of the company. Target is going through many changes right now and these changes are not for everyone. Go in with an open-mind and you will be okay."
good,"At least for me it was a starter job, something to earn some cash. I found that management was pretty strict, but that's to be expected when the people you employ is a bunch of teenagers."
good,"Typically when I get to work I start the day off by grabbing any truck push I have for shoes and push it out. Then, I zone and backstock as needed. Every Thursday I price change and get rid of salvage. I have learned great time management as well as how to help guests out with anything they need. Management isn't the best in my store, but they are still listened to. With all of the changes coming to Target these days, it's starting to be very overwhelming, especially since they keep cutting our hours. If they weren't doing that then all of the new changes wouldn't be to bad. I have enjoyed everything I have learned in my almost 5 years of being there."
good,"Good place to work, get a for young high school students looking to make some money. They try to fit with your schedule as best as they can. You have great co-workers"
good,"I started as a lowly cart attendant and worked my way to being a Senior Backroom Team Member and Trainer. My job duties were far from little and required me to be in multiple departments and highly efficient in getting tasks done. However I learned a lot in how to deal with time restraints, heavy logistics, and unruly customers. The culture was slightly elitist, but that tends to go away after you carve a name for yourself. The hardest part of the job was that at times the pay does not feel adequate at all (I.E. holidays and extremely busy weekends). On the contrary the most enjoyable part was easily the people I worked with. To this day I still go back to my hometown target and get drinks with old managers and coworkers."
good,I absolutely loved the team meetings every morning and the fun upbeat embrace you would get from the amazing group of people that I worked with. I only left due to the fact that hours were cut so far down after holiday season that I couldn't support my family so I had to move to a job that provided more hours.
good,"Able to pick your hours "
good,"it was an ok job. I would recommend it, but then again, I feel I was fortunate to work with good people.  When working retail jobs I believe it helps to have a good attitude in general and that good attitude will rub off on most other employees which will make for a better working experience."
good,The process of doing anything constantly change. It's meant for the better but it can make the job harder and stressful. It's good job but be prepared to meet their quotas.
good,"Target is an amazing company filled with wonderful, intelligent and hard-working people. I've never had better co-workers in my career than at Target. "
good,"Everything was fine my entire year working there, until the newest STL. I used to be super happy to come to work and do what I knew I was good at. The new stl (we all know his name) made the environment so negative always and did things his own way. When he started I witnessed a drop in workers. about 90% of my coworkers are all out of there. and they almost all would come back if he left. Everyone I asked about him-wants. him. out. I say beware the job here until he leaves."
good,"Fast pace work environment, must buy own tools, very willing to help you learn the trade, must be able to learn how to read bore gages, mic, and calipers"
good,It’s a fun place to work at it gets pretty busy so you gotta be up for none stop work. Everyone their is nice and you make good friends at Target that will last
good,"Long hours and monotonous work; good co-workers and unusual guests make the time go by faster."
good,"The things you remember are the people, they make the work worth it. Every day is made better than the last with each new interaction, be it guest, leader, or peer."
good,They enforced taking your time in breaks and lunch very seriously. They took take of the employees working there by reminding them to take their breaks and willingness to teach newcomers.
good,"Target is a really nice place to work and to learn new skills. The pay is great and most of the employees and managers are amazing. I happened to have a terrible experience with my manager, so I left in favor of a better position at another company. I would recommend working here, just be wary of the hours and what management expects of you."
good,"Great job. Loved working at target, it’s a very relaxing job once you get used to everything, employees are very helpful & everybody has a great work shift"
good,Every day at Target is busy and fast paced. Each section of the store requires a different set of skills to ensure that it is working at its best. You are almost constantly on your feet trying to meet deadlines and help guests.
good,"Target is a really good place to start off with, especially if it’s your first job. It’s a friendly environment. Other co-workers make sure they help you, especially if you’re new to the job."
good,"A days work at target is like working on an assembly line at a very fast pace. Moving boxes and making production was at an all time high at all times for a twelve hour shifts on weekends.We had a thirty minutes lunch break non-paid, even with working a 12-hour shift at $16.00 per hour as a seasonal worker."
good,I work the 4 am shift and it is not that bad. Usually goes by pretty fast. Restocking shelves and pricing merchandise. Along with setting up displays and putting product on them .
good,Hours were not set up in a manner that made it easy to figure out a schedule. The mangers didnt help a lot when it came to submitting time off and I felt it could have been more organized.
good,"I enjoyed working for Target it educated me in a lot of things they do that I didn’t know they did .It is a place where the people were helpful and considerate of other not knowing , the mangers I had were very efficient as to directing what to do, and I would like to be reconvened for employees there"
good,"It was ok, but they didn't want to talk when it came to talking about raises. I loved the environment and they let me be creative when planning the monthly calendar for fun events for the employees and also appreciation days.  I gained a lot of experience in HR."
good,Working at Target was a very productive environment. There was always tasks to complete. Target gave the ability to work great with others as this was my first job.
good,I was a seasonal teammember but they trusted me with a lot. I got $12.50 an hour. Only complaint is I wasn’t trained much I had to figure stuff on my own.
good,"I learned everything retail related here and had a good time working in the two years I was there. Because of my background, I worked in the beauty section and loved my little area. I couldn’t stand working in any other department because it wasn’t fun for me. Basically you just help out guests and stock the shelves and organize your area and basically become an expert.  A very easy job for me. My team leader was great and taught me many things and was real with my team unlike the executive leaders where their attitudes are fake and don’t offer help when I would tell them I would need assistance. I loved all my coworkers and the friendships that I made there. Towards the end, target was rolling out a whole bunch of changes as per corporates orders which caused stress, less hours and unhappiness in a lot of team members.  The only bad thing about target is that you have to kiss up to the managers and work there for years in order to get any kind of promotion or recognition. So all in all, I liked my job and my department and my coworkers but management was  very poor."
good,The job itself wasn’t really that demanding or hard. It was a basic holiday job so I got a lot of hours. My main complaints are that the job hours were not flexible at all and being there was a huge mental drag.
good,Not a bad place to work. Fairly reasonable hours enjoyed my coworkers. They can have unrealistic sales goals. They were not flexible with my schedule at all.
good,"a typical day at work was fun , the environment i worked in was amazing . everyone there made the job and day fun . the were able to work with my schedule . i learned to stop being shy and just talk to everyone ."
good,"Overall a decent experience. Pay was fair. Scheduled hours were kept at a minimum as to not qualify for benefits, huge draw back. Very fast paced,mandatory breaks. The management did work with you on when you were available. Extra shifts available."
good,The culture of the work place is inclusive and supportive. Management is aware of issues with team members and are always willing to fix them. A typical day at work is fast paced and extremely guest oriented.
good,"Flexible work hours dependent on what work you're willing to perform."
good,"Target is a great place to work if you are in school or want to work part-time. The hours are flexible and you can pick up shifts. They are great at making you feel like apart family and are supportive. I worked as a beauty team member for about 6 months, the only con that I would say is after i worked seasonal the hours were cut."
good,"Huge emphasis on guest interaction and culture. I actually completely  agreed with this approach and enjoyed it. Fast paced interaction, and constant learning and adapting is also very necessary and promoted, which was also very enjoyable and  pushed me to do and be better."
good,"Loved working here, but tenure, loyalty, and experience do not matter to management team when hours are an issue. Raises are not merit based, you will make the same as someone new. They do annual raises to the same for everybody, regardless of position and tenure."
good,"it's been so long since I've worked for them I really  for this company, I really do not think its fair to give my feed back. I am sure thing have changed."
good,the location that I worked at had very poor management and made it difficult to contact HR. The company didn't understand my student status and didn't take into consideration the time I asked for. It was a fun job temporarily but I would not recommend it to anyone with a strict schedule.
good,"A day at work included opening the registers, stocking any items that were available in the front, assisting customers and taking money and providing accurate change. It gets very busy during mid-day but overall it wasn't bad"
good,I worked at Target as a high school student during the Christmas season and it was a great place to work.  I learned customer service skills.  The hardest part of the job was learning where everything in the store was.
good,"If you are hard working and dedicated you have a good chance for a good career with this company.  I loved working with guest and team mates.  Fast, Fun Friendly"
good,i leaarned how to work with others on a level i have not had to in the past. i really enjoyed my time there everyone was always so willing to help you when you dont know how to do something.
good,"It was fun working with my team member I learned alot, their really amazing people we try our best to work together and communicate with each other. Have out task done and provide as much services for our customers about our products."
good,If the Target store sold well then you get full time work if not they cut your hours to barely 20 hours a week. So great if you're looking for part-time
good,"It was very diverse and everyone is welcoming, the mangers are good people sometimes you will get customers that are angry, or sometimes you can get famous customers and at work when that happends you need to stay calm and keep working."
good,"Target values the concept of a great idea, but if that idea comes with making some people uncomfortable, or ""ruffling feathers"" it isn't a good idea anymore."
good,"Easy work, long hours. Same thing everyday. No vacation hours. Always at the bottom of the pole unless you are friends with managers. Some employees got away with doing nothing if they were friends with management"
good,I really enjoyed the work environment. Fast paced and continuously evolving work environment keeps you on your toes and in the loop at all times. The training could stand to be a little more in depth. There was a lot  I had to learn on the Fly.
good,"I didn't like the management here but the company itself is amazing I really enjoyed working there, and I wish I was given the opportunity to stay. There were a lot of benefits, and the environment was friendly."
good,"Target as a company is great. the hours are decent, pay is high for the area, and they usually adjust with your schedule. you are expected to put out the amount of work for how much you get paid. However, the Location i was working at was terrible in terms of management. the store Manager was having a relationship with my Team Lead, which led to it affecting who got more or less hours for our area. this also led to unnecessary stress in the work environment."
good,Working at Target was an interesting experience as far as gaining knowledge about the retail industry. The pay was competitive compared to other retail stores.
good,"busy, crowded, hot. You are not able to sit down for a minute without your team leader saying something. You are intentionally secluded from your team members."
good,"They are very passionate about upscaling the image of Darts in the public eye and very willing to try new methods of increasing exposure and tap into new markets."
good,Cashiering at target can be a faced paced job but can also be slow all depending on the time of day. Expect to work black Friday of course. Great starter job!
good,"All coworkers were very friendly and always willing to answer my questions. Managers were also friendly and delegated well and efficiently. Hours were okay, was scheduled outside of my availability multiple times"
good,"It is easy to stay busy at a typical day of working here. Customers are usually friendly, with the occasional guest that is hard to deal with. The team members here are always friendly. Starting pay is good for the work that is required."
good,Target is a fast paced job where its easy to learn however the workload at times is face past and changing to where you might possibly have to adapt on spot in other areas to get the job the done
good,"Working at Target is pretty straight forward, its not very difficult or complicated. Most of the people are pretty pleasant and its a fun place to work. However, if the wrong people are in a Team Lead position, they can definitely make it harder than it needs to be. Most of the management rarely listen to employee feedback and often discourage employee interaction at all."
good,"i worked at different throughout my 4 years there, i had some good managers and some poor ones. One of which was the last place I worked I was treated as though I couldn't work hard lines because I was female. (even though it was the only place I've ever worked at the rest of the targets I worked at) Soft line was filled with people that didn't want to do their job but chatter all day. wasn't do happy about doing all the work."
good,"A day at target was organizing and putting new things out onto the shop floor. What i learned was time management and social skills. Management was difficult to get along with because they had their favorites and gave them less stressful tasks. Culture was great, got to work with a lot of different people. Hardest part of the job was keeping the pace. and the most enjoyable part was meeting new people."
good,"It's great and all, but a lot of times there will be only one or two cashiers running the front with entire crowds of chaos going down the aisles. They'll call for backup but it'll take about five times or more calls before one person steps up to help the front. It really needs to be mandatory for employees to respond to backup within a certain amount of time or specifically be called down to help instead of ignoring the calls for backup."
good,"having worked in two target locations (and trained in a third) I can say it's almost always busy. Target is a very driven store with a ""make the guest happy"" model for how the store runs."
good,One of my first jobs that I enjoyed working since I was quick and a great multitasker. You must be able to hold a conversation with the customer while ringing them up.
good,Target was a good company to work for. They took care of me and my family when we were displaced by Hurricane Katrina. The schedule was tough to work through.
good,I started at Target opening a brand new store. It was a very interesting experience seeing how an empty space became a retail store with a mini-warehouse in the back!
good,Worked in a small town Target in the electronics department. If you can avoid the teenage drama and the poor management its a decent place to work. Don't work on the front end.
good,I enjoy what I did and I found this job more enjoyable than working at my previous employer Walmart.  However there was no advancement available.  The environment was great
good,"I had fun for a while working at Target while going to school at the same time. Eventually, management was a little too topsy turvy and hurt the overall workflow of the team as a whole."
good,"I dont really have any insight, as I have not worked there in over a decade. It was great for me when I was in high school, as it helped pay for my car."
good,I love working here and I love everyone I work with too. The environment and the people I work with are great. I have gotten to know and love so many people and made a few friends in the process.
good,"I spent a few years working at target, overall it was a decent job. There was nothing specifically special about it but it was a job and it worked, that's about it."
good,"Being a flow team member is a very physical job.  I very much enjoyed the physical aspects of the job.  Also, making sure that everything is stocked in the proper location gives pride in your job."
good,"I used to love working at Target. Flexible hours, great co workers, very nice managers but as of recently things have changed. They way we conducted business before worked smoothly and the guests were happy but corporate constantly changes our day to day responsibilities and what we are supposed to do. They have become less flexible with schedules, hours are low, its hard to pick up shifts, and the turn over rate is very high. I learned a lot working at Target and got some great work experience working on many projects but many of the co-workers and bosses I respected so much are quitting left and right due to the way business is being conducted now."
good,It was okay. I think that they did a great job with the hiring process and put me to work quickly. I was able to work Black Friday and learn how to work under pressure.
good,"Fine summer job. I received decent pay. However, hours can be unpredictable and management changes often. Overall fine for a summer but would not work longer."
good,I had trouble keeping up with there market team and I feel as it they were unreasonable time requirements.I would suggest this job with someone with more experience in the retail field.
good,"I learned how to use the cash register."
good,"They have decent benefits and good discounts to promote a healthy living if you choose. HR policies are good and they are good at following through with requests. Promotions and raises seem hard to come by for the most part. I was lucky enough to be in a store where my store team lead supported me (primarily because of who he was an a leader and an individual vs just Target branded thinking) I was able to be promoted at a reasonable pace. In my other 3 stores I worked at, this was not the case. Overall, a good company to work for if you don't plan on staying for long."
good,"I started in the HR department at Target.  I loved helping the team members with any HR problems they had.  I would create a schedule for 200+ employees at one time.  Process payroll, gave job offers, ran orientation weekly.  I moved to the front end and loved helping the guests with problems they may of had or helping them find things in the store."
good,"I got along with my coworkers, I enjoyed helping the customers to there cars when they needed help, long days during the holidays, my coworkers and I worked well together"
good,Nice upbeat job. Competitive during holidays. Was promoted within. Enjoyed the atmosphere.  Clean. Provided adequate supplies and resources for employees.
good,"great part time job for a student. can work as a full time job if hours are available. i worked here as a seasonal job during the fall and winter. some weeks i had 38 hours, some weeks only 20 hours."
good,typical days are 5-8 hours long and pretty fast paced. We are always busy whether it is with guests or improving the store for the day or next day. The management at Target has a sound system in place yet it is often not followed leading to a lot of stress and uncomfortable encounters with the management team.
good,The pay was not very good.  I had no benefits or days off paid. My co-workers were nice.  At times it could be fast paced then it would slow down. I thought it should pay more because a lot of times I would work in customer service which was more stressful.
good,"Target is a great company to work for, however their policies are extremely strict. The job can be fun when under the right management. Hard-lines was always lacking employee's which led them to never finishing their job, soft-lines was hit the hardest when it came to responsibilities on the floor. It is an extremely fast-paced environment with constant changing directions and policies. Some people were really fun and helpful to work with, while others would completely ignore you. The workplace is the most clique-ish i've ever seen. Many supervisors or leads constantly talk down about workers behind their backs. Typical workdays(for soft-lines) depending on your shift would start out with clothing racks in the back (or shoe pallets), rearrangment of clothings, fitting room shifts, price change, zoning all day, while assisting with cashiers. The guests are the ones who are most enjoyable and can really brighten up ypur day. It's easier to work morning or mid shifts if you want to have a set schedule, whereas if you work nights you can likely be at the store until 2 am. Target has great discounts for workers with some flexible time off. They are typically an accomodating company, and many times make the workplace meetings a positive environment."
good,"Fresh out of high school, this was my first job ever. I was an Inbound Team Member, formerly known as Flow. I worked early morning shifts, a large favorite of mine. During those mornings, I would assist in unloading the freight truck and then unloading the boxes to stock the shelves on the store floor. It was hard work, having to process information quickly and to have your body get used to the motions. But at the end of every work day, I felt satisfied. The non satisfying part of the job is how fast they expect you to work, believing you can only use 30 seconds maximum to break open and unload a box. That doesn't include having to dispose of the garbage yourself and then stocking extras in the back room, clogging up the time limit."
good,It's more or less what you would expect from a retail store. Like Walmart but better in every way. You get treated as an actual human being here instead of another machine to work.
good,"At Target I recieved my breaks very late and inconsistently, was harassed and misgendered by coworkers and customers, and was moved around to different jobs a lot."
good,"It’s hard work. If you don’t work, you don’t last.  You are paid $12/hr but they cut your hours during slow periods so take that into consideration.  They also cut your hours when they hire seasonal employees.   "
good,The hardest part of the job was trying to figure out who the head soft lines price change person was from month to month. The management was ever changing and their was no clear direction of what was to be done until the job was to late or no longer needed.
good,I genuinely enjoyed working here for as long  as I did. Unfortunately the new management was a homophobe and thought she was gonna make an example out of me
good,Started here after college. They are very friendly there. Always did their best to get me a full 40 hours. We’re very flexible when I had a family emergency.
good,input and maintain prescriptions written by physicians. Assist pharmacist with drug inventory and ordering supplies. Minimal exposure to compounding medications.
good,My review for target was okay but really wasnt feeling it due to finding a different job so now i got more hours on my other job then i did at target.
good,The job itself was easy and easy to maintain at a high level but the management made it insufferable. The would tell you that you were doing a bad job because your area would not look great after dealing with waves of guests all at once
good,"Target starts off as a good job. But when I started getting behind in school, I requested that my availability be changed to earlier hours during the whole week with same amount of hours per week. But that request was rejected."
good,"Target was a fun place to work but at the end of employment the management had gone down goal time Wasnt meant, no communication with management but other then management being poor it was a good place"
good,"Target is a actually fun / great place to job, they had good management, respectful workers , nice customers . Target also  has good work hours and pays good ."
good,"My store is a nice place to work, and in my time there, there was only one other person I didn't like, and I only felt unsafe twice. The work during a shift is consistent, with no down time besides your fifteen minute break, and/or half hour lunch, depending on shift length. Pay is better than most retail places I had looked at, though there is a lot of work to make up for the average pay. Often you will be asked to do more and have more responsibilities for a small, if any raise."
good,"I worked for a short amount of time, management wasn't the nicest, but overall fun and awesome experience. I was only seasonal, but i loved my.job and interacting with guests, and trying to give them the best experience they could at Target"
good,this job requires you to have good customer servie skills because you work with them on a one on one basis. you are dealing with cash and credit cards
good,I love working at target for my seasonal job there. But target does need help on how to manage hours and people to make sure we not understaffed during holiday periods and to make sure opening and closing staff does their jobs to make sure their aren't too many problems the next day. IMO I wish target would give better hours to hourly workers and make sure team leads know how to organize and plan for the day so the workers on the sales floors aren't forced to drop everything and get stuff from back or help out in the front as cashiers.
good,Great company to work for. Possibility to move up in the company. Great team work depending of your manager (like everywhere else…).The only down side I can think of is the pay when you start that is not very high.
good,I worked there for a few months but was never able to get more than 20 hours a week. I was not able to make enough even with a second job. But the people were nice and I enjoyed the work.
good,"It was mostly me running around in a red cart, going through back rooms to find the items that peopme have ordered. You have to fulfill at least one order every hour but each order was like 30 items."
good,"This would be a great work place but for young adult that are in high school or college or whoever doesnt have any reaponsibility, but its not a great job for someone who has kids and bills to pay sadly."
good,the hardest part was traveling due to traffic and distance it wasn't so bad it could've been better just didn't feel comfortable it can be much better ..... ill be looking forward to working there again in a close distance
good,"This is one of those jobs where the saying ""people don't quit because of the job, they quit because of their manager"" is true. I used to love my job and the people I worked with. I felt valued and they worked with me as I developed up into a TL position. But I had issues with it being delayed because of a new manager who didn't get to know me and judged me from afar. They tend to do that if you don't suck up to them as soon as they get hired. Then I started training to move up to Sr. TL with my Store manager and new immediate manager. I was close to my goal and then the entire store team changed and it all went out the window. Now it's daily micro-management and they give you zero freedom to do what you need to get done. Then they yell at you later about those things needing to be done. It all depends on who you have on top. If they micromanage, then the team below will micromanage and so on. The job and environment can go either way. Great or dreadful depending on your team. Not to mention how difficult it is to get a decent pay. Yearly raises based on your review but everyones raise is around the same, plus minimum wage goes up so then the pay gap between leaders and team member stays the same or gets smaller. I've been a leader for years and if a team member got promoted they would instantly be making as much as I currently am. Decent job for a few years, then you see everyone move on to better things. Good for a beginner job or to develop different skills and customer service but not worth staying."
good,"management pitches in always. greatpeople. good hours provided. hours went down after holiday season ended. casual atmosphere, promptness expected in return."
good,"I worked while I took a semester off from school. Even though I was technically part time, I worked almost 40hours a week, usually by myself. There were times when customers were waiting out the door and I would be forced to work alone since they would only schedule 1 person to work and no one else was qualified to help. I was there for a year, and the only reason I stayed even that long were my coworkers working at other departments."
good,It's Great place for women and management is poor .Work life balance and work culture is great i felt . I was enjoying the work and collaborative work.
good,"Target taught me a lot as a person. It really helped me learn how to talk to people and be myself. I did advance in the company a little, but my pay was the same and the cashiers I was managing ($12) which I believe to be unfair. This is the reason a lot of people quit this specific position. I want to expand my knowledge and try new things, and hopefully make more money too."
good,"I learned a lot there about customer services, only thing it was seasonal job."
good,"Very flexible with your schedule,especially if you are going to school. First come first serve on overtime, decent pay and hours. Yearly evaluation and raise."
good,"Target certainly isn't the worst retail job to have, most of the managers are friendly and nice. I've had a few issues with scheduling such as being scheduled on days I'd requested off 4-6 weeks in advance and not being scheduled for two weeks at a time with my availability wide open. Very nice starting wage with no prior retail experience."
good,i done truck and stock shalves it started out as full time but they change the hours and days . we started working from 25 to 15 hours per week or we will bring items to floor and clock out and someone else will put stock away.
good,"It's an ok job for a teenager who isn't looking for much money and doesn't need benefits. Very fast paced, you will be cross-trained most likely in other areas."
good,Target has a great company branding which is one of the main reasons I applied for a job there. The discounts given to the employees are generous. Generally good working conditions.
good,"An average day of work consists of me opening the cafe or closing it, making sure all the food that doesn't go into the oven is readily available for our guests. I am usually alone, serving all the food and running the cash register. I provide efficient and friendly service with a smile. Whenever I am not busy, I am cleaning the counter tops, sweeping the floors, and straightening up the chairs and merchandise. I've learned how to multi task efficiently with maintaining a calm and cool attitude, not getting overwhelmed by having to do multiple things at once. Everyone in my workplace is very friendly and helpful. If I'm ever having trouble with something, I can ask almost any other associate for help and they are happy to help me out. The hardest part of the job is when it's busy, I'm doing everything myself and sometimes the customers get impatient because I can only do one thing at a time. The most enjoyable part of my job is providing both adults and children with the snacks/refreshments that they desire, putting smiles on their faces."
good,"Target is a nice place for employment. "
good,I loved working for Target I wish that it was in a seasonal position I went back to try and get rehired during Christmas season and they denied me that was a really bad downfall
good,It was fun working there but did not have good benefits. If you were sick you did not get paid and sometime you would get asked to stay longer for a shift your almost done because somebody called out.
good,"The motto at target is ""you can always work faster"". They are very good at keeping people on track in any way they can, and providing the best guest experience they can. Having a good Team Lead makes or breaks the job. Luckily, currently, I have a few good team leads and a good ETL."
good,"I started working at Target when I first moved to Abilene, and only recently left. I ended up applying because they were one of the best-paying retail places ($11 company minimum when I started, but $12 as of this year, and they're planning on increasing in coming years up to $15 an hour)."
good,My shifts were usually early in the morning which sucked but i managed to get use to them. Fun place to be at sometimes but hated waking up at 3am to be at work by 3:30am good thing is i was done by noon.
good,"great place to work , great hours and company discount .The hardest part of my job was sometimes I was required to go to other sites . the best part of the job was the people and being able to work with the different vendors ."
good,It was a nice and calm workplace. Very environmentally friendly and also very nice. Work had to be on point and have to be always on task. Just do your work and went home
good,"Target was not particularly different than any retail job I'd imagine, honestly. However, there was a real sense of comradery among coworkers, and I seldom encountered difficult customers. The one complaint I might have about it is that there was *a lot* of learning on the job; people often expected me to know how to do things that had never been explained to me. Nonetheless, they were more than willing to teach me and I was encouraged to ask questions and not shamed if I was ignorant about something. All in all, I'd recommend it."
good,It was a challenging fast paced atmosphere that takes a beating on your body. It made me lose a lot of weight and gain alot of muscle mass however. Paid decently
good,I love my job at Target however you cannot rely on hours as a cashier. I keep this job primarily for my discount and some extra fun spending cash.good part time job.
good,During seasonal there was lots of hours. Management was kind and helpful whenever I had questions. Every once and a while you would get a difficult customer but that's to be expected with retail. Most guests are nice in this area.
good,"I wasn't under a great LOD. I kept asking for more hours and different positions but never got them. I was usually the only one in my department at any given time, including part of Black Friday."
good,When I worked there I was cashiering the whole time. I was hoping I could at least move around and do some other stuff. It was really disappointing  I couldn't move around the store do multitask.
good,"Its a fast, fun, friendly environment. The managers were helpful and fair. Most people enjoyed coming to work. The hardest part of the job was walking and lifting the entire shift. I learned how to work with all age groups, different levels of education and to listen to the customers. Find how best to resolve issues. The most enjoyable part was just talking and bonding with co workers. The people make the job fun and exciting."
good,"Target is a great place to work. They work with your schedule, but it does take them a while to change your schedule to your fit. They are not strict but want us to treat all guest equally and fair and to be on our toes at all times, while also having fun."
good,It's been almost 10 years since I last worked at Target so I don't remember much. When I did work it wasn't too bad. Typical retail. They weren't very flexible for students.
good,"some people were not friendly to new comers , some people did not follow company rules and that affects certain jobs  in the store. I saw favoritism go around a lot"
good,"Nice people to work with and for.  The hardest part of the job was that schedule was never set, you could not really plan anything outside of work.  No Holidays off."
good,"While working at Target, I unloaded trucks during the Christmas season.  Usually as soon as all of the trucks were unloaded, we were permitted to leave."
good,"Productive work place where there isn't much downtime. Overall it isn't a bad place to work, management could use some improvement and how things are ran."
good,This company hasn't been as professional as I thought it would have been. There are more than a few issues with some of the management team members and I feel that most of the regular team members (myself included) aren't regarded as highly as they should be. Not what I expected from this company!
good,it is a good place to work. They didn't give me a lot of hours and also a lot of days. They were weeks where I only had one day. Some times they gave me a lot of hours.
good,"most of the empoyees are rude at the store i worked at and dont care about anyone elses well being. not all of them though... i made a few friends during my time there. its a fun job and all but if your're easliy distracted and get thrown off task, then then things can get messy real fast."
good,It is a job for teenagers or people who want to earn extra money. Management is okay. Corporate needs to give more incentives. Not a place I would want a career.
good,On average employees work 10 hour shifts and are required to perform high production averages. Company operates  4 different shifts ranging from 4 days per week to 3 days per week.
good,Wouldnt recommend for someone wanting to grow but its a nice first job It was easy to understand but not alot of things to do so it was pretty slow and not alot of helpful growing tips.
good,Good company. Dont work with your schedule very well and gives hours to newbys who dont know what they are doing. You get a small discount so don't apply for just that. Good pay
good,"One of the struggles is identifying a typical day. I won’t know from biweek to biweek what my work center is or what the expectations are. But once I find out, I am free to get the job done. I have learned very much in the last three years about the retail industry and Target, specifically. While some team leads are better than others, the training they have provided has been better than mediocre. The vertical communication among team leads is an area that could be improved so that training is comprehensive and consistent and frustration among everyone is minimized. The workplace culture is generally very supportive and congenial. The management generally makes sure we have supplies and resources to do our job, as well as a pleasant break room. The hardest part of the job is dealing with inconsistent hours and frustration caused by conflicting expectations. The most enjoyable part of the job is working side by side with people who genuinely create a team atmosphere: supportive, collaborative, encouraging, and accommodating. This truly exists, by and large, at Target."
good,"Day shifts were typically fast paced where night shifts were not as fast but there was still other work to be done. It was nice to be able to do multiple roles (electronics, photo area, cashier) to help out where needed but also hard to juggle time when a superior gives you a task and another area demands assistance."
good,"Nice coworkers. Everyone seems very driven and kind. For my first job, it was not too bad. I would reccommend to a friend for sure. I liked being a cashier."
good,you always have to stock up new items. My most exciting part were helping customers find products and the smile on their faces after they found it maei it worth it.
good,Work Environment was confusing as Target is supposed to be inclusive and Team focused but I did not find that to be the case within the TL and above personnel.  The behavior and training for TL's and above for their specific departments and job descriptions needs to be improved greatly.  But overall it is a nice place to work.
good,"a lot of freedom once they know you understand how to do your job. my daily tasks included speaking with vendors, building end-caps, and assisting guests with what they needed."
good,"Target is a fun, fast-paced environment where you meet new people, help customers with their doubts.  There is plenty to do and many opportunities to grow."
good,The hours are flexible and had a great team leader at the deli to work with. They were always willing to listen to my needs when it comes to scheduling. The customers are friendly and made the experience with working at Target great.
good,Decent work environment that requires good customer service. Good accommodation of time offs and vacations. Decent training when newly hired but can definitely do better.
good,Overall a great place to work.  I appreciate the leadership and the team atmosphere.  The training for leaders helped create good leaders to take on everyday tasks.  Some roles were tough to be successful at due to corporate initiatives.
good,if you like a very fast paced environment than that's where you wanna go! they make working fun and have special contests with other coworkers. they are very into helping the community also
good,wasnt a bad place to work. had fun working with customers and helping them out with what they needed. was only there for the winter season but overall it was a nice place to work
good,"While working at Target, I felt really comfortable. The supervisors and employees were really friendly and respectfully towards me. I feel like Target has given me an experience that I never thought I would have. Even though the work was tiring, the environment made it worthwhile. The only thing that was hard was lifiting heavy objects sometimes. Other than that, I loved my job. I wish i was still working at Target."
good,"Management team is highly Motivated which brings positive energy in the whole team. This is the definition of what a team should be."
good,"The position I worked with this company was a step by step process. It consisted of unloading 1-2 regular merchandise trucks and 1 food truck during each shift. Once trucks were unloaded, products had to be stocked on the shelf. After shelves were stocked, back stock had to be put in its proper place."
good,"The work environment can be a little hectic and disorganized at times, but that's something you should expect from retail. It can be really fun when working with the right team."
good,"The pay is better than a lot of other places in the area, but most times I'm not sure it's worth it. I feel undervalued some days, it depends on management's mood really. If he/she isn't having the greatest of days, you'll know, and you may suffer for it. They hired someone for an ETL position outside of Target (instead of promoting within), and they tend to do negative reinforcement, rather than being inspirational in a positive way in order to get people motivated and excited to do their job."
good,"it was a fun work environment. I enjoyed my co workers a lot. dress code was very relaxed. it is a challenge for some people, but I found the physical part easy."
good,"Typically day involved working on whatever project was assigned and watching the fitting, zoning. I also cashiered when the front became too busy since the store was pretty small."
good,"Here a small checklist. I used to really truly love this company and my job!"
good,"Too many call outs, covering multiply areas of the store, not enough time to finish your job, because you were asked to cover another area of the store. Sometimes it's impossible to complete."
good,"Love the job but it was who you know based when it came to advancement , I started as a student and after I earn my degree they wouldn’t hire me in management at the time."
good,working at target was pretty fun and I got to learn about retail. some of the guests were really rude while others were tolerable. when i needed help with something my LOD came and helped me as soon as they could.
good,"Working as a Sales Floor Team Member, I worked in the departments of stocking, cleaning, and front end. I would either be assisting customers on the sales floor or assisting at the register."
good,this place had to be the worst job I had. mangers there talk behind your back. they are so ungrateful for the work you do for them... they are very unorganized!
good,Working for target is no joke you have to be very organized and it’s definitely a fast paced working environment the managers are always looking for the next best thing they will recognize your job ethics and will help you with job advancement but it’s hard because there’s so many inside favorites that you’ll get chosen last if you don’t have any pull inside of Managment
good,Depends on what store you work at it can be stressful because the managers are not there for you when they should be. Best part of the job was meeting new team members from coast to coast
good,"I learned to be able to give great customer service and help those who need it. I also was able to learn how to multitask and work well under stress and pressure. A typical day is coming to work, clocking in, grabbing equipment and then checking the schedule on my daily task. I then will call my team leader and verify my task and immediately start working while tending to any need and question a guest might have about almost anything about target. I will typically have three breaks in an eight and a half hour shift and take them promptly when the schedule says. I will finish the night by organizing my assigned area and clocking out and returning my equipment."
good,"Team leads at Target are very friendly, with no superiority complex for the most part. Upper management does, however, seem biased and unforgiving in relation to type of work. Hiring process is easy and stress-free, and the scheduling is flexible. A fun work experience apart from upper management."
good,"Target is flexible with your schedule so if a college student needed a job to work around their school schedule, I believe Target would work with them."
good,Good people to work with. some management was very inexperienced.  Pretty flexible with school schedule. Not so good benefits. would work for target again.
good,Target is a great company to work for. Which provides many great options to advance high enough into a strong stable career. Working for Target has always been firm and fair.
good,Target is a great place to work for any first timers out there. Great job for teenagers to learn about the work environment before they get into the real world.
good,"Target is a great place to work at for the most part. The customers are fairly nice to us, and the management is overall, good. The only bad thing about working here is the hours are inconsistent and they constantly pressure us to get more redcards."
good,Not a bad place to start working especially for students. They are flexible if needs be. Just do your work and you'll be fine. Show up on time and be respectful
good,"I worked at Target during college.  The shifts started at 4 and ended at 8.  My classes were at 9:30.  I cross trained into a lot of departments and could and did get pulled and put everywhere in the store. "
good,"I was in charge of multiple employees.  Ranging from cashiering to customer service.  Scheduling, helping customers.  Making refunds. Settling customer complaints."
good,"I like working at target, however, I felt like I was stuck and could not advance. I was one of the most dedicated workers and I felt unappreciated. However, the pay was great."
good,"Yes, the guests can be intense but you have to ride a wave of calm urgentness. You are there to do a job, as rather mundane as it happens to be. My best advice is to get along with who you work with."
good,I was treated like a professional.  I could use my own judgement. Hard work was recognized and rewarded. The customer came first. Management was accessible.
good,"Honestly an average day in electronics entailed the truck, guests, phones, and maintaining of floor displays. "
good,"Working at Target offers discounts, opportunities to advance withing the company, and competitive pay among retail stores. I would reccomend working at Target, overall. The only downside for me is feeling undervalued by upper management in a corporate environment."
good,"I clocked in listened to the days events and what needs to be packed, do the warms ups, get the station and start packing or closing the boxes left from the last shift."
good,Good job for college students but it can be crazy sometimes due to so much traffic coming in and out of the store. Overall the managers there were pretty cool!
good,"I worked at Target for a few months while in college. They said they were willing to work around school, that they understood as a lot of the employees were students. Finals came around and I was scheduled 35 hours. I asked them to knock it down because I had finals all week. They told me they couldnt so I had to quit since they scheduled me right in the middle of a test that I told them about as soon as i knew. "
good,"Target is a good place to work, the guest are friendly and your co-works and their for you if you need any help. The managers on the other hand do not know the meaning of team work. You would think a manager would ask their team on how can the store do better... nope all they do is push non-stop work on you and get made cause you didn't complete the first task the way they wanted."
good,Wish I could have trasfered my job title back to WA have no complaints great company at my store was....................................................
good,"Target offer a lot good benefits, you have to work fast target is always crowd with people, good pay."
good,"Great atmosphere, customer comes in daily and you get to brighten up their day by putting a smile on his/her face. I also learned that you can just be happy anytime as long you stay positive."
good,"Target is a great place for youths to start out in their careers.  It is a place that thrives on energy, encourages quick thinking and on the fly solutions to problems, and promotes from within, ensuring that those who have spent time with the company can move up."
good,To be able to go back and forth between school and work was pretty easy for me. The customers might not be the best to be around at times but most of the time the work was bearable and not too bad. Managers were happy to hear my interest in working in a particular department. Rated mainly on how many redcards you get and not at all on your usefulness/dependency unless you have a manager in your department that you like.
good,This is not true for all Targets but the 1 Bad Apple ruins the bunch for me.  Target had some great benefits and room for upward movement. Even knowing that the culture in the particular Target I was at was so toxic that I can honestly say I will never go back.
good,"Great flexibility in working hours. Marketsource outsources for Target. Great flexibility, A typical day starts by checking all timecards in the district to ensure proper billing.  training, operational control, coaching and hiring as well as controlling performance in sales."
good,"Nice place to work, I was hired as a seasonal employee. While I was there I took on many different responsibility's. When I was first hired I helped unload trucks, from then I pursued other opportunity's like a ship to store associate."
good,This a retail giant that is a good place to work part time.  You have to like working standing up is you are cashier.  Deal with rude customer and various hour.
good,"Honestly, I love Targets work environment. They treat their employees pretty decent and always have little incentives that were fun and exciting. The only things that hindered my positive experience was the fact that, yes, management was cool but they were idiots, and had no idea how to do their job, and the hours weren't enough to live by. I only got 24 hours a week and some of the shifts were crazy like only 4pm - 8pm and then that's it. Also, when I was there, they started you with $9.50. How? While the customers were the BEST part of the job, having an older more financially stable community than competitors like Wal-Mart, I wouldn't go back unless they raise the pay and give more hours."
good,From my start with the company they have given opportunities to cross train in multiple departments which helps with gaining hours in a retail area where hours always fluctuate. Giving everyone the chance to work what they need.
good,"Great company and work environment. The people are nice and friendly. My typical day is already busy with setting up multiple work stations and servicing guests, but I do take on additional tasks if needed. I'm cross trained in multiple areas and am quite proficient in said areas; but sadly, I have not had many chances to rise up in the ranks."
good,There is nothing that stands out that is any different from any other type of retail jobs.  It is a decent work atmosphere and decent management depending on what location you are at.
good,I spent 17 years at Target working in every department starting as stocker all the way up to Team Leader. I enjoyed 95% of my time there as well. Pay and benefits could be a little better but they are coming along with that...
good,"meh it was a job I got when I was a teen, times have likely changed but I probly wont go back. stockers got 3 days a week usually 4-5 on xmas time and they were usually 12 hour days"
good,"Met a lot of people, steady work flow, and interesting because every day it was something new to learn or accomplish. A different a experience every day with policy and procedures."
good,"Working at Target I loved overall. I believe that they do not know how to treat their employees due to the fact that they have kids trying to lead kids. The leadership team itself consisted of them sitting around telling the member how and what to do. If your store looks a mess and you are short on help, you have to put yourself to work and make sure that you are guiding and setting an example for the regular employees. Also, i didn't like that they would schedule you on maybe a day you couldn't work or on a day that shows unavailable on your schedule and then make you responsible for getting someone to cover you. The leadership not knowing how to lead is the biggest problem and the scheduling. Need to have better leaders. The turnover rate is horrible"
good,I enjoyed my time a Target. Great pay and hours. The only concern I had was the store manager and the lack of communication. the amount of work can be stressful but the culture and people were always amazing and helpful.
good,"If you are a college student and looking for minimal hours its great, But the target here in Mankato, it was super hard to get full time hours unless you can pick them up internally on their app for employees. The management was good and did help out but after the holidays, it made it tough to earn money.,"
good,I have been an employee with Target Corp. For 18 years. It has taught me the foundation that I have set for a very strong work ethic. I have held multilple positions throughout Target. I have learned so much from my managers and trainers that have helped me become the strong leader that I am today.
good,"Target has very strict work culture. Most jobs are physically or mentally demanding. Production uus the ""Word""."
good,"I was hired seasonally & was given the chance to work full rime. The guest where friendly, management was nice. Overall I enjoyed my employment there."
good,I enjoyed my time a Target. Great pay and hours. The only concern I had was the store manager and the lack of communication. Also HR department was not the place to go get help either.
good,This was my first retail job and seasonal and assured me no possible hire. It did suck but I also understood. It was during Black Friday that I was really thrown with the wolves I did not get much training but I learned as I asked questions or made mistakes and fixed and remembered and learned and got better. Pain minimum wage and part time. Less than 20.
good,"I loved this job for many years. In recent years they became more centered on numbers and sales than employees. They stopped doing fun things and catering and pretty much just worked people to the point of quitting. Corporate made management quality drop drastically. It used to be a ""fast, fun, and friendly"" place, can't say it is anymore though."
good,"The training and information needed to do the job is extensive.  Not only communication skills, but knowledge of the RETAIL industry. High stress monitoring of all the Target stores for Refrigeration, HVAC, Lighting and all mechanical equipment.  Able to make decisions and phone calls that may or may not affect the store. Also emergency situations that occur.  (Hold up, Medical emergency, etc."
good,"Also known as sales workers or salespersons, sales associates sell retail products and goods, such as equipment, clothes, cars or car parts, etc. Sales associates work with customers to find what they want, ensure a smooth sales process and process transactions."
good,Loved my job and its definitely a place to work environment is good and very relaxed but also fast paced and enjoyable. Some managers only like to help out certain team members and unfair.
good,"i enjoyed working here, there was decent pay and friendly staff. i was a cashier and i got the opportunity to meet a large variety of people and got more experience working in the retail field"
good,I worked for the company for ten years and I loved the team I worked with . We have remained friends still. And I left the company on my own due to having a child
good,By working as a level 3 for Target I was able to transfer to another state and further my career.  Target was the beginning of my career in business and in lower level management.
good,"It was a real good time working at, Target. Of course it had its ups and downs but overall I had a lot of fun. I got to meet a lot of really cool  people, people I actually enjoyed being around and working with. And I think that’s extremely important for a work place. Management was a little all over the place towards the end of my time working there which is unfortunate because it was pretty good leading up to that point."
good,The company was ok but my boss wasnt very understanding. I had a random schedule after I was told to make my hours specific. I didnt like that but I was appreciative of the job
good,I worked there when I was pregnant and the only Be think I didn’t like is when I had to go to He bathroom someone would take long to relieve me and I dkdng like that they knew I was pregnant at the time too. Very unprofessional for that reason only
good,"I personally loved my time at Target. Wouldn’t have left but I needed a full time position which isn’t something they would offer me. Managers were great, work was fast paced."
good,Target is a wonderful place to work. You get to meet so many people of different backgrounds and lives. You also get a lot of experience with working with all sorts of people and learning to follow directions and working with numbers.
good,"I enjoyed my time there and the co workers were nice. The new Store Manager was extremely disrespectful to the team, and a number of employees left due to it."
good,It was ok working there not fun not  boring   The management OK didn’t have any problems with the other employees very clean environment very well-managed
good,Fun place at times.  Compensation is not desired if you been been there a long time.  New employees will get paid almost what veteran team members get paid.  New increase pay is only given to anyone below minimum.
good,Coworkers were alright but management would cut hours and cut down on employees while we were understaffed which left the leftover workers stressed out.
good,"Hours are usually good, the lowest I've gotten so far has been 32 scheduled hrs but you can cover shifts if you want. The people are nice and easy to work with. Most of the management staff is nice, some only talk when they'er telling you what to do. I only have two complaints from working there. 1. It's always hot in there, if your just walking around the store shopping then you should be fine, but if you have to move at any kind of fast passe you're sweating within you'r first 30 min. on shift. 75 degrees no matter what. I've even heard a few guests complaining about the heat and seen it on some of the review sites. 2. Some of the area's are never fully staffed but they still expect all the work to get done and then act disappointed when its not. But if you don't have open availability the hiring staff wont hire you."
good,"worked together as a team and kept the flow of work to the highest standard. fun atmosphere and made sure that we reached our daily goal every night  ,,"
good,"Very fast paced enviornment with shifting goals daily depending upon store needs and product arriving at the distribution team. Culture of accountability and worked with many great leaders, peers, and my direct reports."
good,It was a very great work environment. Motivated and driven leaders. Guidance is impeccable. Safety is key and very much so instilled in everyday work place.
good,"You have to be able to move quickly and multitask all day long for minimum wage.The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers, but the coworkers are nice."
good,"I really enjoy working for Target/Starbuck. I enjoy the work and the people I worked with, but the compensation for the amount of work does not balance."
good,I didn't get more than 15 hours a week and that was if I was lucky. I tried to work with them so I could continue working there during college and they would not help.
good,"The job was easy, lots of room to work in different areas. "
good,Pretty good way to start your career if you are interested in customer service or HR/PR. Also good if you just want to earn some extra money to spend. Pretty competitive between employees
good,"Nothing you wouldn't expect form working retail/customer service. The hours are flexible, the work is pretty simple, the people are nice and you'll learn a lot of basic work skills. It's a pretty fast pace environment and it involves a surprising amount of quick thinking. Good place to work if you're in between jobs."
good,Straight forward job the only bad part was I had to be in at 4 am and only got 4 hours of work but was asked to sty most of the time after shirt was over.
good,"The job is very fast paced and stressful, at least in my location. The beginning pay nowadays is $12 an hour, I believe. Which is good for someone who does not have to pay for their own cost of living."
good,Lots of employee party's. Fun place to work if you are a teenager. Great compensation for the role. Easy place to work but the managers are a little up tight. Overall a good experience.
good,"It depends on what department you are in, but my manager was just awful. They were rude, worked me more than I asked for while I am in school, and they refused to handle conflict within my area involving lazy workers. I only stayed as long as I did for the pay."
good,Target would not work with me when I was in school so I had to leave the pay was ok the hours changed i think they should give you my hours for all the work you do
good,quick paced always busy very productive workplace i always had fun but stayed busy i learned a lot work with very happy and energetic people team work is very important
good,"Target's retail pharmacy was the best working environment that I have experienced as a retail pharmacist/pharmacy manager. "
good,"Although we didn’t make much, our team leaders were extremely caring and awesome at understanding. The store manager at the time was the best lady for the job. They appreciated the hard work and it was known."
good,"Great job with very flexible hours allowing school or another job, biggest issue is (depending on stores) the managers have favoritism or childish. managers do rotate around. not all have professional/work experience only a  college degree. moving up can be difficult unless a manager or supervisor help/push you through."
good,Target does not play games. If you are slow at learning a job they will tell you in a heartbeat that you are wasting time and they will let you go. You need to be responsible and stay on task no matter what
good,I have been able to develop and learn in order to move with the company. I have been able to develop the life I wanted with the help of the team there.
good,"The store was always enjoyable to work with and the guests who shopped there was a joy to serve as well. As a frontend supervisor, I had seen it all. Thankfully, the staff and management were on their game when it came to making sure the store was tidy and well kept for all guests."
good,very fast passed working environment. breaks were a little short. team members were helpful and informative to new team members. managers assist with work if you did not understand.
good,"Target as store is a great place with great deals and you always find something that you need or dont need. as an employer, not so much. The Target I worked at never wanted to work with or around me and my school schedual, the manager didnt run the store the way it couldve been run, when talking to team leads they acted bored as if me getting more hours and better pay was boring and wasting their time, ect. I love target as a store and what they have to offer, but not as an employer."
good,Target is an okay place to work. It isn’t easy if you need a full income. If you are just needing part tile work and don’t need a lot of money it is a good place to work. Also if you can have flexibility.
good,My day is usually kept busy with assignments and making sure we make our daily and weekly goals. I'm in charge of all the cashiers and guest services.
good,Its hot when its hot and cold when its cold but the job itself is not bad. The money makes it worth it. They are big on safety and following their standard of work
good,"Must be willing to work hard and be a team player, ability to work with little supervision is a plus and will help you climb the ladder. Willingness to work alongside reports will allow for great buy in and overall success. Development and coaching of team members is key."
good,Fun work environment depending on how your coworkers are fairly fast paced as you are required to always remain busy. However at times the expectations were set too high making goals difficult to reach as it felt there was a slight disconnect between management and front end staff. But overall understanding on an individual basis.
good,Loved working here. Very friendly environment. There are many different job opportunities throughout the store if you are willing to be a dedicated employee.
good,Great place to learn and how to manage. Opportunity for growth is there if you are willing to put in the time. Working long hours during the Holidays made the job difficult
good,"The pay was horrible but, I loved working there. Wish I didn't have to leave there. It was a great place to be esp during the remodel. fun people. so glad I never had to learn the register."
good,Good place to work to earn some extra cash on the side. Great part-time job perfect for college and high school students just starting off in the job field. Teaches leadership and customer service skills.
good,"If you are a good hard working and you are able to work as a team then the job would come easy to you, It does have its flaws like most jobs but its an okay job to work at but wouldn't make it my life career."
good,"I got a ton of hours and they pay was really nice, but they slowly started screwing over everybody I worked with. Most of my co-workers had to get two jobs to survive because they were giving all of us like five to seven hours a week."
good,Nice place to work. I helped open a new store so I didnt get enough hours but it was nice. I wasnt able to get the schedule I wanted just yet before I left. They were a little intense about uniform also. Nice people to work with
good,It requires a lot of late nights and early mornings. Pay is well. It takes a very physical toll on you a lot of lifting and moving things around. Its also a very tedious job.
good,"A good first job. Simple training program that was easy to understand. Managers were kind and helpful. Cashier work was fast paced and took a little getting used to, but good overall."
good,"Job advancement at Target is great. It takes a lot of hard work and dedication to get there. Be prepared to go through a lot of changes in positions, management, and a whole lot of merchandise movement."
good,"Overall I have learned a lot from working there.  Room for advancement is difficult, even with extended and exceeding work experience.  Communication can be lacking at times with superiors and that can be frustrating.  The work expectations are not extremely out of the ordinary, but unrealistic goals are sometimes expected.  There is continuous training, which is great.  It assures that even if you do not promote within Target, that training will be beneficial at other employment ventures."
good,The work was honest and rewarding for the first store I worked at.  The second store was unsafe and chaotic.  Your experience will vary from store to store.  Any advice I give could be utterly irrelevant to your particular situation.
good,"It is an ok job, i would recommend it to be a ""forever"" but a stepping stone to a better career. Must be able to multi task and help out guest as you are working."
good,"no prbolems working there staff was good and manaement was beter. not a big fan of the 15 lunch breaks.  morning and afternoon shifts are easy, nobody is there"
good,"Target was a great job for me while in college, they worked with my school hours and they always treated their employees with respect. "
good,"Target was really overall a great place to work. Some of the upper management in the store were not so great, but the company itself was wonderful. They paid well and as a team leader I had every other weekend off and alternated opening with closing on the weekends I did work."
good,"lunch area was very peaceful and quiet working at the store , customers didnt give much hassle for anything and it was just chill to work at target its a good place to start for anyone needing new work experience."
good,It’s  a good place to work at to be honest just you butt heads with management at times and sometimes they get too comfortable scheduling work hours..
good,"It was a good cashier job, I didn't care for promoting the redcard but it was still okay. It was very repetitive. I liked the people I worked with and there were alot of people who became familiar faces. There were also some guys who came into my lane and asked me for my number or would give me theirs. I was married so I definitely wasn't looking for that kind of attention. Just funny. Oh I also didn't like how I couldn't have a set schedule. That was really annoying."
good,"For the most part its a decent place to work at, depending on what position your in it can be better or worse. Considering its retail, you deal with common things any other retail environment has to deal with like customer service. If you like people then its a good place to work in, and it pays well with annual raises so that's nice. All the positions are simple and pretty easy so realistically you dont need much experience to do them successfully."
good,"I have been enjoying the time I have been a Target team member. The only negatives are the hours. The schedule will say your are working a certain amount of time but there are night where there will be no trucks or no work. The people are awesome, love the customers, the past is even decent."
good,Target was a decent company to work for. My reasons for leaving were mainly personal ones with the management team I was under but the company overall was good to work with.
good,"It’s an okay work experience, great first job but something forever. I want to expand and grow more outside of target because a promotion in that store is close to impossible"
good,"Nice places to start your career, they have a lot to teach you, and you can move fast depending on the store director. Make sure to build a good relationship with all executives"
good,"long day, short breaks, sometimes fun to work there. the hardest part of the job was having to stay positive even when guests were yelling at you. the most enjoyable part of the job was making friends which made the long shifts go by much faster."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my position and daily responsibilities. I also believed in Target's Mission."
good,Fun place to work with lots of employee activities. Very fast paced and must be able to keep up. Very hard to move up within the store. Customer service
good,"Typically the work day was fairly monotonous; expect to be stocking inventory for the majority of the day and helping customers. It wasn't for me in the long run, unfortunately."
good,Its a well sought after job & they do a lot for you as an employee as far as bennifets ect.. however there is a lack of manager / employee trust & this seems to sometimes create a tence work environment.
good,"The job is actually really easy, just fast paced. The biggest problem with working here, was the hours (14 hours a week)and some of the managers. For example i had one manager that was always helping out when someone was behind. Great manager. My other manager wouldnt lift a finger, would tell you to take your back stock back or whatever and then go walk away. She would then cop an attitude if you didnt get 6 pallets done in an hour and a half. it was ridiculous. She had no idea what it actually took to get the job done or how long it took to put away everything while sorting through stuff that isnt in your area....The pay was nice and like i said, it was an easy job."
good,"It is an ok place to work, if you just need to supplement your income. But if its a job that you have as a fulltime, I don't think is it really supportive with promoting within at an timely rate."
good,Most of the time I do not have all the equipment I need to accomplish my job. I learned how to work around problems to still finish my tasks properly.
good,"Unloading trucks, stocking product onto shelves before the store opens. I learned to work as a team or one unit to meet store goals. Management was great and it really wasn't a hard part to the job."
good,"Starts early, very fast paced and physically demanding. Learned to be flexible and manage change. Mentored and developed large staff with high turnover."
good,"I enjoyed working there. People are friendly and helpful, everyone there seemed to genuinely want to be there. There is some unavoidable issues if you get sick or need leave of absence but I think that's common at any job."
good,"When I worked at target it was my very first job, it was easy to do and I liked working there. However, I had a team lead that was out to get me. Would make my life there horrible for no reason. Talked to multiple managers about what was happening to me and for 6 months nothing was done about the situation until I just had to quit just to get my sanity back."
good,"Target is a good place to work...if you like to work.  If you're there only to get a paycheck, try elsewhere.  I have found the atmosphere to be very team oriented and if you keep that mindset, this is a great place to work."
good,They strongly incourage you to talk to all guests. And keep you on your toes with the busy days and seasons. Reprimands could be better handled and be kept confidential a bit more. But an overall fun place to work when everything calms down in the off seasons
good,Working at Target overnight was really fun and laid back at times. Most of all the team members that worked with me were awesome. Every year around June there is a Target appreciation day at Great America.
good,"Good managers some days bad managers other days, some that did not quite know the situation of the backroom where I worked. Good hours, good money, if it weren’t for the less then stellar half management I would’ve enjoyed my time there much more."
good,"I loved working for target. Unfortunately, there is not a lot of room for growth. Compensation is not that great either. You can pick up as many hours as you can when you are cross-trained in multiple departments, with out exceeding over time."
good,"Be willing to work mulitiple different areas. If you have a flexible schedule you will fit right in. It is retail, so its throuw you in the fire type of work. Be willing to be proactive."
good,If you're in packing the expect you be 50% or higher by your second week. And I got let go at 40%. Some people are faster then others. So if you like to work fast and got it down you will be a good .candidate
good,"You really don't have a set typical day at work."
good,"I worked at Target as a GSTL for several months when I first relocated and was looking for a job more in line with my career field. I enjoyed my time there more than I anticipated- my coworkers were for the most part fun and easy to get along with, management seemed perfectly fair, expectations were made clear, and the time flew by as there was always something to do and something happening. "
good,"I'ts fun to work there, but not much room to grow. In general people and management are nice and friendly. Flexibility in working hours is a plus. Will start with minimum pay."
good,"Manage a shift of hourly warehouse workers to meet daily production and throughput goals. In charge of staffing, performance management, and department specific tasks."
good,"short term goal , not a bad place to start. Not much to do as far as career but definitely have a income coming in. It help to build you to deal with customers that is always a plus."
good,"My coworkers and managers were always positive and enjoyable to work with, it just got stressful when we were busy. Most interactions with customers were great, only had minor issues every once in a while."
good,A typical day at work in the clothing department is pretty fast paced. It's never too stressful but for new people it may seem like a bit much. The management is very nice and kind hearted. They are also very understanding when it comes to adjusting hours for any reason. They also offer tons of hours when they have extra hours available. The only downside is due to the fact that there are so many employees it's very rare to get exactly 40hrs a week. Aside from that everyone does get a decent check. I love the fact that everyone is so positive and works as a team.
good,I enjoyed working there nice coworker nothing was hard about the job management is nice I enjoyed having face to face with everyone it was a nice pace at target.
good,"Working at Target was a new experience for me, it opened my eyes to a different type of work, I made plenty of friends and really enjoyed the atmosphere as a whole."
good,"They are very understanding employers, and the pay is competitive. It starts at 11 dollars an hours and time and a half for holidays. I got extremely ill soon after starting, and they were very kind about the whole situation, as well as with dealing with me being a full-time student."
good,"Working as a hardline team member, every day I would check my schedule to see who I worked with and was rarely disappointed because I knew that all my coworkers were there to work but have a good time. When you're zoning your aisle you can have conversations with your teammate and learn about them. Guests were pretty understanding so long as you treated them with the same respect, and it wasn't hard to go the extra mile because the tools you had made it very easy to do so. Managers are pretty lax but so long as you put the guest first and complete your job on time."
good,"Working here came with it's pros and cons. I was disappointed in the training that I received initially. I was left confused as I had never worked in retail before. Working here meant that you had to take initiative if you wanted to further yourself. That was my own personal mistake. The management at this store overall wasn't awful but there will always be room for improvement. "
good,Target is a great company to work for. They offer great opportunities to further your career with them. All managers and district managers are sweet and understanding people. They are also very professional and like to compete. All stores are well put together and the employees are fun and friendly people.
good,"a typical work involves working is working multiple jobs throughout the store, while working there you will learn many areas of operation. Management expects task to be completed at an appropriate rate. Coworkers are easy to get along with for the most part."
good,"From what i can remember from working there I did enjoy it. The day would start out with knowing what part of the store you were incharge of, the manager of the would step in and help areas if the needed it."
good,I could not find opportunity to grow/ switch areas and hence i moved out of Target. It was also a slow paced organization where things had to follow lots of red-tapism before they got approved.
good,"just worked on the sales floor stocking items and keeping the area I worked in neat and clean, I would clean up spills sometimes, the managers were nice , there was really no hard part about the job"
good,Target is a fun place to work.  It pays pretty well compared to many similar jobs in the area.  People are friendly and easy to get along with.  I would recommend this job.
good,ALl co workers are extremely fun and nice and are willing to share a work load. As long as you show you love to work by staying on time and never missing a day they will reward you exponentially
good,Have great guest service skills and good team work. The hardest part at work would be when working alone on most days and having to stay later then expected.
good,I much enjoyed my time at target and wish  I could have stayed but I was a seasonal employee and they did not have enough room on the roster to keep me.
good,I enjoyed time with my coworkers. All were very friendly and helpful. Team effort was really a big thing along with the sales of red cards. They push red cards very much which aren't always super easy to get. Overall a good job.
good,"Working during the holidays is stressful as is, not to mention being new to the job to begin with. You have to learn to be fast and of course service with a smile."
good,fast-paced workplace and good co-workers make the time go by quickly and if the team leads and the LOD are cool then it should be a breeze. Good experience
good,"Target was a fun job, at the time I worked for them and the pay was OK for a young adult or for supplemental income; but, it's not a career. I meet a lot of great people during my time there. No real complaints."
good,"i wouldnt recommend for a single parent  trying to make it on there own. but i loved what i did in the advancement i have had working there. but all managers i was working with is communication was bad. but there were alot of joy in love on there job, we all knew that customers was number one priority.but you had to knew all the departments to get hours."
good,"Working at Target was very fun although at times (holidays) it can get very stressful. Managers are cool and work with you. I am in college and they schedule me around my classes, which I really appreciate."
good,"The over night flow team is very fast paced .  The team was friendly and easy to work with.  The hours were rough at first 4:30 am - 1 pm."
good,The work was fast paced and always kept you on your toes. I was tasked with unloading incoming trucks as efficiently and safely as possible. As well I was responsible for labeling incoming items quickly and accurately.
good,"Target is a good first job. I think it has its days; good, bad, and in between. Management will help if you need it. The only part about the job is coming in to close and there is a bunch of re-shop to put away if the person before you didn't complete it."
good,Scan merchandise and accept cash or credit cards for payments. Enjoyed the interaction with the customers. Being introduced to new merchandise was exciting.
good,worked here for 4 years throughout college. great to have as a part time gig. very accommodating with class schedule and scheduling around availability.
good,"When I was recruited for Target, I pictured going to a place of moderate prices and decent quality fixed products that people were coming inn to happily buy as is. I had no idea of how fast pace and bizarre the retail environment could be. The team was good and the training was thorough but I just wasn't as prepared as I thought to work so many various hours and shifts. The job was quite challenging and I have the utmost respect to the long term management that is often in place. Those people are incredible. The opportunity for growth is there for those that are prepared to face the rigors of working retail."
good,"worked 8 to 9 hour shifts, two breaks and a 30min lunch break, always worked at a very fast paste, i learned a lot specfically in costumer service, and how to manage time and organization as well as team work. management was very flexible and showed there appreciaction toward the workers."
good,"Target was a good job, a typical day consisted of going to clock in and then heading to guest service to see what register the GSA wanted me on. I learned how to handle money, and manage myself when a guest wasn't being the nicest. I hardly ever say my STL. I saw more of the LOD's than anything else. The job wasn't really all that hard. The most enjoyable part was being able to talk to all the guests that came through my lane. To talk about how they're day was going was something that always makes me smile."
good,"Target has a wonderful training program, a decent starting wage, and from my experience, the supervisors seem to work with your schedule and life events."
good,Working at target was more than a retail job. You had to get into the minds of the consumer and really try hard to make a sale and provide the guests with great service.
good,"Target is a pretty decent place to work at. Its not a very exciting job but it is a good one if you are used to a routine get in/get out type of job. Hours are flexible, which is a plus and also management will work with you if complications arise that may cause you to miss work."
good,"I worked on stock so I made sure shelves were stocked at the time the store was open. I learned to always watch for details when stocking. The hardest part was the unloading, but after that it was fun."
good,Target was a company focused on delivering the best retail experience for the customer. Target ran a lean operation which at times left it difficult to complete daily tasks
good,"Some days are busier than other and more stressful than others, but still a great work environment. Also everyone is easy to get a long with and they are very welcoming."
good,There were a lot of options as to which area you work in and promotion potential is possible if you have drive. The benefits kick in when you are over a minimum weekly hours and they're great.
good,"A lot of fast pace walking from floor to floor helping the guest. I learn to work in different department to stay flexible. I think the management could be a little stronger meaning I feel most don,t know the business as much as the team members. I love the culture of the store the fast fun friendly atmosphere. Everyday is hard but after my shift I feel like I have accomplished so much and it feels great. I feel the guest are the most enjoyable part of my day because they’re so happy when you give them great customers service like pulling something from the stockroom or just directing them to a product they’re looking for."
good,"Fast moving culture, exciting and challenging.  Excellent support and resources.  Good technology and many opportunities for expanding knowledge and building a resume"
good,With my time at Target i became comfortable very quickly as my superiors were straight forward but very understanding.I enjoyed the work i did in Logistics as it always kept me on my toes and i enjoy a fast paced job.
good,I worked there in high school and did not take it seriously at all so I don't have any complaints. It did seem like a good part time job for a student.
good,Learned how to be more patient and put on a smile on your face no matter what when dealing with guests. It's a minimum wage job but team members makes it less like it. Team members help each other automatically without being told to.
good,Target took very good care of their employees. Not only did they have a stable work environment but they also used to have votes for best workers and most impressive workers of the year.
good,"If you aren't management then this isn't a great place to work.  Management gets paid, peons do not.  Its a friendly culture but at times feels a bit clicky and more like highschool and not a business."
good,"Target is not the worst place I've worked, but pushing a charge card on customers is not a good thing. I, as well as many of my coworkers, am uncomfortable with pushing ANOTHER card onto consumers (no matter how okay the discounts are)."
good,Management was not consistent. Rules were bent to make sure company goals where met. There was not unity in the culture each department viewed themselves as separate.
good,"For someone currently attending college, it was a very fit summer job that was worth my time. I could complain about the hours, but I chose to work the graveyard shift so that was my own decision and I have no one else to blame. Coworkers were very nice and fun to work with, the job got stressful on busy days with a lot of merchandise to get onto the floor, but that's just the way things go."
good,Easy work good place to work I recommend to work a target if they company care about the employees skill time and dedication when they do the job I like to work there
good,"The hours assigned were not consistent. There were some days that I worked from 6am to 2:30pm, then the next day I worked from 4pm till close, which made sleeping difficult and it was also difficult to schedule time off for doctors appointments."
good,"blah blah blah blah blah tap tap"
good,Everyday was a new experience. You got to interact with different types of people. Some you would get to know and it was nice for some to ask your opinion and valued your suggestions.
good,"Great company culture in a fast-paced environment, if this is what you prefer in a company then I recommend you work there. There are many opportunities to advance in the company and offered benefits are great, it shows the company takes care of employees."
good,"Learned self-sufficient skills, team leads could be better, management could be better.. Pretty much exploit us since Target isn't a union job. Competitive hours. Fun with other team members and team building is pretty good. Training could be more clear to what our job actually entails"
good,"Everyone is very friendly and will gladly help with any questions you may have. If a guest is looking for something, it's easy to ask over an intercom to help find what they may be looking for."
good,"It was nice being able to constantly have headphones in while at work, but this didn't quite counterbalance the awful management choices. They hired me as a cashier and ended up forcing me to work in the back room which was a lot different than what I expected. It was a little bit too repetitive for me, just scanning things over and over and finding a spot to pick them. None of the workers are social to each other, even on breaks. Getting to assist customers was my favorite part of the job and I wish it had been more customer service oriented."
good,Hours vary from week-to-week depending on seasonal requirements. 
good,"I only worked at Target over the holiday season, unloading trucks and stocking shelves in the morning. I enjoyed the work, and wish I could've stayed, but unfortunately, they didn't have the hours. I've also heard that that's a fairly common complaint there."
good,"a typical day is helping guest "
good,Worked overnight stocking shelves.  Met a lot of people of varied night time work.  It was somewhat more laid back without customers in the store at the same time.
good,Started out as a very good place to work. My store went down hill and the company direction has turned much more toward fashion and trying to impress people rather than focusing on team engagement. Work life balance took a dramatic shift for management. Certain stores don't have proper accountability standards.
good,"job was slow paced in my department of sales and it didnt really pick up much unless it was the holiday season time of the year , other than , you just have to stock and report to your supervisor"
good,"A typical day, or night, began with the unloading of the truck, followed by working the fright onto the sales floor. In the backroom, associates organized merchandised and stocked items that did not make it out onto the floor."
good,I enjoyed working At Target because of the people that I worked with. I enjoy helping out people no matter what the job. The consumable work was easy to do with little training. Learning the location of the product enough to be able to tell guests the location of product was a challenge.
good,"Target was a fun place to work, definitely more suited for younger colleagues. The most enjoyable part of the job was the work events, and discounts. Target was a good job"
good,"It depends on how many trucks are scheduled to come in."
good,"This is a great job to have. It was one of my first jobs, love the people there and the people who come in. With the job i have i get to meet so many different people, and they get to know me."
good,"I worked here so many years ago, that its hard for me to give some type of accurate review.   The people were friendly, and accomodated my school schedule."
good,the work day was at times fast pace enjoyable staff customers were great to get to know learned the process of opening a new store that was a good experience.
good,"A typical day at wok involved: "
good,I loved working for target. I was a cashier. I was hired for the holiday rush. I loved working with people. I got a lot of complements from the guests. Sometimes they would tip me or bought me a pop. I miss working for Target
good,"I started working at Target in October of 2017. I was hired on as a part time employee. The job was very fun and provided a good amount of hours due to peak season. Once the season was over and all of the seasonal employees left, the management insisted on telling me they ""thought"" they hired me on as a seasonal employee and I didn't have the training I needed to do the full job. Then they said they didn't have time to train me so either I quit or I get fired. So I quit and started a new job search."
good,Target was a great opportunity for me to get the hands on experience with cash and the customer service. I wanted more and to move up with the company and get more hands on. For someone who is going to school or just got out of HS its a good place to start.
good,"overall its a good company to work for. I enjoy being around my coworkers, it's fast-paced, management is nice, fun environment, great work life balance"
good,"I worked at target for 6 months and now I am looking for a new job where I can work full time, i liked and i was always  a good worker, unfortunately  they don't have a position  for me at this moment."
good,customer service is top priority
good,Was to serve my customers and provide help when they needed it. Prepared the food and made sure the work area was neat and clean. Management seemed fair and the hardest part of the job was to keep busy.
good,"I was only seasonal but I vastly preferred this to the other roles I've been in. Competitive pay (at least for cashiers) although the managers at my location were a little.....cut throat. Great with customers, though."
good,Target with a safe place to work at a lot of open opportunities to learn new things meet new people work with a lot of customers and you learn something new everyday
good,working here was interesting. many people coming and going so the work environment was constantly changing. all in all it was a good place to work while in school
good,"Nice place to work, flexible hours and schedules.  Fast paced at times with lulls in between - it's retail.  Store is clean and customers are generally pleasant."
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Target, I had a lot of fun and worked with some really great people. The only reason I decided to leave was eventually they brought in a new manager who wasn't the best and it started to go down hill from there. But before that happened everyone was happy to be there, it was just a good environment to be in for the time being. Eventually, the customer service aspect of it got tiring and sometimes the scheduling hours wouldn't make sense but that's retail and it eventually wears you down. Highly recommend for someone who want to build on their resume due to the many different jobs Target can provide while working there."
good,"A typical day of work varied by department and guest needs.  Retail business operation serving community needs, management changed frequently.  The workplace culture was fast paced and collaborative.  The hardest part of the job was getting enough hours while operating within an organization that most employees are part-time function.  The most enjoyable part of the job was customer service and working with others to present company brand in a manner that drove sales."
good,IT was great experience working for target because they would help you if you needed anything or if you were struggling with a task. It was a very helpful environment even though they do expect a lot from you through your day to day work schedule.
good,for your standard part time job. its pretty good. they do promote managers to certain departments that have no idea what they are doing. but other than that its a good place to work
good,"Great place to work for, a culture of companionship. Management is always willing to help out, when asked. No retaliation, constructive criticism is always well taken."
good,Learned how to sort through packages off an assembly line from unloading a truck.  Learned how where items are located in the store and how to distribute these items to the correct location.
good,Work was great. Job was fast pacing job and required a lot of things to remember. Once you learn things as times goes by it starts to become more easier for you.
good,Target is a good place to advance skills such as eye contact problem solving and team work. The environment can change quickly depending on the attitude one puts into their work.
good,"The rating scale for Performance Planning and Review is made up of five factors: Poor, Needs Improvement, Meets Requirements, Exceeds Requirements, and Outstanding. Any factor rated poor or needs improvement MUST have performance comments. For any factor, performance comments should support the rating given."
good,work was exciting as my day was never the same working in loss prevention. the team I worked with made my job and time within target very enjoyable. management was excellent as they helped me grow in my own role and how to be a leader.
good,I would consider Target a place of employment as a stepping stone to boosting your Career to something greater. It was a place were you could gain a lot of experience and learn more about yourself. If you love working with people it's a good place to work. They can be very dependant on you to do everything.
good,"Overall target is a great company to work for, but they offer very little advances in career growth. My store was run by great manners so everyone got alone nicely. Nice Break room area, big space in my store, but the discount isn't all that great"
good,A typical day at work is fast pace and challenging. I learned how to compromise with guests and work proficiently. Culture was friendly but professional. The hardest part of the job was making sales and at times I felt under trained. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with people who had a passion for what they were doing.
good,"I enjoyed getting to know my coworkers as well as the customers. Target does really well in making sure their employees are satisfied, by having special days that encourage their employees to try their best to receive rewards."
good,Place is food to work . Have to be able to lift over 59 pounds so you must be in decent physical shape but overall good place to work I would recommend
good,"I didn't mind working for Target, however it was really tough to be there at 4 a.m. since I worked the flow team shift. We unloaded the delivery trucks and stocked the merchandise. I enjoyed the employees that I worked with, however there was no paid time off or benefits since we were part time employees. There were no set shifts, since our shift depended on how long it took us to put all of the merchandise out on the floor."
good,"It was a good job for someone with no work experience, the staff and co workers were helpful on time with breaks and lunches. clean environment to work in."
good,I like working for them and it was fun. They where cutting hours and it was hard to maintain a steady pay check but overall experience with the employees was very pleasant.
good,"By far, the best job I've ever had. An amazing workplace with friendly coworkers and clientele. Always something new to learn and a lot of opportunity to move upwards. Management team always encouraging and giving recognition to their employees."
good,In undergoing some changes hopefully to make this an A1 place to work.  It is trying at times because you have some people who don't want to carry their load but overall it is an ok place to work.
good,This job would work for college students looking for a flexible schedule. They have good communication when your concerned about your hours or a day you may need off. There are so many people as well as so many cross trained people. This comes in handy when you need someone to cover your shift or you swap.
good,"Good pay. The managers at this location were reasonable, gave you hours if you needed, and very understanding. All and all the manager were good. God bless."
good,"Target was a great place to work in the beginning.  It is a fast-paced environment, and is centered around sales. As a cashier, I worked with customers checking their groceries. Management is constantly under pressure to sell.  The hardest part of the job is keeping up sales quotas."
good,"Dependent on how hard a worker you are will determine how you feel about the job. If you pick up on things quickly and are good they tend to call for you more when they need help, which can be either good or bad."
good,"Push products to sales floor, backstock excess products, recieve shipment. I also learned how to manage the cash register while providing excellent customer service"
good,Good co workers who provided good friendly customer service.. Good communication with staff and management.. Made sure customers and staff were save..
good,"Good place to work.  It provided me with hours, friends, insurance for me and my boyfriend, management opportunities and so on.  There was a great break room and office area so that you can eat lunch and take breaks behind scenes.  I would work there again."
good,"1) a typical at work was a typically a good"
good,"The people working there were great and made the day go by fast. Customers, on the other hand, were a little more difficult. Pay was great for the job."
good,"Fun place to work, very nice people. I was a seasonal worker and when the season ended the just deleted my account and stoped scheduling, instead of giving me a notice.  That has left me a little sour toward the company as a whole.  Workmates are incredibly friendly and helpful though."
good,This was my first job and I enjoyed it but some of the managers over me really sucked and wouldn't let me do my job for unknown reasons. Overall a decent place to work.
good,"Target usually highers younger kids and gives them the first job experience. Personally I really liked the managers I had, they always listened to me when I asked if I could be trained in a new area of the store. The only downfall to this job is the Redcards. After working at Target you tend to loath that word. The quota they have for Redcards is reachable, but only if you bully the guest into signing up for it or only explain the 'good parts'. Managers would give us 'the talk' if we weren't asking every guest about a Redcard, and if you didn't reach your personal quota for Redcards you could be written up. Hours were a little biased when it came to the schedule, the people who always got Redcards tended to get more work days even when schedules were being cut. If you work at Guest Service, be prepared for the crazies with wild stories about the items they're returning.... even though they were clearly stolen."
good,nice work place. nothing bad to say about management. have to be on time in your shift if not you can easily loose your job other than that is a good place to work
good,"This was my first job. It was a good first job. Learned a lot about customer service and work ethic. I started as a cashier. Within a year, I started at their Customer Service Desk. A few months after that, I was promoted to Cashier Supervisor."
good,Constantly on your toes moving around. Even on a slow day there are plenty of other tasks to complete. The members are a blast to work with and make the time go by fast. Only downside are those red cards that they pressure you into selling.
good,"- Fun people to work with "
good,"Leading a team of 20+ with respect, compliance, example, integrity, etc."
good,Target is a very nice place to work the people and co workers are very nice whwn working at target you get to meet a lot of people which is a great benefit and also working at target you learn things you might have not known out of work really loved the job hope to work in retail again
good,Target is a fun yet stressful place to work. Some days you feel over worked and others you feel there is nothing to do but the people you work with make all the difference there.
good,"A typical day at work was pretty chill, being on your feet all day but always staying busy. Ive learned a lot about retail and working together as a team."
good,Whilst the company was lovely to be a part of. I can definitely say that the environment is not something to consider long term. Why? It tends to be quite dull and demeaning after a period of time.
good,"This was probably one of the easiest jobs I've had (excluding the busy times during the holiday season of course). Found it quite easy to accomplish my duties in a timely manner. However, left due to co-workers treating others like garbage."
good,"everybody worked together to get the jobs done"
good,"I liked this job, there were many benefits. On the other hand, I feel like the store was so big that I didn't have a chance to meet any of the other employees"
good,Fair employer.  I enjoyed my time with Target.  Good Retailer.  Nice culture.  Hands-on leadership style.  Competitive marketplace.  Quick to move and cease opportunities.
good,People there are great. you do have to deal with some crazy customers but that's a given with retail. Fairly well compensated but they do not give out good hours.
good,"I loved working at Target. If you work the cafe as well as cashier, you get paid a little it more per hour. The hardest part of this job was having to meet the red card quota."
good,"I had been with Target for over 30 years when they sent my entire department function to India.  They were not very good about helping to find a replacement position for those of us who were of a certain age.  Up until the most recent times, I would  have said Target was a great place to work, but in recent times they seem to care less about their employees and more about their image to the public and to the bottom dollar.  But, that is corporate life!  People I met and worked with were great.  I feel like I was given the opportunity to learn a lot and experience a lot while working there. Pay and benefits were great."
good,Been a while really can't remember how it was I was in doing security the second go round I worked there in high school to and it was pretty much on you feet all day the most I can rememeber
good,Fast paced good environment. you are able to request time off if needed and they are flexible with hours. As long as you are a hard worker and do what is asked it is a good place to work
good,"I was a seasonal employee, so I was not retained after the holiday season. However, the management was fair and worked with employees to arrange flexible work hours. The pay was adequate for the work required. Discounts were only applied with cash purchases, or with application for the company loyalty cards (debit or credit)."
good,"All depends on the person and how they fit in a job. If retail is your thing then Target is a great fit! Guest servicing, stocking, and makeing sure your area of the store is in top shape are very important things, so making sure you are doing what you need to be doing will keep you in a good spot and you should be fine in the company"
good,"Target itself is clean and friendly some management can be rude that’s only some but working there is easy well working as cashier,you are on"
good,Not a bad place to work. Fun environment but there is a lot of favoritism. After the holidays they hours are cut drastically.  You couldn't talk to the mangers about any issues because things never were fixed.
good,"The management are friendly and respectful and appreciative"
good,"I have learn a lot from the people you meet at Target. I got to know my customers very well because they find you in the process for you to help them,"
good,es una buena compañia pero no dan oportunidad de tratar de quedarce mas tiempo con la empresa
good,"Unload the truck and put away the stock. It is easy, and you work with good, relaxed people. Consistent weekly schedules and roughly 4 hours per truck."
good,"Would not recommend anyone sticking around at Target for more than 3-5 years. It can be an interesting place to work, but the leadership seems to be taking a swan dive."
good,The store manager was not very involved in the employees. Other managers were left to problem solve on their own without much collaboration from him. Did not usually come work with employees.
good,If you want a seasonal job that is fast paced and very busy from start to finish i would recommend this job! Everyone is very friendly including management
good,good people. managers are helpful when not super busy. holidays can be difficult. discounts are not that great. work informant is good for the most part.
good,Great place to work Not a great place for a career. Management could use some polishing but there intentions are good. Overall benefits and pay is better than most jobs in the area.
good,"i worked at target for one year ,i was looking for a full time job. but after a couple months they changed the overnights to pt and i needed full time"
good,"If you are hired seasonal, the company will let you go without warning. Other than that, it's perfectly fine."
good,"Honestly the best place I have worked. Loved the people the environment, the managers. Nice break room with lunch normally laid out for employees to enjoy."
good,Job was great on fast-paced days/times. Coworkers work as a TEAM and never offer attitude. Managers are always available to talk to . This is by far one of my favorite past jobs.
good,"You can tell that Target cares a great deal about the students and employees. They offer many paid pieces of training that teach you to become a better educator. In addition, they offer many resources for students whether they are a top student or a student who is struggling in a class. t"
good,"Fellow team members are great to work with, work is fast paced, direct team lead is fun to work for.  Overall work experience is fun.  The management that is hired is entirely too young for the positions that they are entrusted with."
good,"Spending the majority of your time restocking and walking around the store has its perks but in the end it becomes repetitive and boring. Good place to have as first job though, I guess."
good,"Working at Target has been fun but im looking for something with longer hours. Things I enjoyed about Target were the employees I worked with, the caring atmosphere, the free food in the break room, and I appreciated how most managers were relaxed while on the Job, yet professional."
good,"With this being my first job, I was a nerd due to the work world and had taught me the very valuable experience of working for a wage yourself and showed me the satisfaction of a job well done."
good,"Around the holidays at a customer service job there is pressure  all the time, with everything you do, and at Target, its no exception. The environment was always fast paced, even when it was slow."
good,"Having never worked in retail, I learned a lot about how Target works.  "
good,"The team members who put in the effort and who have been there for years are the only ones contributing. Management is usually lazy and fresh out of college. Target now almost exclusively hires their new executives right out of the business college program, and many lack the necessary knowledge and training on how to run a team."
good,"Temporary (seasonal) position provided some insight into the retail experience.  All team members, including management, participate in the day to day operations of the store.  The team works together to move and stock new and existing products to designated locations within the store and to provide excellent customer service to their customer base.  Available team members are expected to fill open cashier positions at times of heavy consumer traffic.  I found the workplace culture to be friendly, collaborative, and productive."
good,"Coworkers were friendly, helpful, and diverse. I learned a lot about retail and how to communicate with guests and coworkers. The hours were always consistent but flexible."
good,"excellent teamwork and communication skills between co-workers and managers, neat and clean store, fair pricing, target red card saves 5% on all purchases"
good,"Not the best HR situation "
good,Internship gives hands-on experience working in merchandising. Get to live in downtown Minneapolis with the other interns. Solid leadership and fairly simple work so you can enjoy your summer.
good,"Target was a nice place to work. During my time there, management changed over 4 times and everyone wanted something different. I loved working with the customers"
good,"If you enjoy working at a fairly quick place most of the time, this is the place. Of course there are hours where the work is slow for cashiers, but there is almost always something to do and training to be given. A few managers are so-so, majority are fairly good and show they care about the employees."
good,Feels like they take advantage of your skill sets and have you running around doing multiple jobs. They micromanage and are nit picky about protocol rather than job performance. And rarely get recognition
good,"It's as standard as it gets when it comes to retail. You deal with poopy customers, they ask for your manager, you look like the bad guy. However, it can also be a lot of fun and I mean it's Target so not very hard."
good,target is a fine chain of store that sale a varetiy of products at a resonable price. fair starting pay for first time jobs for high school kids if intersted in
good,Working at target was very fast paced at times or really slow. Not really an in between. Always gave great customer service to guests and helped them out whenever they needed to find a certain item. Workers were very laid back and nice to each other.
good,"Guest Services"
good,"I worked logistics (truck) for years and it was wonderful. It's definitely a fast paced, strenuous job, but I never felt like it required a ton of thinking. The hours were 3am-4am til 8am, and even though the work was hard, it was easy to get into a rhythm. I actually found it relaxing most of the time. It's like being paid to work out. Just don't mistaken not needing to think a lot for not needing to work hard. You do without a doubt work extremely hard and you'll likely regularly hit your limits."
good,"I worked 3 days a week but the shifts were 7-8 hours. They give us free lunch sometimes. I applied as seasonal & said they’ll keep those who communicate well. Good place to get experience. I had none as cashier & handling cash but all it took was practice & if you need more training, they’re flexible."
good,"I worked at Target to gain In-State Tuition at my University and my manager was very flexible with my hours. It was only a summer job, however the people were very nice."
good,This company ahs alot of opportunity for growth. As long as you work hard you can move around the company but it may take a while depending on what position youre trying to get.
good,"Experiences vary by location depending upon store management and culture. Overall a good place to work. The company promotes from within and makes career advancement very easy for employees. The downside is that it creates a homogeneous culture that some in management roles may not like. If you have a good management team, a person can make an excellent career out of Target."
good,It's a nice job if ur not looking long term. You can promote within the company but it's a process everyone is super friendly and great to work with. They will gladly cross train you if you ask.
good,"Really good environment, the one I worked at everyone was friendly and I did not have many problems with the staff. The management was great. They are REALLY into convincing their customers into red cards though, kind of annoying."
good,Great place to work. Can't say I have any complaints. Managers expect a fast paced environment and making sure that the numbers are being met. Very physical.
good,"Fair work place, it has taught me that over night for me was to stressful but working together as a team taking orders and I sometimes gave orders was exciting."
good,"Target is a fun working environment. It is generally busy and every day is different. Your team has your back at all times.  Management changes frequently and can be stressful.  Discount is great and culture of company is progressive.  Hours are not always guaranteed and although pay has increased,so have expectations."
good,"Enjoyed most of the people I worked with, The only thing I did not like much was they would hire new people then cut the hours of those that had worked there and had been dedicated for years, and give them to new hires."
good,Typical day at work can be very intense based on payroll and coverage you have to be able to utilize ll of your resources as a leader.  but the team is what makes it worth to see them take ownership and be eager to learn new things made me feel good
good,"Target distribution is an interesting place to work. The people are great and the money is pretty good, however the hours are long and hard. You find yourself using your off days as re-cooperating days."
good,"Never a dull moment at Target. I enjoyed going to different departments. I really liked the cross training. Helping people in a fun, fast and friendly way!"
good,Work is pretty good until the holidays come it gets pretty busy. You learn to communicate with people around you. Overall the people who you work with are great and understanding.
good,"This is a good place to work part time. The hours can be long, but they are flexible if prior notice is given. For a younger person, Target does offer a future, if the person applies themselves and is willing to learn."
good,"The store was frequently understaffed to save costs. Consistently I was forced to do the work of 2-3 people to keep things running. Shifts were distributed poorly and often times my midshift would only be on the floor for 4-5 hours and leave before anything closed up, leaving me to close 2 sections (deli and bakery) by myself. Ridiculous. I was tormented by my managers as well. Otherwise fine."
good,"It was nice working for Target, but the issue was that there were a lot of people trying to be the boss and the one that was the boss just let it take place instead of addressing it when it was brought up."
good,"Pretty fun to work at with free things found in the break room pretty often, black out dates around thanksgiving- new years which means that you can't take those days off"
good,Steady work and fast paced. Great company to work for and very understanding. I would highly recommend anyone to work for the company. Hours are very flexible and the company will work with your availability.
good,"i enjoy working here. super professional. The leaders really care about their employees, and the whole staff is really helpful. plus the 45 min lunches are cool."
good,Making the guests a priority is of utmost importance and this is something a lot of other big brands miss. I enjoyed my one on one guest experiences. It was always a fun place to work and help people.
good,Depends on the store you work at. I was fortunate enough to work at a good store with good management and lots of team collaborations when it came to getting the job done.
good,"I believe target is a stepping stool in life to get to the point at which you really want to be at as far as success goes. It can be seen as a career path to some, but for the most part its better to use as so I ng to get you where you need to be in life."
good,I enjoyed the job. This was years ago that I worked there and I heard they will be upping their wages which is good. I can only speak for when I worked there.
good,HR was not cooperate with my full time student schedule. All other employees liked to mess around instead of work. Because I was new I felt like the other cashiers left all the work up to the new employees and just messed around.
good,This was a great place to work. The staff was awesome and the pay was decent for the job. I would have kept working here had the pay and the hours been better. Would recommend to anyone that would want a relaxed part time job.
good,The contact was split of two sites Chester & Cardiff.  The company was very flexible with time due to travel and were very helpful arranging travel and accommodation.
good,"everything had to be done fast paced, because it always seemed like more trucks were coming in faster than we could work, other than that i liked working here. Everyone was nice."
good,"not deaf friendly there. not willing to learn sign language, and the team at the workplace is very slow and the management is not doing their job to those who are slow, they don't mind attention to slow people but mind attention to people who work fast, we feel unfair."
good,"Target was a good company to work for. Only real issues were tough to move up on the company ladder. No matter how hard you worked, if they liked someone better, they would get picked."
good,"learned customer service skills, great management of store but not Starbucks department, workplace was a friendly environment and fast-paced, hardest part of job was inconsistent hours, best part of job was discounts."
good,"Supportive Technicians"
good,"A typical day as a cashier in Target would involve completing transactions accurately, addressing customers in a polite manner while helping them bag their recently bought merchandises. Also it would include collecting go-backs items and maintaining working areas clean."
good,"Overall good place to work, competitive, friendly co-workers, management is friendly, however low salary, not enough hours, work outside recommended schedule upon hire"
good,"Target was my first job and last job. I graduated high school and turned 18 and was welcomed into target, at first it was hard because i had never worked before, but with the help of my team mates they pushed me to get the work down. I then became one of those teammates that helped the newbies that were struggling. I loved my job and would recommend my friends to work for Target"
good,The FLOW team was my first fast-paced job and I enjoyed the environment. The hardest part of the job was sometimes keeping track of the unloading of the truck.
good,"This job was very fast paced. The management was pretty good, could use more improvement. The greatest part about the job was their discounts on food, clothes, and certain items."
good,"Every day was unpredictable working second shift. You could have a 6 hour shift and then the following night it could be a 13 hour shift. Management was typically calm and respectful when dealing with employees, and this seemed to be how most of the building acted. *this was at least my experience*"
good,"Started in my senior year of high school, have stayed during breaks as I go away to college, so it's very helpful in that regard. Love the select people I work with, but as I've continued to be here, it can get old and cumbersome. It has taught me a lot, so I'm grateful."
good,"I like the job but I need more hours  , it's a very nice place to work at but they hired so many people they have to split the hours between all of us"
good,"Good workplace, teach you a lot, good people and management. Expect you to work in all areas when you are trained in one. Learned to be patient. Enjoyed the other employees"
good,A typical day at Target would start by managing your entire day around customer service and product knowledge. The product knowledge is helpful and fun. The workplace is fun and the people make the day more enjoyable. The hardest part of the job is when you have exhausted all possibilities to find a solution to a customer unpleasant experience.
good,"Great place to learn skills but once you are a Team Leader, you do not get paid enough for everything you do. As a team member, I enjoyed Target much more."
good,I learned that the process of unloading and the truck was the easy part. The hard part was trying find space during the holidays for all the merchandise that couldn't fit on the sales floor that came off the truck. The most enjoyable part of the job was that all the associates worked together as a team to get the job done.
good,The fact that every week your schedule was different made it hard to budget or plan. It was not necessary to do the schedules the way they were done. That was why I left.
good,Target is a huge retail store and working with them is a good experience. The company culture is very different and everyone is very supportive of you.
good,Overall great place to learn management. Fast Fun Friendly place to start your career at. Gives individual the opportunity to gain the experience you need to work successful business.
good,"I loved Target culture in the 90's early 2000's. Retail is struggling due to online shopping and lack of stress relief shopping, materialism within the new generations."
good,It was a great pace to work; I believe management could've been better. Also the way the chain of commands worked didn't sit well with me other than that it's a great company to work for.
good,"Target has been my occupation for the last 4 years. However, after attending school and earning a degree, there comes a time where you just want something more. Target has built my responsibility and accountability of myself that I know will be very helpful in my future endeavors."
good,"Offered competitive wages."
good,"I loved working with Target Canada. They had good values and employed hard working people. Shame it didn't last, due to poor logistics practices. We tried really hard to help the store succeed but it was impossible as a whole."
good,"Honest work for honest pay. If you clock in and do what you're supposed to, people will like you and you'll feel good about helping the team. Scheduling can be a little all over the place but that's just retail in general."
good,I worked here when I was still a student. I was able to set my work schedule around my school schedule. There is always new opportunities to learn new departments.
good,"Starting off, the management was great and amazing. I could not see myself working at any other target. As time passed people began leaving due to it being a retail job, and management changed. The employees at target faced a very rough period of time from roughly around february 2017 to august 2017 and things are just beginning to get better the way it was."
good,The shift goes by fast because there is always work do be done.  Good place to work if you are a hard worker and have a good work ethic. I am learning  a lot in the short time I have been there.  They are good about making sure you take your breaks and that you clock out at the end of your shift.
good,This was my first job out of high school. I worked as a cashier and along with that there were other small tasks to be done. I only worked here for a few months till I moved onto my next job opportunity.
good,Target was a fun environment for me and a good learning experience. I was able to learn alot about the Company and the Merchandise that was being sold.
good,"Had a great time there, great people and work was fun. It was one of the best jobs Ive had, the holiday season and the months leading up to it are insane but other than that its all around a great place to work.  I left because they had a restructuring and it the company wasn't going in the direction I personally agreed with."
good,"Currently work here & I have realized that it is not a secure job/career. Great pay. Managers micro manage. You are just a number here. 10 or 12 hr shifts... they want no downtime or talking to your coworkers, non stop work & if you’re caught talking or having downtime you will have to explain why. I’m in warehousing driving OP & our manager makes a could be fun workplace miserable. Projects a timer on the wall for 3 minutes after breaks so you better be at your work location within those 3. Cannot leave building once clocked in, not even on breaks. Other departments managers stand on a platform & watches directly over them w critique. Somewhat like a sweat shop. No AC & no heat...but GREAT pay & easy job to do. They watch your numbers hard.. to reach their goal you literally have to work nonstop no bathroom & no talking. If you don’t reach the goal they are going to have a talk with you. I started off at 16.49/hr +1.00/hr for working the 12 hour shift schedule"
good,"I enjoyed working at Target however at the time, the team that I was on did not offer career advancement. After I left Target, the team was actually let go completely. I think Target provide support from the management team however they lack diversity with career advancement opportunity"
good,"It was alright working here, early hours for flo team, 3am. Better than working at walmart although. Just wish they paid more for coming in at 3am. Very professional though."
good,"A very busy fast paced work environment, with always having returns/exchanges left me with every department being paged to the front desk for items/merchandise to be put back out on the floor. I learned to perform gift registries for guests who may be expecting a baby, wedding and or new memebership services. The management was usually very easy to contact or get feedback from when needed."
good,"Great organizational resources available for roll-outs or remodels. "
good,"I loved working at Target. The environment was fun and friendly. I ended up leaving after a year due to the fact that they didn't pay well and I needed to find a job with better pay, as I was pregnant with my second child."
good,You have to be able to make sure you are paying attention to every detail. The scheduling was very decent and the pay was good also. the staff were very friendly.
good,"I enjoyed working my way though Target store management, however once you gain the experience you desire after three years other companies will pay more for your developed human capital."
good,"The position I was put in was very enjoyable, there was always a different area that needed to be fixed or touched up and it was never in the same place for to long. You learn almost every skill they have to offer in the building (aside from higher management stuff) so if you’re asked to go help a different team within the store you can. The management can be a little hectic as there are many bosses that outdo or overstep each other that it interferes with the job, but the people you get to know and suffer alongside of are great to work with. I’d say the hardest thing in that position was finding the time to manage all of the projects that needed to be done within the hours given, since many of the different teams in the store would allocate the hours set for my team to different positions. However, seeing the finished project always brought a sense of pride and enjoyment in the day."
good,"VERY fast pace ESPECIALLY if you work in a high volume store. Management can be annoying when it comes to RedCard sales. Other than that, Target is a wonderful place to work."
good,Target is a wonderful place to get extra job experience but lacks the ability to move on to other jobs within the store. Management is great as long as you work hard and help towards store goals.
good,"This company cares about it's employees and worked with my school schedule well. Very fast paced environment during holidays, summer, back to school, etc."
good,"Overall, working at Target was great.A typical day at Target was clock in, cashier and resolve any issue I came across,preferably on my own to speed up the transaction process. I learned how to deal with people during an issue, and how to keep everything calm whilst so. Workplace culture was one big family. I got along well with all of my coworkers and managers."
good,Cashier duties included helping check guest's products out. We also help clean and organize areas within the store. Customer service is really important.
good,trained throughout the store and learned various operations of the store. this included being the manager of the store for half of the day and responding  to manger calls and quick decisions.
good,"Fun Place to work good work environment. Clean stores."
good,Target was a good place to work for i enjoyed it they worked with me the whole time i was raising my kids. Which I am grateful for I can not complain.
good,"- Challenging and engaging work environment"
good,"overall good company to be employed at. Friendly staff and friendly guests. managers and staff easy to work with."
good,"Fast paced environment with a lot going on especially during holiday season. You are never alone in your work though. Every day you are placed with a partner and you work as a team to get things done quicker, also makes warehouse work a lot easier not being silent and alone for your shift."
good,Great job to start with.  Very comforting atmosphere and an easy job to have while going to school or just looking for extra income.  Works well with scheduling and management is very cooperative.
good,"Target is a difficult place to work, they expect a lot out of you. At the same time however the people you work with make it worth it. I was there on average 33 hours a week and what got me through it was my coworkers. If it wasn't for that atmosphere i would have left a lot sooner."
good,"Target prefers quantity of quality. That means they don't care about product rotation, they just want the product put up on the shelves as quick as possible."
good,work load fluctuates be prepared to work a lot of overtime around the holidays and at times there is very little work. Sometimes you are standing around waiting for work and then the work comes all at once and you are really busy.
good,Logistics is fast paced and the job has high expectations. Management does not communicate well. The hardest put of the job is unloading the truck. The most enjoyable part is working with others.
good,"Only part time, the time that I work here, I am still at school and struggling between my studies and work.  I'd be willing to go back and work again at Target if I've been given the chance again"
good,"I worked with the team as a cashier for 4  months,I left due to complications with my pregnancy,I don't mind working with the team again,it was a great experience for me especially being able decide from a variety of future opportunities to be a good fit and I have been working on a project for me to follow what I've learned from the store position to this day and I have a lot going through the process"
good,The best part of working at a target retail store is the team. Working at the store can get redundant but the making friends with the team is the best part.
good,working for target was only OK. The co workers were up and down and the managers were so iffy. If you had family emergencies and needed time off they were never to understanding.
good,I like Target. We have very good team .Everyone gets best customer service. Everyone works very hard. We try to keep customers happy by providing good customer service
good,"Many different job types and varying hours with each."
good,"Very busy and fast paced, always work to be completed in a good way. Customers very easy going but you need to work at a faster pace than other retailers to provide better service. Management was poor and managers tend to be rude or intimidating at times. Hours are flexible but not in quantity."
good,"It's a good job, just not a job where you feel like you are making a difference.  Lots of work, products, and duties, with many duties being shared.  One day you can be doing stocking, other days you're stocking, cashier, bsckstocking, pulling, and other duties.  Still getting paid the same amount."
good,"As a seasonal employee, this job was good as a college student. The hours were flexible, the work was mindless, and the team had an overall good morale. It is great for young employees to gather work experience and learn about a team atmosphere along the way."
good,"A typical day at work would start off as we would unload the trucks and restock the shelves. We would start from the first aiels and work our way to the back of the store, once done with that I would most likely be sent to back stock."
good,"I was flexible and did not let anything stand in my way. Work any shift and switch with anyone but when I got pregnant it changed. I think I just couldn't help out as much as I wanted. Fun place, fast paced, changing all the time to keep guests happy and fulfilled. Thankful for my 18years."
good,"Typical day: Merchandising end-caps, Stocking shelves, in-stocks (inventory control), Planograms, customer service, leading team members, hiring, coaching and counseling, and facing to name a few."
good,The coworkers are happy to help and are very nice .the work place is very fast paced but the job gets done efficiently. The team leads are good leaders as well.
good,If there wasn't many customers you had to help the clothing section nearest you. sometimes you are selected to assist with the dressing room. as a cashier you had to sell their credit card.
good,Great place to work. Managers are fairly laid back and understanding.  Lots of cool coworkers. Cash registers are easy to learn and operate. Zoning is also an easy task.
good,I've mainly worked in the food industry until I started at Target. Target is my first retail job and the employees and managers are very fun and they treat you like family. I would recommend people to work at Target because of the fun friendly environment.
good,"It was a great place to work at.  Got along with all the coworkers.  It was fun and fast paced. The store was always clean. Management started off good, but over time it became unbearable."
good,Target was where I had to do for intren ship in other to graduate from school over all the people their was really help full. I learned as much as possible and by the end of the 3months I had all my hours which was 300 hours
good,"If you need a paycheck, then this place has flexible hours. If you have good managers then it can be really fun. Most red cards I had people apply for I felt bad afterwards."
good,"Awesome place to work at! Management can be intimidating, but they just wan everyone to succeed and once you learn that, you'll enjoy it. Everyone is very nice and warm. everyone is a team player here!"
good,Most enjoyable part if job was talking  to the elderly people that came through my line. For the most part they always had a story they wanted to share. They like to talk and I like to listen.
good,"Even though I work during the Black Friday event , it was still a bit more relaxing compared to other stores.  I wasn't really a fan of their bathroom breaks and lunch breaks but it's a job.  Management is usually too busy but that's with most grocery stores and retail stores. The only difficult part of the job was having to lift items that were a bit bigger than you as a cashier and scanning them successfully without hurting yourself.  What I learned was to make sure that I had a very good breakfast in the morning you're going to need it ."
good,"The DC offers long hours at great pay and benefits. This will, however, take up most of your waking life. The retail market will dictate the amount of work the DCs have and for Target business is booming. Motivated applicants only, as you will be consistently asked to do more than you arw currently capable of in order to continuously improve productivity and performance."
good,"Great company to work for, very family orienated, lots of training if interested. I would still be happily employed if admin positions were not made redundant."
good,This is a great job for anyone who loves working in customer service and helping people. But sometimes it can be very stressful and demanding  but I loved it.
good,"No longer there.  Was good, hard work.  Very structured and detailed.  Worked hard and fast to push freight to salefloor and stock groceries on food side of salesfloor."
good,It's great a good place to start at but it lacks career advancement so don't stay too long either. Fast paced environment and you'll need to learn how to do multiple things outside of your work role so be a quick learner.
good,"Working at Target is an experience, you join a community and quickly feel at home with your coworkers. Friendly overall environment, always maintaining a clean environment."
good,Working at Target is an enjoyable experience for me. They are very flexible with my hours and they make it easy to work there. The least enjoyable part about the job is the pressure of getting someone to sign up for a Red Card (Target's credit card).
good,As a cart attendant my job was to quickly gather as many carts and have them ready to use for the customers. No matter the weather the job had to be done.
good,"This was my first job as a teenager, and having worked there for nearly 3 years I learned quite a bit! My job duties varied greatly as I was moved around during my employment with Target. I started as a cashier, worked in the food department, sales floor, electronics and back room. I really enjoyed the job at the time because of the large amount of friends I had there, as well as coworkers who became good friends."
good,Very fast paced workplace made for days flying by.  I liked the environment and the management.  They are very number based meaning you have to make your goals every day.
good,Nice company to work .learned lot of things related to work and other skills. Well mentioned office infrastructure and friendly work environment and cab service is also there.
good,"I love working at Target. It was friendly, clean and organized. Leadership is amazing. Training is amazing. I love what the company stands for and for the quests."
good,"great place to work. Friendly people all around. Management is very understanding. Very diverse area. One of the hardest parts of the job is simply getting customers to apply for REDCARDS. most people already have them, but its also one of the most enjoyable parts of the job because its a miniature celebration when you do."
good,"Target was a good company.  I worked there a number of years in different locations.  If you are flexible, you'll go farther in the company.  They are always looking to outsource projects, so regular employees might not be around much."
good,"I enjoyed the chance to work in other departments,  customer base was very enjoyable,  management was usually there to help with any problems you had."
good,I only worked there for a month or so but I learned how to cashier and work within a team. It was a nice place to gain a little bit of experience while I was still in high school.
good,everybody worked really hard to help each other finish all the tasks that needed to be done on each shift.  The management helped alongside everybody.
good,"Ok job for someone just getting out of high school, or just looking for something to keep extra pocket change not enough to keep you a float. Schedules and hours fluctuate to much."
good,"nice pleasant place to work, hours vary weekly, interacting with guests, showing them how to use the cartwheel app  on their phones to save extra percentage off,, and the benefits of the target red card"
good,i was young when i worked here. it was an excellent first job. it was fun sometimes it sucked working so late but they have amazing workers. i recommend it as a first job
good,The people are easy to work with and very knowledgeable about the business.  I enjoy working for my boss who makes my job so much easier.  The most enjoyable part of the job is helping others with whatever they need.
good,"Like any other retail job, you have to deal with rude customer, thieves . But other then that target is a okay job to work ..im not sure about long term.."
good,I normally was the fitting room attendant and also store operator at the same time so I was constantly busy. I learned how to use my time wisely to get what I needed to done. The workplace was actually nice people I worked with were very pleasant.
good,I enjoyed my time at target and would recommend it as a place to try out retail. It's not nearly as hectic as a walk mart so you can build your skills and gain experience.
good,"Depending on the hours you wish to work and position you are hired for, the job can be very rewarding. Helping customers all day either at the register or on the sales floor can help build great relationships for the store. The hardest part of the job can be managing your work hours. Sometimes you are given hours you cannot work and it can be hard to adjust around them but management is willing to do so."
good,It gets tough working at the cash register and dealing with some complicated customers. The job itself is easy but having to deal with some complicated customers gets pretty tough.
good,"The management and staff are very friendly and helpful. They aim to please their customers and treat the employees very nice. I wish the pay was a bit higher, but all in all it's an enjoyable place to work."
good,Bom aprendizado profissional e de adquirir experiência
good,Great work environment during my time with the company; worked overnight and never had any issues with amount of work or demands from management. Team huddles conducted by shift supervisors were always inspiring and encouraging to employees.
good,I fully enjoyed working here. Staff members were very productive and encouraging. Employees were efficient and friendly. The overall facility was immaculate.
good,"Makes you be a team player, staff and co workers were friendly and outgoing, willing to help new co workers, efficient and fast paced service, my least favorite was a 15 min break and 30 min lunch, might as well have a 1 hour lunch break."
good,"A typical day in the Target Café is fairly routine. Most days it is the same set of tasks to be completed before the end of your shift. The culture of working in the café was a little odd, as most nights found you closing on your own. This was a good thing and a bad thing. Being alone to close taught me how to manage my time and to experiment with ways to streamline the process, but it was also difficult on nights when it was busy."
good,"It's a fine place to work, it is a good company overall. I like that it's flexible scheduling. Very easy to come in daily, get the expected workload done and leave. Holidays, and Back to School are very long days so be prepared, but other than that. Solid company."
good,"Learned a lot while working here. My manager became a good friend of mine, he pushed me to use my full potential. Gave constructive criticism that helped me become a more productive worker."
good,I currently work in the softlines department and my co-workers are excellent team players. the store managers really do work with you in helping to make the store better.
good,Target was a fun place to work.  I enjoyed working with customers and helping them find exactly what they needed.  The Black Friday sales were awesome!
good,"Although the job did get stressful at times,when the right coworkers were there to help you out when times got tough,it could be an enjoyable job.I'd recommend working there"
good,"Target will give you good leadership experience. The pros are a good salary and good training. The cons are work/life balance. You will work 50-60 hours EVERY week and you also work every other weekend, holidays and nights."
good,"I do not have much to say, its retail. I did not like to up sale the credit cards, everything else came with the job. No big issue with the operations."
good,target is a really fast pace job and is great for those who like to stay busy. the way things are ran are great and the store has a lot to offer. all around a good but not great place to work
good,"Very flexible scheduling, friendly environment."
good,"Overall, my experience with Target has been amazing and I would highly suggest that if you have the opportunity to work for Target that you take it. They help you develop essential skills for any job and they are very beneficial."
good,"Working in the deli is fun if you are surrounded by the right crew. Everybody should work together to get all the required task done, but some crews leave all the work to one or two members."
good,"While being employed with this company I have learned how to: Process payroll and payroll requests. "
good,"Good place to work , work life balance, Fun, Good learning, Good benefits , Transports feasibility , opportunities to move to different teams. Over Best company"
good,"fun and friendly work place. fast paced with lots of guest. required quick thinking and problem solving skills. management is helpful and encouraging, great place to work."
good,Advancement into Senior Management required a Bachelor's Degree which I do not have. The culture was very employee friendly encouraging teamwork and recognition form both management and peers.
good,"I did work experience for target the manager was a very friendly and nice man as were all the other people working in the store, the store is in a good location and there was always a job to keep you occupied, really i can't say anything bad about my work experience at target."
good,"Had two supervisors, one was great and very supportive.  The second was always asking me to work OT, then denying me the opportunity to claim the hours (get paid) without getting in trouble for the OT"
good,fun good place to work for experience . always do the right thing . good good good management. and not so much of great scheduling. Gotta prepare thing
good,Good team to work with. Hours are flexible but the work is intense although pay is low. Management is very positive and understanding and encouraging.
good,"This job was pretty simple. All I did was refold clothes, organize shoes and accessories, help guests locate items, backup register, and return clothing from dressing room. Overall not a difficult job, but at the time I was very anti-social, and it was the holiday season. Not the best combination. While, it isn't difficult, it is a big store and corporation, so think about whether you want to be treated as an individual or another worker. Also, because it is seasonal, you cannot ask off too much when you have already been scheduled. They need you there because your their  backup."
good,When I became a Produce Team Lead everything changed. The management level only cares about what is coming from corporate. They don't work with the employees based on their lifestyle and hours. They talk about people behind their back. I enjoyed myself up until the point where they hire executives straight from college that have zero management experience.
good,This was my first full time job and I really enjoyed being a employee at Target. The management there is very much so in touch with their employees and actually cares about your personal life and schedule.
good,"Unpacked, organized and stocked all types of merchandise. Rotated and updated shelved inventory.  Worked on a strict time line. Fun seasonal position."
good,Working at target was brief but exciting It provided me the opportunity to learn about the many different positions within target. My experience at target was positive and I would consider working with them again.
good,"Work/life balance depends on the position that you work. There is definitely a great work culture, and not much drama. Hardest part of the job is selling red cards! Coworkers are definitely the best part of the job. Moving up in the company will definitely depend on which location you are at and favoritism definitely plays a big role."
good,"The job here was very easy, go into work and do what you need to as far as helping fellow employees or customers. Must be a people person to enjoy working the floor."
good,getting people to get red cards was the hardest part of my job other then that it was a great place to work and i would recommend it to others. It was like working with a little family.
good,"good place to work, very fun and enjoyable. a lot of help when needed. while working there you can easily move up. managers make things easy for the employees, and are very understanding."
good,"Third shift position with overtime. Stocked products on shelves. Completed inventory of incoming products. Managed 30+ employees during the shift, payroll, etc."
good,Fun and Productive workplace with friendly staff. Target try's to help make the employees time working for them a positive experience and one to remember.
good,Why am I not able to just apply for jobs?  Why must I fill out a review for every company I have ever worked for.  This seems almost not worth it.  I can
good,I was young when I worked here but I thoroughly enjoyed working for Target. I appreciate how supportive this company was of me. I had a lot of fun working here and was always motivated to try my best.
good,"I worked in various positions with Target and although every job has its challenges, overall the company tries to do the best and correct programs for its employees and customers"
good,Retail work hours can vary quite a bit throughout the year with Christmas and back to school being peak times. Work hours can drop a lot during the winter months after Christmas.
good,"My experience with Target has been an overall positive one. The stores that I have worked for were accommodating with my school schedule and also focused on maintaining a functional work life balance. All in all, I would challenge those going to work for Target to be clear about what your goals are upfront and manage UP when need be-the resources are there, but the initiative needs to be on your part."
good,"At the time, I wasn't happy working at Target. Looking back I miss it so much! Some of the management and team leads made the place sour, but overall it was a fantastic environment!"
good,"This is a good company to work for if you do not need full-time employment.  Generally, employees are hired in such vast numbers that the hours for working are low except for peak shopping experiences (Christmas, Thanksgiving, etc)."
good,"The STL of the store was over his head, did not work with management well to make the store a better place. I thought my career with Target would of been a better experience."
good,"For the 1st year and a half I worked there I really liked it. Then a new store manager came in and everything went downhill. People started quitting and turn around was crazy. If you work salesfloor you are expected to do everything. You work not only your area but you are constantly being called up front to just on a register to help the cashiers who don't work very fast because they know sales floor will called to help out. You also have to stock shelves, cover other areas plus your own while people go to breaks and lunches, you have to also put away returns, and zone your area."
good,I learned how to merchandise shelving goods and help customers at the same time. i learned the art of multi tasking with this company and believe me you need it with every retail company you are to go into.
good,A typical day at work can be busy depending on the time of the day but workers are very energetic and helpful. I learned a lot of cutomer service skills
good,This review depends on the store. The Flow team position is great for those who want to focus on their work with little distraction or disruption from customers.
good,the benefits are amazing the discounts are good if you shop there. its a good job when you are in college not career its a lot of responsibility to handle.
good,"They take care of their employees, at least, i felt they did.  Working on the overnight team, we have less time to do the same amount of work 2 days shifts do, so pace is fast, but manageable.  We were given a lot of food/ rewards when I started there. I worked for the company twice in the career path. Reliable."
good,"Hours were typically long, but they went by quickly. This is because there was usually always something to do which made time fly, plus the co-workers are all amazing, caring, kind individuals, which definitely helps."
good,I learned how to organize a department. Front facing was an interesting challenge. I also was able to rely on management to develop my many people skills.
good,"I enjoyed working here, depending on management they are more understanding of family circumstances that may arise.  The reason I left was only because the hours were to difficult for Child Care as a single parent"
good,Working at Target was a great experience. The people and management was like a family. It's hard work at times but the opportunity to move up in the company is endless.
good,"Working at Target was a good experience for me. I took pride in my position there. Working a Target was very enjoyable at times, until your work load got backed up, and then you let a team lead know about it and they may or may not send you help, and then they think you are suppose to work like robots time we get backed up. But other than that, working at Target for my second time was very good."
good,"I liked working at Target, working as door security during their makeover,, I also enjoyed cashiering. The work environment was great, and I liked my co-workers"
good,"Great opportunities to meet new people both internally and externally. Rapid paced, there is always something to do and learn. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the people you work with, you are able to become a close-knit group."
good,"I would complete customer transactions, stock shelves as well as putting away returns. Complete return transactions and exchanges. I would close the check-out lanes at the end of the night. I would close target café at closing. I would work in the electronic department when needed."
good,"Target was my first job in the United Sates, it helped me with my English and also to develop a great customer service. their goal as a company was to provide excellent service and that was something that I loved."
good,"we were busy almost every day and would celebrate holidays together as if we were family, having potlucks and such. i had fun and was sad when the season was over."
good,employees are fun to work with. managers can be a little more cheerful. work is easy for the most part. holidays can be tough and some customers are hard to deal with.
good,A very fast pace job that requires you to be a team player and a energetic person who is always willing to help. They love it when you make sales for the company. Hardest part of the job is customers and bad attitudes.
good,We are treated well and can be ourselves in a more relaxed environment. Now with a tighter budget to spend on employees we can see days where we are doing more work in the same amount of time.
good,Typical day is doing go-backs and zoning a certain clothing department. Co-workers are very friendly and helpful with any questions I have. The hardest part of the job is taking in the bad attitude from customers.
good,"Once all of the prescriptions were filled, shelves cleaned, OTCs faced, items ordered, and pharmacy straightened, there were no other tasks to complete. I like to be busy and not have down time."
good,"I took this job to get in some extra income. I only worked here for about 6 months as a cashier and stocker. Overall, it was a good place to work. The Store Team Leader was great when I was there."
good,What a fun place to work. Good starter job for any person who loves to have constant interactions with people. Not difficult to learn the tasks at hand and can easily move around or train in different positions within the workplace.
good,not the worst place to work. typical customer service stories where customers are rude to the point that there is nothing you can do to make them happy. some people just have the mindset that if they raise enough of a fuss they will receive a discount
good,"Nice work experience as a first job. Had the opportunity to work with other employees similar to my own age at the time, so the work environment was always fun, but productive at the same time."
good,A typical day of work would be helping guests with any transactions at a cash register. Assisting with any break coverage and cleaning up the shelves. I learned how to give good guest service and work efficiently to give each guest a good experience. Management worked well. There was at time communication issues with important details. Most of the management made sure to have good relationships with co-team members. The hardest part is having to deal with extra difficult guest and the inconsistent hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was cleaning up a certain area to make it presentable and just look nice.
good,"I began working for Target when I was 19 and thoroughly loved going to work. I started as a salesperson stocking shelves and assisting guests, and had great management to look up to. I transferred after about 2 years from one store to another and management was not nearly as positive. This had a negative effect on many of the team members, and the work climate was so much different than what I was used to at my first store. Overall though, I enjoyed my time working there."
good,Management seems to have favorites and aren't helpful when needed. Like to cut hours and don't like people taking time off of work. Coworkers were nice.
good,"I loved target , it was a very friendly environment and I was always treated very well. A lot of my hours were very manageable and easy to work off of ."
good,Great place to work if you are attending school. They are very flexible with schedules and willing to work around your daily activities. The most enjoyable part of my job is the diverse atmosphere
good,The people nice. Management was understanding to people like me who was taking classes and working at the same time. Management was very flexible with my schedule.
good,They are really flexible about your schedule especially if you are a student. It is a clean and friendly place to work. the managers are always helpful. Overall it is a good place for starters.
good,"It's a decent job, sometimes it can very very messy. I wouldn't stay here to make it a career. The pay is alright and the discount comes in handy when you're a couple dollars short."
good,love the job hate that I had to leave couldn't perform because I was pregnant. but overall I love working with everyone and loved working in backroom getting things off the shelf for the cashiers in lobby
good,I enjoyed working at Target because of the workplace culture. The company is very team-oriented and you were given the opportunity to manage your work without being micromanaged.
good,the workplace of target was hard to get use to because of the fact that the workday started at either 3 or 4 in the morning and was very productive everyday stocking the shelves fast before the store opened
good,"I enjoyed working at target.  The management was fairly friendly, enjoyed working with my team members.  Great hours for high school/college age kids."
good,My experience wasn't as bad as some of the others ive read about. I was cross trained into many different area which i like in a job. Some of the managers though could use some serious lessons on being managers and the proper way to handle their employees.
good,For the most part the company is a great place to work. It is all in your attitude and mind set. Customer service is a big part of the job. The hardest part of working for the company is unreasonable guest that are having a bad day. Unfortunately that is also the best part of the job.
good,"The management was always very willing to help, provided us with free food often, and were really great about making sure we got our breaks and didn't work more than we should. As corporations do."
good,"loved working at target, but unfortunately they closed all their stores in Canada. I would recommend someone. Very good place to work and good customers servive team."
good,"Great place to work. Work life balance is off for executives, but you do get every other weekend off which is almost unheard of in a full time retail job."
good,"If you are looking for a friendly place to work that has growth potential and excellent benefits, Target is the place to be. Hard work, reliability, and friendliness truly pays off with this company."
good,good working hours. good attitudes to work around. around a lot of other shopping centers. beautiful environment to work around. peaceful and friendly faces.
good,"Some weeks I'll only work 25 hours some 40-50, but never consistently enough to get the ""Full-time Benefits"" they offer for 35-40 hours a week average."
good,good fun place to work. i had an awesome time with everybody who works there and after doing it for a while and traveling with the company i decided to move forward
good,"If you are not competitive, do not work here. Not only do employees stress over RedCards, so do the managers. If you are in a new location expect technical issues around the building."
good,Made a lot of new friends and learned a lot of the ins and outs of a large business. The work load varies from season to season. The management also varies from one manager to the next.  You have several managers at one time. Communication is key to a productive outcome. The hardest part of the job was in having all the tools needed to complete the job correctly and in a timely manner.
good,"I loved working here. The environment was great and the amount of hardworking people was incredible. I got a lot of hours working there. I learned multiple positions working there, from cashier to food ave to working at electronics section."
good,"Good work environment great communication Leaders are very positive and cheerful."
good,"I actually loved working when I started, but now with all the payroll cuts i'm not getting much hours. Management did work well and allowed me to be flexible in hours for school so that is pretty good."
good,Target is un-unionized and gives you a fairly set schedule depending on your position. They give annual raises and are pretty lenient on attendance. Black Fridays are horrible though.
good,A typical day was really running around making customers satisfied and cleaning up aisles and watching for safety hazards. Maybe every hour or half hour get a call to back up the registers and complete basic tasks from your team lead.
good,"The work days are moderately paced, albeit short (a part time schedule), In my time there I have learned the inner-workings of the wearhouse environment (i.e. stocking, research and pulls, and back stocking)."
good,"I would arrive to work some days between 8-4pm, 1-9pm, and 4-10pm. My hours varied as well as my location at which I worked. I would work in Trumbull Mall Target some days, Orange Target some days, and Hawley Lane Target. I was responsible for opening, closing, and holding the key to the locker that held all cell phones ( iPhone, Samsung Galaxy, etc.) Also held a key to Target's locked electronic inventory on the floor as well as in the stock room. Responsibilities including keeping track of all Cell Phones when I open and close the kiosk. Selling contract and non contract phones. As well as electronic protection plans through Apple Care and Target's Square Trade Protection. Assisted and advised guests on the product of their interest. Guided guests through how to use something purchased or something they are interested in purchasing. Assisted Target electronic department employees with cash register functions. As well as zoning department for all things cell phone related. Worked with Target Promotions Gift Cards, Credit Cards, and Sales. Worked on Thanksgiving, Black Friday, Christmas Eve and New Years Eve. I learned a lot about Sales at this job. The Management was ok. Most were by the book. Some were laidback. Workplace culture was very diverse. Hardest part of the job was not getting a phone or xfinity service sale to go through after selling your heart out to a guest. What was also a difficult part was how the target employees at certain stores leave the Target Mobile employees to do all  the work behind the boat at the register and that gets hard because we had our own"
good,It was a good and fun job but then lost to many hours and wasn't being treated fairly. Co workers made it better. It was also to stressful to complete what they wanted in the hours I was given.
good,"I worked in the electronic area, I helped guests with their purchase choices, etc.. There was a good workplace culture, I met a lot of cool people working there."
good,The work days can be long and the shifts on the weekends are the longest. Overnights can be difficult if you have family but having 4 days off during the week is nice.
good,"A good place to start out in a call center environment. They have several shifts available as they are 24/7 operation. "
good,such a huge part of my early working life. I made great friends through work and had the pleasure of working with my Mother. Target provides great oppportunity.
good,"I've had the pleasure and dismay of working at two different stores during my time with Target. One store was the horrible with nothing but drama, poor leadership, and a work/life/balance that was a laughable at best. The other provided amazing culture that provide a wonderful opportunity for advancement and being able to be promoted at incredible quick rates and actually looking out for what was best for the team."
good,"Good place to work, it's a big place, so you can work there for awhile without knowing everyone that works there. Hours are nice, as well, and managers are great."
good,job is great if you can get the hours.  Enjoy working there. people are easy to work with.   Management is fine.  Safe work place. cleans place to work well run.
good,"Target was a great place to gain work experience. The hours were decent, though the wage left something to be desired. Overall, management was good and the team I worked with meshed well together."
good,"My experience with Target was amazing! I loved everyone I worked with at my location and had wonderful management. The company as a whole is very active in the community which I love. They were great with their employees; they would cater in often, they were understanding of needs to take time off for family, they would train you in many areas giving people the chance to grow further within the company and over all better themselves. I always knew my company had my back!"
good,Working at target was a great experience and it being retail made it difficult to advance or have full time hours because of the ups and downs of the buying trends. But it  was definitely a great part time job!
good,target works hard to ensure its staff are trained and equipped to do their jobs.  the process can take some time to get on but thats due to balancing work hours with budget.
good,"target was a clean and  fun work place, the coworkers there were all very friendly and everyone got along great. even the managers were very nice and cooperative"
good,"Use excellent planning, organizational and numerical skills. Move merchandise using proper equipment. Use technology to read instructions, reports and information. Maintain a clean, well-organized work environment."
good,Target is an inclusive company that pays a decent wage.  Typically you come in and pick a lane to be your cash register for the day.  If things get slow you are expected to help stock gum and candy by the register.
good,The hardest part about working at Target was working with the overnight manger. We never seemed to see things eye to eye. Other coworkers were easy to work with.
good,"A typical day at Target is to always be busy, to never sit still even if there is a lull. One is to get out and organize what is out of place. Then when theres customers to scan and bag groceries in a timely matter all whilst pushing red cards to the customers."
good,"When changes to policy were made, the leadership team was not always willing to have a modicum of transparency.  Some expectations made were very unrealistic."
good,Managers take care of their employees by bringing food and drinks often. the hardest part of the job was unloading boxes and boxes of product off of the semi trucks. I enjoyed getting to work along side cool people.
good,"Started as an overnight stock person, and that went about as expected. Left Target as an Target Protection Specialist (Asset protection). Interacted with customers and team members in all departments."
good,"Being in charged of one department (Electronics) is tough enough when you have customers constantly streaming through the store asking information on certain products and being rung up when they find what they are looking for.  But being alone for your own department for an entire shift can be nerve wrecking if asked to keep an eye out for one or two additional departments while those employees go up to the front of the store to help shorten the line and get the customers out quickly.  If the managers at least hired one more mid-shift employee to help other customers with their question and cover the lunches of the department without pulling people from other departments, the store would be relieved of a lot of stress and would have less unsatisfied customers waiting for the next available employee to help them."
good,"Very early mornings and weekends/ holidays required most of the time. Advancement opportunities available with long-term commitments. You are on your feet most of the time and need to ask for extra tasks to keep you busy, so you will not find yourself bored."
good,"Target is a good company that will always keep you busy during your shift.  Employees get a 10% discount, but only if they use their red card.  Management was fun and nice to work for."
good,It's a very fun and productive work place to be at. You get to help a lot of people and it's fun! You are always doing something and their is never a down time.
good,"It's a alright company ,fast paced job ,great managers ,good customer service ,nice products.I had a alright experience needs to bump up pay good job overall"
good,"Decent pay, nice atmosphere.  The team at target is very good at team work and helping anyone out. The culture and standards the management set are very easy to do.   They jump in and help wherever they arr needed."
good,"Overall working for Target has been a good experience, the pay is good compared to other retailers and the teams and team members I worked with were generally great people."
good,"good part-time job to fill time while I was looking for other employment. good environment, but was minimum wage. not for someone looking for a career."
good,I spent several years with Target and truly learned a lot from this company.  They were definitely focused on developing talent for the future.  Their focus on brand dominance and standards was precedence setting.
good,"The hardest part of my job is unloading the truck with all the heavy product other then that everything goes smooth the rest of the say. I learn a lot working at target. I can casheer, move pallets and use all of the machinery that we currently have. The management is ok, it could be better. The most enjoyable part of the job is when i get to use the bailer."
good,I was able to move up after almost two years but not able to do anything to improve my department. I was given the responsibilities of a supervisor but not able to make decisions to help.
good,What can i say? Its retail. A lot of things are out of your control as well as you manager. Let them know far enough in advance you have something coming up and they are usually flexible. They may call you in... A LOT. But hey! You're getting hours... but never more that 39... get ready to literally run to clock out.
good,Work went by quickly and everything went smoothly. Management didn't understand the needs of the employees but what else is new. Didn't learn much. A pretty standard job.
good,The day seemed to go by pretty slow. I learned that if you wanted to do a good job you needed to work fast there. Management was not okay they just had bad attitudes.
good,"Target was easy and fun to work at. Managers were willing to accommodate your needs and scheduling. Most customers were nice and not weird like at some ""other"" retailer."
good,"Coming in, unloading delivery trucks, taking boxes out onto the sales floor and unboxing and stocking shelves. Then taking backstock to the backroom and putting it in the correct area of the backroom and inputting the location and count."
good,"decent company overall, great pay and vacation time based onhours worked. very clean environment nice co workers. easy to learn the procedures on a daily basis."
good,"The jobe was boring and the people were stale, also the work was repetitive. It payed well but the hours were short and i worked the dawn shift. Over all not the best experience"
good,"Enjoyed having a different schedule each week. Learned how to work a cash register, along with how to selling Red cards proficiently to customers. While working there everyone had excellent customer service, along with strong work ethics and integrity."
good,"In the retail world, change in the name of the ball game.  Target does a great job rolling with change for the better and is always looking to improve their way."
good,"With a good team and a positive attitude, working at target is nice, somewhat physically tasking and a fun place to be. WIth an organize mind and a thoughtful heart, target is the place for you."
good,i learned how to do quick transactions and the staff was great at accommodating the schedule as needed. would recommend it to teens looking for their first job.
good,High pace work environment with plenty of room for advancement.  Very competitive leadership based program that really pushes you to the next level.  Very challenging and fun position.
good,"I enjoyed being a cashier at Target as my first job, it was right around the holiday season so it was pretty quick paced. I enjoyed my job and it was a nice place to work."
good,"What a fantastic place to ""grow up"" professionally! I feel very lucky to have been a part of the culture and success of what I believe is one of the best retailers in the country."
good,"Management training was efficient and the time provided to perform tasks was adequate.  Since I was only seasonal help, my knowledge  of product placement on the floor was limited which created frustration to the customer.  (Seasonal, Christmas help)"
good,"Target is a solid company, and is a job that I not only like but respect. To that point, we don't do a good job of creating our own sense of identity, only comparing ourselves with Walmart (rather comparing our sales and profits)."
good,a typical day was generally good. Learned a lot about working  with others. management was very helpful in providing information and thing needed to complete assignments.
good,"not bad place to work, i think its a great place to work especially while in school, lots of opportunity to grow and develop and learn if you have a degree, besides that i think its best to look somewhere else. be ready to deal with people and make sure you're able to handle it"
good,It's a good work place but it's not a career unless you have a degree. Would like better pay but it's decent. The higher ups are easy going. It's a good side job if you want extra money.
good,I loved working for Target. Spent a good amount of my checks there as well. The stores are great. The customers are mostly friendly and the 10% discount isn't so bad.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Target. The work as a back room associate was pretty simple and the skills and certifications, I acquired while there, will continue to help me advance in more challenging fields of warehouse work. As well as help me obtain a more competitive wage due to the experience I gained. My only complaint would be lack of full time hours. They will switch you to part time regardless of what you were hired on as. Didn't seem fair, but it happens."
good,Best work/life balance as far as retail goes. The job can be fun and very little stress if you know what you're doing. Training and development are both areas of opportunity within the company.
good,"target is a great place to work, the atmosphere is fun friendly and close knitted. the schedule is flexible and can accomidate most peoples lifestyles."
good,All in all the company was great to work for but some of their expectations for you as an employee seemed a little high based on the task that they were asking you to complete. They often didnt provide you with the man power or materials to complete a task that they were asking. It would be a great company if they provided the necessary things to effectively complete your daily tasks.
good,"Unload trucks and organize the freight on to pallets, then work the freight to the floor.  Work freight in a fast and safe manner.  Maintain an organized and clean workplace."
good,"as a sale associate for retail we have sale targets every day, and sometimes we need to offer certain items to get rid of them fast. I usually would ensure that I ask my staff to suggest these items to each and every customer to move the product our and increase our sales. "
good,"as a sale associate  for retail we have sale targets every day, and sometimes we need to offer certain items to get rid of them fast. I usually would ensure that I ask my staff to suggest these items to each and every customer to move the product our and increase our sales. "
good,"counting floor inventory "
good,"Working on the sales floor in almost every department, I learned a lot about how grocery stores work. From working in the backroom over night to working in the dairy section and grocery area throughout the day, I had to learn where almost every thing in the store was in order to help customers. It was a fun environment with good people but there was a lot of monotonous tasks involved with working at a major grocery store."
good,I rarely had a dull moment at Target and would love to go back. They were very flexible and understanding. The open door policy was wonderful and management is always there to hear you out.
good,Retail employment can be quite rewarding and a great place to start if you don't know what you want to be when you grow up. It does help to be a people person.
good,Target Financial services was a highly beneficial for me because it taught me a different side of customer service. Many of the customer issues were related to Target Card Holders ( Credit Cards ). It was my job to detect fraud and other financial issues that our customers could be facing while analyzing different strategies and procedures to resolve customer concerns.
good,Target is a very large corporation and with that in mind the individual gets lost as a cog in the machine. Managers showed little to no investment in teams and favoritism is rampant.
good,"I love meeting new people and cashiering for Target  was a great place to do that. The management is great they're all super friendly and you make friends pretty quickly. The only thing that gets me are the Red Cards. I personally think they are great. I have one and I love saving money. The hard part is selling them to customers. I hate that we need to meet a quota and if I don't get at least one card per shift I feel really disappointed in myself and sometimes they give us a talk about why we're not selling any cards and make us feel guilty. So if you're looking to apply be warned about those red cards. But besides that, it's a great place to work."
good,"I have not been apart of this team for very long as of yet, but it is a very positive atmosphere. There is always something to do and always more opportunities to gain more hours."
good,"A typical work day, did my task performed to their expectations."
good,"Typically my day would start and end in customer service. I would assist customers with any printing, copying, or related service. i would also provide accurate pricing based on pricing guidelines the company provided. I learned how to behave and carry myself in a customer service environment as well as complete multiple tasks simultaneously within an allotted time frame. The management at Target Copy was helpful and thorough when helping me understanding every aspect of what went on in the work environment. The entire staff was like a family and worked together as a unit to complete projects. The hardest part of the job would have to be pricing a project to the penny via invoice. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping brainstorm and create an excellent product for the customers."
good,"If you are in college, and you are in need of a part time job. Then Target would be a good company to work for (rather you go to school in the mornings or in the evenings)."
good,"I have been an example of great leadership. This what separates myself from other potential candidates.  I’ve shown in my past positions and endeavors that truly I’ve been successful in every role.  Not only I have surpassed departments and company goals placed before me, I set personal goals for myself which I have succeeded for my professional career."
good,A typical day working at Target consisted of unloading however many trucks onto the belt while sending out items to their respective departments. Once done unloading the trucks we head out onto the floor and unpack the items onto the shelves.
good,It's a company changing everyday to keep up with the demands. You can't move up in the company unless you have four year degree. So alot of change over in management.
good,"i worked in cafe and i felt it was enjoyable. the manager of the cafe was a bit brash, but overall a good experience. Retail is not for me, i missed working with kids and had to find another job."
good,Target is a place where you can make friends with your co-workers. The store opens a 8am but workers get there at 6am to unload trucks and to stock products. Team huddles happen throughout the day to keep workers up-to-date with what is happening in the store.
good,"I would set up the backroom to unload truck for the night, then manager would review suggested pace for the truck and amount of freight per hour . Team would receive a 10 minute lunch break during shift to talk and relax and eat. "
good,"A typical day for a cashier is standing in one spot for 4-8 hours, although management was always on top of giving everyone a break if they needed one. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with guests and being treated like a human being for a minute (sadly a rare occurrence in retail) . The hardest part is getting docked on hours due to not selling enough Target credit cards."
good,Target was a very fun and friendly workplace with great coworkers and great managers. I worked flow team as well as customer service. Flow team was receiving and it was very fast paced but easy tasks.
good,Target is a good company to work for and the management try their hardest to install a sense of fun while at work. The problem is management turnover is enormous and this is very disruptive. My job meant a 4.00am start and about a 10.30am finish which is great as you have all day to do things...the downside is getting up at 3.00am. All in all a good place to wok
good,"Easy job for students. Hours are super flexible. Management is really nice, customers can be a little difficult at times though. Overall a nice place."
good,"Good work like balance. "
good,"Great place some high standards in regards to whats expected of you. Doesn't reward you for long time employment, might actually be the opposite saw a co worked get let go because it costed to much to have them around, they were young too they were just with the company so long it was cheaper to hire someone else to do their job"
good,"I enjoy working for Target... Target has given me great experience, and in a way it has change my views on different situations. It should be a requirement for everybody to work in retail, and get the experience of working with the public."
good,"If you enjoy working with the public and working in a retail environment, Target is a great place to work. Must be able to handle high volume during holidays."
good,Target is a fast paced and fun place to work. Be ready to hit the ground running and never stop. It is a very competitive place too.
good,It was a very positive environment to work in. The only downside is that I received very little training and schedules were consistently incorrect. I worked at the cash register the first day by myself. Very quickly I moved up to Guest Service to handle complicated returns and corrections.
good,"It was a nice environment, never any issues except they will get you to work different departments. When it comes to pay the raise is not good."
good,I definitely learned a lot working for Target over the past years. One of the most important skills that will follow me throughout my career would be my problem solving skills. Guests approach me with every issue you could think of and it is my responsibility to help them as best as I can. Being in this position has taught me to think on my feet and think outside of the box.
good,Most enjoyable part of the job is the people interaction and the fact that I learn something new every day.  Good teamwork and hard work.
good,Basically as a overnight logistics we helped unload all trucks over night stack boxes and replenished all empty stock throughout the store. Also helped in the freezer department as needed
good,"The management was tolerable, some supervisors actually cared about our well being. Mostly, asked for high expectations when coming into work. Other co-workers are amazing and we all help each other out as a team."
good,I was cashier here and Guest service clerk. It was a very busy environment as well fun with co-workers. I learned to do returns and exchanges and customer service. I earned to be very fast paced especially when it got busy.
good,Target is very inclusive and focuses heavily on work/life balance. There are several groups which you can participate in such as a women's business council and volunteer council.
good,Great company to work for!  I liked everything about the company culture except that it underpaid its employees.  I also feel they should provide uniforms for its employees.
good,"The company I work for is a great company. I have meet some great people while working with this company. I do a lot of lifting but it's all in a day's work. Working with this company you have to fast, fun, and friendly. The best thing about this company is that they motivate you to do better. You would have a lot of work to do in a short period of but it feel's great to get finish before the time is up. I have learned how to be a great team player."
good,Its a great place to work people are nice. atmosphere is good. Just as a cashier you don't get benifts and hours are not enough. Pay could be better.The people are nice and friendly.
good,"Target is a decent place to work for part time money at entry level. "
good,"At Target I learned to maintain a fast pace while working as part of a team with clear goals every shift."
good,Some of the managers were pretty good. I don't like how they don't take your family life in consideration. I think that was one of the reasons I was really let go because I had a funeral and my sons 1st birthday in the short time I was employed and I asked for both days off and I don't think they appreciated that.
good,"Fine Company to work for, especially if needing to work part- time. I don't have any experience since CVS has bought them. My pharmacy manager was great and got a lot of experience.."
good,Everyday is a day of great people working together to reach the goals of the store as a team. I've learned how to continue drive sales even at checkout
good,"This was a decent job. Most of the people were friendly, working directly with customers is rewarding, and while the pace was often rushed, the whole schedule was fairly relaxed. Getting anywhere within the company, however, requires a college degree. Even that of team leader, which does about the same work as those under them. This is a good place to use as a transition job, something to keep you busy and economically secure between ""real"" assignments. They are big on volunteering with the community as well, which I appreciated and joined in on."
good,Target is a great place to work just a lot of running back and forth also the staff is very great and helpful to others and helps you too.
good,The main focus was guest (customer) service. On a typical day I would help between 40-80 people. Staying up with the latest technology helps when providing information to guests.
good,"It's a chill place to work, but all you do is unload a truck and then restock shelves and backroom, nothing really cool to it and the only thing you get out of it is your paycheck."
good,"For the most part, i enjoyed my time at target. i was hired as an electronic salesman but also stocked different sections of the store and acted as a cashier. Hours changed constantly however and i was pressured to work more hours than i could because of school."
good,"Target was a fun place to work for. Although, I transferred to another store and wasn't given the same position. It was a pain to have to edure a position that didn't involve much customer service or interaction with people much at all."
good,"Best part of job is being able to make people happy when they are finding the items they would like."
good,"Meeting people is the best part of the experience. Fun and fast pace"
good,"Target was a great enough first job to have me stay for about 6 years. Here, if I had an education to fulfill or any other pressing matters, the management worked with me in understanding that sometimes certain priorities came before work. Training is highly honored in a company like this and you're truly taught how to execute client service and satisfaction."
good,"Target is an amazing place to work - daily challenges of running a retail store always keep you on your toes, and no day is ever the same. Target prides itself on the team environment created in its stores and it is a truly enjoyable place to work."
good,"A typical day would be stocking shelves with merchandise, helping guests locate items in the store, and often coming up to cashier. I learned how to help others and  problem solving skills. Management and co-workers were easy to get along with and easy to communicate. The hardest part of my job was trying to get to the call boxes before they went off to help the guest. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to know my co-workers."
good,I was hired as a  seasonal employee and enjoyed my time here. From the seasonal position I was offered a part time position. I love working here because everybody is friendly. They allow you to be cross trained in different departments which makes it so you eventually get more hours per week because you can pick up shifts in other departments than what you're scheduled for.
good,"Great place to work for..!! Very organized and clean.!! Tightly ran store. Absolutely no feed back tho on how well ""or not well"" someone is doing. There seems to be  lack of respect and communication within the young team leads. Started out feeling comfortable with this job but for some reason I began to feel uncomfortable as if I didn't fit in and I wasn't part of the team anymore."
good,"- Preparing food for customers at cafe, stocking, shelving, inventory, cleaning, greeting customers, customer service"
good,Unloading of freight truck and stocking shelves. Customer service and some cashiering. Help keep the floor and back room clean and stocked.
good,"Direct customers on sales floor and help fit products to customer’s needs. Use retail knowledge to prevent theft in various fitting rooms. Stock and organize products on sales floor. Handle cash, check, and card transactions. Sold Target Redcard memberships. Better pay than most retail stores.Co-workers are nice."
good,"The staff there was a very great staff and there was a position fit for everyone! If you aren't social or would rather be moving around, the sales floor was great for you! But for more talkative and stationary people, cashiering was great too!"
good,I'm really just writing a whole bunch of mumbo jumbo because they are requiring me to write a review and I just want to go to bed because I have to work at 6 am.
good,Great place to work. Not to difficult of work. Management is little difficult to work for. Work alone in factory setting
good,Enjoyed working here for several years. Many opportunities for growth. Dedication to training leaders and team work.
good,Target is great place to work for experience working in retail. They teach you many things everyday that would improve your performance each day in every different departments around the store
good,"Most of the employees act like a tight knit family that will quickly accept you for who you are. One specific team lead in the backroom would tend to talk down too new team members and would laugh if you didnt understand a certain situation, however the current employees were a wonder to work with, regrettfully my time there as seasonal is being cut short but if i had the chance to i would reapply in a different position"
good,"Excellent job culture , but poorly managed back in 2012 when I worked there. My father is still currently employed there and loves his position. Highly recommended!"
good,I arrive ready to get the job done. Work hard and was accurate and detail oriented. Enjoy spending time with my team members and leaders.
good,"I was only a temporary worker for remodeling that the store underwent, so I'm not sure how different working in other fields are. "
good,Working there was steady they said fast fun and freindly but it wasnt it was verry hard work but when you get use to it it becomes easyer
good,Fantastic company who really cares about their community and being all inclusive. Great prices and always a team environment.
good,"I din't spend much time working here, but I did have time to perfect my pharmacy skills. I learned drug names and indications and how to consult patients about possible side effects and interactions. Great place to work for a student."
good,"I enjoyed working here. It was a great environment, with great people. Unfortunately after being open for 2 years the place shut down permanently. I learned how to work with customers, how to accommodate their needs. My main focusing was pleasing the customers we had and making sure they left satisfied. Making customers feel that they were welcomed was important to me, customers helped us as much as we helped them. Working for this company taught me how important a healthy relationship with the customers could be. My overall experience was a lovely one."
good,"team was really cool loved working with them, easy to learn everything... worked there awhile never moved up, did everything there above pay grade"
good,"I worked the early morning crew (3am) and it was very interesting. Each day was something new. My managers were super nice and always uplifting so early in the morning, I feel that the pay could have been better, but I was getting off of work when everyone else was just getting started."
good,"It is just staffing agency."
good,"A typical work day is always great, cause i always try to make the best of it all the time.My co-workers are amazing, so friendly and enjoy having a good time at work. Management, is always on and off. I have a hunch that my management might be kinda of racist or unfair to the team ... But there's nothing we can do."
good,"I felt every day at work was different which was the most enjoyable part of my job. When I was working at target it was a good learning exp.  they were all about staying up on your training. I always felt like the management team wasn't always honest because they acted like everything was ""hush hush"" .  I didn't feel my job was secure at the end when I was off for medical reasons."
good,"working overnight"
good,I enjoyed my time at Acosta. Management was great and made sure I had everything that was necessary to do my job. Built many thriving relationship with customers.
good,"Lead a team of 30+ to unload and replenish a target store.  Also responsible for coaching, hiring and firing of team members.  Responsible for the yearly reviews as well a various store duties."
good,It's a cool place to work but the short breaks are ignoring we even have a short lunch break. We on are feet for 9 hours straight which require me to wear comfortable shoes. I like that we get to wear comfortable clothes like sweats and have water everywhere to drink. So we won't be dehydrated throughout the day
good,I liked target cause most of the staff was pretty nace and the pay was ok but most of the people on the carts team were rude to me and put me down and i got sick there
good,"From my experience they took notice of who was doing what and how, and made an effort to help people reach their full potential. From the point of an employee things seemed to work fine, but I worked nights and did not see how empty the store was."
good,Depending on the store your in depends on your job experience. My store manager if he had the confidence in you he allowed you more control but he was still final say. Next level managers are minions at best with my boss being the worst of any manager I've every worked with
good,Target is a place to work as the goals are clear and the company is heading in the right direction. A typical day at work is very positive and everyone is willing to help each other. The management is great and very inspiring.
good,"The management was pretty good, depending on who was there. The people that worked there got along pretty great. The only thing i wasn't to happy about the fact that they don't overtime."
good,"This job w's very diverse. I met a lot of different people of different backgrounds with one thing in common, the love of coffee. I learned and appreciated the things I learned as I limbed the success ladder."
good,Flexible and provides great work life balance especially for women employees. It also provides great career growth within the organization.
good,Friendly atmosphere management is knowledgeable hardest part about job is completing tasks with minimal personnel.
good,"Very good job, coworkers become family, guests become friends. Looked forward to going to work everyday. It was a very friendly job."
good,I like working around a environment that is clean and the people are nice and everybody gets a long glad I was able to become a team member at target.
good,very friendly and engaging place. so many different kinds of people. always something interesting happening. Management is pretty good also.
good,Target pharmacy has been bought out by CVS. in my experience it was a great company to work for. Very organized. Good structure in the company.
good,"Great company."
good,"I learned so much for working with target, I learned how to set end caps, back stock items,cashier,stocking items. Helping customers with their needs."
good,Being a retail worker is ok if you have amazing management team.....like all companies you get the good with the bad. I've had excellent supervisors.....not so much in the HR department
good,Staying organized knowing where certain items need to be and working fast pace helps get the job done. need to follow the rules and communicate with your co workers
good,"Working at Target has been great. I love the pace and people of retail. Target is always trying something new. However, because I don't have a college degree there is no opportunity for advancement."
good,"I would go into work at 5 in the morning and make sure the deli was ready for the deli, the management were really nice but they don't come and check on you very much there was some days where they wouldn't come over at all."
good,Great team environment to build leadership skills for those seeking to lead peers. The position as well builds skills for time management and how to handle tasks in a timely manner.
good,"Written multiple cookbooks in chef, implemented environments, roles, databags in chef for better environment management."
good,Target is a good place if you are looking for a part time job. If you enjoying helping people then this is the job for you .I love dealing wit the multitudes of different people coming through everyday.
good,I worked for target for about 2 years. The benefits were nice and the in store perks were ok. They had mandatory overtime during November to January. The most undesirable trait the company had was that there was a lot of competition for hitting your numbers(productivity) and management also picked favorites.
good,Typical day as a cashier. One of your main duties is to cross sell the red card and credit cards. Help to keep store neat and tidy when it is on the slow side.
good,I enjoyed working with my coworkers and they helped me outside in the bad weather when they could and they allowed me free drinks when it was really hot or cold.
good,Target is a great place to work. You are provided with the training to help guests and work with your coworkers and teammates to make the store a great place.
good,"My job at Target gave me the opportunity to learn new skills that are handy and useful in the workplace, as well as provide me with the knowledge and experience required for future jobs. Target provided a very diverse and welcoming environment. The hardest part of the job was working the long hour standing up and dealing with rude costumers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the fact that I was being productive and constantly engaging in social interactions. I had the opportunity to meet new people and learn about what it means to work for and earn your money."
good,"Engage with team members, help peers out in other workcenters, manage the sales floor, make sure every guest leaves happy, and protect companies assets."
good,Was a great opportunity for a student. Flexible with your schedule and is a big company so always room to grow and help customers. Co-workers are always willing to help learn.
good,"I really liked working here, especially with the culture and the sense of community that was within my store location. There seemed to always be an event in the break room or free food, or something like that. It really made me feel like I was valued."
good,"I did not work with them too long, it was only a seasonal position. Supervisors were however friendly and HR was wonderful. Co workers as well!"
good,"There isn't a typical day at Target. There is always something different going on, whether one day is busy or one, not at all. I've learned that dealing with the public is a very hard, but rewarding experience. You get to meet a lot of different people and this job has given me a lot of patience. Our managers are very reliable and will always lend a helping hand if need be. They run our store with confidence and pride and I enjoy working under them. My co-workers are from various walks of life, but we all co-exist to get our jobs done. The hardest part of the job is that sometimes equipment is hard to come by because so many departments need the same devices to complete their tasks. The most enjoyable part of Target is coming in each day to seeing co-workers and working alongside them, learning more about the job and helping guests find everything they're looking for."
good,"Great Team, Great Technology. Learned quite a bit regarding different management styles and replenishment methods."
good,Got to meet a lot of new people. Was definately a experience especially during holiday seasons when it got a little crazy. Fellow co workers were amazing!
good,"I worked at Target as a seasonal employee so myexperience may be different. A typical day at work consisted of a lot of organizing/go backs and answering people's questions. I learned a lot in regards to Target's goals and priorities and was happy to learn they value their customers. All the managers were helpful and my coworkers pleasant to work with. The hardest part of the job was having to work during the holidays, but the team makes it easy to overlook. Overall, I enjoyed working here!"
good,Overall good place to work at. Favortism is noticable here. I'm not one of them. I know it's retail but work/life balance can be better. The pay can be better. My times at this place has been an awesome and interesting journey. A lot has changed. People come and go. Go and come. There's a few of us still around. Management can be improved. Treat your workers right. Be fair. Quit the favortism. Then it will be good.
good,I learned how to work with people from all over because of my location and how to help customers find what they need as well as save money everyday.
good,The flow team is a great team to be a part of you ensure the shelves are stocked for all the customers and make sure the store is presentable nothing but great times
good,working for target was something that i really enjoyed. i loved the people i worked with and helping guests find things and assisting them in whatever way i could
good,Typical day was folding apparel and resetting the store for a 5 hour shift most nights until the store closed. Occasionally ran the cash register as needed.
good,managers do not really do their job here. after months of working at target. u can just chill for a bit. its hard for them to keep a employee especially overnight
good,"Fast pace, team orientated workplace. best part is that its overnight, easier to navigate and get things done without having to worry about customers."
good,"Good job,  indoor in AC,  management control issues,  fun team and competitive work ethics. Clean, moderate pase job hard lines and soft lines. It's a good experience to have."
good,"A typical day was pretty easy , clock in get a new name tag gave my walkie talkie and let my team know i was on the floor and available. Either go to the back and get merchandise that had to be on shelves or being to zone my section. Which included Grocery, Pets, Toys, Lawn and Garden, Beauty and Stationary. Lunch break was about 30 minutes and there was a Starbucks in the front of the store. On holidays they always served food the the employees which was very nice. I also worked overnight a couple nights doing price changes. When the front got backed up they called me to the register which i was traded for in the beginning. They time flies when you are ringing up customers. Very fast pace and that is fine with me."
good,"Every night there is a truck to unload with anywhere from 1500 - 2600 pieces, We have a target time of a hour and twenty minutes to unload, after that is complete we break down the pallets all around the store and begin to stock the store."
good,"A typical day at work will be very productive and a lot of interactions with Customers in store and over the phone. I have to make sure the fitting room and my work area is up to standards. When I first started working there the management there was the best, by far, I ever had and experience. My store manager was very friendly and professional. He was the best I ever had. All my supervisor there at the time was very knowledgeable and willing to help and teach you when you are struggling with things. My co-workers there are amazing too. They are like family. Now a lot of things has change within the year I have been there. We have all new management do to some issues. Majority of the new management are unwilling to help and not very knowledgeable about each department in the store. A lot of them say they have open door policy but when you try to explain and tell them about your concern nothing gets done about it. The hardest part of my job is to try to understand and come up with idea that is best fit for the store if I need any help. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with customers and being able to experience a work place with great people."
good,"Target was a great work environment that provided ""team building"". Worked with a good group of people, and good management staff. I enjoyed working with the company, but I worked 3rd shift. It become to much for me over time, and I needed a change."
good,"Good place to learn and grow."
good,"cleaning up before the store open, make sure break schedule is made, handle any corrective actions. I've learned to have patience and how to manage team member issues (manage my team). My co-workers and I worked very well together. We work together to get many task accomplished."
good,"Each day had it's own challenges, no typical day. Many employees have been at the facility since it opened. Large distribution center which gave you plenty of exercise from walking from section to section."
good,Target is a nice company to work for if you shop there. They discounts you can get as employee is worth it. They are a corporate company so things don't always work as they should when you have someone sitting in an office making decisions.
good,"I enjoyed the work at Target Even during a hard day, the work was manageable, and that's really all you can ask for. My biggest issue with working for Target was the management. No, there was no gross misuses of power or extreme bullying, they just weren't reliable. I had a family emergency that required me to go down and visit that member across the country. The closet time I could visit them was about two weeks after the incident occurred, more than enough time to give notice when calling off (per the company guide lines). I talked to my supervisor and put in the time off in the system as instructed, no problem. Then the schedule comes out and I'm still on for those days I called off. Confused, I talk to management and they say there was a mistake and they'll fix it. Thus began the weekly circus of checking the new schedule and finding my name on it, taking to management, them saying it'll get fixed, and it not."
good,I loved my time at target they have a lot of great people. My typical work day started at 2 sometimes 4 in the morning depending on the day the I got too doing  my job as a stocker I enjoyed everything about my job
good,I would run the store 3 to 4 days a week. When i wasn't the manager on duty  I would work in other parts of the store to help are sales and make sure all projects were done on time. I love the team and working with new people. I learned just about everything you need to know on how to run a store.
good,The biggest challenge is keeping up with the constant changing work environment.  Retail changes every day.  The thing I liked the most was developing point of sales displays and strategies.
good,"Very friendly and down to earth coworkers making the job more enjoyable. Allowed for plenty of interaction with customers. Customer service becomes difficult when dealing with difficult customers but this only allowed for situational learning and how to improve both social skills and appropriate actions under stressful or uncomfortable situations. The team leaders were all very friendly and dedicated to their job. They allowed for direction when needed and detailed instruction regarding duties. My typical day at work involved regular routines which I was able to perfect and feel confident about, allowing me to enjoy each day. Overall, I did not have any complaints with this job."
good,"I have a good experience working at there. Fast, Fun, Friendly is a slogan used in Target and I feel the same way as employee."
good,"Loved working with the different cultures of people, the non repetitive  work day, great hours and benefits. management was very thoughtful about your personal matters."
good,"Target was a great place to work until they sold to CVS. Now CVS has too many rules and regulations. The workflow is terrible, and all the new systems keep making it slower. Then they have the adacity to time you on top of it."
good,Decent job. Stocks floor and keeps presentable which is not easy when you have a whole department of isles and racks to maintain.
good,"I enjoyed working here because I always had something to do, and whenever I needed help from coworkers, I got it. Communication was difficult at times, but the job was not fast-paced as to where I became stressed."
good,"It is fun learning environment and  encouraging managers and co workers in exploring new technology.Wonderful work ethics."
good,"There is a lot of politics at Target, team members may get promoted fast than others due to team member attitude, performance and likability."
good,"Fun most of the time, mainly due to the guest and peers who constantly worked hard for you with you doing the same in return."
good,Working for Target is fun. Working with your team is like a family. I love interacting with guest and help out others. Management just focused on numbers and not workers.
good,"étiquettés, mettre les prix sur nos départements,faire le facing"
good,Customers that love to shop and enjoy interacting with employees. Environment that compassionate for the experience of citizens of america.
good,This was a great experience for someone trying to break into the world of work for the first time. I would recommend this company to anyone who wanted to get their first experience in the work force.
good,"I started as a cashier but was quickly moved to guest services. I enjoyed working with such a diverse group of co-workers. Management was very willing to promote from within based on merit, which was also very appealing. Target was a great place to work while I was settling in and learning my way around Colorado."
good,"I was hired in 2002 and stayed until 2015 I was a sales floor team member then I moved to cashier around 2008, it's not a bad place to work its just not my type of work I would do again, a normal day would be come in starts off with ringing up the purchases making sure the guests have a target red card if you don't ask they will tell you to make sure you always asks, I love the guests I had a few regular guests come through so nice"
good,Target tries to force the Redcard on customers. It would be nice to shop and not hear about a redcard. Let the customers shop without makeing them feel bad if they don't have a Redcard
good,Most enjoyable part of the job is making the store beautiful. Hardest part of the job is finding balance between home and apparel.
good,"It was a great experience. Would love to work there again! Amazing atmosphere, friendly people, great pay and loved waking up in the morning to start."
good,Great place to combine work and personal life balance. Growth is significantly good but the directions are at times not clear. Decisions are a little at laid back and focus is always at the end.
good,"I enjoyed working with a team, I learned a variety of different positions while working there, I enjoyed working with management they taught me a variety of ideas about all my positions i've had."
good,"Target is a good job, I really enjoy working with my co-workers and the management is good. A typical day is greeting and interacting with my guest, helping them find whatever they are looking for and making sure that have the best experience at our store. The most enjoyable part would have to be my guest. I love being able to help them with whatever they need. I always try to make them feel welcome."
good,Cool People Nice Environment Its A Very Fun Place To Work & Meet New People. Co-Workers Was Fun & Loving To Be Around I've Meet Alot Of New People While Working At Cedar Point
good,"Move merchandise safely using the proper equipment "
good,Worked for a fantastic boss and an amazing crew of people.  Very fast paced which made for multi-tasking and a fast day.  Dealing with doctor's offices and in person relationships.
good,A typical day at work includes unloading freight from the trucks and having the floor stocked before the store opens. I've learned how to do many things at Target. The management is understanding and my co-workers are constantly available to lend a hand. There is always something to do...day in and day out!
good,"The pharmacy was usually fairly busy. I interacted with lots of patients and helped to solve problems in the pharmacy. I learned how a lot about drugs and how to work with a team. I learned how to use a pharmacy computer system. I really liked working with my team because everyone is so willing to help out. The hardest part of my job is probably trying to explain why medications are so expensive or that insurance won't pay for them. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to build relationships with the patients that come in and hopefully, making a positive impact on their lives by giving them a good experience and information to maintain their health."
good,"* I enjoyed working there just not enough work and hours."
good,A typical Day at work was mostly busy on weekends. and slow on the weekdays. target cooperation team members worked as a team. each employee had a job to do but if times get stressful we was all responsible for helping each other out.
good,"The Visual Merchandising Leader is a new role, so it is still evolving. The company is wonderful to work for, so many great positive people."
good,"Decent bosses that have a lot to handle and do, a diverse range of employees. I would stock shelf's, help out in other departments. they did follow the laws when it came to breaks unlike McDonalds, and would sometimes reward the crew if we did what we needed to, in a quickly and  orderly fashion"
good,"in the 2 1/2 years of employment learned a great deal about the store work as a cashier, work on ad sets, worked on pogs, also worked a brand team member"
good,This was my first job and I really enjoyed working for the company.  I worked here for many years.  I worked at two different location and the second one is why I decided to work elsewhere
good,I loved working on the Target team.  I made a lot of great forever friends.  I was able to learn how to work my way up the chain and have fun while doing it.
good,"scheduled hours are flexible, good managers and the co-workers are very friendly. Managers need to work on their managing skills. The hardest part of the job is hours and not having enough people on the schedule."
good,"Reasonable Pay and advancement abilities."
good,"At Target, we would start off our shift restocking the store while walking around helping any customers/guest that may need our help. I've learned that customer service matters a lot. For example, a business cannot continue if we did not give great guest service. The management at target was good, but could be more improved. The Co workers were wonderful, friendly, and helpful! The hardest part of this job was not having enough resources to use for our guest. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and making new friends with new co workers or customers!"
good,Target is definitely a fun place to work with options to move up but the management needs a lot of work. Ethics and morals are definitely in need of a good fix.
good,"It was a great experience working at target, a place where you can grow fast. Most of management was great, and very understanding if there was a problem. Coworkers were great and fun to work with."
good,Target warehouse has a fun fast paced work environment with great pay and benefits. the work is steady so there is no layoff and plenty of optional overtime available.
good,"Depends on which location... started off as a seasonal worker and had the opportunity to stay after the holidays but I wasn't comfortable with working in my department with the workers I had. Very relaxed work environment but still there is a general understanding about the expectations for the brand,"
good,"As a sales associate,i helped the customers and                         helped maintained the neatness of the store. Great people,wonderful environment. Everyone helped each other out. Friendly co-workers and customers."
good,Target is a great starter job for high school and college attending students. The work inviroment is fast pace withe decent pay
good,"The ""big guys"" that you work for are very nice and understanding, Some of the GSTL's have attitude problems and take their jobs waaaay too seriously. They are very rude but I guess that is wherever you work."
good,"Retail is demanding with unpredictable hours and less than desirable pay.  However, the customer service skills I acquired are invaluable."
good,Target was a great company to work for. The management at my location was extremely caring and attentive. They were always around to help with a question or a customer.
good,"Lately there has been an unfortunate cut in hours even though productivity has gone back up. Things can get a little tough, I mostly work in the clothing department, and it is the heart of the store. We can be put anywhere and often times have to help pull the entire store together, while also acting as cashiers and service desk operators. However, if the rolls are reversed softlines is often left in the dust and expected to pull together on our own. I will say that my co-workers are amazing and much of the management team is easy to deal with."
good,"I was not a full employee with Target, I was a volunteer through the pharmacy portion and wasn't associated with the Target management. However, from what I experienced with the pharmacists, the employees are very kind and provide a safe and comfortable work environment. The pharmacists were very insightful and taught me how to do the daily tasks of a pharmacists."
good,Assist guests by educating them with knowledge about our store products. Engage by providing them swift and efficient service.
good,"Management is wonderful will always work with your schedule."
good,"challenging work area that keeps you busy and productive."
good,working at target was fun and the people were great but the guest are unappreciative and will not hold back even when they are wrong
good,"Same as the previous review, I must have made a mistake because its making me do a target review for a second time. i am just filling in more words to be able to click preview so i can delet this"
good,Like working for any department store it has its good and bad days. The work is not too difficult and easy to get along with other employees.
good,I worked with Target for 3 years & it was an amazing place to learn new things.People are very Productive & very much helping in nature.
good,"um lugar maravilhoso de trabalhar, porem precisava de estrutura"
good,"A typical day at work would consist of helping customers with any question about an item or the store that they may have. Also encouraging customers to purchase additional items while promoting the company card. I learned how to work in a customer friendly environment while pushing sales, I also learned how to get my task completed in a timely fashion, majority of the times before the deadline. Managers were a delight to work with, we worked together in order to get the job done. They were friendly and informative on how the job should be done. My co-worker were harder working, and friendly individuals. we all took the same positive attitude, and serious approach to making sure the work was complete which we were always successful in doing so. The hardest part was part of the job was clocking put because we all enjoyed each others company and loved getting our job complete. the most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with everyone from managers to co-workers to customers, and also being able to put a smile on the customers faces and having them leave the establishment satisfied and getting all my work done before the deadline. It was a overall great experience to say the least."
good,was a great company to work for a few things could be adjusted to help further good employees. in order for others that are good that haven't been to college there should be a system set in place to where they can move up when in the company.
good,As an Executive at Target you learn how to multitask and work under pressure. Leading a large group of team members from different backgrounds stretches your skill set on a daily basis. Leveraging your resources along with strategizing our key aspects of the day to day life at Target.
good,"Good place to work, learned to work within a team, gained skills in customer services, and general on goings of retail. Learned cashier duties, front end goal such as promoting red cards, dealing with difficult costumers, assisting with costumer inquiries and requests"
good,Nice place of employment.  I learned about setting up displays.  I learned how to properly delegate responibilities.  I had to hire and fire employees.
good,"Challenging but rewarding. I sold more red cards than any other employee, within the holiday season. I worked very hard and wished there would have been greater opportunities for advancement."
good,"I have learned to work with others,customers comes first and how to follow safety rules and also how to keep a safe and clean environment."
good,"Typically I am very busy at my position, because I have two jobs; answering and directing incoming phone calls, and attending to and assisting guests in the fitting room. This position has taught me how to work in a stressful and busy environment successfully. The training is great and their flexibility with my availability is amazing. I have had great superiors and equal co-workers alike. This is a great place to work, whether part-time while attending college or full-time as a career; Target offers plenty of room for promotion and improvement."
good,"Working at target was fun, it was a job were no team member was left behind. We all unloaded the truck then we all went out to the floor to put the items were they belonged. Target is a fast pace job and i enjoyed working with the company."
good,"Fast, Fun, Friendly working environment. Team environment with great company culture. Easy to get along with other peers and supervisors. Great promotional ability within the company."
good,"Typically a very busy environment with many customers coming in and out every day. Customers come first, obviously, so it can be difficult to complete other tasks. Managers (and corporate) push team members to get people to sign up for redcards."
good,In this Retail Environment there was a lot of turnover in Management and a somewhat lax education of policy within that management which resulted in confusion and became inconsistent.
good,The work area is very unorganized because of there understaffed teams always causes a problem for the day and the workers are very lazy and don't care. As well as the managers do not know how to schedule team members the correct hours.
good,steady paced and always worked with friendly and patient co workers the customers at the store were always very easy to get along with and understanding when something wasnt my fault.
good,"Wasn't bad for a first job. Lot of responsibility for little amount of pay, worked in electronics and customer service and did enjoy my time when I was there."
good,"This position only benefitted people who would work crazy hours to start. When I started they expected me to come in for four hour shifts. And when I had any emergencies that would make me an hour to two hours late, instead of accepting a call out they would tell me to come in to work a two hour shift."
good,Job is very Physically demanding with long hours. The compensation makes up for the difficulty of the work. Management requirements are no experience required so they many times have no idea what is going on. Absolutely no room for advancement the promise is there but the steps to gain advancement are impossible. The time frame for advancing is in years after you have meet the requirements. Once hired you are in a dead end when pay (three years) is maxed there is nothing else to look forward to but more vacation. This may be a limited experience based on location but management is afraid to back you for promotion because workers know more than they will every know about the business due to the high turnover rate of management.
good,Target has provided plenty of opportunities for individual growth and development. It is however difficult to advance within the company because there is no clear path for promotion. The culture depends tremendously on the management of each building. My co-workers are like family and make me look forward to going to work each day. The hardest part of the job is the constantly increasing workload. The most enjoyable part of the job are the hours and the variety of daily tasks that prevent the job from becoming mundane.
good,great team members and leaders. business was slow  fun place to work too bad it closed and is no longer open good job though
good,"There wasn't a ""typical"" work day at Target. Every shift had uncertainty that was followed by an increased workload. The work was fair and the pay was decent. Unlike some of the supervisors, the team members were fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was getting customers or ""guests"" to sign up for the store's REDcard and if quotas weren't met, threats of being dismissed were made, even if you were a superb cashier. What was even harder was having to promote the store card to familiar faces who already declined the offer. The most enjoyable part of the job was ringing up groceries. It was a fast and fun task that kept me busy and made the time move faster."
good,"This was a fun place to work at, but once you got to the management level there was a lot of undue stress.  Depending on your manager, really depends on your work life balance.  Most care about your family but others don't.  There were more that didn't than did."
good,I think working at target gave me a sense of knowledge of what should and shouldn't happen in the work place. Its a nice place to work for younger people just starting out but I don't think its would be good as a long term career.
good,Target has its benefits. They definitely support education and very flexible to all kinds of schedules. Very respectful staff and plenty of room for opportunity.
good,"You get out what you put into it. If you work hard, you get more opportunities for advancement. You can always pick up and switch shifts."
good,Every day at work can be the same depending on the time that you work. you are always learning new things when doing projects and is put in charge on completing that task. the objective is to make the story look nice and give good customer service.
good,"All in all Target was a great place to work, I met a lot of great people there, I think I also grew as a person from working there."
good,The clinic experience was very informational. I learned so much about handling insurance and keeping the clients informed on the latest health news. I also learn how to do medical coding which I found very interesting.
good,"Once at work we would set up in stock room, about 16 employers in front of conveyer belt. Two of us would start unloading truck, the rest would palletize items as they came down conveyer. Was fast paste and fun. After truck was unloaded we would take items to department floor and stock items in location of product. the hardest part of job was using CPU scanner some times item was not easy to locate were it was or needed to go but over all work was easy and fun sometimes felt like we were bowling while unloading pallets. co-workers were kind and relaxed always helping when needed"
good,"I do really like the company, But it's the management in my current location that I don't like. It's obvious that they don't know how to run the flow team portion of the store."
good,Everyone is easy to work with for the most part. Target has definitely helped me grow within my work ethic. Management is pretty great with the exception of one or two higher ups. overall would recommend working here.
good,"Everyday is something different at target its a good job you meet new people everyday some are friendly and some are ehh lol but in all its fun meeting new people also management is ok, co workers always helping you out when you need them."
good,I worked with Target for 15 years. I enjoyed learning and worked with great people. I loved the one on one guest related experiences.
good,"Fun place to work, flexible hours. The pay is decent for a college student or someone who has other support. The managers are pretty cool though, and it's an easy going environment. If you work night/early morning crew you can have headphones! :)"
good,A typical day work would consist of unloading trucks. I learned how to paste myself and not to get tired so fast with the big items.  Because I was under temp service I really didn't work with management.  There wasn't a hard part to this job. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with different people.
good,Stable and inclusive corporate environment. Compensation is wanting.  Retail and retail-like environment and work hours that coincide.
good,Typical day at work would interact with about 50 or more people answering there questions and attending to there needs about the store.
good,Great people to work with. Learned a lot about managing the team in terms of gaining desired productivity and controlling absenteeism and other performance issues.
good,"While working at Target I learned a wide variety of operations, whether handling transactions at the cash register or stock control, I was taught the importance of customer service and how to handle myself in the presence of an unhappy customer."
good,"This is a nice place to work, and I really enjoy my job.  I get to interact with customers primarily in the electronics department, but I also am in toys, sporting goods, market and more.  Target won't give me the necessary hours to receive benefits, and are reducing hours store wide to the point that I cannot even support myself even though I am working hard."
good,"Busy about every day with serving guest a smile on my face. Busy with zoning and stocking the shelves on the front lanes."
good,Great place to work it was a fun training program and I wish it was just full time instead of part time work I had a great time working for this company
good,"Push the racks and clean the aisle, help the customers with any items they need.I learned from the customers that is important to have communication skills."
good,"Good job for the pay. Co-workers are friendly and guests are, for the most part, pleasant. The job is a relatively low stress position and the pay reflects this."
good,"Despite being one of the lowest paying jobs I have ever had, I love this company. They treat their workers fairly, and provide a work culture that very positive and incomparable to any of the other companies I have worked for."
good,"I enjoying working but it is Target.  Target ios better than Wal-mart so if you are choosing, choose Target. You will not be disappointed."
good,"Employment at Target, for just over five months now, has been rewarding mostly in that it gave me the opportunity to dive back into a hands-on work environment after 6 continuous years as a university/graduate student. My current job enabled me to lose some weight I'd gained sitting behind a desk during graduate school, as well as bolstering my confidence in confronting unexpected situations (hard-to-please guests, infrastructure failures, logistical errors, etc.). Nonetheless, there are only so many skills to be picked up as an employee in the Logistics/warehouse side of retail, and little room for advancement as long as more experienced employees retain their positions. Job security can be a stressful issue, as I am painfully aware that in spite of my effort to be consistent, diligent, and hardworking, my place can still, in theory, be taken by any of dozens of possible candidates."
good,"I believe the benefit Target offers their employees are above average. You have medical, dental, vision, plus with enough time in you get pension paid by Target, plus a 401k that they match a certain percentage. My time with Target was very educational and financially helped with retirement."
good,"as a backroom team member, you will have to work at a fast pace. it requires a lot of physical activity. backroom team members get along very well."
good,"Working at Super Target has been a lot of fun. It teaches you many things such as patience with irate customers and how to work fast yet friendly, While the company is great to work for, there can only be so much challenge in the monotonous routine and I am ready to find something more challenging than just cashiering."
good,"Most of the co workers are enjoyable to work with, but management is a mess. The schedule is constantly being screwed up and availability being ignored on multiple people"
good,"I enjoyed working at Target, there was a lot of fun people there.  These right people made it enjoyable to do the work that was required of you.  I think that if Target had come into Canada differently they would still be here, i think they opened to many stores of the hope. The customers where also part of the problem expecting it to be like target in the states when that's not possible, with the laws being different and so"
good,"Fast paced work, with moderately high expectations. Safety oriented, however numbers are high on the list. Attention to detail is a must."
good,"I worked in the backroom section, also known as the logistics.  This part of Target is unseen by guest and where a lot of workers are the proverbial busy bees that run around filling the store's sales floor.  I enjoyed my co-workers there and I would gladly work with them again."
good,I really enjoyed working here because i could take as many days off as i would like. The pay was above minimum wage and they generally treat their employees with respect and as an employee if you felt disrespected by management there is a help line that you can call that will help settle the problem and it really did put some managers in their place.
good,"cool staff, everyone cared for on another and we really worked hard. I liked working there because we all just did our job and no one got angry at us."
good,its usually busy with long lines the management doesn't really know how to keep the customers happy but they know how to keep it all organized with one line then multiple. at target if you hit your 5th hour and haven't taken your lunch you will get in trouble for it. the managers are unorganized when it comes to the breaks and gets everyone late and in trouble.
good,Target had many perks and benefits to working there. The corporation has no issue with showing gratitude towards their workers
good,"Point of Sale Cashiering, Customer Service and Sales."
good,Management and my co-workers at Target are nice.  The work is not extreme but can be fast-paced at times.  I enjoy the atmosphere in my current position.
good,The hardest part of my daily job was making sure all the inventory was going to the appropriate ship locations. The most enjoyable things that I've done on the job was customer service.
good,was in charge of setting up the conveyor racks for loading and or unloading trucks.got trucks unloaded and or loaded at a timely efficient manor. keeps floor cleaned of boxes and such making it a safe work place.
good,Go in do the job and its a great place to earn some costumer experience. Everyone is helping out and makes sure the job gets done at the end of the day.
good,"Everyday is different, there are always tasks to do and customers to help. The hardest part of the job is completing tasks and handling as customer needs all at once."
good,Managers are flexible and reliable.  Reasonable amount of time for breaks and lunch.  Training is available for most positions.  Customers are much better than at Wal-Mart.
good,"This place was okay until they closed. Management was cool, no hotheads. Had a good time working here until they shut down."
good,"So far so good as far as the actual work load. It is what was described during the interview process. The schedule is inconsistent and though I was given a set schedule, it has not been what was promised. Overall, I do enjoy the atmosphere and co-workers. My only complaint is the unset schedule."
good,High energy and challenging work environment.  Working through an incredible amount of change which is exciting but not always productive.  Focus is on leadership behaviors but with all the change and ambiguity there is often room for subjectivity.  Really smart people.
good,Worked overnight and it was an amazing experience. Possibility of learning new things everyday whether it be from your co-workers or your Team Leads.
good,"I enjoy keeping busy, working with customers to find items, providing the best customer service. I work with a great team of people, they are very helpful and pleasant."
good,A typical work day for me is returning items for our guest and answering phone calls. I learned how to type faster and greeting customers on the phone. The hardest part was when I was unsure of a return or a problem and no one was around. The most enjoyable part was knowing I completed my job successfully and was able to assist the customers with their needs.
good,Everything is red and l loved it cause it felt like Christmas. First Job learned a lot that further helped my carrier in customer service. Work place was always held at a service with a smile. Best first job I could have asked for.
good,"Able to talk with guest and assist them with little to no supervision. Fast pace, fun to problem solve with the guest. Seasonal was the best because you got to stay busy."
good,"looks out for each other"
good,"Target is a great place to work part time or full time if you are looking for extra cash or a place to start a career, the managers are very hands on, happy, and supportive."
good,Management is real strict but are so supportive. Management will help out with any task that you can not complete on your own.
good,"Its overwhelming, its brutal, its retail.  This job is ever changing and never ending.  If you enjoy a fast pace work environment that is like a screaming toddler in the toy aisle, this is the place for you."
good,"Target does a good job regulating time for all Team Members, but there is a vast lack of communication between the leaders.  On several occasions I was written up for No Call No Shows because a leader forgot to document that I had spoken with them.  Also, leaders often fail to communicate with team members, which causes confusion and strife when things do not get done for special events or visits.  Also, training seemed to be very lax towards food areas as there were very few people trained to cover an area for breaks or meals.  If someone called out, the area was often closed because there was nobody else available to handle operations in the work center."
good,"great team of coworkers and had snacks during holidays, customers were hard to deal with at times complaining about the lack of stock on shelves"
good,Productive work place with supportive team and management. Opportunity for advancement. Provide a team environment that allows everyone to thrive.  Very inclusive atmosphere.
good,"Been working with the company for a while i like it, but i am ready for something more challenging. Where i can show my skills better."
good,Very busy office with great staff and patients.  There was always something new to learn. Helpful staff with a lot of patience.
good,"I took this job as a cashier for extra money, I enjoyed working there, they made you feel like a team, and I also enjoyed interacting with the guests."
good,Management is encouraging and helpful but has access to limited budget to allow the employees enough hours to be full time.
good,Not enough employees. Management needs training and not just promoted because who you know. The people and guests are fun.
good,"Supervisors and Team Leads are nice and friendly. Willing to work with you if you need anything or want extra hrs. For as moving up in the ranks, it takes awhile and you have to truly put in the work."
good,"This was a good part time job. It was a fun place to work, but understaffed at some times. I was hired as part time, but they would always schedule me for 35 hours or more which is why I ended up quitting."
good,"Management kept all personnel informed of all daily activities, including any errors and outstanding performance."
good,"Young mindset with innovative thinkers. Target was growing rapidly but almost too fast at the cost of it's own success. Very top heavy and they made the right decision to slim. I was a manager that oversaw a team based in Healthcare Support. I funneled all communication from stores, Headquarters and our vendor through my team to research. Every morning was emails for about an hour, support focus for the last half. Touch base with team, then meetings based on projects. Lunch would be emails or some strategy work for myself. I would then have some time to further my plans in the mid afternoon, wrapping up with store touch bases."
good,TARGET is a fun place to work. everyone is friendly and the employees strive to make guest happy. Its a brand new store and its always clean
good,"Provided knowledge about electronics sold in the department. informed customers about insurance and return policies. sold add ons to electronics bought, insurance on items over a certain price."
good,"Working at Target was a fun, fast paced job which required me to focus and always be ready for something new."
good,Target was very accommodating. They were more then willing to work with my physical needs during and after my pregnancy. A slight bit of in house favoritism and promotions based on popularity over more concrete reasons. But overall a wonderful experience.
good,During the week it's steady and busy overall. The weekends are the busiest in my location. If a team member does not know a specific answer for a guest we ask and help each other the best way we can. Working as a team is the best way to make sure the store can function at its best.
good,"Thoroughly enjoyed working for Target for a number of years.  Provided an excellent environment to build my leadership skills, try many new things, and work with incredible talent."
good,"The store manager is distant."
good,Very friendly team until your in a bind and then they turn their backs on you and leave you hanging even when it's for medical reasons.
good,"a typical day for me Would Be Stocking And Restocking items , assisting customer with What they were looking For ,"
good,"A typical day at work involved me processing transaction, stocking certain areas in the front of the store, maintaining a clean work space, assisting customers in various transactions, questions and problems pertaining to the store itself and the products available. "
good,this was a fun job with a lot of different people to meet everyday. ringing up customers and listening to them tell you about themselves is very interesting.
good,I gained a lot of confidence to work in the Pharmacy with the supportive management group with the exposure to the Kroll system.
good,This was a great job for a high school student who wanted to come back for breaks during college. The work environment was good and management treated the employees very well.
good,A fun place to work. My management was supportive. Since it is such a big store and there are several managers it did seem a bit impersonal at times. But also being a big store there are lots of different ways to grow and develop. The job was not monotonous because of this.
good,A great place to work. Meeting all types of people and help other is my passion. Management are very supportive and they work well with hours for a 2nd job.
good,They have very friendly environment. Management is knows its employees. They are very good to their customers. They are understanding with employee issues and will adjust.
good,"It was a decent paying job that allowed me to work around school, 10% off was by far the best perk.  allowed me to gain better employment in the future."
good,"very fast paced, fun place to work. Staff was helpful. Management was friendly, liked interact with employees and guests. Flexible when it comes to school"
good,"While I started at Target when I was 16yrs old I was just a part time cashier since I was still in high school. Once I turned 18 I got promoted and then worked hard everyday. Theres always plenty of work and always plenty of hours. The one issue I had was some of the executives just look at numbers and not at the daily task and challenges. All they cares about was making corporate happy. Some goals were hard to reach when the company is making $300,000+ a day."
good,"Target was a great place to work. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable and always willing to help. The training was user friendly and easily accessible. A typical day included zoning assigned areas either in softlines or hardlines, providing customer service and cashiering as needed to keep lines down. While on the register and the floor I shared information with our guests about the benefits of the Target Red card and the Target app."
good,It was very well managed. The holiday time was relatively stress free with plenty  of hours to go around. After the holidays it is hard to get hours though.
good,This job is very busy as well as challenging. For me the hardest part of this job is balancing the various tasks that come with the overall job. I've learned to be organized and pay attention to detail. The most enjoyable part for me is working with my colleuges and getting to know our guests as well as accompolishing all the tasks that I am expected to complete throughout each day.
good,It's hard work but the job is as good is only hard if you make it so. The people you work with really make a difference on whether the day is long or easy.
good,"I already very much enjoy interacting with people - both singular and in massive groups.  Working at Target allows me to continue helping people with various retail needs.  I enjoy the challenges of problem solving and the pay-off when a guest is thrilled with my service.  Managing a large group of employees also positively tests my patience and multi-tasking skills.  The hardest part of my job is effectively balancing running a 'tight ship' as well as letting the staff have fun.  My employees do very repetitive work, so as their boss, it is fun to find new ways to make their shifts energetic and quick.  I also love training or 'grooming' employees for my position - as talent management within the company is very important."
good,"I've heard it has changed greatly since I have left. My review would not be topical."
good,Overall a fun and challenging place to work but with some management problems and with emphasis on certain things that I found unnecessary and of putting to customers. Also the vehement anti union rhetoric and the forcing of employees to work outside of areas covered by their job description was unacceptable. Overall though interacting with guests and working in my own workcenter was awesome.
good,Very good place to work. Lot of things to learn everyday with fast placed agile and speed to market environment. Very rewarding work culture.
good,"workplace was friendly and helpful, the only downside is that in the position that I was in it was understaffed and I would end up having to do 10 hours worth of work on my own"
good,Target is a very fun to build a career from.  Team members are recognized for their hard work and determination. Members are encouraged to become leaders in the store and many managers will assist you in preparing for such leadership.
good,Everyone I worked with was very friendly. Very team oriented and organized. Would work there again. No alot of room for advancment.
good,"A typical night shift at work as a Target Salesfloor Team Member is you come in and work pulls and reshop, then after pulls are done you jump right into zone while helping guests (customers) in between your tasks. Your coworkers (team members) are fun to work with."
good,"I put away items and help guests find what they need.  Nothing really hard about this job, you basically do the same thing everyday"
good,"Good work environment, lots of benefits. Great starting place for a business/retail minded individual. A good place to move up through company and reach your goals."
good,"it was always busy, there was always something new to do. my co worker were really nice and fun to work with. i really like it i got to meet a lot of nice people everyday."
good,"A typical day at work was making and retrieving phone calls, scheduling appointments, promoting the discounts and special offers around the store to customers. When they come in for their appointment, you had to help them decide what would be the best portrait package that would fit their desires. Come up with creative ideas for the shoot. Take their pictures then edit them with their involvement. Afterwards, schedule their pick-up and register them. Also you were in charge of making any special orders. I learned that you have to be a quick problem-solver, be creative, organized, give great customer service, and be very enthusiastic. My manager very skilled at the business. She had a lot of sales knowledge and she would always find a way to communicate with me. My coworkers were pretty cool, we all helped each other out. The hardest part for me at that time was getting hours. The most enjoyable part was making appointments."
good,I learned that everyone has their own was oh doing things at target and the team generally works together to get the job done i enjoyed the early hrs.
good,Enjoyable work and interaction with customers. Multiple tasks performed to be proficient in several areas of the store. Friendly over head staff made the time go faster.
good,"Fast paced work. Unload freight off of a truck onto pallets accordingly. Take pallets to correct aisle and put items in correct place on shelves. Clean up after yourself as you go. Rotate food according to FIFO(First In, First out)"
good,"Some of the most creative and smart people I have ever worked with were at Target.  While the culture can be cult-ish, the level of talented people there is impressive"
good,Most days at work were the same depending on your location. The job did not have a balanced schedule and depending on supervisor some employees got more hours while others got less. It allowed one to learn what is expected of a big named company.
good,Good work place. Mostly everyone are team players. I personally love the other team members. Some days are hectic. Works around your schedule.
good,"I really enjoyed working there. I would help the customers, stock the shelves, clean up the store at night, The manager were good."
good,"Good place to start into the workplace and work enviroment. Reptitive, but you learn time management and how to organize and some resources for advancement in leadership skills."
good,"Target prides themselves on providing great product for their loyal customer base, at competitive prices. Their stock system is constantly up to date so you truly know if something is in stock or not."
good,"i worked there a long time ago, but Target trained me for my future accomplishments in retail.  They are very organized and their stores stay immaculate."
good,"My immediate supervisors were very helpful when in training and beyond. As I was in the Deli department, I didn't have the opportunity to get to know team member, but the deli afforded us a sense of community. The only drawback is my observation that much food is wasted which could have been donated to the less fortunate."
good,"Maintained a good accuracy when pulling the products to the floor, had a good understanding of the PDA system and responded to the team members requests fast."
good,"Come in started making pizzas, hotdogs, and popcorn, as the day would go by we would end up throwing away hundreds of pizzas a day."
good,"Target is a nice environment to work in.  A typical day at work would consist of Unloading the freight from a trailer, take product to sales floor and stock everything until shelves are fool of product or until freight is complete.  Anything left over gets taken to storage for back-stocking.  "
good,"I think my negative experience came from me never working retail before and not knowing what I was really getting myself into. My official job title was a cart attendant, however, they had me as a back up cashier, at the customer service desk, and as a janitor. It became very difficult for me to collect all the carts in the summer heat with no electric cart trolley. It was all hand pushed up a parking lot on a huge hill, I wasn't very durable. "
good,"A typical work day include but not limited to, prolong standing and walking around apprehending shop lifters and greeting customers."
good,Target may have been my first job but it was a very good experience with a fun atmosphere and a great team to work with. I enjoyed my time at target and was very sad to leave and even more sad when I heard it was closing.
good,"Had a great experience working here, very friendly, laid back environment, the job was never too demanding and paid well."
good,The most enjoyable part of this job was working with my co workers and helping our customers. The way we had to keep our work stations clean and neat was also a plus.
good,Friendly place to work.  Would recommend to others.  Big emphasis on developing yourself and others.  Only pitfalls are ones you would expect to encounter at any major retail company.
good,great place to work i enjoyed my short time there the co workers were great i can honestly say target was a blast to work there
good,Travaille parfait pour une étudiante. Recomende pour toute personne cherchant un premier emploie.
good,The job environment was great and i really enjoyed working there. They just didnt think i was the right fit. Management was friendly for the most part. Words just got around that werent true in the slightest and those were believed over mine.
good,the environment and the people are fun to be around but waking up early to go to work is not fun and it is a lot of lifting. I learned to be determined and a hard worker. a normal day involves getting to work at 4 AM and than unloading truck and getting the items on to the floor.
good,"Really enjoyed working with my co-workers and supervisors. Going to work was always a positive experience. Just wish the pay, benefits, and advancement opportunities would have been better."
good,"Overall great company to work for."
good,Target is a pretty great place to work for overall. I unload and detrash new product that come off the trucks in the early morning shift. I've learned to be part of team and work together to complete task in an effective and timely manner. My team leads at Target are some what unprofessional and I think they have room for growth in certain areas. My fellow team members I work with are absolutely amazing I truly treasure their input when it comes to work related situations.
good,"Target was a great place to work. However, I wish I could have gotten more hours. I commuted thirty minutes for each shift and some shifts were only four or five hours long. My team was great and I loved working with them, we were usually a very well oiled machine working together. Everyone plays an important role in keeping things running smoothly and communication is key in that role. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing guests receive quality customer service from my minimum knowledge of basic procedures. I do what I can to help both Team Members and guests have an enjoyable experience."
good,"There is much to do in this store. You will have numerous guests to serve, many tasks to comoplete during your shift. It can be fun if you're up for it."
good,well I go from section to section of the store stocking all of the shelves making sure that the products are at the right place and displayed neatly
good,"I learned a ton working for this company, and was able to explore multiple fields of interest over the course of my time there.  Supported to transfer teams if the skills fit. Ability to make quick decisions is limited, despite focus on that right now."
good,"Typical day at Target for the team I was apart of was usually bland with us scanning and stocking items. Despite the dullness of the work, I was able to find enjoyment in interacting with guests as well as my coworkers."
good,Job was fun and sometimes hard but it was a nice experience to learn to interact with customers. Typical workday was coming in and getting ready for a long shift with not that many customers during day hours but an increase during the night hours. Co-workers were somewhat lazy and lenient to rules and I had to motivate certain individuals who would procrastinate.
good,Target hires some of the most amazing people to work along side. They have high standards for hiring Talent. I have met many of my greatest friends and mentors through this company.
good,"Fun place to work, amazing co-workers, everyone working as a team very helpful and friendly to each other. something new to learn everyday"
good,The most enjoyable part of my day is knowing that I have completed my routines for the day and have saved the store from any losses and knowing that the team worked safe and there were no team injuries or guest injuries. The management team that I work with are a great team and the team members that I work with are awesome. The team understands the importance of the shortage and inventory.
good,"I would arrive around 10:15 pm. My shift starts at 10:30 pm. I greet my co-workers and then clock in. I go to the backroom, get to my position in the line and start place items in their correct piles. When the truck is empty; we grab pallets and start rolling the piles in their designated area of the store. Once there are no more piles in the backroom, we start emptying boxes, and put those items on shelves for the next 3 1/2 hours then we take our first lunch break. Once lunch is over we get back at it for another 3 1/2 hours for our second lunch break. Then I continue my shift for another 4 hours, and when 7 am comes around it's time for me to leave."
good,"For many, retail is challenging, so I keep that in mind. However, the management and fellow employees understand this, so, no matter how difficult your customers are throughout the day, there is always someone to confide in. I have learned excellent people skills because even the meanest people seem nice compared to some people."
good,I enjoy working for Target but there is little opportunity for a full time job. Very flexible when needing time off. I have worked at Target for 4 years and we are finally getting a management team that sticks around. For awhile it was like a revolving door. It is nice to work with the same team for more than a few months.
good,I started out as a sales floor team member and was promoted to electronics team member. Electronics was more fast paced and you were to work more independently. Had to review new products when came in and provide guest with the same knowledge when asked.
good,"sales floor- clock in sign out a walkie talkie and my device, announce over the walkie talkie that you are starting your shift. Check pull line for items that need to go out on the floor, put away reshop, zone your area"
good,i think they should have tried to work with their employies a little more who were struggling. for example; i got kicked out and was trying to find somewhere to stay at the age of 18 while i worked there and they dint really try to understand me. i couldnt make it in because i didnt always have a ride or a place to sleep for that matter and they acted like they didnt care
good,Not a great company to work for when you have a family to support. Will be told will be full time and then managers change their mind. Scheduled very few hours. get in trouble for taking scheduled breaks.
good,"A typical day at work consists of folding and organizing clothes as well as answering the phone"
good,"Target it is the second-largest discount retailer in the U.S.A. When the company was opened in the Canada I had a opportunity to work there."
good,"Target was my first job and i loved it at first but the management needs improvement. Other than that, the people were great and it was always a fun work environment."
good,Great people and company to work for. The retail life is self explanatory. If you are driven and motivated in the industry you can go far.
good,Coworkers and management were encouraging of continuing education and were willing to work around school schedules making school the priority. They were always friendly and willing to help out where needed and when necessary.
good,"Pay structure is lacking. A bachelor's degree is required to really move up in the company. Decent benefits. Clean, friendly work environment."
good,Target is a great place to work. If you are trying to advance you have to make sure that you are consistent in training and knowing policies
good,"Flexible"
good,"The work was interesting and the people I met were great. Customer service is a thankless job for the most par, but Target made an effort to make me feel valuable."
good,A typical day at Traget is very fast pace and very business. What I did not like about Target is that the management was not good. The hardest part of about this job is that you never know what kind of customers you will deal with and they can be pretty rude at times.
good,"For me a day at Target generally includes being assigned an area to maintain thru your shift, helping guest with any questions and supporting the front of the store cashiers whenever they need assistance."
good,The management varies store to store. Many stores are extremely leader heavy and those leaders micro-manage all employees no matter how long they have worked there.
good,"I was only at Target for a short time, but they made me feel welcome and I really enjoyed the time that I was there. All of the management staff was easy to get along with and they made me fel like part of the team."
good,Because of this job and the demanding responsibilities I really took into consideration the direction in which I was heading with my career choices. This job made me focus on the specific path I wanted to take and I'll always be grateful for that. I appreciate the team and the enthusiasm that is behind the target team everyday.
good,"A good place to work. Co workers are friendly and nice to work with."
good,i saw a lot of changes that could have been made thus allowing the    center to run more like a well oiled machine. This would time and affect the bottom line in a positive way.
good,"A typical day involves making sure the Softlines area (clothing department) is Brand; communicating and following directions is key and I follow through, making sure my area is clean at the end of the day. "
good,"We began at close and proceeded to look over schematics, remove product from shelving, move and reset the shelving and replace any remaining product, pull new stock from backroom and place that on the shelves. Signage accuracy and price changes. The management was limited overnight to a supervisor and m;y co-workers were about 5-6 amazing people. "
good,I would go in and unload trucks then push the product out on the floor. We would do instocks and pulls and have certain tasks that were to be done each day. It was my job to make sure the team members completed all of these tasks. I was in charge of preparing for inventory and making sure we were ready for the inventory on the day it was scheduled. I completed the interview process for the incoming team members and also was responsible for counseling the teams members that might at some point need corrective guidance.
good,"Target is a great place to work and an incredible opportunity to build your resume, learn and build great relationships!"
good,"Aid in opening/closing procedures, maintain cash drawer."
good,"Work with vendors, work with other team members, website maintenance, product availability metrics, work with distribution team members."
good,"I am currently working at a Retail store.  The warehouse people place the pallets on the floor and I work whatever section my manager wants me to do.  I have learned a lot about the coding they use and where it gets stocked. I get along with the management and co-workers.  I don't really dwell on visiting with co-workers as there is not much time for that.  I am focused on the job and work best when concentrating on the job at hand.  The hardest part is that it is part time.  Otherwise, I would stay forever, I do like the job.  They tell me what they want and I do it."
good,"I worked in the electronics department, which was great if you knew basics about electronics and tech.  There was a lot of room for advancement."
good,"The management plays favorites with employees and only promotes those they are friends with outside of work regardless of work ethic. A typical day is not bad, the stocking team, logistics is one of the best in the state. We work had and fast and accurately. I do not typical work past opening so i do not know the store manager or how things are fun during the day."
good,It was another good place to gain experience at. It was very fast paced and every day was busy. Down side was the managers expected a lot out of us without enough hours.
good,Target is all about team work. This makes employees feel like they are apart of something. It also make you more comfortable when asking for help. The Management wants you to succeed so that they can succeed.
good,"A typical day at work is filled with constant motion; stocking shelves, assisting guests, cashiering, cleaning, and helping other team members. I've learned that multi-tasking is a great way to develop patience. Also, with management being easily approachable, the work place environment is very pleasant and helps to promote a good working relationship between team members. The hardest part of the job is disappointing  guests because we were out of an item they wanted. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the smiles on the  guests faces because we made their visit a pleasurable experience."
good,"A typical day of work consisted  or assisting customers with inquiries about products and handling money/credit card payments, stocking shelves, to include inspecting items prior to placing them on the shelves, & complying with all OSHA standards. I learned how to work with a team of individuals to get a task done. Management was very flexible & involved in the work staff. This is a great job for someone who needs flexible hours & wants to have fun while working."
good,"Very repetitive but it's a great environment to work in. The Co-workers along with Management are very friendly, tasks are not difficult to do & the best part is your rewarded for your hard work!"
good,The work place was fun and people seem jovial. The culture is was social and collaborative but sometimes too collaborative
good,Often times Target is a pretty slow place to work at. When you have everything done Management never really found things for you to work on.
good,Management was pretty good was very flexible with people who have other jobs or people in school who leave for school. The pay rate isn't that good.
good,"Had to jump from job to job. One day im on the register, next im working with food and then im folding towels or stocking childrens toys, but overall it was a good experience."
good,"Working at a large retail store is exciting and fulfilling. You are working alongside many other team members and managers so communication is key."
good,"The company is a friendly company to work for, but can not be relied on for a stable amount of hours. Pay increases are exceedingly low and only occur annually."
good,"TARGET is a nice place to work and learn. Co workers are open to learn from you as well."
good,"Always busy, wonderful team members, late hours. Hardest part of job was standing on feet all day, sometimes supervisors would forget about breaks."
good,"Good location to work for retail pharmacy- very steady but not overly busy. However, it was so long ago that I cannot currently give an accurate review"
good,Work culture is awesome in Target. It is easy to maintain work life balance. Quality of work is also very good. I like the company and would reccommend to others.
good,"A typical day at Target would be come in at 5:00 am or 5:30 am i was usually there early. Make sure everything was in place for the unload process. Then we would unload the truck and bring everything that could come out to the floor. Then we would stock all shelves making sure everything was neat and full. I've actually learned a lot from this job. I learned that everything is more than what it seems. I use to think that people would just fill the shelves but now i know how much time it takes to sort things out and make sure everything is correct it really is a lot. Me and my coworkers got along great, they were actually the best coworkers i've had and that's an amazing experience. But the hardest part of my job was just being up so early you really have to make sure your sleep on time. The most enjoyable part of my job was being around my coworkers. They made the job a lot better."
good,"A fast, fun, and friendly place to work.  No two days are ever the same.  There is a new challenge everyday.  Great team atmosphere!"
good,Working for Target was not a bad experience. Everyone was always energetic and full of energy. The store was always well organized and everyone went above and beyond whether it was their position or not.
good,"This was a great place to work love the environment and the customers were awesome. Everybody stayed happy and up beat. In 6 months I became a manager, loved the chance for advancement."
good,"I liked my little job I worked there when I got out of high school and I enjoyed it but I knew that it was not what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. The older lady's there guided me to do something else. They knew I worked hard in cooking, cleaning, cashiering and in managing a kitchen by myself."
good,"walk into work speak to every one. Have start up, sign up for work area, and beging your day. You must work quickly and high speed to get you productivity for the night."
good,Many of my coworkers were easy to get along with and often made tasks more enjoyable than they would otherwise have been.
good,"Their cross-training is great. To be able to work in different areas of the store is a plus. The work environment is great, but because it's a bigger store employees may at times be overlooked. So far, at Target I've learned how to do in-stocks, drastic reports (prevention loss    type thing), back stock, visual merchandising, customer service, and cashiering."
good,Retrieved carts from parking lot and assisted others as needed. Worked as backup cashier when needed. Cleaned bathrooms when needed.
good,"It was okay, the pay could have been better and had they not started to cut hours. My job was pretty physical also. I felt like I did quite a bit and only made a decent pay check."
good,"Worked in different departments, made my work more enjoyable."
good,Target is a very customer service oriented place of work. All co-workers including supervisors and managers are easy-going and willing to help.
good,Management cares about their employees and tries to help them succeed. A typical day consists of running a cash register and asking customers if they want a RedCard. Management focuses highly on employees getting customers to open a RedCard whether it is the debit or credit.
good,"Fast paced environment!  Multi task skills a must.  Co-workers are the best!  "
good,"Lack of training when needed."
good,"I only worked there for a brief period of time, but the staff and management made me feel like a part of the team right away. A typical day at work included clocking in and doing what was needed to better serve the quest. I learned team work."
good,"its an okay company to work for. i been there for 14yrs and you would think you had seniority when it came to scheduling hour!"
good,"Working at Target is definitely a learning and growing experience. Over months I've learned a lot of things. "
good,"Management was easy to talk to, coworkers were older and more controlling. Hardest part: RED CARDS. Selling and promoting red cards is not as easy as it sounds. Very interesting variety of customers."

good,"Fast, fun, and friendly place to work with the best of people and work together in a great environment that provides excellent customer service."
good,Fast paced enjoyable environment with very good benefits.  The leaders are very encouraging and make work a fun place to be.
good,For a produce and meat team member we must give a presentable and full department for the guests. For any team member we drive ourselves on for guest service. In-stocks position is to make sure the whole store is full as possible and keeping everything neat and organized as we go through the store.
good,"Typical night consisted of unloading a truck with anywhere from 1400, to 2800 pieces of merchandise and was not limited to just one truck a night. "

good,"Target is a great place to work for a young college student. The management is great! The store is a fast, fun, and friendly environment."

good,"I worked at Target for over three years. I learned a lot, as I did a little bit of everything for the company. I also made a lot of good friends while there."

good,"I enjoyed being a part of a team who got things done on a daily basis."
good,"Your typical retail job, nothing too exciting.  I disliked how they looked to hire from outside the company instead of promoting from within.  Typically paying higher wages to those from outside the company."
good,Fun place to work and the people there are great.  Day starts early so come in work hard and fast with co-workers that make you laugh and smile.
good,"Overall Target is a good company.  Although certain things need to be improved, it is a fun work environment.  There are great people that you get to work with everyday.  The only disappointing thing is that compensation is very low."
good,A shift at this business consists of a busy and chaotic environment where we specialize on putting the guest first. The hardest part in working in a busy environment is being able to multitask.
good,"Good management, staff, and facility. Target has helped me develop customer service skills while learning to work in a team towards a common goal."
good,"Typically, the day consists of clocking in, checking the board to see what area of the store you are responsible for, and checking in with the LOD to see if they have any specific jobs they need you to complete. It isn't a hard job, my managers were good with working with my availability, because I am also a student.  "
good,The team involvement at Target is fantastic and a pleasure to be a part of. Day to day duties are challenging and rewarding when completed. The hardest part of the job are the 12hr shifts but the three days go by fast and the four off make it worth it. The management are very helpful and try and provide all that one may need to complete his/her job easier.
good,Great place to grow and develop as a leader.  Every day is different and gives you a wide range of management experience.  The best part are the teams you get to work with on a daily basis.  You must have a strong passion for driving for results.
good,Went to work every night to unload trucks then put the product out on the floor.This made the stores shelves full for the next business day.

good,"Target is a great company to start for. They are always working to develop their team members. If you're looking for a great company start with, go for Target. It is not however a good career option."
good,"Very fast paced, I learned many different recipes to many different beverages. My management wasn't really the greatest because she mostly told me that I did things wrong rather than praise me for the many good things I have done. My coworkers were really friendly though because they said I was always a hard worker and they enjoyed working with me."

good,Fun Fast And Friendly. i like that i can work as a fast pace and get my job done at a timely manner. Target has a strong work team.

good,My daily tasks were operating the cash register and helping guest find what they want or need. In addition to operating the register I also maintained a clean work space. The managers are very open and friendly. The most enjoyable part of my job is my co-workers and helping the guests. The hardest part of the job is not being able to please or help the guests.
good,"Zone your area and put away foreign, learn time management and hard work.  Management is good, too many co-workers for my personal preference, hardest part is when the store is super busy, most enjoyable is making new friends."
good,"Amazing culture but poor communication among managers and employees."
good,I like working here. You run into so many different personalities at Target from the employees to the guests. This job is easy I enjoy making guests happy.
good,"customer service, fast-paced, friendly environment, cashiering, kept busy, opportunity to change employment positions"
good,Every morning I start by setting up receiving so that the team can do a fast and efficient unload.  Over the years I've picked up skills on how to maneuver around obstacles so that tasks are completed quickly.  Everybody there is really friendly to work with that's the best part.  The worst part is when you're given a timeline that is impossible to complete.
good,"Working for Target Canada is like working with a family. We always work together in a fast, efficient way to get the pallets of stock to the floor and then to put the products away."
good,"It was good while it lasted, the work was enjoyable and the people were great to work with. The hours were flexible and the location was perfect for my situation. I'm sad that Target is closing because it worked really well for me and it had a good working environment."
good,"Operations are no longer in Canada, however it is similar to the US. "
good,"nothing bad to say, it was a fulfilling job. management was great and the environment/ co-workers were pleasant and professional."
good,"A typical day at Target is replenishing merchandise onto the sales floor, hopping onto a register when cashiers are backed up, assisting guest and providing excellent customer service. I learned and developed outstanding customer service skills. Management seems to be on top of everything and are very understanding at the same time. The employees are super friendly and are overachieving. There wasn't a particular part of the job that was difficult due to the fact that the employees and management are super helpful. I really enjoy working with a set of great people and coming together as a team."
good,Treating you not as a person there just to do your job but as an unit. A friendly atmosphere that made you comfortable to come to work.
good,"I worked mornings and evenings"
good,Learned alot about the logistics aspect of the company; friendly atmosphere and loved the fact that they had paid time off.
good,"A typical day at work would be just doing the same as always, get to my line and start checking costumers out in a fast and friendly mood."
good,i like the job .i was only there 1month    i wish i got hire but not it  was fun i wish i could  stay and learn more about  job the hours work out fine
good,i would say the worst part about working for this company is the managers they do not do anything but stand around and even the team leads stand around until corporate comes into the store then everyone changes. also the pay could be a lot better. The employees are amazing.
good,Great work environment with great employees. Had fun leading and training new members to be their best self. Sometimes executive leadership failed to take care of their employees and productivity would decline. Meeting the needs of the customers is always top priority in retail management.
good,"Role required a heavily internal and externally customer focused mentality. I was required to conduct my daily task within strict guidelines, and regulations from major regulatory institutions (FSA, NCC, and PCI). Main tasks required by the role include detailed daily checks, daily BACS transactions, delivering and installing essential software updates, daily problem solving, setting up and maintaining new user and group profiles. Weekly, monthly, and annual CAIS, Escrow, and Validator submissions and updates. The role has a heavy focus on using, testing, and maintenance of IBM iSeries machines. I was an integral part of a dynamic, flexible, multi-skilled, and high performing team, I regularly acted as deputy to the department head. And was entrusted to make all team management decisions on his behalf. Role required an astute attention to detail, discipline to complete routine day-to-day tasks, a high level of professionalism and responsibility due to the nature and value of the data I handled each day, and a sense of conscientiousness to follow tasks through to their completion. From this role I have been able to test my ability to learn and have been successful in every foreign task I was asked learn and master."
good,"It was a good work place its great talking to all the guests even guests from out of the states, only difficult part was doing go backs and several guests come up to you and keep you occupied for a while."
good,The job gave me an opportunity to build my leadership skills. Having many different cultures I had to find ways to communicate with them so that they can understand what I need them to do.  It also gave me a chance to work independently and also as a team player.
good,"As a company, target works very hard to give the guests excellent service and fair bargains. Whenever a guest needed something we were instructed to help them right away, whether we were engaged in a previous task or not. The management I worked under were upbeat and straightforward with criticism so I always knew where I stood with them."
good,"A typical day at work starts with me being in food ave, the pharmacy or up front as a cashier. In either work stations i communicate with guest in  a friendly manner and help them locate the items they've come in the store for. My co-workers are great friendly people."
good,I enjoy workplace at Target as it has great employee integrity and Work life balance.Especially i love the fact they encourage women empowerment.
good,"There's a pretty good culture at Target and the people are for the most part great but getting promoted from within is extremely hard, more often they will hire someone from outside for leadership positions , which is extremely frustrating."
good,It's a great place to work and develop strong analytical skills while maintaining the integrity of your decision-making skills. It is what one would expect from a big box retail store.
good,"Load and unload trucks for the company, change light bulbs and help other employees. make sure that the customers are satisfied and have good shopping experience."
good,"fun environment , co workers were pretty nice. the most fun part of the job would be communicating with guest and making them laugh"
good,"At Target I set planograms, which consists on taking down whole aisles and resetting with new product while the store is open."
good,"This is a nice company to work for, They are very micro-manager style, they just assume you need to be managed very closly. They have descent opportunity to rise in the company, and they try their best to take care of their employees."
good,"It's really great being able to work with guests everyday in the store and being able to help people with what they need."
good,Target was a great jumping off point and I learned a lot about managing.  They weren't very good about hiring within though
good,Continuously pushed to advance and stretch your personal strengths and opportunities with numerous tasks that must be met daily. Great company to work for because of the focus and emphasis of what it means to be a team. While working here I have developed numerous skills and a better understanding of what compromise is to ensure completion of tasks.
good,working for target gave me my first retail experience I loved every part of it I wasn't only limited to one position I worked in all parts of the store my ended position was in the food department I really enjoyed working there
good,"Fast, fun and friendly staff. Clean and bright work environment. Can get very busy, but is a very interesting place to work."
good,"The position I held at Target was a tedious one, consisted a lot of bending and reaching, walking, and lifting. I learned a lot about the product Target carries and became familiar with prices and the location of specific items. Management was helpful in situations that arose at work, especially with disgruntled customers. My co-workers in general were hard workers, but most were young and very much liked to goof off at work. The hardest part of the job was the sporadic schedule. I like working a set schedule, but with retail there's no such thing unless you are management. The most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction of knowing that I completed my tasks in a timely manner."
good,"All Target team members I have worked with have been very friendly, offering a helping had to guests and fellow team members alike.  Management has been approachable and easy to work with while providing the structure and focus needed to keep the store running smoothly.  Besides constant guest service on the sales floor, the most time consuming task is assisting with cashier back up calls because they are short notice and they take you away from tasks you are currently working on.  As a retail position, it can get stressful many times a day, but fellow co-workers are constant reminders that the guest always comes first."
good,This role was a startup role that worked heavily in the gray - building process from the ground up.  Despite tight timelines and strict deliverables leadership allowed my team and I to get the job done in the manner we best saw fit.
good,"My days were very busy but that's exactly how I like it. I have learned many new skills, like loading a sweeps truck, working in the freezers and the sap computer program. The hardest part of the job would be that there was never enough hours in a day to get all the work done."
good,"My day in the Target Clinic starts with opening the clinic and ,ensuring that all exam rooms are fully equipped with needed supplies, and all logs from check list are completed, make sure the clinic is cleaned and ready for that's days business."
good,My experience at Target has been overall enjoyable. Working with friendly coworkers was particularly enjoyable.
good,Loading and unload trucks.  Then load store shelves with accuracy and corretly.
good,"during the season it was pretty busy so the day went by fast, but after the seasons were over it calmed down a lot. My phone and customer service skills improved greatly because of my time spent there. The LOD's were always there if you needed help or needed someone to talk to, and the other team members were always ready to lend a helping hand and super friendly. The hardest thing was keeping track of time and getting things done by the end of the day but making a guest happy always made it worth it."
good,"A typical day at work was clocking in, stocking shelves, organizing aisles, cashiering, doing go-backs, and assisting customers. I learned how to cashier, how to properly zone an area, how to work with others, and how to assist customers all in a timely manner. Management was friendly and helpful, they always stressed that we were a team and we all work together. Co-workers were very helpful, they taught me the ropes of the job and assisted me when I needed it. The hardest part of the job was getting your zone organized in a short amount of time. The most enjoyable part for me was cashiering, it made work go by a lot faster."
good,"My time spent with target mobile was very constructive and beneficial. I was able to learn much about technology in general, and in due time my knowledge and experience had the result of the staff seeking my advice on many related matters. If given the chance I would do it again, although I did find the upper management quality lacking."
good,"awesome place to work,company works with on your scheduling.met lots of great people,job wasn't really hard to do enjoyed learning new things,most enjoyable is meeting people and being able to help them."
good,"- Learned new things in related to pharmacy"
good,"Fast, fun and friendly. And really value their guest and employees."
good,Days and times varied from week to week. Worked in the jewelry department. Straighten shelves with merchandise and kept the area clean. Helped customers. Folded clothes.
good,"My first experience in working in a fun environment."
good,All the Team Members are very nice and show a very positive attitude at work.  My Co-Team Leads have been very helpful from day one.  The total work environment is very conducive to total productivity.  I've learned the true value of customer service and communicating with other Team Members.
good,"From the day I started at Target I have enjoyed every moment. We are not just a group of team members, we are family. We built the store together and take pride in the work we do everyday. The support provided from everyone is what makes Target a great place to work. With the coaching of my executive leadership team I have learned things about myself and become a better leader to my team. When you have fun at work everyday it ceases to be just a job but a way of life and a career."
good,I usually helped unload the truck at 5 in the morning with the other members of the Flow team. Then I would help the team start putting the products on the shelves before the guests came in the store.
good,"I loved working here for almost 2 years but the company has decided that its to much of a loss in Canada to be here anymore. "
good,it was short and sweet but learned alot from the experience. Wish them all the best.
good,"its fun to work as a TPS, got me through college! I had a very accommodating manager that made life really easy at Target. Gotta say, though, any other department, I would have quit within months."
good,"While working at Target, I got to learn a lot new things. I was able to be took from the cash and put anywhere else in the store to work there. I enjoyed learning different departments. I was able to keep calm in all situations, and I knew how to make the costumers happy. When I worked on Black Friday, and boxing day, I was able to keep calm, and help every guest throughout the day, even though it was beyond busy. Even though I might not have got along with every employee that I worked with, I never let that effect my work area. I was calm and respectful to everyone no matter what. I never brought my personal life into the work area, when I walked in those company doors, I dropped all my problems. I pushed through any injury, or sickness that I had, and attended work!"
good,"I was paid the lowest legal amount in the state of Illinois. They were very cooperative with scheduling, usually. It had a great ""team"" mentality."
good,"Working here has been an integral part of my life for the past few years. I have had the pleasure of being apart of a wonderful team of people and developing work relationships that made coming to work an absolute joy. My work environment was harmonious and welcoming, with the majority of my coworkers behaving in a well mannered way. For the most part, everyone got all along well, but had a few conflicts. From a management standpoint, my superiors were respectful and provided many learning opportunities. A typical day usually comprised of working through my opening routines, reviewing reports, and assisting with other work centers in finishing their daily workload. I had the opportunity to develop my skills in other work centers and step outside of my designated work environment to aid in completion and allow for overall store efficiency. One of the more enjoyable aspects of my job was my interaction with guests, as well as my day to day working interactions with other team members. The workload and under staffing offset the more enjoyable parts, however. Unfortunately, there was a lack in team members to properly support the store, and it fell to others to pick up the workload. Oftentimes, the team would have to work on recovering from the day before. Overall, it was a humbling experience and it helped to further my skills in guest service. I was able to gain a new outlook on how to solve problems, in addition to finding a new perspective on personal growth in the workplace. Working here has allowed me to learn a new skill set that will help me in my future endeavors."
good,A typical work day would be clocking in on a automate machine in the employee's lounge. Helping customs with the location of a certain items that is located in the store. Management consist of multiple shift managers throughout the day. The hardest part of the job would be the customers that might cause a disturbance. The most enjoyable part about the job is the interaction that comes with helping the customers.
good,"My job consisted of cashier, sales floor, guest services, and cart attendant. I assisted customers with various aspects, such as checking out, using gift registry, finding items, pulling items from backroom."
good,"Helped fill prescriptions, answer phones, customer service, complete fax requests, submit authorization, check inventory, and maintain a clean work environment."
good,"Helping guest, setting merchandise, cleaning and price checking."
good,"The company really promotes working together towards common goals.  They value collaboration, team work, and driving for results."
good,Feels like a family. Friendly managers and employees.very positive work environment.
good,Target was a fun job there were many different activities and volunteer programs that I was able to get involved with. Every day you were able to do something different. It was very entertaining and a very pleasant atmosphere to be in. I would recommend anyway to work here
good,If you don't have to cashier all the time and you work hardline or softlines this could be a good place to work. Working seasonal gives you a lot of hours but you will be pretty much standing all day. The company is very ethical though depending on which location you work at it might be different.
good,A typical day at work is full of fun. customers are great and co workers are amazing!
good,They'll give you lots of hours if your willing to work for them
good,"Make sales every shift"
good,"Target didn't offer a flexible schedule that allowed me to both attend college and work. I would often work shifts late at night and transition directly into my studies and assignments. I learned how to operate the necessary equipment and it advanced my interactions with customers. The management for the most part was nice, but they could at times be domineering. The hardest part of the job was probably just the constant lifting, the most enjoyable part of the job was the other team members. Really friendly and helpful people that will assist you beyond expectations without being asked."
good,It could be good and not so good depending on your position and team lead
good,"great work area"
good," Assisted customers with finalizing merchandise purchases at the cash register."
good,I really liked working here. We were always busy. I got to help out in other departments when we were done with our work. I liked the co-workers. Everyone was really nice and helpful. The management was really nice too. The hardest part of this job was waking up extra early  but then the best part was that you got out early and had the rest of the day to enjoy!
good,"Working at Target isn't anyone's idea of a top of the market job.  But it is where I got my start, and I was thankful for the opportunity that it provided.  The hours were long, and sometimes I had to work closings and openings back to back, which was tough, but it comes with the territory.  Overall, the people that I worked with were good people."
good,"Target was great, it allowed me to be a leader to hundreds of people while gaining great experience."
good,"a typical day, clock in and do slave work for incompetent managers."
good,"Great culture, smart people."
good,"A typical day at Target Flushing can sometimes be hectic considering where the store's location and the heavy guest traffic. The work environment is team oriented as each coworker is very friendly and helpful to each other. The management is very understanding and will try their best to accommodate your needs and resolve conflicts with the scheduling. Overall, Target Flushing is a good place to work for, with a family like work atmosphere."
good,I gained excellent customer service skills. The company had many changes when I was there and a lot changes had occured over the years I worked there. At the same time changes for the better.
good,My time here was very enjoyable and relaxing. I was a cashier and liked meeting new people. Had the pleasure of getting to know my co-workers and everyone was friendly and easy to talk to.
good,I learned to work at a faster pace and working with all different types of people
good,"This was my first job. Pay was decent. I was a seasonal employee. Over one summer, my family moved. It was very easy to transfer store locations. Nice employees. Quality cross-training."
good,Its all about constumer service so the management will likely sacrifice you if it means making the customer happy.
good,"The team culture and people were amazing to work with. The job was easy, and at times fun. There was always food in the break room, and different little parties and events. "
good,"The hours for this job are 6 am - 2:30 pm M-F.  These are the best hours for ANY job in retail, and I loved the hours for all eight years I was in this position.  I would spend about 2 hours a day on a computer with email, reporting, logging, tracking, word processing, and ordering parts.  The remainder of the day was spent completing required weekly preventative maintenance tasks and troubleshooting and repairing any corrective maintenance tasks that came into the system from team members in the store or field projects from Target HQ.  I learned plumbing, electrical troubleshooting and repair, basic HVAC tasks, basic refrigeration repairs, carpentry skills, safety observations, leadership, financial management with an annual budget of over $500,000.  Overall, the co-workers in the store treat this position with respect.  I most enjoyed knowing that I made an impact on the sales of the store by repairing a certain piece of equipment or prevented a safety situation with the same repair.  I perfected my customer service skills with this job having to greet guest while they shopped and I was repairing equipment.  Without happy guests shopping, I wouldn't have a job.  The hardest part of this job is the constant turnover in management and Targets idea of what a good manager is.  Many of the new managers were in their early 20's and had no idea what retail management was all about and mostly what Facility Management was.  This is the main reason I left this job was due to constant stress from poor upper management.  The hands on part of the job was amazing and at times very thrilling!"
good,Overall a great place to work. Management cares a little too much about numbers though.
good,Make sure the parking lot is clear of carts at the end of the night and through the day. Take trash out. Put up hand baskets.
good,"Job began as part time but can easily become more you just let them know you can work and they would give me all kinds of shifts. Can work in many different departments if willing."
good,"excellent work environment."
good,"A typical day at work is when your short handed and you have to get HR to call in employees to work  or pull other team members from grocery department  to help  it always works out when team members work together to get the job done."
good,Team Members are always helping each other with the guest as well as each other in the store. You can learn many areas to expand your knowledge of the store and advance in the company.
good,Love the staff and work life balance. Owners always willing to help with any issues.
good,like meeting and speaking with the customers and seeing the product i have never seen before
good,"Effective direct leadership"
good,Overall a great place to work. I've never had a complaint and i'd love to do it again.
good,I always have a good day at work when I get to work as part of the target team
good,"The most enjoyable part about working for this company is that, i was able to upgrade my skills with regards to communicating properly  with fellow employees and guests."
good,Its a retail job. No matter how hard you work your butt off. Its like they dont  care. And the pay and hours are horrible
good,"Come in and check what foods to prep, fill levels for replenishment in cold drinks area, and cook hot foods that require to be under a heat lamp."
good,Loved all the team members I worked with and loved the positive environment.
good,"At Target I would do many different things in the Electronics and Toys department including restocking shelves, keeping shelves neat and organized, putting away reshop, putting up/taking down ads/signs for week, assisting customers, cashing out customers, selling electronics using my knowledge"
good,"Set plans for the day around business needs.  Address obstacles of team members.  Provide clear direction for the day.  Communicate business goals to team members.  Collaborate with other Operation Managers on business flow and needs.  Operational huddles to drive and develop self and others."
good,"Learned a lot due to the high volume of prescriptions Team-work, allowed me to be pro-active."
good,Great for recent graduates to begin management career. Long hours and weekends are a must.
good,"job was consistent, nothing new really happened. The management is friendly so are all the co-workers. You will rarely find your co-workers to be in a bad mood. Positive environment with a lot of friendly guest and customers. There is little downside to working here."
good,"Fast paced and plenty of detail oriented work."
good,"Very pleasant Enviroment, learned how to work the cash register for the first time. Management and other co-workers were very helpful. The hardest part of the job was getting them the customer to apply for a store credit card."
good,Target is a fun place to work. I started in store operations and the career path on that side of he business does not have much flexibility.
good,"I enjoyed the idea of family photography and at first this job seemed excellent, but the longer I worked here the more under pressure I came from the company itself, expecting me to boost my sales average despite unrealistic coupons provided to customers year-round via Target Portraits and Groupon, which made keeping my personal sales average at an acceptable level impossible. More on that later."
good,target has lot of opportunity to grow within the company. management is always happy to help in any way possible.
good,I enjoyed working for this company and have made great friends among my coworkers. Really great benefits.
good,Target is a wonderful place to learn about how to interact with customers and other employees. You can have so many opportunities to cross train with some opportunities to move up but only so far. They seem to hire their team leads out of people who have no retail experience but have a degree rather than those who know the job and are loyal to the company. To that degree I believe that for most Target is a wonderful job for young or part time people but you cannot make a life for a family by the pay. I have learned so much and grown as a person just from having the amazing opportunity to work at Target its just not able to get me where I want in life.
good,"Process payroll"
good,"Target is not a bad place to work. They are really flexible with their hours and are always willing to work around your schedule. Your hours can sometimes fluctuate too much which is detrimental to those of us who have bills and other responsibilities. Also, their benefit package isn't all that great, but aside from that the staff there is amazing which honestly encourages hard work and dedication."
good,"Be ready to stay on your feet. Good job to have. return items back to shelf, help out wherever needed."
good,"great bosses, great time spent at work, fun work crew, great customers, fast paced at times"
good,"My overall review working at Target was a great experience, the fact that customer service is their number one priority made it easy for me to complete tasks and assist customer with daily needs."
good,Brought in carts and worked the express checkout lanes. Management was extremely rude to the point where I finally just quit.
good,A typical day at Target starts with me getting my equipment and going on about the rest of the day. All the bosses at target are actually very accommodating and are willing to help you out when you run into a problem. Target really is a friendly place to work.
good,They have a lead program here but is  hard to get time allowed to attend the classes. The wage is low.
good,"Night crew relaxed and enjoyable, but got the job done.  Stress free."
good,"I enjoyed working at Target. It felt as if I were another part to a bigger family. The team there is phenomenal and we strived to make every guest feel as if they were home, too."
good,I meet a lot of great people and it is a joy to help others and to assist them with whatever they need.
good,Co-workers make this place enjoyable just a great team. hours get choppy at time however you can always swap shifts
good,"Everyone was nice and very helpful. I learned a lot from how to work a cash register to answering phones to pulling stock. I would easily go back. The thing that holds me back is the pay and if you have an appointment or something serious happens and no can cover your shift, you are great penalized."
good,"Great company, wonderful place to work. Managers are excellent and they offer tons of growth and benefits."
good,Great and understanding staff. Hard on the body because of hours but a worthwhile place to work.

good,"Responsible for the cleanliness and great looking store"
good,"Always enjoyed working, the atmosphere at work was great, everyone was like a big family."
good,"I worked at this company for 3 years. Some of my management was great. Other parts weren't so great. "
good,"Help fill prescription"
good,place will make you want to punch babies....management is horrible
good,Overall fun work environment and made many long lasting professional relationships
good,"Great place to work, looking to expand my skills into other working environments."
good,Learned to work in a fast and safe manner while dealing with demands from management and customers.
good,"I would say this was a pretty decent job, dealing with new people is one of my many skills. It was enjoyable, fast paced, and a good learning experience."
good,Working at Target everything was to be merchandise properly and well stocked. I liked this because it keeps the customers coming back when they see a neat and clean store with workers who have outstanding customer service skills.
good,"Don't mind going to work everyday, enjoy working with my co-workers"
good,"I have worked at Target for over three years now, and it has taken me that long to get to a point where I feel good about working there. Target is more about hiring more people to give part-time, then they are about giving current employees full-time."
good,great pay and benefits were good. very flexible hours were a convience.
good,The Company over all is a good company. The chance for advancement is non existent.
good,"A typical work day for me is making sure that the store is maintain and is at a ""green"" level meaning they store is neat and tidy. I typically have a different duty everyday while maintaining a safe environment and making sure each and every guest is satisfied with their experience and Target. I make sure that each guest I encounter is finding their merchandise okay and that they don't have any questions. I have learned a lot working for Target, I'm crossed trained in multiple areas in the store meaning I can move around when needed. I have great relationships with all my team members and can work closely with each knowing we can get our job done daily. My leaders can count on me to get each task done without having to go to them for help. The leaders also ensure a lot of confidence in their team members making sure that if they are not around to help the team members can do a task without being told. The hardest part of my job would be that some days are busier than others and on a busy day finishing task can be difficult. The most enjoyable part of my job is making the guest happy every time they come in."
good,"Working for Target for the past 7 years has helped me gain experiences that I wouldn't have been able to elsewhere. Through them, I learned what it is like to work with a diverse team in order to bring complete satisfaction to the people that shop with us. Ever the fan of education, Target is always happy to work around college schedules and is willing to give you extra days off if you need it to study. The management is well established and ready to answer and guide all team members to help them learn and grow every day."
good,Target pays well if you work in the Distribution Center or if you work at Headquarters. Other than that Target is just like any other major retail bussiness.
good,I have enjoyed the time I have worked at Target.  As far as retail goes it is a good place to work.
good,"I process returns, payments, exchanges, and handle guest concerns. I work in guest service. The store I work at is a good store."
good,Target has a very good idea of what their employees should be expressing. Assistance is of the upmost importance.
good,A typical day at target entailed me replenishing shelves and unloading the nightly truck.  I was a backroom clerk so a lot of times i was responsible for pulling items out of the storage room.
good,"always giving customers fast, fun, and friendly service. Customer is always right and making sure every customer is satisfied"
good,I enjoyed being on the floor helping guests and working in different areas everyday. It kept me on my toes and always learning new things. This is a great starter job that helped me have fun and make new friends even while I was at work!
good,My typical day started with crew meetings and daily plan layout. We exercised. Would start by opening up check lanes. Begin stocking shelves and unloading trucks. I really enjoyed marking items and placing them in there right locations. My co workers were always fun to work with. I think that the hardest part of my job was when an upset customer was hard to please and nothing would satisfy them. Bu through that i really gained a lot of people skills.
good,Really nice place to work with nice people and staff. The atmosphere was relaxed and everyone worked as a team.
good,"Good job, not so good benefits, not so good pay. Fun environment. Team oriented"
good,"Good work/life balance, but not much room for promotions or increase of pay."
good,Amazing company. Very professional and intentional in all of it's practices and principles
good,I loved working here ... the only thing was that there was more then one person telling me what to do at a time.
good,Overall I enjoyed working for Target. As always those who you work with and work for you help decide the culture of a company. They were very flexible with my school schedule. Big changes to the healthcare they offered was my only drawback.
good,"Target is a relatively nice place to work, with a wide range of tasks and a great tendency to cross-train people in various areas. "
good,"Very Good Place to work in."
good,I worked on the overnight team unloading trucks at Target.  The job was very labor intensive which I do not mind.  The management was very fair and the other employees were very easy to work with for the most part.
good,Target can be a fast paced workplace. I've learned to deal with the guest and their attitudes in a professional manner. Management is fair. the co-workers all get along and work together very well. The hardest part of the job is staying busy during slow or non busy hours. the most enjoyable part of the job is the people you meet and seeing the guest leave with a smile on their face.
good,As a soft lines member you work with clothes a fitting room and the cash register when needed.
good,This was a decent place to work. The work wasn't too hard but as the operator at this location you were responsible for a lot more then just phones and I felt you weren't appreciated for all the hard work you do.
good,I think Target was a great opportunity to learn and grow in the sales and retail career field.
good,"Typical work day would include anything from running the guest service desk, to working in the pharmacy, and sometimes supervision of cashiers. There was really no hard part to the job. I learned everything the first time it was told to me and contuined to grow within the company. Most enjoyable part of the job is making the customers smile."
good,"I enjoyed working for Target. there was never any internal drama, issues were always resolved almost instantly and everyone got along with other for the most part."
good,go to work learn the function before being moved to the next function friendly workers and hardest part is getting 180 boxes per hour and most enjoyable is driving forklift and getting the work done.
good,i just moved when i started here and the company was great they saw a lot in me and because of that needed me in to positions i stepped up to the challenge and did well
good,"working at target was An easy job I loved my guest at target as much as they loved me.I gave my all to each person (guest) that came to my station I was A cashier I would have lines of people waiting for me to serve them .I would have liked to been challenge by the company but because I,am so good at customer service they would not train me anywhere else. I feel like I could have been trained and challenged .there was really nothing hard about the job black Friday was very busy but fun.I love people and I love to serve A smile can really change A person heart."
good,"Typical days of work consist of assisting guest with returns and exchanges. Open new credit accounts, except payment on existing accounts, sorting re-shop, helping management in monitoring the front lanes due to lunches and breaks of other team members. The hardest part of the day would be, not being able to be of any assistance to the guest within the store and the guest then have to be referred to our corporate office. When this happens, the guest may become very upset due to the inconvenience that it may cause them and as a result they begin bad mouthing the associates in front of other guest and team members. Furthermore, they try to make matters worse by making it seem as though they were not assisted or helped at all when, we all take the initiative to go the extra mile in assisting our customers with all of their needs and wants and put them first. On the other hand the most enjoyable part the work day would be the 10 or more guest that comes after that 1 rude guest and say how well I handled that situation and starts to express how the whole situation could have turned ugly if someone else were to be put into the same predicament. The target that I am employed at is centrally centered around a residential neighborhood therefore, our guest frequently visit 2 to 3 times a day, so we pretty much have built a relationship with and know each other very well although, I myself don't reside no where remotely around or in their neighborhood. I like to think that me, being the person that I am brings nothing but joy to my heart and the passion to lend a helping hand whenever"
good,The Target Corporation seeks to offer essentials & luxury products on a broad scale to US and Canadian customers.  They seek to stay innovative in all their areas of operation in order to drive ideal customer experiences & maintain the best prices possibe for moderate-to-high quality goods.

good,Very friendly organization everyone works as a team to get the job done
good,Awesome first job that allowed me to build great customer service skills
good,Its a fun work environment. You never know what kind of customers you will get. Getting to know co workers is the best part.
good,"I loved working there, just it was seasonal so the hours weren't enough"
good,"I was able to meet and greet new people, performed different job duties"
good,"Working there was just like the typical job. Go into work, do your job, then go home. Wasn't really a friendly environment but still okay work place. Nothing really special to review on"
good,Great Place to get amazing training and leadership skills! Great if you like a fast paced environment!
good,"Very task-oriented environment, with an emphasis on customer satisfaction"
good,"setting sales"
good,"We unloaded the truck, stacked pallets, moved the pallets to the floor, stocked the shelves, back stocked and cleaned up the store. I loved the people I worked with however it seemed that the management would not reward those who worked hard for them."
good,A typical day at work is very productive and goes by pretty fast. My management is very friendly and supportive in everything I do. Also my co-workers are well mannered and friendly. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing customers leave with a smile on their face.
good,Internship allowed for growth as a leader in running a million dollar business. Great expierence for any business career during college.
good,"I love working at Target for benefit of helping the guest and working around great co-workers. I have learned a lot about myself and being able to find new ways of customer service and helping people. As far as the working environment it can get pretty hectic, its either not enough people during the work day or you're in multiple locations and can't get everything done. The guest and co-workers make the day better, but the management doesn't make sense, they have communication and common sense issues, its such a hassle to request off a day, call off and ultimately find another job. Its not something that i think is for the long term solely based on management issues. Great place to work when you get to know the people who work there."
good,check out customers with items and keep my work space clean. some staking
good,Fast paced and fun to work. Target has instilled a great attitude and fun place to work.
good,"Every day at Target is different. Depending on the needs of the business I may need to solve a problem in a crisis situation, deal with an employee relations issue, or follow up on a staffing concern."
good,A typical day at Target was customer service and taking care of the guests.  I would check out all guests and I would train all new employees on the registers and how to run the front end of the store.  Management was easy to talk to and they would do all that was needed to help us.  The hardest part of the job was not having a consistent schedule.  The most enjoyable part was working with the public and growing within management.
good,"typical day was checking numbers, guest satisfaction, credit card applications and then reviewing schedule and having mini meetings with 1 to 3 employees that were selected as my group of cashiers to maintain weekly status reports. I learned that maybe everyone was not on board for the team spirit but everyone were consistently kept up to speed on why it was important. Management was ok but my direct supervisor believed the bar could never be too high, even when I broke records in credit card application 177 for March and 173 April. Co workers were always willing to help. the hardest part of the job was keeping up with the many facets involved with running a proper front end. The most enjoyable was getting treats if you closed with a certain executive, 12 packs of soda, family size chips or boxes of ice cream, Charity events were awesome too, did the walk for cancer, volunteered for PBS pledge drive. did geocaching as team build event."
good,Great team work and environment. Company looks out for employees.
good,"A typical day at Target for me is providing exceptional customer service, keeping a well-maintained store, driving sales and managing inventory. Target has taught me how to work better with a team and how to boost sales."
good,"I learned a lot about the Canadian work place culture, I enjoyed working with co-workers."
good,The pay wasn't great. The benefits weren't exciting. But the environment was super fun. I spent my day running the photo lab and customer service. I was great at it. Management was good. The hardest part of the job was the hours worked. Many days 12 or 13 hours with no reason and never compensated. I was paid a set amount never time and half for ot. That was hard. I loved working with people and I generally had a good time at the job.
good,"My daily responsibilities were to make sure that the company met all daily, weekly, and monthly sales; I for-seen areas such as women's apparel, men's apparel, jewelry, shoes, accessories, groceries, and electronics. All Target team members and executives worked amicably to ensure the best service to our guest. To better satisfy our guest, all service calls must be answered within thirty seconds or less. Target provided me with the basic essentials I needed to have a happy and healthy career."
good,"Job improved my overall communication skills by constantly interacting with different people on a day to day basis.  Co-workers were always enjoyable to be around, and the workplace atmosphere placed an emphasis on the importance of teamwork."
good,"As an team member, I stocked the shelves on the sales floor so customers always can find what they're looking for. I also assisted the customers with their questions and concerns, as well provided speedy checkouts. Working in retail has helped to work at fast pace and still provide quality customer service."
good,"Very busy with set tasks"
good,"working in a fast and friendly environment"
good,good strong team environment and the other team members you work with help you have successful day of work
good,"I had a positive experience at Target.  Target is a well run company that is always growing and will to change for the best interest in the customers.  You feel like the management cares for you on a personal level and is proud of the amount of work you've accomplished.  Work was not always easy as with any retail company the store gets extremely busy.  You are often time crunched by short time slots where you have to finish your work in a certain amount of time, but that is expected in any retail environment.  I would suggest applying to target for anybody seeking a enjoyable entry level job."
good,"fun working environment, love the coworkers, non stop workin g"
good,Run frieght in a timely fashion. Be suffient and energetic. Make the best of the job.
good,Great environment for high school or college students. HR is always very active and events are always being promoted.
good,"Long hours at times, a lot of standing on your feet. Teaches you a lot of patience and customer service skills. Great co-workers who enjoy their job. The hardest job would have to be dealing with unruly customers. The most enjoyable would be getting a chance to help the nice appreciative customers."
good,Target was a fun workplace management was always doing nice and thoughtful things for staff.  Everyone was very approachable.
good,I love working at target. It was crazy an fast pace around holidays. There was always something new to learn and train for. The team leads were always helping there team to stay on track.
good,"typical day at target . working with public on a daily basis"
good,Most memorable job that I've had. Excellent team environment and efficient management staff. I assisted in the supervision of an overnight truck unload and stock team. Diverse atomsphere with great benefits.
good,"The pharmacy rules, the rest of the store and upper management suck and only care about themselves."
good,The job has many benefits to excel in a career field. It also helps that you get to work with the general public
good,"Providing great guest service: Vibe with our guest, making sure our guest are finding what he or she needs and getting out of the store in a timely manner without having to stand in long lines.  Making sure also our guest rate us with excellent guest service.  I learn to me more aggressive in pushing our cashiers to want more out of life and to move up. I learn being in management require you to oversee just running a great business, but to take care of your co-workers as well.  The hardest part of my job, were trying to please or accommodate everyone.  The most enjoyable part of my job is working with great staff members (colleague) making sure if you need assistance you don't have to asked.  Making each other job easier."
good,"I learned to communicate with costumers, and become proficient in the products that we offered."
good,Responsible fro product inventory by label scanning and proper report reading.  Move designated product to accurate packing system.
good,"•	Serve guests as a cashier."
good,great energy about working there - feel like you are apart of something
good,"Typical workday began at 9am and would not end until 5pm or later depending on the rush.I'v learned how to be patient when it comes to customer service. The management was easy to get along with. Co- worker were fun to work with, always kept me laughing."
good,"Fast, Fun, & Friendly is Targets motto. I enjoyed working with and for this company. All tho there is a lot of favoritism in the company and not much room for advancement. I still believe Target is a Great Corporation."
good,Target does care about its workers and the community. The take time to fill lunch boxes for the four-squares program and volunteer on field days for elementary schools.
good,"Target is a fast paced retail environment that focuses on the guest first.  Previously, as a district manager, I learned how to manage more than one unit at a time, but with all units focused on the same workload.  As a multi-unit manager with Target, I have learned how to manage multiple work centers that must cohesively move together to create a dynamic experience for the guest.  The hardest part of the job is the same as the most enjoyable part of the job, balancing team with task and creating priorities and work plans that take both into consideration."
good,A typical day at work would consist of keeping to store looking great for guests. Ive learned how to use my strong communication skills to my advantage with selling and also how to organize things in the back room.
good,atypical day at work is unloading trucks. inputting products into the data base. Pricing merchadise. Putting the merchadise on the shelves & cashiering.
good,"I work with guest service on a daily basis whether it is handling returns or helping someone find an item in the store.  I have learned a lot from this store.  There is always something to learn and I find myself working with all areas of the store to better myself and continuing to learn more and more.  Management changes every two years because of company policy so it allows me to always adapt to different personalities and work styles.  My co-workers are also different, they range from different types of personalities as well as work ethics and styles.  The hardest part of my job is seeing someone leave the store unhappy.  The most enjoyable part of my job is to hear someone inform me or one of my supervisors say that this was the best experience that they have had yet shopping at a Target store."
good,"Same as previous Target position, I was transferred to a new position."
good,Target has hands on training programs for all positions with consistent feedback from upper management. Through leadership dimensions the company helps you to identify strengths and opportunities to determine your approach to leadership. You work closely with all positions in the store and give direction to perform all daily task.
good,Working overnight logistics at Target has definitely helped me learn the meaning of hard work. The physical strain on your body from a 8.5 hour shift is difficult to deal with but the co-workers I've had make the job more fun. The management at Target is very encouraging and always strive to establish a team atmosphere. A typical day at work begins at 10:30PM when the team unloads the merchandise and separates it out to the various parts of the store. After that is finished the team goes to their designated area of the store to begin stocking the shelves with new merchandise. Since I work at a Super Target that includes a full grocery store as well as soft and hard goods. This process continues throughout the night with 2 breaks at 2AM and 4AM. The goal is to get all the merchandise out onto the floor before the next sales day begins at 8AM.
good,"Early morning hours and off early in the day to enjoy it."
good,"Good coworker, Fast past place."
good,Management is all over the place and changes so much that consistency across shifts is an after thought.  Senior leadership continues to focus on what the teams are doing wrong and tries to enforce change but should be focusing on what the teams are doing right and focusing on each teams strengths to maximize productivity.  Promotion from within is an afterthought.  In 10 years of service I only saw 4 employees promoted to management.  This company makes it almost impossible to get promoted as the employee has to go above and beyond the expectations of a recent college grad to get promoted.  An employee has to beg for time for development and have meetings with senior leadership but if you work on an off key your meetings with leadership may not happen.
good,"There is high turnover, although the company is fair.  Working with the public was always interesting"
good,"guest service, training new team members, interviewing prospective team members, team member scheduling, supervision of team members, planning and organization of 	merchandise displays and workload."
good,A typical day at work is working in either customer service or at the cash register. Ringing up customers and returning items for them as well as assisting them with any questions or concerns. Managment was fair and my co-workers were very nice. Hardest part of the job was standing for sometimes 8 hour shifts. I learned about team work and hard work.
good,"Taught responsibility and accountability"
good,"Cashier, checking out customer's merchandise, providing the upmost assistance and help for customers, with a great friendly and courteous attitude."
good,Learned to talk to customers and build a lasting relationship
good,"Loved working at target. Good co-workers, we all got along great, management was always respectful and on point. They had good benefits. Loved how we was able to switch shifts with people easily. The shifts were flexible. You can always cross train to other departments of the store which was cool."
good,"Overall great work environment with excellent leadership, team cohesion, and well rounded accountability. Co-workers are friendly and the best part involves all the friendly faces you see."
good,"Depended on which department I was in. Electronics was all sales and knowing the products to show to customers "
good,"Targets goals, missions, and values are very aligned although there are endless opportunities for business growth and enhancements. I want to continue to build a business and grow a business – it’s having the right product, pricing is right, and making it easy for the guest to find! I enjoy working with everyone within the multichannel but struggle with the mobility within at this time and seeking to accomplish additional achievements and reach new goals."
good,"see previous review"
good,I didn't work long but the people were very nice and helpful. The store was always clean.
good,"It was a fun and easy job. But if you move too fast up the ladder and come close to surpassing someone higher than you, they will purposely knock you right back down. If you want to work here, be ""okay"" at what you do, other wise be prepared to look for another job."
good,"Great place to work, smart co workers, excellent technology to help you reach your goals."
good,"I've worked at target for 5 years, no room for advancement"
good,"Target was the perfect place for me to gain extensive work experience. In a typical day I would act as the operator for the store and answer every phone call and transfer customers to the appropriate department while using a multi-line phone. I would also greet and direct customers to the departments they were looking for. At Target I learned how to give exceptional customer service even when the situations were difficult. "
good,"This job is at a very easy pace, your basically on your own, it's not so much busy unless it's a holiday or there a sales from the holiday. Everyone is very easy to get along with and friendly.. and don't think there is a hard part to this job it's very easy and the customer are even more friendlier, it's a very friendly environment job to work."
good,"Working at Target is a typical retail experience. We work holidays, odd hours, pay isn't great, little advancement opportunity, but I love the people I work with and most of the guests I deal with on a daily basis."
good,i liked working there but i got up to early.i wouldn't go back to that shift but i would work there again.
good,A typical day would be opening up our Cash office for the day. Throughout the day I would help cashiers who need supervisor approval on registers or needing help with a guest. My co workers are a lot of fun because everyone is a team player.
good,Everyday provides you with tasks which you must work together as a cohesive team to accomplish.
good,"I enjoyed working at Target with the flexible hours, the different job duties, and working with people."
good,"Loved going into work each and everyday. The staff there were great to work with. It was an over all good job, but the hardest part was hours."
good,"Great managers and staff."
good,"Unload trucks,  stock meat, produce and dairy into cooler,"
good,"M-F from 4 am to 12:30 PM"
good,"Clocked in at 4am started unloading process in the back area, pulled pallets out to the floor and started stocking the new merchandise.  I learned techniques for stocking shelves like reading the item and location schematics.  The management team was ok.  The most enjoyable part of the job was having great co-workers."
good,Target has a great company model that is set up for you to succeed. From the floor to logistics they run a tight ship. The only thing I would suggest if you decide to choose this company is to ensure you make it to work on time or early because they will not hesitate to let you go if you don't adhere to the company policy on attendance.
good,"you will learn to be a good team member with skills in customer service in a fast, fun and friendly place. management is nice a efficient, co-workers are knowledgeable. The hardest part of the job is the lack of hours you get in a week, but you get to work with the friendliest people i know!"
good,"Fast paced work environment. "
good,Time fly's when working for target distribution center because is a fast past environment.
good,I really enjoyed both the focus on guest satisfaction and the people that I had the pleasure of working with.
good,There was always something different to do at Target. The benefits were great also.
good,"good entry level for management or marketing interns. Most Target stores adhere to consistent  guidelines and therefore, you can know what is expected and achieve goals and promotions."
good,"This was a seasonal position with great team work, which i enjoyed."
good,"I was a good place to work, great environment and the people I worked with were friendly and helpful."
good,"Fun place to work, willing to provide opportunity for movement. Stressful, but fast paced."
good,"Target is a great job for students with no real financial responsibilities. Target has a great work environment, some of the bosses are fun and respectable and team members are friendly. I must say though if your the type of person who works hard and waits patiently on promotions or recognition don't work for Target. I have been with Target for three years and 6 months now and I work my tail off everyday. I had team leaders and executive team leaders giving me credit and pumping my head up about promotions. But, if you don't hang with the right executive team lead, team lead or team members you can forget about everything. Target is to much of a political store to grow and develop at. Also, Target are giving out major pay cuts and cutting key hours away from team members who have a family to take care of just as well as the people in corporate and so. The only difference is THERE SIX FIGURED CHECKS AREN'T GETTING CUT AND THEY DON'T NOW WHAT IT MEANS TO HAVE TO LIVE FROM CHECK TO CHECK."
good,"The company has recently taken a stance to work differently, to accommodate the many different strengths of each team member in how they work most effectively."
good,Delivered excellent customer service by greeting and assisting each customer. Addressing customer inquiries and resolved complaints. Reorganized my departments to meet customers’ demands and to drive profitable sales. Contributed to merchandising ideas to keep the sales floor looking full. Displayed the appropriate signage for products and sales promotions.
good,"A normal day at work is filled with me making sure the people that walk into my store feel welcomed. At Target, we consider our store to be a ""home"" and the people that come inside are our guest. Therefore, as soon as a guest comes into our store, I greet them with a smile on my face and make sure that I am there to answer any and all questions that they may have. "
good,Worked in the food court and it was a routine daily job...loved my coworkers
good,"love the team work which this company incorporates, even more how they turn around and give back to the community."
good,"Typical day at work was never the same! Always helping out the team, planning out our workload, reviewing reports."
good,Love catching shoplifters...Great place to work and very laid back atmosphere
good,I worked in my own little office doing the store cash deposits and getting money bags set up for the next business day
good,"Constantly on our feet. I learned customer service is everything. Multitasking is very useful. I built great friendships with coworkers and had good relationships with my bosses. "
good,The position was a very rewarding and fun place to be at. I learned how to work quickly and communicate effectively. Most of my co-workers were friendly and easy to work with. The most enjoyable part of the job was that it was fast paced and was physically demanding. Hardest part of the job was the fact that it seemed repetitive after a while.
good,Stocked shelves before the store opened and during store hours. Shelves were fully stocked and store was cleaned before customers came in.
good,Not a place to have work life balance. The company expects to have your full commitment above all else even family.
good,This is a very flexible workplace in terms of work life balance.
good,"I was hired at Target as a Seasonal Employee in Soft lines Department, Cashier, Customer Service Associate. I was available to work anytime but was usually scheduled to work eveings. We usually met in the women's fitting room at the starting of the shift for a meeting. After, we started Zoning which consisted of bringing everything forward from all of the departments. As we went through all the departments we pulled out items that didn't belong in the department which were go backs. At the end of the night, whatever go backs we had left, we had to take the items to the departments they belong too. Well, the most enjoyable part of the job was getting Target's employee discount. It wasn't much but it was something."
good,"Really awesome people to work with, easy job picked it up quick."
good,"I work the early morning shift as a Flow Team Member. Unloading trucks and stocking shelves with other Team Members. It involves a lot of lifting and coordination, it's very enjoyable. I then switch over to ""In-stocks"" which is a scan of the entire store. The goal is to make sure product counts are up to par and all necessary product is stocked for costumer convenience. Any sale items out of stock get ""rain-checks"" and signs, and each week there is a ""drastic count."" These involve some computer skills. Of course, any shift requires attentiveness to customers and their questions/needs. Both shifts have to be done accurately and timely. They aren't particularly challenging and both are enjoyable."
good,"Target is an amazing company to work for and provides a healthy culture for the team and exceptional experience for our guests,"
good,"A day at Target is filled with a mixture of personalities and issues that need to be attended to.  As a supervisor, I have learned to use various resources and talents to handle difficulties that arise.  Target work environment is based on a team method.  Co-workers and management are comfortable around one another, but are also professional.  Meeting different people and obtaining various ways to interact with the guests is one of the best parts of working at Target."
good,If you can make it in the this high powered retail management environment  it will prepare you for future postions
good,"Overall a good place to work, but a lot of store management acts very high and mighty even when they don't know what they are doing."
good,"Each day I got to meet and greet guests that would come into the store everyday. I learned how to use a cash register. The management was okay with maintaining the work environment. My co-workers were friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job is dealing with a lot of guests that rush through the store on certain holidays, but what was enjoyable was working with the guests"
good,"Strong brand, tough to get promoted."
good,"I enjoyed working at Target.  It is was a great place to work for as a college student.  Pay was above your typical grocery store, and I gained a lot of valuable experience working with customers on a daily basis."
good,Target is a good employer and focuses on personal development.  The retail environment is fast-paced and demanding.
good,Shipping and receiving specialist. Checked Vendors in and out. Shipped and returned merchandise as needed. Checked product dates. Keep backroom and receiving area clean and organized. Handled electronic items. Loaded and unloaded trucks. Took care of hazardous material and recyclables. Working everyday freight from backroom to sales floor. Trained in various store materials.
good,"A typical day consists of conversing with previous associates on the days activities and obtaining knowledge on what to expect for the day. We learn about issues that have arisen as well as praises for those that are exceeding. Management isn't an issue but there are instances where management could step up more and become more involved. My co-workers are strong but there are a few that could use some more help. The ""hardest"" part of the job would be to maintain total professionalism with those consumers who overstep their boundaries and saying no when there are some skepticism. The best part of my job is being able to help consumers who are able to walk out of the store with a smile on their face knowing that their visit in the store was well worth it."
good,"A typical day at work involved efficiently balancing personal workloads with creating a great guest experience with the customer.  Specifically the work entailed providing overall coordination and support to the placement of merchandise on the sales floor.  I've learned how to correctly interact with both the customers and team members, and I've also learned proper problem management with both team members and customers.  Management and co-workers are part of a diverse team that pride themselves on professional courtesy and task completion. The hardest part of the job is pleasing everyone, especially a disgruntled customer.  However, the best part would be doing whatever possible to solve that same customer's problem."
good,"Great place to learn to multitask all while keeping the focus around the needs of the customers and team members alike.  Great place to learn all facets of retail from food service, to receiving merchandise to floor planning and leading a diverse team."
good,"When coming in to work, I check what needs to be done on the sale floor. Then the manager tells me what areas that i am responsible to clean. My co-workers are very nice and respectful. There really is not anything thats hard about it the job. You have to be able to time yourself in an orderly fashion so that everything done on time while assisting guest."
good,Being patient is key. Providing people with a customer service and making sure they're happy is also important although I don't get many hours as I'd like at this job.
good,"Target is a very well organized and safe place to work. However, they do loose employees due to hours lost."
good,I enjoyed working with the customers and helping them make choices and keeping them happy. I loved the job until they cut my hours to 8 hours a week. I liked all my co-workers they made me feel right at home when I first met them and offered any help they could to me. I learned how they sorted the clothing to be restocked. How to sort by departments.
good,Fast-paced retail environment. Everyone was always curtious and professional.
good,Target is a fast paced company who enjoys collobrating with others and creating solid solutions.
good,"Great people to work with and work for.  Amazing opportunities to hone leadership and ""soft"" skills."
good,"interacting with sales associates in the best possible way to provide top sales to guests.  I worked both sales which involved restocking and resetting shelves, along with check out lanes involving checking customers out.  The position seemed to be somewhat repetitive after a while, part of the job.  Fun co-workers."
good,worked well with co-workers. always busy. great time overall
good,It was a great experience and was glad to be a part of their team
good,working at target was ok. um we had a lot of issue with the mangers we had on our team. but we were still able to work as team.
good,"Mornings I would open the store and all the registers. Watch and support the cashiers and the customer service team members with daily activities. Close the store, count the register bags and lock away the money into the safe."
good,"Everyone there was really helpful. When i was in training the trainers taught me how to do everything i needed to do, They were really patient with me."
good,"It was an enjoyable experience. I have to say I was so excited when I was hired and through the entire orientation process. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to continue working there because I was in need of full-time employment. It was a wonderful experience though and I don't regret it."
good,"Target has a multitude of different areas to learn. I worked at Starbucks, on the lanes, soft/hard lines (clothing/electronics) as well as on food order (essentially warehouse type work dealing with the grocery section.) Before I left I also began to work flow-team which is the area that unloads truck shipments and stocks the store. My resume and ability to perform other jobs increased tremendously just by working at one store."
good,Great Benefits and Pay.  Great culture.  Not the place to work if you like structure.
good,"nice friendly place to work, with a great culture and core values. Only drawback is sometime worklife balance becomes an issue"
good,A typical day would start with checking in with Starbucks whether I am scheduled there or another department. Making sure that things are going well and taking care of things such as the weekly order.I learn about what changes might need to be made according to the day and it's happenings or for future happenings. I check in to see how my team is doing. One of the hardest parts of my job would have to be knowing how to manage my time wisely when different circumstances arise and things need to be altered. I love working with people and making guests' day with even a simple smile.
good,I started there in the summer of 2010. I enjoyed the joy meeting lots of people. Smiles from strangers that made me feel I was doing a good job. I worked sometimes 4hrs a day sometimes 8hrs. I had a good supervisor she was there to help me when I needed. The people I worked with were funny and we always had a good time. Guess the hardest part of that job was the holidays. Never a down moment but made the time go by. What made my day was knowing I made a differene for someone. Liked that job and enjoyed the people.
good,typical day at work would be going and reviewing what team members we have for the day and how much coverage we have. making sure everything at that front of the store is in order and guest are checking out in a fast timely manor. i have learned a lot from how to deal with guest that are not pleased to helping new team members learn their roles. my team members and management are easy and fun to work with.

good,It is a typical retail job. I have learned to take tasks as they come and execute them to the best of my ability. My team is fun but still gets the job done efficiently. I enjoy being able to help people find something they might be looking for. The hardest part was during the holidays with the massive influx of people and products to sort through and assist.
good,"Target has always been a fun environment, you learn so many different aspects of retail. Every department of the store has teams that work together to keep the flow of the store thriving for sales. Management has gotten to be younger and inexperienced which I understand because they don't pay them as much as veterans in management. Co-workers are have often kept with a positive attitude despite the curveballs retail will throw at you wither its an angry guest or a workload that account for more hours given. The hardest part is understanding that a lot of things are not what they seem. The most enjoyable part is seeing all the newly marked clearance!"
good,Clock in on time. Help check customers in and out. They have great discounts.
good,"This company keeps you busy. We process scripts on an outdated software that makes typing a single prescription a very time consuming activity. Filling, pick, and drop off of prescriptions are always busy throughout the day. Target in general does fewer scripts then most chain pharmacies, but that is because are system is so outdated if we did the same number of scripts, we wouldn't be able to continue with our work load."
good,"Flexible hours, but not flexible positions. Not able to move around much within the job. Work was easy enough, though would get very dirty.  Team was ok.  Hardest part was super early hours. I did enjoy getting to help people throughout the day."

good,"A typical day at work consisted of clocking in at 6 pm and hand stacking freight on 53' trailers from floor to ceiling and nose to tail, but you had to be careful to distribute the weight right or it would have to come back to be unloaded and reloaded."
good,"Usually I would be responsible for unloading freight trucks, stocking the shelves and assisting customers with finding items they were looking for and product reviews. The management was decent with their helping employees that needed assistance. I learned a lot about customer service and retail stores, how to assist customers and maintain professional attitudes despite your own personal feelings. The hardest part of the job was learning planogram's and POS standards"
good,"Working for target was great, fun, and fast paced. I learned how to better serve customers. The management team was great, I enjoyed having different managers. Hardest part of the job was knowing that not all customers were going to be satisfied even though I gave great service."

good,Great company to work for unless you need a full time position.
good,To me it was the same routine. It was more about numbers then anything else.
good,"Every workday I would greet customers and help them choose the right portraits for them to purchase. Talking to them while showing them their portraits and ringing them up was fun. I always learned about new people which is always enjoyable. My manager was very accommodating, though my school schedule was a little problem for her. The most challenging part of this job was learning how to use the camera to take the portraits myself. However, I think that if I had stayed longer I would have become very adapt in that field."
good,"I worked in the food service dept. I was responsible for making and preparing the food for that day and the next, I also made sure inventory was fully stocked. cleaned and maintained the enitre department."

good,Sales Floor Team Members typically stock the sales floor and straighten the designated isles. Team members will fill in for register duties as needed and provide excellent customer service. Co-workers are friendly and very helpfull. Everyone helps eachother without question. The hardest part of the job is making the sales floor presentable during the holidays. The most enjoyable part of the job is when Target provides its employees with lunch and candy.
good,"There were multiple customer issues that needed to be solved by me each day. cleaning and organizing were apart of my daily duties. The best part about working in the customer service field is the different people I conversated with throughout my days there.

good,"Nice place to start a career but your required to work weekends and morning, afternoon, and night shifts."

good,had a ball working for them. will reapply if need. management was great employees also

good,"Target was a great place to work it helped me to learn and appreciate all the job positions in a major retail store.  Everyone works together as a team.  Much of your time really is spent putting the store back together at the end of the night to make it look presentable to the customer and a pleasant place to shop.  They are a customer service first though store and helping the guest is tops on the list of duties, along with cashiering. a job that can be trying at times.  Phone service is also a job duty that  I enjoyed on the floor answering customers questions over the phone and by being the store operator  and directing calls on many nights  hardest part cleaning up if a customer got sick.  Best part the variety of employees.  Great place to meet new and interesting people."

good,"Great place to start a career! You are given a ton of responsibility from day 1.  However, there is a reason Target always appears on the list of ""Best Places to Start a Career"" but never on the list of ""Best Places to Work.""  That reason is work/life balance.  If you get a chance to work at Target, take it - but know it will likely only be for a few years."

good,Target was a good company to work for. I loved the people. Felt I got good training. Since it's such a big Target that I worked for I didn't get many hours. So that was the down fall.
good,"Although I had worked at two different targets, my first one was great. They always had fun, but yet our work got done. They always did things for us to recognize us for great work or just because and the holidays. The pay was not the greatest. "
good,"Great job if you're willing to work long hours and willing to relocate to continue to grow within the company."
good,I enjoy working at Target.  I like all the people and meeting all the guests.  I have learned something new everyday that I have worked here.  The hardest part of my job is closing one night and opening the next day.  The most enjoyable part of my job is working with the money.

good,A typical day at work consisted of making sure the reshop was put back onto the right shelf and I learned more about how to take down ads. I also went up to be a cashier when the lines where backed up. The management was good but can be better and all of my co-workers got along and performed teamwork. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting the help the guest out that needed help when asked.
good,The business is focused heavily on maintaining its culture.  The work life balance leaves something to be desired.  The team is great.  The management appears to be invested in your development.  Long days and few real days off are a drawback.  Plan on receiving a lot of feedback.
good,I enjoyed my time with this company it was a good experience as far and working with my team members.
good,"I learned great customer service skills and logistic skills."
good,"I worked here as a contractor, so I was barred from a lot of employee privileges so can't give a solid review. People either loved their jobs and benefits, or felt overworked an tired. Clearly a shark tank with employees out to get each other's jobs. Strong corporate culture. You will have to drink the Kool-Aid if you have any chance of moving up."
good,unload truck then stock items on floor then i did cashier in the electronics area
good,"Target is a good company, all about teamwork and being part of a friendly environment. If they pay was more at the time to support myself and home I would still be with the company"
good,"A typical work day for me at target is very busy for me. My job is manage follow up and execute task, leave no for do overs. I focus on the brand of the store, making sure first impression is where it needs to be. My work load rolls out four weeks ahead so in in order for me to meet the companies expectation I have to plan out the work and each week is planned out, also I delegate who will be responsible for which task. I'm also responsible for training and development. It is very hard to work with some of my co-workers because I have really high expectations. They tend to focus on what we don't have to get the job instead  coming up with a plan to complete the job. For me I have a image to protect when it come to my work, I take it very serious. The hardest part of my job is completing the workload with the little workload we have. For me its a developing process because it strategically help me to plan and execute the work. The most enjoyable part of my job is when people rely on me for answers to a situation or need help with their planning for their work load."
good,"Target is a good place to work"
good,"Always busy and on the go, keeps you on your feet. I've learned wonderful customer service skills. Management was awesome and co-workers were as well."
good,"This store in particular has struggled with keeping the right head count for management. I have been carrying the job duties of three managers for almost four months now. It makes my job very difficult and in turn negatively affects my perspective of enjoying my work. I cannot be advanced because I am at a position that cannot be replaced. I am solely responsible for the training, development, and scheduling of 40+ employees, in which those numbers will increase as the holiday season draws near."
good,I am a people person.  I work better when I am working with others.  I am a self starter and very goal orientated and I push to meet and exceed any expectations set for me.
good,Each day brings on a new challenge whether it be juggling a variety of tasks or strategically planning the future of the store.
good,"great working with people, customers are sometimes a strain"

good,Target is a great place to work and really shows care for their employees.
good,Its a decent place to work. The management is pretty nice and flexible when it comes to scheduling hours. The co-workers are good as well. My only complaint is that advancement is difficult.
good,when i first started for this company it was a nice fun place to work but then became very corporate.
good,"Manage a staff of 35 "
good,"Showed up on time, started working on register immediately, got a break every 3-4 hours, learned how to run cash register, everyone was real helpful and helped me through my first few days, hardest part of the job was trying to talk people into getting a red card, most enjoyable part was getting to go outside and gather shopping carts."
good,Worked for Target for a few years as pharmacy manager and overall a good company to work for.  They do however seem to make you do a lot of unnecessary paperwork and tasks that are very time consuming and tedious with no benefit.
good,my team member was was great i'll miss my co workers and manager
good,"unrealistic expectations, no one ever seems to retire from this company. more focused on hiring someone because they have a degree"
good,"When I first started working I liked the job a lot, but as time went on I started to dislike it.  Many of the managers were very critical of the employees performance. For example if an employee did not manage to have a customer sign up for a store card then the employee would be criticized about their performance.  On countless occasions my employment had been threatened simply for not getting enough customers to sign up for the store card. The communication between the different Managers on duty was atrocious.  For example I had asked one manager for a day off and he let me have the day off, but a few days later another manager approached me about not coming in on the day I had requested off and I told them that I had it approved with the other manager."
good,"Organizing  products , fill shelves and be involved as a team player."
good,"I currently license my artwork through Oopsy Daisy, Fine Art for Kids. They have given my children's tremendous exposure and credibility through avenues such as Target Stores and The Land of Nod."
good,Leaders make the environment friendly and easy to work with.
good,Great experience spending the summer with Target. Their Executive Team Leader Program is well designed and well executed. I got deep into merchandise marketing strategies and sales reports. I appreciated the fact that I was assigned multiple projects and thus gained more exposure.
good,"Low pay, no real chances to advancement unless your a favorite and very wishy washy on directions"
good,"unloading the truck putting boxes on pallets and bowling them down the isle to be stocked on shelves. i learned how not to rely on myself but to my team members. the managment was very friendly, co-workers were very friendly and nice. the hardest part was trying to keep up with our quota and trying to beat the clock. I liked how it was constantly busy and when there was downtime we could help customers"
good,I don't really recommend Target for anyone looking for a long term job. It's great if you just need an interim job while looking for something serious.
good,"	Performed  daily loads 3x a day taking merchandise from back trailers to prepare stock for the sales floor."
good,"Great work environment that required quick, on your toes thinking in order to better serve the guest that required our assistance."

good,Target is really good with giving wanted hours. It's easy for the most part no matter where you are stationed to work.
good,Target is a large company. I worked and the distribution center and advancement is non existent there. Pay is ok but for what you are asked to do versus pay no good.
good,"As an Executive for Target, I am responsible for ensuring I role model an amazing shopping experience to our guest. I have 2 managers as direct reports, in which we are continuously strategizing how to maintain and improve processes."
good,"- Customer Service w/ all types of electronics"
good,"My only problem with target at the time I was there around 2008"
good,"Most of this job was the same thing a lot of days. Unload stock and put on shelves, organize current products on shelves."
good,"I would come in and be assigned a section of the store to maintain. I would be responsible for at least two carts of reshop to be put back on the shelves and in its rightful place, I assisted customers throughout my shift and as well as all salesfloor associates I was a backup cashier."
good,"Target is a fun place to work. You gain a lot of experience working there. You have the ability to move up quickly if you work hard and you are good at your job. Target puts a lot of time into the development of its employees to make them better team members, which you dont find at a lot of company. Because Target is a major Fortune 500 retail chain it is well known and has a good reputation in the industry. Target is fast paced and one of its core beliefs is getting the job done right, quickly and effectively all in the name of making its guest happy for repeat business. "

good,"It is fun and friendly."
good,Working at Target was a good experience and I always had a enjoyable time working there. I worked in the backroom and stocked the shelfs and also helped with customer service out on the floor. I will always remember the hardest part of the job was having to use the forklift to bring down heavy boxes from the top shelf in the backroom which was always scary. I would recommend to anyone looking from a nice job if you are between jobs or want a career in retail target would be a good place to be.
good,"Supports many different life styles, and generally understanding."
good,"Assistant store manager. Very employee focused company. Company believes in supporting women, and is very involved in the community. "
good,"Seeing I personally am very ""team"" oriented, Target fosters a true ""team"" environment which works very well for me.  Resources are always made available, including other team members, to ensure personal success.  What I truly enjoyed each and every shift was the impact I made in helping, guiding and assisting guests and improving their perishable food purchasing experience.    "
good,"pick and pull order, unload large quanities of merchindice of trucks, pack truck and transport merchindice to and from off site, learned to use elictric fork lift, wave machine, and power jack"
good,"For instocks, your day will start early in the morning before the store opens to ensure all aisles are accurately presented as well as stocked by scanning them. For backroom, you will need to consistently pull items off the shelves that are being sold throughout the day in designated time periods."
good,"My overall experience at this job was good except for favoritism. I worked as a stocker, cashier, sales floor, some backroom, fitting room operator, and some clerical. Lots of training, learned a lot, good coworkers, all aspects were enjoyable."
good,"I started there as HR for 2 years, then went to Cash Office, Followed by Front Supervisor and also moved to the sales floor doing team lead job.  I learned a great deal with the store.  I had great co-workers.  Management was somewhat supportive. The hardest part of the job is learning the balance of productivity and customer service.  I enjoyed everyone I worked with and our repeat customers were fantastic. "
good,basically it was summer school. prep the seniors students for college and the working world.
good,Unloading trucks and stalking merchandise to the sales floor. Co-workers and management are friendly and professional. Hardest part of the job is the lack of hours available.

good,"Respond to incidents within the store.  Conduct surveillance of the sales floor and employee areas either by physical or using camera.  "
good,Unregulated hours  and oft times called in  to work on days off
good,"Overall an enjoyable company to work for. This company helped me develop my overall leadership and management skills, while utilizing my existing retail background knowledge."
good,"It is not a bad company to work for, they have excellent benefits, however it is difficult to get promotion."
good,Learned that every team leader is focused on their own task at hand. There is no room for improvement after becoming a Senior Team Leader at certain Targets. Hardest part part of the job is living up to their exceedingly high expectations. Most enjoyable part of my job was being able to work with my friends.
good,A typical day at work involved making sure all the cash was accounted for. I was responsible for the front end and had to make sure the lines were moving quickly. I also had to be a motivator for the other team members to get them to sell Target Credit Cards which was highly important. The hardest part of the job was the few occasions when I could not get us to reach the goal for how many Target Cards sold. The most enjoyable part of the job was being a team leader coming from a management position at my previous job.
good,"My day starts at 4 am unloading a truck with a very productive team and getting done  with a 2400 piece truck in an hour and 10 min, then my managers have set up everything for the day in order for us to get our jobs done easy"
good,"A decent retail company to work for, if you are younger.  Development opportunities are not as prevelant for older team members."
good,"Start doing Instocks at 7am, going through the whole store shooting Research and putting up rainchecks for out of stock items. At 11am we have to be finish shooting. After that we print our signs and work out our pulls. All my co-workers and Team Leads are really nice and always ready to help anyone that needs help. The hardest part of my job is that we don't get enough hours. What i enjoy the most is just going to work and learning something new everyday. "
good,Working here was a great experience. Meeting these happy customers and the cash register always made me enjoy working there.
good,While working there I enjoyed the guest and other coworkers. I would go in and say hi to whoever was working and if you needed help the other employees would come and help in case they were already with a guest.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of me waking up at 4am. Then arriving early mornings unloading Trucks, and organizing merchandise. Lifting and carrying heavy objects/merchandise carefully all around store. After the truck has been unloded, we then go aisle through aisle correctly stocking, reading expiration dates, organizing new products, and labeling them. Constantly going up and down store untill everything in the work environment was clean and suessfully completed. I learned at my time working at Target is that , even though it may be hard work, it is always capable to be accomplished and worth knowing you worked  hard to achive a goal. My coworkers and I had amazing communication towards eachother and customers. They would say I was always reliable and responsible. The hardest thing about my job was learning how everything worked, But with training and a little time of practice I learned rather fast. The most enjoyable part of my job, was making friendships, amoungst my cowrokers and manager. Providing excellent service to customers, and proving to myself that I was able to do such hard work. "
good,Decent place to work compared to other jobs at similar companies.
good,"Overall, I would have to say that one thing Target is really good at is team member (employee) recognition and overall talent development.  Target is constantly pushing leadership to identify, and mentor, talent found in the store so that they may one day become leaders themselves. All things considered, my favorite part of Target would have to be the people I work with. Peoples hired by Target, no matter what level, often share a similar mindset with one another. Many great friendships are formed due to the hiring expectations set my Target initially."
good,Hmm..Target was fun place to work. Everyday my manager gave me goals and I mostly filled those goals. I made a record over there I sold more than 100 credit cards with in 3 months on that location.Some co-workers got jealous they used to do weird stuff. I did all my work with Honesty and always smile on my face..
good,Customer driven. Teaches great team work skills as all associates work together
good,I really enjoyed going to work at Target because the managers and other employees really cares about each other. Everyone made it fun. You get a decent discount when you work there and always enjoy hearing about new products before they go out on the sales floor
good,I really enjoyed working for Target. If it wasn't for the time compliance law I might still be there. I throught it was a great place to work. The managers were friendly and so were the co-workers. The hardest part of the day was going up and down the tall ladders they had.
good,they have agreat bunch of people working there. I hated working holidays.
good,"We work as a team to unload store merchandise for stocking on sales floor. Hardest part of the job was the physical work of carrying crates, pulling racks."
good,a typical day would be checking customers out with their merchandise and helping other sales team members with reshop if needed.
good,I only worked here seasonally so I don't have much experience but everyone was pretty nice. 
good,team members are really the company's assets. they the ones who sells the brand because of thier customer service and knowledge of the product.
good,"Typical day at work consist of Zoning, which is pulling product forward on the shelves and pegs in order for the store to look good, cashiering, and helping guests. Overall A good place to work. Not too fast paced as many other jobs but its good. The best part of the job is, being able to help guest during the holidays and knowing that you helped make some child's Christmas. Knowing that because of you, a kid just got the present that he/ she has been waiting for."
good,I had a solid experience as a Target Backroom member and would recommend it to any one looking for an minimum wage part time job. 
good,fast fun and friendly place to work. could increase the hours but other than that its a great part time place to work
good,"Because of my relocating, I only worked at Target for 5 months. However, during my time there the people and the environment were great! If I lived closer I definitely would have stayed."
good,"Clock in, stocked shelves, helped people locate items, took breaks, clocked out, went home"
good,"Target is a very productive and fun place to work. Especially for those who are coming in as first time workers. Although Target will gladly cross train you, there is not a lot of advancement opportunities without a college degree. Being that other than a management position you will be stuck at the same pay rate no matter what part of the store you work at. Management are some of the nicest people I have met. Very good at working with you on your work schedule and any problems you face at in the workplace. The hardest part of my job was all the weekends i had to work. Depending on your position you rarely got a Saturday or Sunday off unless you asked for it. The most enjoyable part of my job was coming in seeing all my co workers and helping guests that need help."
good,Employee friendly workplace.  Well managed and pleasant enviroment
good,I have learned how to work with all different kinds of people.  The hardest part of the job was keeping my personal feelings apart from my professional feelings.  
good,"I enjoyed coming into work, looked forward to interacting with customers, team members were like family, loved it"
good,Daily task involved alot of physical labor but the setup of the store made it an easy one. Learned soemthing new everyday and worked with helpful and friendly staff. Getting adjusted to working late nights is the only tough part.
good,Corporate team atmosphere fostering productivity and responsibility.
good,Target taught me to work hard and be dedicated to a company and a team. I was highly respected and given the tools to continue to be a asset to any agency I am a part of.
good,Working for target was a great learning experience on contributing to help the company grow.  
good,I was there for 4 years. I love coffee so it was a great fit for me. I moved to so I ended up finding a new job
good,There's always something for you to do. Either your helping a customer find a product (on the phone or in the store.) or your helping out up front as a cashier. The hardest part of the job is keeping the customers satisfied during the holidays.
good,"•	Customer service"
good,"I enjoyed working at Target, because I got alot of different work experience. I started as a salesfloor associate where I learned customer service, then as a backroom asscociate I learned warehouse duties, and finally worked as a photo lab specialist running the photo lab."
good,"very easy and relaxed work atmoshere"
good,I enjoyed working at Target for the time being. It was nice getting to know most of the people there and most of the people that I was working with had great skills and go above and beyond their point of communication. 
good,Job is very compatable with anyone no matter how old or young. Managment is all around and works well with everyone. Pay is average.
good,"I would help guset service with returns, help cashiers with large transactions, and delegate lunches and breaks. I also would fill endcaps and coolers. Then at the end of the night I would collect all the money from every register and re-bank it for the next day, including coins and bills. "
good,"Target is a fantastic place to work. The best part about going to work every morning is knowing that you will be in a stress free environment. The management team is very helpful and always appoint to meet the needs of their employees. My co-workers were very friendly and welcoming. If I ever had trouble with a task they were right there helping me every step of the way. The hardest part was leaving this wonderful corporation.  But I did enjoy every aspect of of this job."
good,"Sales Floors"
good,Cashiering I learned to be fast but accurate with the skills required for that job. 
good,"Each day I would redo at least one aisle of the store, most of the time more. All the while helping customers. Working for Target helped me learn more effective interpersonal communication skills. It also taught me how to deal with a hierarchy in the workplace. Having management that actually responded to concerns and needs of employees is a huge benefit to working for Target. The hardest part of the job is definitely time-management. But the most enjoyable part is walking away from an aisle that is clean, neat and perfect!"
good,"Typical days depended on where you were required to work for the day but the store was overall pretty flexible and so are the team members. Sometimes team members were pulled to work in areas not assigned to them for the day and were also pulled to help out other areas of the store. It provided a lot of experience doing more than one position requirement. Typical days always relied on gues services and being fast, fun and friendly. Team member positions required stocking shelves, straightening shelves, putting product back on the sales shelves, answering incoming calls, cashiering and working in electronics, food avenue and guest service."
good,the staff was fantastic and always such great store to work for
good,I have learned a great deal in having to work with many different people in different walks of life. Dealing with customer issues has given me the ability to handle stressful situations with ease.
good,"To work with team very good management, friendly staff."
good,A great leadership experience where high standards and accountability are the key to driving great results.
good,I would off load and receive freight daily. I also would use battery operated equipment to store pallets of freight.
good,"I started out taking in shopping carts, learned the registar, then moved to the back room. I took this job as seasonal help, but I soon got burnt out."
good,"Fast paced yet they didn't work with my school schedule. Management was ok, but the pay was low."
good,At Target I had a chance to develop and coach others on a daily basis. Each department and individual worked to ensure guest needs were met.
good,Everyone who works here has a great attitude on working here and all genuinely enjoy their jobs. Fosters great teams.
good,Had daily meetings for safety and company concerns. Hand out daily work assignments. Provided company training for all new hires.
good,learned so much from the company being one of the originals targets team members i take great pride on this.my work experience with Target was a great one.
good,In-store fun for team members.
good,Target is a great place to work. The Team Members make it worth going to work everyday and making it through the day. A typical day is hectic but fun and fast paced. Managment is nice and they will listen if you need to talk. The best part of the job is the Guests. The regulars that come in just to see you and it makes your day.
good,"- Supervises 30 employees, conducts a daily breakout for the team."
good,Worked in most pharmacies in the Twin Cities and around MN. Was able to jump in and perform all staff pharmacist duties in unfamiliar environments.
good,I worked second shift so it was a very difficult job to have when you have children. Tough work but very good pay
good,Targets model is straight on. I wish they cared more about employees than just meeting numbers
good,"I supervise the front end staff (cashiers, service desk, starbucks and food avenue); i normally cover breaks, get changed and make sure the guests are getting attended to in a timely manner; i adore my co-workers that come to work ready to work and do what is needed; what makes the job hard is when there is not a lot of help to cover what needs to be covered."
good,Working close with management about day-to-day operations. Managing team members daily to complete task and objectives set by upper management.
good,"This was a fun job with many opertunities to learn about and work in every dept. which I did, then proceeded to advance to a yard jockey position then onto a CDL otr driver. After accepting the job, I decided driving a semi was not for me. My position had already been filled after a year of driving so I moved on instead of going backwards at Target."
good,Overall the enivorment is friendly and the team has a high energy level through out the store. Whats kept me here for more that 5 years is the great team I have encounter everywhere. Only negative thing I can say is the pay scale needs improvements.
good,I felt there wasn't a team effort and there was no advancing. It was a dead end job plus it was extremely boring.
good,Target Cafe in my opinion is a wonderful place to work. I love the fact that the days go by fast and how focused they are in keeping their guests happy. Our management also is wonderful and readily available. My coworkers work well with each other and rarely have disagreements . when we do however we quickly solve them and focus on the task at hand. I would have to say the hardest part of the job is keeping up with demand. its a very fast paced resturant but we manage well. Honestly I would have to say the most enjoyable part of every day working in the target cafe is seeing my guests happy and seeing our regulars everyday.
good,"Target used to be the best place to work in my opinion. The benefits continue to improve and they're continually making improvements by the year. For someone like me that works hard every time I walk in the door, there's no advancement for me. Team leads get their friends hired or someone that doesn't have a clue what they are doing get promoted because they are favored by certain individuals. Management seems to only be concerned about their bottom line and not about their team members anymore. The culture of this company has declined rapidly by the year and I stick by the company hoping that there will be changes. I am constantly lied to and promised things and changes that never happen by management. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the smile on a guests face when I am able to help them find something or lift furniture into their vehicle after purchasing items. In my time working for my Team lead I have learned how to manage situations, co-workers, and paperwork. The hardest part of my job is working 6 days a week, not getting 40 hours, and knowing no matter how hard I work, I have reached my ceiling and that there is no advancement for me"
good,Target is a cool company the stores are clean and they really stress keeping it that way. The managemnt at the stores is usually pretty scatterbrained not really good at handling situations. Like a teacher who only knows the answers on the anser sheet and that's it
good,I gained a lot of experience there. Management changed a lot due to the seasons. The people there were great to work with
good,Learned good customer service. Didnt have much of an opportunity to explore new areas of the job. Wasnt really offered to do so.
good,Management is with Target CW. They listen to your concerns. They work in the Dallas location and recruit to the best employers in Dallas.
good,Wasnt the best paying job
good,"I was a cashier and helped the front lines. I would balance my draw at the end of everyday, I would assist the customers with any concerns or questions they may have."
good,Being a security officer gave me an opportunity to gain experience in the law enforcement field.
good,peferct job for people in school.lots of good looking female workers. Some managers make it hard to work there.
good,Providing fast fun and friendly customer service to guest.
good,Work depended on the season and what the demand was. Management was helpful and fun to work with. Inventory skills
good,First job. Learned some useful people skills but had to finish school to acquire high school diploma
good,"Working overnight was no issue but their motto is ""More With Less"", meaning we are cutting employees but we expect you to do your job, their job & our job. I did however gain a lot of knowledge & skills in the retail world, from everything you see to everything that you don't. Management had their favorites and those are the ones who got hours on the schedule. they were also friendly until their boss showed up, then we had to perform miracles to make them look good. The hardest part of the job was never knowing when you came back to work, would your job still be there because they looked for or made up reasons to fire you once you no longer appealed to them. I was not terminated but i've seen it go on so much. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to come up with plans with co workers to show management no matter what you put on us we can handle it plus more."
good,"I learned at this company to not take things guest say to heart. I learned how to promote Red cards and how to properly educate guests on its benefits. The hardest part of my job is working at two different places at the same time, being at Target Food Cafe and being a Front-end cashier. Sometimes when the lines are backed up, I am instructed to come to help check out guest in a different work center. When I go to help, there are people who are waiting for me to come back, sometimes they are very frustrated and/or end up leaving. The perks at my job is the fact we constantly have something going on for team members, for example they have volunteer activities regularly that we can participate in. We are able to unit as team away from the job."
good,I loved working for Target. The management was wonderful when I forst started working there. As time went on and management changed it went downhill. I loved my coworkers and the things I did.
good,A typical day at work was very fast paced.
good,I worked at Target for about a year and a half. It was a good place to work. They worked with your schedule. The only reason I quit was because I was only getting about 15 hours a week.
good,"led my team to do their best pulling products that were sold during the day, back stock items that did not fit on floor"
good,Typical day at work:
good,It was fun while it lasted! I really enjoyed the people I worked with but just wasn't something I wanted to do for longevity.
good,coworkers were great
good,I liked that i could save money by not having to go to the supermarket all the time. it was a easy and relaxed environment(except for the holidays)
good,"a day at Target would be good always kept busy with things to at work. I learned how to use a cash register, a PDA. The co-workers were really nice and easy to get along with. The most enjoyable part of the job was to see customer happy."
good,"Target is a typical retail workplace. Workloads can be excessive during busy seasons. Management was fairly reasonable but also under pressure to meet excessive goals during the busy seasons. All types of people work for the store, you never really know what to expect."
good,"a great job for people in college, management is friendly but expect you to stay longer than expected to complete the job."
good,it was nice to start but the turnover was to high i lerned a lot working at target and would for it
good,I would provide assistance to people at the cash registers.
good,"Working in the stores of Target is a fast paced job. Most of the time it is enjoyable but most days, senior management does not give us the payroll and resources to complete all projects. The best part is that you get opportunities to improve your leadership and the worst is the retail hours."
good,i would greet customers and complete transactions
good,"A typical day or night consisted of scanning guests merchandise, bagging them, and then collecting their payments in the register. Management was very fair to everyone. My coworkers were very nice to work for and I enjoyed working with everyone. The hardest part of the job was keeping cool because it was always so hot on the registers with no fans. The most enjoyable was working with guests and working with money and making great friends."
good,"This being my very first job back when I was in high school in 2008, I took quite a bit out of it. I loved and hated it so much. In retrospect I took so much from it and apply much that I had learned on the job to day to day professional life. It's a great company to work for and they will teach you organization, efficiency, and diligence like no other retail company."
good,"I had fun, helped the customers the best i could and my co workers were easy to work with."
good,"Working as a logistics team member requires a good amount of physical activity moving items and making sure they are stocked correctly in the stockroom. I have learned how to problem solve and find creative solutions in order to ensure that items are easily accessible and stocked correctly. Managers are friendly and helpful. My co-workers were friendly and easy to talk to, and are also very helpful for completing tasks quickly and efficiently. The hardest part of the job is during fourth quarter (end of the year around the holiday season) as the volume of items coming in to the store dramatically increases. The most enjoyable feeling about the job is the feeling of accomplishment when you complete a difficult task."
good,"I loved working at target. The people who you work with are amazing, everyone works together as a family and work gets distributed equally."
good,Easy to find a job with minimal raise or professional growth.
good,A typical day here was most times low and rushed. I loved the feeling of a team and having some freedom to do go and come in our down time. My co-workers were all friendly and great people. The headrest part of the job was keeping busy in your down time to not be sent home.
good,"Good reports from relatives in Muncie,Indiana,USA.Good working conditions.Contented work force"
good,"I was hired seasonal, the hardest was around Thanksgiving and Christmas time, very crowded and everyone needed help. My typical day was early morning go around the store and order all the items needed from 8 to 11 then at eleven i did rain checks and printed signs, placed them accordingly then proceeded to push merchandise and do zoning around the store. Helped customers when they had questions, answer phones on the floor and assisted as a back up cashier when needed."
good,"A great place for someone looking for a second/ part-time job, or as a first job. Advancement can be tough if you are not looking to become an Executive for the Corporation."
good,"A typical day at work begins at 8am. I prepare my work center for the guests by keeping my work station clean and ready for the guest when they are ready to process their transaction. I learn how to interact with many diverse groups of people. My management team inspires me to be the best I can be. My co-workers are very supportive and encouraging. I cannot find the hardest part of my job. It can be challenging at times, but not hard. I really enjoy being apart of a team as well as being a leader."
good,"I would come into work, And start the day with reshop (returning unwanted merchandise) then we would gather with the manager, listen to our daily tasks and go off to work. i stocked the shelves in the market area."
good,"Some of the supervisors were a little bit off at the time I worked there, so I can only give a biased review. But aside from them it was a good job."
good,It was a good place to work I learned how to help customers how to zone merchandise and maintain a good zone. Also learned how to be a good team worker assistaning and training team members on how to accomplish task in a resonable time.
good,Everyone is nice and friendly to each other. The sales floor team works hard to satisfy the guests need on what they are looking for. The managers create huddles to see how the employees are doing and making sure the employees are keeping up with the work.
good,"Great work experience, working with hard working employees. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing you helped someone."
good,"Target expects team members to be fast, fun, and friendly. You'll find that most people who work there fit the bill. You'll fit in fast and make good friends. You can be asked to go above and beyond your job from time to time. They are very understanding as well."
good,the management really didnt care about the employees but it was an okay place to work for i went in and got my work done and left
good,A typical day at was just fast pace at times
good,Responsible for managing all the credit card and cash transactions in department store environment.
good,"It was a fun friendly place to work, the work wasn't difficult at all. The only thing that i didnt like was the favoritism and the hours, i didnt get many."
good,"I put all the returns away. Cleanup and zone all the departments. Also I am the receptionist some days. Answer phones, let guest in the fitting room, sort out all returns from guest services, and make pages for the pharmacy. When store closes check the fitting rooms. When team members need help at the registers I go up and help them checkout guest."
good,Good income and benefits company is more for numbers and reports than for the people.
good,"Working at Target for several months has definitely taught me how to keep efficient on a set time schedule. With the Plannogram Team, we had specific deadlines to have the aisles ready for new products that had to be met punctually. The hardest part of this is moving around the products that are already there and figuring out their new location. The best part of the job is definitely the people I met and worked with."
good,Target is a great place to start as a leader. You learn many skills needed to grow as a leader.
good,I loved the fact that your co-workers were also your friends. I knew going into work everyday that we would be able to get everything done but also have a fun time doing so. We would always cheer each other on which not only made for a stress free work environment but that fun environment would also reflect back to the guest to make their visit that much more enjoyable. The only unenjoyable part of the job was upper management who acted more like a bully than a manager. One who would take it to a personal level whenever you were not available to work on your only day off.
good,"In June of 2011 until the end of October 2012, I had the opportunity to work for Target. During this, I worked as a back room attendant on an over night shift where a team an I unloaded stock off the truck and restocked the store. In addition to this, I was able to develope strong team work skills while getting to know my co-workers and learning how to become a better team member. What I enjoyed most was being able to meet both management and corporate staff during work hours daily."
good,"Each team member was assigned an area to organize, keep clean, and put the merchandise in the correct spot. I learned about how to work retail. When a customer would ask about a product I was walk them to the item, then show them a target brand that would be the same thing just a better price. If a customer asked about certain dog collar for training, I would also point out that we had dog treats on sale as well. My co-workers helped me out a lot and they were very nice. If you were closing when someone was done with their area they would ask over the walkie who need help. The hardest part of the job would be keeping a good time frame. Some nights I would be assigned two areas that would be shopped in a lot and if a customer asked about a certain product that was on the other side of the store I would walk them directly to the item. On a busy night it became very difficult to get everything done and still make the customers our number one priority. The best part was helping people out. If I finished my areas early I would go help co-workers with their areas. Especially when a customer needed help and I would show them a cheaper and better product and the customer would be so appreciative."
good,Was able to have a very flexable schedule here which was great when raising my kids. Co-workers were friendly and helpful. Only real problem was I was not elligable for insurance because I did not AVERAGE 36 hours per week each year!
good,"A typical day at work involves managing creative ideas into concrete fabric developments. I learned a lot during my job at Target. The culture is amazing and involves a great sense of self accomplishment . It allows the employee to understand where he stands and how you can improve. The hardest part of the job is juggling so many categories,however that made the position more enjoyable and exciting at the same time."
good,"A typical day at work is setting up, lifting boxes, pulling pallets, a lot of work"
good,i have fun working at target i know how to manage all the customer thier needs in the store.and help the customer
good,"It was a great experience but I wasn't treated fairly in my eyes, they would call me in to work early or to cover others shifts but when the season was over they decided not to keep me which really hurt me."
good,"greeting customers, checking customers out, bagging items, handling money,"
good,- On a weekly basis I complete payroll for over 180 employees and on a daily basis I answer and help with any concerns that the employees and co-workers may have
good,Good place to work and shop. Competitive prices. They have great customer service.
good,"I have worked here at target for almost 2 years and it has had its up and downs. But Currently the management inplace doesnt seem capable of taking on new ideas to complete task in a much easier fashion. Its a fun job to work for awhile, but not everyday. The hours get cut really short, leaving you little to nothing for each pay check, You need a second job to support yourself if your going to work here."
good,Fast paced distribution center. I learned that I should get back to driving. Day shift management while training was great. Permanent weekend night management were hard to locate when I needed a problem solved. Day shift co-workers helped train me and helped whenever needed. Permanent shift did not.
good,"Target's another great company to work for. Target agrees with promoting from within. Given the skills to learn the qualities of the job, there's really no hard parts of the job."
good,my typical day at work would consist of me getting there around 7am and leaving around 4pm daily. In the time i spent there i would push an restock every item we had for electronics. i would also engage with customers/guest and help with checkout.
good,I loved working at target. it is a great place to start work experience.
good,I personally like Target because it gives the chance to interact with people of the public. its never a dull moment. its always somthing going on. i never get bored because its always something to do.
good,I learned a lot of my customer service skills from working here.
good,"A typical retail job. Learned alot about the company. Management was fun to work with, Co-workers were great. No hard part except for the customers."
good,"Good experience, I liked working with people. You get to know different people every days. My most enjoyable moment was Christmas time."
good,Helping customers with sales and returns. Developing photos and providing digital media options.
good,"Work in backroom, put things onto the shevles from the pallets.. Put things in properly place and scan them. Cleaning and keep the backroom clean and organize.."
good,"A typical day of work consisted of helping customers (guests) find items that they needed, making the area you were assigned look presentable. Learned a lot about the daily operations of a large retail chain."
good,"Every department as it's set jobs that you do during the day. once you learn those jobs, your job is quite easy. Management and guest are what make if you have a good or bad day."
good,"Duties included cashiering, stocking, product organization, and customer service."
good,"Target is a great company to build your ""Big Box"" retail management experience with. They teach you skills that can and will help you with large retail companies and/or your own business decisions."
good,"Management/ co-workers are friendly and approachable. Not a good place to work if trying to maintain a lot outside of work. Not really tolerant around other work schedules and school, have to shift work availability in accordance."
good,I stated as a labourer but picked things up very quick and learnt alot of damproofing techniques.
good,"A typical day at work is never the same but the team members and the relationships you build make the time fly by. In today's ever changing economy the payroll and bottom line are always moving, but the level of work and service expected of each person grows slightly larger. Over the course of 4 years I learned to adapt and adjust on the fly, if a situation changes you reevaluate the resources you have and redeploy them to maximize productivity. If you stay ahead the bumps in the day won’t ripple out to the entire team. On a daily basis I would manage a team of 20 to 45 (weekends and during the 4th quarter) team members, fix any technical difficulty, maintain team supplies, handle all guest concerns or complaints, direct guest flow, answer phones, enforce all store and company policies. Coach and write up team member infractions, motivated, and attempt to resolve any team member concerns. Handle daily safe count, drawer totals, and money ordering and paycheck distribution."
good,ringing up guests
good,This was a seasonal position. Everyday I would take down old displays and replace them with new ones. I learned how to manage my time well because keeping up with breaks are mandatory with Target. I had several coworkers that I worked with and most of them were students who were working to support them self while in school. The hardest part of the job was the heavy lifting I had to do. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to see new product that come in.
good,It's a great company to work for though they focus in outside hires for their management positions. Retail job might be tough during holiday times but it all gets easier after that.
good,"I came into work got on a register started checking out customers, if it wasn't busy I would do restock. I learned how to deal with customers better. The management wasn't all that good."
good,"This is a fast fun and friendly corporate store. Its a hard working sales floor job. You have to multitask, work under pressure and do customer service. Back up cashiering, back stock, returns, etc."
good,"A typical day at Target is an 8 hour shift that includes partnerships with the various departments of the store and local law enforcement, coupled with varying degrees of online training and conference calls."
good,provided excellent customer service. I learned how to use a register. The most enjoyable part of the day was knowing that the customers were satisfied.
good,ienjoyed stocking the merchandise and enjoyed working with the people there.
good,"worked with the public, consulted with other health professionals."
good,"Sales floor offers more independence, especially hardlines which includes: domestics, stationary, seasonal, plastics, sporting goods, health and beauty, and housewares.Each day offers a new challenge to see what can be improved since my last shift. Management strives to work with each team member as much as possible."
good,"on a usual say our busiest time is during the lunch hr/dinner hr. at times ikt will be a slow day and at time it will get really busy. ive learned a lot since ive worked there ive learned different positions such as being on the sales floor, answering phones clear guess services endimes. management for the most part is pretty good, co-workers some i can get along with some you cant. the hardest part of the job, to ,e is to keep up with cart when you are working by yourself with lil to no help. the most enjoyable part is at the end of the day, you know you have done your job."
good,This job was decent but very repetitive and people were rude.
good,Over all I enjoyed working for Target. They could be a little more considerate of employee's who have been working there over some time seems like the cut the hour of the older employees and give them to the newer ones.
good,It was a fun place to work and my co-workers were easy to get along with. The reason for me leaving was moving to Florida.
good,You clock and go to your assigned department. You help guest when you see them and go up for back up cashier when needed. I learned how to work as team and how to do retail sales and a little backroom detailing. The hardest part of the job would be to tell some of the guest that you don't have certain items in store that they saw online. Just be prescient and don't become rude.
good,Great team environment and the ability to cross train in other areas of the store.
good,A typical day at work begins by the sales floor team including myself recognizing each other for previous accomplishments we have witnessed each other do in the work place. We are then instructed by the management team to our assigned areas and given a set of tasks to complete before the store closes. Through out my shift I provide great customer service to guests at the store. I have good coworkers that know what needs to be done and I have made many friends. The hardest part of the job would be learning to multitasks several priorities without letting one or the other from interfering with one another. The most enjoyable part of the job is whenever a guest remembers you from their previous visits and thanks you again for the great customer service.
good,Each day as a barista I prepare beverages for the guests that come to Target. I have learned how to make and modify all the drinks available on the Starbucks menu and create new options not found on the menu. I enjoy the ability to brighten someones day by providing them with a tastey beverage in a timely manner. I have met some unique individuals that have broaden my ability to provide excellent customer service to every person that comes up to the counter. My co-workers and I are a team and offer support to one another when needed. The hardest part of the day is not having the ability to serve guests after we are closed.
good,"I enjoyed working at Target. The store is always busy, and you get to know the customers who shop there regularly. Fun place to work."
good,I loved being a cashier. Not necessarily for Target but for any place. I love cashiering. Target was really nice in that they trained me and gave me the opportunity. I had a big problem with the training though because they didn't tell you everything you needed to know. There was a lot i didn't know how to do that they expected me to know.They also treated me like the underdog because i was new. It was a wonderful experience though.
good,The job it self was refreshing but the employees were there simply for the paycheck and did not show much enthusiasm in working there and the management seem to 'play favorites'. As a whole the company and its regulations were practical but did not have an expierenced hiring manager.
good,"As an executive they pay pretty well. But as most executives for retails companies, there is little work life balance. Great benefit packet. For hourly workers there's a lot of incentives and protection for hourly employees."
good,began day making sure merchandise was stocked and sale signs were up and accurate.
good,"It's very monotonous after 4 years. It's a very fun place to work, but it's because of the people I work with, not the job I do."
good,Working at Target was really great. I enjoyed the work I had to do and also the people I worked with were fun and easy to get along with.
good,"location closed, very difficult to be heard if your weren't in management"
good,"I loved photographing families especially children, it was fun to capture their moments."
good,I was a cashier then i was moved to guest servive. I loved it there. I would take returns and take payments. At the end of the night i would close the guest service department.
good,"Upon opening the store, my peers and leaders will walk the building for opportunities that need to be address in a timely manor. As our team come in, I will delegate task accordingly. I've learned a lot about working on a team and accountability. My co-workers were all hands on and offer suggestions each day. The hardest part of the job was leaving, as there were so much that can be done daily, but through collaboration and team work my peers lend a helping hand. The most enjoyable part was working as a team. Everyone had a positive attitude which lead us to drive profitable sales."
good,"Worked there over the summer in one of their department stores. Honestly, the managers on the floor seem to do and order us to do tasks just for the sake of doing them. No contemplation in matters ever happened."
good,Day was filled with helping customers and learning new things about home improvement products. The management was very excited about coming to work and expressing the goals every morning and acheiving those goals. The hardest part of my job was cleaning the parking lot of excess debris and carts because of constant customers and theft.
good,"Target is a place where you can work while attending college or working a second job. There's no way to guarantee forty hours a week unless you're in a unique position or hold position as middle or upper management. A typical day at work, depending on your position, involves plentiful guest service and conversation. Helping people find the items they're looking for is 50% of most sales floor positions. Management is many, as each supervisor has their respective areas to manage, but may close the entire store themselves depending on shifts. My co-workers are similar to me and my viewpoints about Target. Most people my age who work at Target don't, or didn't, expect to be working there after a certain number of years. The hardest part of the job is the constant shift changes from week to week. Few employees are guaranteed a permanent schedule each week, and so the hours are up and down. Also, being part-time, hours have to be cut and moved around to satisfy the monthly man-hours allotted to the store. Sometimes weekly hours can go from 35-40 to under 20 on a whim. The most enjoyable part of my job is the independence. I mostly work in the stockroom by myself, as well as many different positions. I ""mix it up"" regularly."
good,It was a nice place to work. Employees were friendly and helpful. Management was nice.
good,"It pays the bills, and the people are friendly. we need more people working at this job cause everyone is leaving for school."
good,"A great place to work if you know the right people. There is plenty of room for advancement, but it is absolutely essential to surround yourself with great people and hold each other accountable."
good,My experience working at Target has been good ... The Target family is very welcoming and understanding ... Some of the LOD's as we call them (managers) could be more active with team members !
good,This was my first solid job and I was very appreciative for the opportunity. Everyone at Target is friendly and willing to help other employees as well as customers. It is a clean fun working environment. In my position it was very fast paced but there was always good team work.
good,Great company to work for. Gained alot of valuable experience and was able to manage employees right out of college.
good,"steady job, no growth without a degree, no concept of continuous improvement and not used to a production environment in the warehouse biz."
good,Working in Myrtle Beach is always a plus meeting and greeting people as a cashier was an even greater plus to my day. Target was always a supportive friendly place to work.
good,"My typical day involves continuous communication with our patients, doctors, nurses, my co-workers and Pharmacist. I help facilitate the distribution of medications to patients in a timely and accurate manner. My job allows me to work on a very productive and positive team. The most difficult part of my job is having to tell someone that their medication is really expensive when I know they can not afford it, also whenever we have a patient pass away. The most enjoyable part of my job is that it allows me to help someone every day."
good,"A typical day in the warehouse at Target usually started before the sun came up and once clocked in was non-stop action. This is the type of environment I prefer to work in; always moving, fast pace, keep you on your toes and have to be ready for anything."
good,A typical day at Target was actually pretty easy all my coworkers were very friendly an helpful. Everyone always works together to get the job done. Management is really involved in every department of the store they also communicate with all employees throughout all the shifts. I enjoyed helping customers an other employees and staying busy.
good,Target is a good corporation to work for.The associates and managers are very helpful. They are flexible with the work schedules.
good,Target is a good company with a good structure. However the place is a dead end location for those with no desire to move up into the management ranks. People can work a department for 10-20 years without advancement.
good,"Gained valuable experience straight out of college, but its definitely a who-you-know game to get promoted."
good,good place to work which enforces team work. Learned a variety of skills which help improved my professional skills.
good,Stable place to work at.
good,"Target is a great workplace for anyone. Very understanding and helpful managers and employees. Work hours are crazy sometime 2am and 4am and very hard cause I have a 1yr old, but they can work around my schedule."
good,Over sought day-to-day operations managerial routines that contributed to shortage on other work centers.
good,unloaded boxes from truck and stocked shelves in the store. I learned how to stock shevles properly. the hardest part of the job was was waking up at 3am for work. the most enjoyable part was the discounts
good,"Flexible, good attitudes and the employees there take pride in thier work."
good,"Fun workplace, really nice employees. Not much opportunity for advancement or raises."
good,All I did was fold clothes all day with an occasional cash register helping. The employees were great to work with and the management was too.
good,A typical day consists of multiple tasks that all need to be completed by the end of the day. one must be able to prioritize and delegate task to the team. Peers and team members are very capable of work but need to be inspired at times.
good,"I learned the merchandising and buying functions from one of the best in the business. These skills were vendor mangement, negotiations, pricing, product selection, and team building. These skills are transferable to any marketing or merchandising job."
good,"Target treats their employees very well. Fast environment, teamwork, and organized."
good,"was a good place to work, acquired much knowledge and new experiences. Every day performing different tasks."
good,"I enjoyed my time here! Everyone is very friendly and encouraging. I learned to build every work skill i have here. Learning quickly has become easier, having cashier experience is relevant in almost every job, and having retail experience is great! The hardest part of the job was adjusting to everyone's positive and complimentary attitudes. Most enjoyable, the friends i have made and memories I will carry."
good,it a nice place to wrk the people they are fast fun and friendly met a few good friends there
good,"Planning and executing the new planograms in the store. I have learned how to manage a team of people from 3-50 people at a time. I have also learned how to plan and execute, while maintaining a fun work environment."
good,clean environment. A good place to work
good,"I would primarily assist guest with returns and/or exchanges, and would at times work on the floor assisting guest with buying decisions. I learned that the person who ask the most questions is the one who is in charge of the conversation. I also learned that people are not naturally mean, they just need to be understood."
good,This position was as a cashier for Target. The hours were hard to balance a family life with because when you work retail you have to be available for the customers in the evenings and on weekends.
good,"Running the entire store operations, addressing our guests and team member needs, phone calls and solving problems."
good,"i have been there for 6 years, and had been promoted to a position that ended up being discontinued a year later. since then, i have been passed up for countless other promotions."
good,"Good place to work for, great managment. and leadership great pay rate good place to learn and archieve your managment ideas and promises."
good,"My shift was early morning hours, from 4 am until-. If you're into those hours the shift is great. It's a lot of physical labor, but you are with a team and they help you when they can but you must be able to work independently. If you do not know how to work with haste, or with haste as well as accuracy, you will definitely learn this working stock. If I dreaded going into work so early, I got over it as soon as I got to work and got around my co-workers. I also had a good supervisor who was fun, encouraging, yet firm & strict about emphasizing haste & accuracy ;) All around great experience!"
good,"I did not work here for very long. As i stated earlier, it was a seasonal position. But the brief time i was there, it was a very enjoyable place to work."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the customers happy.
good,My typical day at Target starts with my manager giving a list of tasks to complete before the end of my shift. The most enjoyable part of my job was assisting customers with any questions or concerns involving the store and assisting customers with any heavy or bulky items. My co-workers always came to me if they had any questions while dealing with a customer or anything work related.
good,checking out costumers and maintaining a clean work area. Great people and laid back work place.
good,My typical day at work would be that I had to watch over 10 to 15 cashiers and handle all the front end problems with guest. I would also be in charge of handling the money....
good,My started night off by off-loading trucks/ stocking at Target. I've learned how to operate handheld scanners. Management made sure the requirements were meet. Co-workers worked very hard. There were difficult tasks but nothing i cant handle. The most enjoyable part of the job is greeting customers.
good,A typical day at work included assisting guests with their needs and maintaining product on the sales floor. This position taught me the meaning of customer service and what it takes maintain a strong reputation. Management and co-workers were very professional and followed a strict protocol. The hardest part of the job was trying to please every guest but the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting customer expectations.
good,"It can be stressful, but its your average corporation. They have great benefits, but if you are under a hard manager, prepare for stress."
good,"The general staff and work was good. Kept me busy and productive. Overall, a great place to work."
good,"Was part of truck unload process and stocking process. Worked mostly in electronic, infants and grocery. Afterwards worked in the backroom cleaning and organizing. Also was working with price change and date checking. Enjoyed working at a fast pace and with other coworkers."
good,"I learned to work independently while being responsible for different departments. I realized my knowledge and responsibility when I would be assigned assistants new / old to train and direct during a daily routine. I can work under a tight time-schedule. The importance in preparing the store for business and how much goes into the process. Guests complimenting us personally or to store managers of the overall appearance, stock and shopping convenience gave me great pride knowing I was part of making that possible."
good,"A typical day at work was long, but enjoyable because of my fellow staff members. I learned how properly assist customers as well as manage store revenue (re-shelving, remodeling, logging). Management was just as personable and helpful as my co-workers. The hardest part of the job fell in a tie with late night store-closing and moving shelves for remodel, but neither were all that difficult. The most enjoyable part was interactions with my co-workers."
good,It was a great place to work with great people.
good,Target was a great job for me. The company had great benefits and lots of great people.
good,Really focused on development and building leaders. They have great mentor program that really there to help you adjust to the company culture.
good,You are asked to accomplish a ton of task with a few people. You are told your job is to manage and not do physicall work yet are not given the resources to do all the jobs.
good,"Great work environment. Friendly, eager to help staff. Learned stocking, loading and unloading. Management had great training techniques. The hardest part of my job was actually getting there because at the time I did not have a primary means of transportation. The best part of working at Target was the staff. They were always friendly and willing to help with whatever I needed."
good,"Daily, I greeted customers and quickly and accurately filled their drink orders. I also completed clean up duties along with checking out customers. I worked under a good management team that was very willing to work with my schedule. This company encouraged growing knowledge of the products and to be creative. The more difficult part of this job was being quick and efficient during the rush hour crowd. I found that if you wear a great smile and have a great attitude it makes the work place more enjoyable."
good,"Good Company to work for but has a big issue with turn over. I like working there, however, without a HR person it can make things a little tricky when it comes to scheduling."
good,Great place to work if you love retail. Staff is friendly. Great learning and training environment. Good benefits.
good,"I've been apart of the Target Family since 2007. I started iff as a seasonal worker, and later became permanent. I started off as a cashier, and worked my way up to a GSA. I would say the enjoyable part of my day is being able to help the guest with whatever problem they may have, and hearing them acknowlege with a warm Thnak you, and smile."
good,I got tables ready for new clothes. Pulled new items from the back room and organized them on the tables. I also went around to all the tables everyday to make sure all items were neatly folded and placed in right place.
good,Working at Target was a good experience. I learned alot more about teamwork in addition to my prior experience. There's alot of standing and lifting but the compensation is definitely worth it.. I enjoyed working there I'm just looking for something better.
good,* Learned alot of leadership skills
good,learned how each item has it own location. mangement always had fun iwill the job. always had someone there when u had a team lift or needed some help finishing your areas
good,"Good work place, everybody works as a team, management always on the floor. I've learned from working there that you have to look out for yourself and focus on your own work. I learned to meet deadlines and get my projects done in a timely matter."
good,"Though the job could at times be hectic, the workers were still a team and management were part of it as well. i enjoyed my co workers as well as the customers."
good,"I was a cart attendant, so my job was to keep the store filled with shopping carts. And helping customers with ""carry-outs"" to the car. Sometimes I would help stock or on cashier."
good,"Hourly team members get treated well with good work/life balance. ETL's also have good work/life balance and have a good schedule. However, STL's are mistreated by DTL's and and are over worked and not appreciated."
good,The company allows growth in a short period of time as long as your a great worker but they still start off at minimum wage
good,"The hardest part of the job is making sure that all the other team leads know what is going on in your area, and communicating what needs to be done, and getting people to do it. I have had issues that need addressed from the corporate offices, and to save money they hand down ""fixes"" that only put a bandaid on the problem instead of fixing it the correct way the first time."
good,"Okay job but not enough hours, managers play favoritism, no real room for advancement, and cross training is a joke (they tell you they will cross train to get you more hours but they don't follow though)"
good,"This has been a very rewarding position where I have leveraged my management skills to achieve success in payroll playing, allocations, and running a $50 million dollar retail store."
good,"costumer service, meeting and working with new people, i also assemble bikes for the company"
good,"Work hard, usually not good enough. Working at the Target in New Jersey was much better than working at the Target in Greenville, North Carolina."
good,Target is a great place to work as long as all of your co-workers and managers keep it that way. You have to have optimum patience and a wonderful attitude to survive the worst customers.
good,"The job is a great thought but not one thought through. Poor management, bad attitudes, co-workers who dont care to do their job. Most enjoyable part were the days off."
good,"A positive atmosphere and kind people, however the pay was not suitable to my needs."
good,"Good place to work for a college student, worked with good people, loved my management. The hardest part of my job was being in that hot sun pushing carts. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers and how I put smiles on there face."
good,"Due to the overnight nature of the work, I dealt with many different personalities. I not only had to understand the many tasks that had to be performed but also make myself incredibly available all night to my staff. this also helped me develop my problem solving skills. Working overnight issues occur and they can not always wait until the morning."
good,"· Ensure that each customer receives outstanding service by providing a friendly environment, which includes greeting and acknowledging every customer, maintaining solid product knowledge and all other aspects of customer service."
good,"I enjoyed working at Target, I enjoyed working as part of a team. My coworkers and my managers were always there for me when I needed them and were always very understanding, The hardest part of my job was dealing with rude customers, but I always made it through the day."
good,I typical day at waork would be busy but yet fun and fast.
good,"A large company with lots of things to learn from, a typical day at work will be putting back items and checking out customers which we call GUEST."
good,Target was always willing to work with my scheduling needs while I was attending school. Everyone was always friendly and it was very easy to get along with everyone. The hardest part of my daily routine was the lack of recognition you get for your hard work.
good,"I work for Target Mobile wich is run by Radioshack, it's checks. a super busy store and you can hit your goal you get fat okay you get decent hours at least 36 a week and if you get"
good,"With this job, I've learned to think on my toes as the saying goes, because there isn't much time to debate an issue. And finding the solution is often rewarding. But the job requires me to move around quickly as we are on a tight time table. A typical day involves the setting up and demerchandizing of 6-10 aisles, whether they are being set in their new place or just being temped for a few days. The only flaw is that there are times when what the schematics says for the Remodal team is not what the construction team's schematic says, which causes problems. But these problems are solved by working around the issue."
good,boring jobs a lot of work to do that has nothin pertaining to the position
good,had fun working with fellow students and earned how to be a better worker.
good,I help guest check out and bag their items. I also assist them in finding the items that they need.
good,"During my time at Target I learned many things. I worked at Target during both high school and college and worked in almost every department of the store. During a typical day I would help any guests in the store that needed assistance, answer guest's calls, make the store look nice, and restock merchandise. Management was a little distant and gave the feeling that they did not really know what goes on in levels below management, however they were still nice and made an effort to connect to all employees. My co-workers were very hard working and made an effort to work as a team. We help everyone out when there is a need for assistance and everyone has a positive attitude. What I enjoyed most was being able to work with people and help answer any questions that they had. The hardest part of the job would have to be dealing with the management. Like I said, they were nice, but they had expectations of certain things that were uncalled for in this environment and they did not really understand all that goes into a typical day for a sales-floor team member."
good,"good to very good in all areas.Work enviornment and conditions were good for a mid level mgr (level 3). Most difficult was multi-tasking emergencies, inspections and routine procedures and paperwork at same time."
good,Great place to work with several oppurtunities. I learned how to deal with many different people. This job was trying at first but is now a good experience to have
good,"Started working for Target, it was great at first, but as i grew more comfortable with the company i realized that for minority individuals such as myself i felt there was no real room for career advancement. I was stuck in the backroom and whenever i requested to be cross trained in multiple departments i was denied due to my ""tattooed appearance""."
good,"My typical day at work included arriving, clocking in, clean work station, check out customers, and clock out. As this was my first job I learned that customers want what they want. I enjoyed everything about the job and disliked nothing."
good,"I loved the people I worked with and felt that I was well trained for my area, but I was always assigned to another area I wasn't trained for and was told to just do it. In the end I was let go as a seasonal position because I was unable to pick up on the way things worked."
good,"Target is a fabulous place to learn and grow as a professional. The company is dynamic, filled with entergetic and intelligent people working to make Target your number one shopping destination."
good,Target was a great experience. I held many leadership positions and had an overall wonderful experience working there.
good,"At first, I wasn't too thrilled, working at a major retailer for minimum wage, but it changed after I got attached to people. I enjoy working at Target, pay should be a little higher for what we in Customer Service have to go through, but at the end of the day, it's just all laughs. We all care about each other, and look out for one another. I love my job, but I wouldn't do it forever."
good,We would punch in to work at time clock then get equipment then start in backroom 1 then work are way 2 others as we branch off to different warehouses then some would stock and some would backstock. i learned a lot from target and my management team and one day i hope i can have a store of my own. their was never really something hard about job cause my team or co-workers always keep up with me and others. the most enjoyable about the job was getting rcognize and gettin paid so i can support myself and my 2 kids.
good,"Had an opporuity to work under a mmanager team.Saw that it was servant, they were fast , fun , and friendly."
good,"I stocked shelves, helped guests throughout the store, made the shelves look nice, and helped cashier up front if needed."
good,"Met alot of different people, many challenges, many curveballs and alot opportunities with employees to solve."
good,I liked target very much they just wouldnt be able to secure me enough hours to raise 3 kids.
good,"working at target is very enjoyable,everyone is really friendly and helps whenever i need help. Managers are really open when needed to talk to and helpful."
good,Gave me experience in learning how to work in a fast paced environment and learning that the customer is always right.
good,I worked overnight stocking and organizing the product. I learned about how the items arrive in the stock and how every thing. The managment treated us pretty fair an also fed us on our breaks. My co-workers helped everyone who need help .The job wasnt hard the enjoyable thing about the job when everyone was going to work we were heading out starting our day.
good,not the worst job ive had. over all pretty basic. bad for your back and legs-backroom team member
good,"The pay is horrible and there is little room for promotion without a degree. After 8 years I was already at the highest I could be in the company. Now that I have my degree, there could be more opportunities but I would not want to be store manager and work the crazy endless hours."
good,"First thing i would do when clocking in would be to unload the truck after it arrived. We would pallet the merchandise according to the numbers on the box's. After palleting the merchandise, I would have to stock the aisles with the palleted merchandise. I gained a better understanding of teamwork and working on deadlines. The management was fair and motivational. My coworkers were kind and helpful when it came to something i did not know about. The hardest part of my job came when there was a short deadline with a lot lot merchandise that had to be stocked. The part I enjoyed the most about the job was my coworkers and the the deadlines that needed to be completed."
good,"When you day starts it seems like it would be a boring day, then as you open your lane and guests arrive to make purchases you have the opportunity to meet new people of all walks of life and your day seems to slip away. You are so busy that by the end of your shift it still feels like you just got there."
good,"Target was an amazing place to work even if it can be crazy at times. A typical day was going in, scheduling lunches and breaks, making sure everyone has the right change in their drawers, helping guests with exchanges or refunds, running around the store, and meeting daily quotas. There was a lack of management for a period of time, but it made me learn the roles of an assistant manager which benefited my team. The hardest part of my job is when you get guest that are trying to scam your store and you can't do anything about it. The most enjoyable was the interaction I had with different people everyday."
good,Target is a great company who cares a great deal about its employees. Provides extensive training to make sure you are ready for your role and responsibilities.
good,For a retail environment this company wants their employees to grow. They offer several programs for recent college graduates to gain experience in management. This company is also great because of the health benefits it provides for their employees. The medical coverage is outstanding. I have never worked in another retail environment but the medical coverage is top notch and is probably better than its competitors in the industry.
good,A Typical day at Target will be filled with customers and a busy day no matter what. I learned how to stock shelves and pull items. The managers are there for you also. co-workers are very supportive and hey help you when you need it. the hardest part of the job is to satisfy every customer.
good,I was there seasonal but when i was there it was fun. Management was great they got me up to speed with the job. The co-workers are easy going.
good,"Worked many areas, worked with many people. But I only saw it as a first job and was cut hours."
good,Its a great company to work for if your NOT in the pharmacy. Would have been nice to just have stayed on the salesfloor. The pharmacy is not a great place.
good,"Fun working environment, team oriented atmosphere, benefits, advancement possabilities."
good,Good Place To Work Very Fast Fun And Friendly Was Treated very nice there and recommend to anyone who wants to work there just be independent
good,"love working over night im able to help my husband provide for ae family and still be home for the kids during the day.. by the time i get home the kids are just waking up, and i have enough time to see my husband off to work..."
good,Excellent business and technical chanllenges. It was too good working environment
good,"Used to be a great place to work still had the midwest mentality, not so much anymore."
good,"It was fun to see lot of people throughout the day and learn cash register functions, but I am not satisfied with the outcome of my employment."
good,"Always something to do. There were times in which things would be kind of unorganized, but it quickly got sorted through and back on track."
good,They are a good focused company on what we need to do to better tomorrow. They are focused on helping employees to get involved in the society by doing hands on things as a company. They try to look at the company as a whole to see what they can do to benefit the employees and the company as well. They try to keep reconizing employees and pull out the best of them.
good,Overnight was great because you still have the day to do personal things. People were great to work with also. Hours were good and could usually get a lot of hours in with extra hours needed.
good,"Target is a fun, multidimensional company to work for. There are a number of opportunities within the company to grow and advance in your career."
good,"Working at Target was a good experience for me, it was by far the cleanest Retail store I've worked in. The employees were all friendly and it made for a good work day. It was only seasonal for me though."
good,"I worked as a stocker and the pay was pretty good for how un-demanding the job was, but there are definitely similar jobs out there with better pay."
good,Always something to do. I learned how to do cell phone activations. co workers are pretty chill. Some managers are a lot cooler than others. Work days are pretty straight forward.
good,The work environment is a fast paced environment which some excel at and others do not.  Patience are required and experience with the public helps with that.
good,Leadership is nice and listens to feedback. There's always something new to learn. Employees are nice and get along well. Pay is pretty good. Customers are mostly friendly. A good place to work whether it be a first job or just an extra way to earn money.
good,"I really enjoy working at target, there are some days when I don't want to be there, but overall its a very nice experience. I do recommend applying there if you are in need of a job."
good,unfair management..great team to work with but unappreciated management..they could use some training themselves on how to have a better understanding on workload given in a timely manner by actually doing the labor
good,"I worked for Target for about 2 years, and I enjoyed my time there overall. A typical workday differs a bit from position to position and store to store, but all in-store roles are task-oriented. Between the two different stores I worked at, I found the faster-paced environment of a Super Target in a large city much more rewarding. I learned a lot about task and time management, and how to perform as a group leader during my time there. The slower-paced store I worked at could be a bit more relaxing, but it tended to make shifts drag on."
good,"While the job may seem nice for high schoolers and other entry-level jobs that require no degree, it gets boring real fast. You're going to be doing the same 1-3 tasks for the entire day. Especially for cashiers and other guest service jobs. Seniority runs rampant, as the older you are, the more likely you are going to be picked for a promotion or raise than others. I have worked there for over a year, yet the senior who has worked there for two months has been chosen as a closing manager. Other than that, they offer a lot of quality of life options, such as snacks in the break room, and a break every 2 hours depending on how long you work. But you probably won't be able to talk to your coworkers often. They keep you busy there."
good,"Target is a typical large retail employer. There are many employees and many managers. They have flexible schedules, however they want people for weekends and evenings. As a huge employer they review standards and practices often, which causes rules to change frequently. The hardest part of the job is that your daily responsibilities change and you have to be flexible and go with the work flow. Helping my fellow team members and guest is the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"The benefits were fine but hours were often cut to 20 or below for every week outside the holiday season.  Being forced to be outside for cart collection in winter was a nightmare.  Co-workers were nice and managers were okay.  Overall an okay place to work if you are in High School, College, or just want something part time"
good,"Working at Target made me grow more as a person and employee. I learned how to work in a fast paced environment, and got to be in charge  of my own section to maintain and stock effectively."
good,Working at target broaden my horizon for the short amount of time I worked there . Taught me thing that will become useful when I apply to other jobs that require certain things I was able to learn at target
good,I enjoyed this job very much but there was an incident at work where I no longer felt comfortable once spoken with one of the managers the problem was ignored and they did nothing about it .
good,"Good place to work  friendly  supervisor and good coworkers, good pay, but not enough hours to pay  my bills and support myself and family,  good experience"
good,"The pay is not commensurate with the work and demand placed on you, but the culture is inclusive, and there is a sense of safety and of belonging.  If the compensation was on par with the reality of the costs of living, I would rate the experience better."
good,"Just being able"
good,"It was a Good seasonal job. And kept me busy. Coworkers were friendly and helpful. "
good,I like it because it’s easy to commute to. Everyone for the most part is easy to get along with. They work in fast pace environment. There is a Starbucks in the store so at least if you work in the morning you got an energy drink.
good,"The environment doesn't exactly feel like work its more of a comfortable environment. The work load is pretty easy, it only gets difficult around huge holiday seasons."
good,"I have worked in retail for my entire job career. I have always found a way to enjoy the work I do and the enjoy the people I work with. Lately, it seems like the managers are more focused on the customers and the work to be done rather than the employees that are there to do the job. I enjoy the work I do and I enjoy the team members I work with but I do not feel appreciated by the management team at Target."
good,"Overnights are not great, and they know it. Target at least pays better for overnights. Some flexibility and an employee discount that is the same offered to customers."
good,"Scheduling 3 employees to unload the biggest truck before Christmas and expecting it to be complete in a timely manner. Always helping when they can, and every superviser and manager telling the employees what they want done even if they all have different tasks they want done by the end of the day."
good,I love target im good at what I do I really need this it’s getting hard out here I wanna be responsible n support my family n myself I wanna be free n wanna feel free help out I’m sure u won’t regret it !!
good,If your looking for a first job its great place to gain some experience for the workforce. You will have to move on from this job quick as their is little room for advancement.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is floor planning all the new merchandise we get every month or so. Dealing with guests wasn't the worst part because they just come and go, there's no running from them."
good,working at target is a good opportunity because as a first job it does offer a lot for those who lack experience or in need of a summer or a first job you can also try for different positions to fulfil your desire.
good,Overall Target is a great place to work with decent benefits and pay.  Transportation Command Center is a good starting place for a career in logistics but there is not a clear path of advancement.  You will need to be proactive about where you want to take your career if you want to advance beyond this role.
good,"I learned now to interact with people; coworkers and guests, in the best and efficient way possible. The managers are always proactive in keeping things going the way it should be to help the guest and the worksite."
good,Target is a good place to work. It is a friendly workplace where mamagement looks for team improvement. Good work is rewarded. Benefits are ok. Pay rate is good.
good,"Working at Target and one person's specific Target experience entirely depended on the location. For my specific location, we had a great environment, culture, and atmosphere."
good,"Working at target has taught me how to manage my money and how to treat customers, along with the employees. The best part about working at target was the overnight shifts. I enjoyed having the whole day to sleep and the whole night to work."
good,Overall Target is a good first job to have. It has decent pay and the work load is not very complicated. It is easy to catch on. Only downside is there are not many benefits to working there.
good,"Great place to work at. Amazing company to work for. But, at my store their managers need to learn we are people to with feelings and normal people lives. They treated us like lab rats, and their personal maids."
good,"Catering, Customer service, & teamwork at Target is a goal every day and is always achieved. The pay is good and cashiers are friendly, it’s a good place to be"
good,Decent work place the people are friendly  but the manager are not understanding an don’t try to help people in case of a emergency but the workers were very cool
good,"Working at target there’s so many task and things you must get done before shift end you are tracked on everything and your assigned to task that have to be completed , it’s a real important job. You have to always be on your A game because if you mess up on certain things, your not only affecting yourself. The most hardest part of the job is “opu” your timed to pick for guest pickups having to deal with helping guest along the way and not being able to find certain items ."
good,I would say that targets greatest strengths is its flexibility and its willingness to change with the need of the times.  I have never had any scheduling issues with them.
good,Too many leaders not on the same page giving different direction to one employee. Feels a lot like some employees are expected to do more while others on the same team are not.
good,"No need in sugar coating things: I really, truly, enjoy this job. I have built incredible relationships with many people, every need I had that I would give them would be handled with compassion, care, and an immediateness that made me feel valued. The pay is nice, naturally,but it more over it is the happiest jobs I have had."
good,It was a huge change if pace from the last place i worked the hours where not as cruel and it was a way friendly place to work. I was a seasonal worker i wanred to be full time but my hours were cut need a better paying job
good,"Long hours, great pay but the customers are terrible. The customers are probably the worst part of the job. It is imperative the applicant have a great attitude and stay positive."
good,A normal day would be working on freight and merchandising. Most of the time you work by yourself and management got frustrated if you can't work at a fast pace.
good,"Lead team to accurately pick, prepare and pack online orders on time for shipment. Achieve fulfillment goals and establish clear priorities for the fulfillment team based on key metrics. Assess daily schedules, including breaks, to ensure schedules match workload and productivity goals. Understand Order Pickup and Fulfillment systems and end of day procedures. Improved quality processes for increased efficiency and effectiveness. Identified and resolved process issues to encourage smoother procedures, more efficient workflow and overall business growth"
good,Learned a lot about retail that i didnt know before i got the job. I worked with a lot of really nice people that i had an enjoyable time working with.
good,"While the job can be stressful, they make it easy for you to have your needs met outside of work. They will work with your scheduling needs as much as possible. They encourage growth both at work and home."
good,"Teamwork at its finest, my team was always very helpful and never left me behind. Managers were so understanding and polite. I really loved working here"
good,Many different shifts available. Fun work environment. Management cares more about how personable you are than how good your work is. Black Friday is actually a great time
good,On a typical day at work I would help guests find the items they need.  I also stocked shelves and set up store displays.  I learned how to deal with stressed guests or confused guests.  I learned patience.  They workplace culture was very good.  The management tried to help you out as much as possible.  They often treated the sales floor to food rewards and we were encouraged to write thank you or encouragement card to fellow team members.  The hardest part of the job was keeping the shelves stocked while still helping out guests.  This was particularly hard during the holiday season.  The most enjoyable part was the satisfaction of helping the guests.
good,The job is strenuous. Packs a lot of work in little time. Pay is good but people are childish. Hard work really pays off. If you beg for hours they usually give them.
good,"Good pay for a part time job. A lot of work but worth it in the end. Great leadership and family culture. Work life balance is so so but, during non peak times it is great. A great place to start, re- start, or to gain experience. Oppurtinity to crosstrain is abundant and a learning envirment is present."
good,"The flexible schedule appeals to me.  I enjoy working in a service position interacting with guests and co-workers.  Supervisors and Managers are quick to help and train as needed.  The atmosphere is nice, bright, clean and organized.  There is always something new and fun to see and opportunities to give people a reason to smile and feel better about their day at Target."
good,"Target is a good environment to work, flexible hours and an open work space with lots of room to switch up your role. This company is very organized and rewarding at times."
good,"Awesome female managers."
good,"hard labor you will work hard.. management  are mostly nice individuals,  every one is respectful & appears to work well together.   You must be a team player when working at target"
good,"Job is pretty well rounded but works you very hard. Always lots to get done, never stop moving. Managers are nice and work with you, guests can be challenging at times but are okay if you keep a positive attitude."
good,Worked with this company for a little over 13 yrs. It was my 1st job. The only drawback is after a while it can wear you out. It is retail. I definitely recommend it.
good,Work life balance is non existent for those who want to exceed and excel within this company.  However compensation is substantial for those who put the work in.
good,If Target would be more consistent with hours it would be ok to work there full time. I’m not very fond of having to work pay check to pay check. I need something more stable
good,I was there almost 10 years and enjoyed 6 years of be4ing there. I trained this girl and she became my manager and as a BULLY. No one would do anything about it. She was mean and hateful to all the cashiers and management knew about it.
good,"My recommendation is for Target to capitalize on experience of the Managers vs hiring College graduates to Manage. "
good,"I make 13hr. Which is really good. Helps keep me a float. Just need to get more hours, but it is difficult with school. Wish target offered doubles. Overall, target is a great company to work for, just push through the two major holidays and you’ll be okay, and do not work in soft lines."
good,Work is Alright but sometime manager can be over reaction or over thinking and they end up make mistake but they will yelling at us for their mistake.   I love my job but I cant do this if they kept yelling at us.
good,Single handily the Co-workers i had were the only reason i stayed for 3 years at my specific store. The job it self isn't to hard and if cross trained in different departments can be kinda fun. When i first started the pay was pretty bad but $14.50 is a decent amount for the job. Life-balance wise its pretty easy going.
good,I had learned through this job personal time management and how to balance the current workload and possible customers that would ask for assistance through the shift.
good,"The company seemed to change over the years that I noticed. I worked at Target in Milford, Ma for 11years so I saw a lot of change. Some change was good and some bad. The employees hours would drop and make it almost impossible to pay bills. During the last 4 years I worked there was the worst with hours. Eventually I was forced to quit when I was only getting 12 hours a week to support my family and ALL the years of service I gave to this company they let me walk out the door!"
good,"Enjoyed working with some great people, got my work and tasks done in a timely fashion. Had to be on my toes for when customers needed assistance and ask as well if they needed anything."
good,"I enjoyed my experience at Target because my stores culture was very healthy. There was not, much room for advancement, but to be honest I wasn't really looking to spend the rest of my life in retail. Good culture, but requires a lot of patient. With the strong customer driven culture, sometimes it can feel like the employees needs are disregarded. Long term job prospects are uncertain due to the changing retail environment of online orders and."
good,"It can be the best starting job but depends on what department you can have alot of fun or deal with alot of drama "
good,Overall a good experience with friendly coworkers and management. Able to work independently with help from management when needed. I would recommend the position although it is without much challenges
good,"The front of the store was kind of miserable. Especially on a check out lane which is where you will be if you are new. It’s stressful, and then boring. I was a closer so I would be busy for a couple of hours and then I would sit there with nothing to do for multiple hours, even after “zoning” my lane and others it was still incredibly boring"
good,The company is very flexible at times when time off is needed. It’s a combination of being overworked as well as underworked. But the team is a great to work with.
good,by far some of the nicest managers i’ve ever met. everyone is super friendly and is always willing to help others who are in need or have any questions.
good,"Create a guest-obsessed culture that prioritizes the guest experience and delivers on store sales goals"
good,It was a fun place to work but very stressful. Since I was under 18 at the time I could only work 4 hour shifts but I think if I was able to work 8 hours it would be much less stress trying to clean up your section of clothing. Being a Cashier was easy though.
good,"Working at Target was a great experience. I enjoyed meeting new people every day. I enjoyed working with my team leaders and managers."
good,"Back when I worked there the pay was way too low for all the work I put in. Some direct managers would definitely recognize hard work, but with raises only coming annually and low hours, it wasnt the best job to sustain me then."
good,Good job...Inconsistant hours are the main draw back..I would recommend Target for second job but as no fulltime for front end entry level employees hourly wage is great but getting hours is difficult.
good,"I worked early morning shift 4:30/am, it was great, nobody on the road driven in. Staff did there jobs, time flew bye, placed items on shelves, until the truck load was empty."
good,Working at target was a decent experience until we opened in canada and it all went downhill. Training was a joy. Learned new things every day and the team culture was fantastic!! My manager was a disaster. Sexist and inappropriate to the max. I think if I had a different manager it would've been better.
good,"Great job, just have to ensure that seasonal workers are well trained because if they mess up the headache will fall on you. So in order to make sure that management is happy make sure that seasonal workers know the job inside and out."
good,"Working for Target was a wonderful experience. My phone skills flourished. My people skills, in general, flourished. They provide advancement opportunities to anyone who was interested."
good,everything you do working at target is very simple. its hard to mess up while working. the only problems are the customers when they're angry or mad otherwise everything goes smoothly.
good,Fast paced and team oriented work environment. I enjoyed their flexibility to work with me and my schedule. It was enlightening to meet so many people and be able to help them or make them smile.
good,Target is flexible with hours to an extent. They are plenty of different jobs to fit what you would like to do. The management is good and well understanding.
good,I stock perishables most of my time working. I get to chat with my fellow coworkers so that nice. The only time where the job isnt as fun is when an LoD has you do something in another department for long periods of time only to see you the next day and wonder why you didnt get your original job completely done.
good,"It was a fun atmosphere, if you wanted to learn a new department or any department they were very willing to train you and it helped to better assist customers."
good,"Target has a flexible schedule to fit your needs if you need a job while going to school, pick up a second income or for a seasonal position. There is room to grow within the company if that is what you're in search of as well!"
good,"Their work schedule was the best part. You worked either three day weekends or four days during the week. It was nice to have three day weekends every weekend.  Management isn’t the best, but they do compensate pretty well."
good,"Easy job, sometimes got extremely busy, semi-organized management, time goes by fast, customers were sometimes difficult to deal with especially regarding coupon/ return policies but a good schedule."
good,Its a great company to work for but there is si much to do that even management can't seem to give you the same instructions. You can get your tasks done but then will be asked why you didn't do this or that. Its because you were told by your team lead to do something else. It's a bit confusing to follow but you get use to it after awhile if you can put up with it.
good,"I really enjoyed working here, excellent training & everyone was really helpful. The hardest thing about working here was multi tasking. A typical day would be processing customers transactions & greeting them & ask how their shopping experience was."
good,"Target is a company that truly values their guests, and they want their team members to value them, too.  The leadership can at times be rough, and there exists a culture in which you are looked down upon if you do not bleed for the company."
good,"They advertise paying significantly higher than minimum wage; however, they will only schedule you about 8 hrs/week and refuse to cross train. Management styles varied drastically and could make/break the positive environment."
good,"Target was a good part-time job. They are flexible, which is great for a high school/ college student. Great atmosphere to work in. Employee discount a plus"
good,I loved working here but the managers tended to play favorites and give the hours to their friends. I left when my hours began dwindling and they finally dropped me to 0 hours so I quit.
good,"Always have something to do and if help needed, whether it is management or other team members, you always receive help.  The most enjoyable part of my job is closing because that's when it becomes more of a team.  everyone is helping each other out and no one is left behind at the end of the night."
good,Nice place to work. I enjoyed my fellow team players. Everyone works well together. The management is friendly and helpful. They give days off you need.
good,Target is a great place for people with all types of job experience and education levels. You become a stronger employee and develop customer service skills. It is a good working environment and there are ways to move up in the company as well. There is a position for almost anyone and the opportunity to cross train and develop with in different departments.
good,"you would start but checking the end caps, the you would start from filling the shells then you would unload the truck by that time if you where done you would check to see if you have any price changes."
good,"Good place to work,It’s just not for me.The time is not consistent.Its a part time job for someone who don’t have major bills.The pay is every two weeks,on Fridays.Depending on your bank you will never get payed earlier  than Thursday."
good,"as with any place, if the people you work for are good, then the experience will be good as well.  Can be a fun place, and benefits are not too bad. Hours can be sporadic during certain times of the year"
good,"Target is a wonderful place to work, although advancement opportunities are not always available. I'd highly recommend working at any Target if you're interested in a positive environment, staying busy and feeling like you're a part of a family."
good,Target is good place for college students to work and to gain experience. The only thing I will say that made it difficult was management and inconsistent hours.
good,Overall Target mobile was a good experience and I learned a lot. Target is a good company and the people for the most part were decent. I think that target employees should be paid higher for the type of work we all do.
good,Most of the workers were friendly and helpful . Some of them I am still friends with.  I would go back if I had to. When I was there some of the managers we friendly
good,"Target is a really solid place to work.  When I started working there I was getting $10/hr (+.50 for having a specialty) and a year later I was making $12 (+.50 for my specialty) because the corporation raised the base wage... that was 2018, and I believe it's even higher now."
good,I worked a seasonal job for Target and was ecstatic with the pay and training I received however about a month in I was being scheduled for nearly double what I asked to be scheduled and when I attempted to talk to schedulers I was brushed off. I did not stay after the end of the season in order to focus on my high school work as I had fallen far behind due to a lack of free time.
good,"Easy place to work, experience and fun-loving staff. Good hours with flexible scheduling. Very lenient managers, allowed me to work at my own pace without pressuring me."
good,"I started working at Target with a happy and healthy optimism towards the job.  It was good until after they got rid of my department.  They didn't communicate with me on what my future of the company would be. When I asked for a change in my job title and schedule, they wouldn't work with me until three weeks later, just for one week, and then it went back to the way it was."
good,"I received a promotion and a pay increase, it took them 4 1/2 months to adjust my pay after getting promoted. It still wasn't correct at that point so i decided to move on"
good,"I honestly loved my time at Target. My coworkers were extremely welcoming and accommodating, and the job itself wasn't very difficult. However, management sometimes expected too much from their employees leaving us overwhelmed and overworked during rush hours and peak seasons. Another thing was that the training was very ""hands on."" As in, they would throw you into the thick of it with no instruction. While it was very aggravating and annoying at first, several team mates were able to help teach me the ropes. The good thing about that is that, while there are several tasks that require more training than is provided by management, they are relatively easy once you get the hang of it. Overall, I had a very enjoyable time with the company and would definitely recommend it to a friend."
good,"Working at Target was good. It was fast paced in Flow, but with good teams, manageable. My only qualms with Target were the managers. In Flow you were judged and immediately had your hours affected by store hour sales. You had no control over this, but were often blamed as a group for poor sales. I worked at the most productive store in my city, but we still never met the sales goal. It was extremely irritating to have our manager take it out on us. "
good,"It is great place and a good experiences. "
good,"I've worked at three different targets. they keep an emphasis on hiring good and friendly people, they have many days where they have rewards for employees (one did monthly cupcakes for birthdays, and they all did things like had ice cream in the break room on national ice cream day, or waffle day, or any of those weird holidays). It's still a retail cooperation so there's gonna be issues, but overall the people care and it's way better than the environment at walmart. If you have to (or want to for some reason) work retail, target is your best bet by a wide margin."
good,"Good place for someone who is just starting out in retail. Overall the company is pretty straightforward in its policies. Somewhat strict dress code. You will learn a variety of skills at this job, including: customer service, merchandising, fixture blocking, signage, etc. Isn't a good fit for those wanting close coworker relationships, as a lot of the work is independent (though there are some collaborative tasks as well)."
good,"The company has high ideals but sometimes struggles to meet them. The pay was good, though I know it has decreased. High stress and high turnover. If you like hard work, don't mind long hours, and understand that this is a job in a corporate world then they are a good company. They expect results and at the end of the day it is what matters to them, despite the sales pitch. Understanding corporate culture this never bothered me, but people were sometimes disillusioned when they hit a rough patch. There are great benefits and opportunities to gain large bonus as a store team leader. They put an emphasis on a friendly work environment and a healthy team culture - which why would you want to work in a different culture. Realistic hours in management are between 60-70 hours per week and more during holdays"
good,It is definitely a pleasure. They treat you like you apart a team. Trainings are easy and the jobs are pretty simple. They definitely need more security.
good,When i was hired it was for seasonal for remodeling. My team worked overnight and everyone was cool. It was a very nice work environment and cuz it was overnight u didnt have to help much customers. Wish I could have stayed there permanently.
good,It is a retail/part time job unless you luck out and are able to be moved up within a certain department. Target works with your schedule if you are able to request off in advance/is not a holiday which is nice. I have learned new HR skills for which I am thankful for.
good,Target is a place where a lot is expected of each team member. The work load is high but the pay and benefits and culture makes up for it. It is an inclusive place that is okay with you being different though; my store has a lot of different backgrounds working together productively.
good,Management at target does need improvement but as long as you have an understanding for what’s going on you’ll be fine. Keep a smile and cheerful attitude at all times.
good,"A typical day at work, would start quick and fast paced, depending on the truck size. Hardest part about my job was trying to meet the time limit it would take to get done with a specific time, but the work was great and the people were amazing"
good,I really enjoy working at target. The company is moving in a great direction with their new and improved methods of logistics. I reccomend this job to anyone needing a challenging job.
good,The customers were very friendly and I enjoyed the discount. The management had a lot of favoritism and expected you to pick up their slack after they’ve been doing nothing.
good,In the beginning hours were always around 32. Now most won't have more than 20. 32 hours is required for medical coverage was no longer covered last 2 yrs. Only individuals with coverage and hrs is management. Management used to give holidays and personal time without argument. Now you have to have good reason to apply for any time off. Managers don't really talk to each other anymore. Confusion and anger  toward employee for no reason. Other than lack of communication between management.
good,"I don't remember my dreams. hydrogen, helium, lithium, boron, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, neon, sodium, magnesium, gold, iron. that's all I actually remember of the periodic table."
good,"Fast paced environment with room to expand. Solid culture and surrounding people to keep an upbeat, positive attitude. Decent pay for the work. 3.5/5 stars."
good,"The team members are very friendly, and it is definitely a no judgement zone, everyone is free to be who they are. I actually love going to work everyday, the only 2 things that could be better are"
good,"During the holiday season they gave me plenty of hours but by the time christmas was over my hours were almost completely cut. I only worked a few times a week and they hired me part-time but not as a seasonal worker. The manager that hired me seemed to not have liked me, which is fine but this started to effect our professional relationship. She handled situations poorly and let personal opinions effect professional decisions. I had no problems with any of the other managers they often would compliment my work and we had a great professional relationship."
good,I learned many skills and performed many job details in my time at Target. I was cross trained in many departments. Worked with many amazing people. However due to personal family issues I had to quit my position.
good,Fun and friendly environment.  Willing to work with schedules. Friendly staff. Quick learning. Great training. Good break schedules. Great hours given when asked for.
good,"It is a good place to work, pay-wise, but hours are very limited as well as they vary week to week. You are not able to get a set schedule so it is hard to work a second job as well."
good,"This job was one that could be described as both fun and slightly stressful at times. Most days there are a multitude of tasks to complete before the end of a shift, you are left to decide for yourself how to manage your time and complete everything in a a timely manner, while also making sure that you are keeping the company's standards in mind."
good,Long shifts hot temperatures the management is okay but other than that trash I worked 4-2am I’d rather have morning shiftt but you gotta be lucky. -t588
good,"Depending on the season and time of year, hours tend to fluctuate. Busy seasons, such as Christmas, Easter and Back to School tend to provide plenty of hours. You are required to work weekends and holidays. I found it difficult to make ends meet on a schedule that kept changing from one week to the next. I was not pleased having to work on Sundays. That has always been family time for me and it was difficult to get the day off"
good,"I worked as a cashier and also in the cafe. I was trained to do the work of a cafe manager and would have been happy to take that job, but they trained me to do the work, I did the work, and never advanced to the management job. I enjoyed cashiering. I liked the people I worked with but there was a lot of favoritism and I am not super political."
good,Even though my position was temporary/seasonal I wish I would've gotten paid the correct amount for the amount of hours us seasonal workers put in. Overall the people were great but the pay was horrible.
good,"This is a long review, I knew going in that it was just a job for the summer before I head off to college. I applied to be in produce but they scheduled me in the bakery until I was done with school for the summer. It was stressful at first because my training was bare minimum. I basically had to learn how to close and I got one training shift and then they toss you in by yourself. It was hard and there were times when I was talked to because I did a poor job, but then I got the hang of it. "
good,"This position required you to review shopping orders placed on the company website. Most of your day was spent focused on your work so collaboration was limited, but co-workers and management were pleasant.  It was a mostly relaxing atmosphere."
good,Target is a wonderful business that typically has its employees best interest at heart. Workplace culture was wonderful and taught me a lot about customer service and got me use to working retail.
good,"Target is an amazing company to work for, however upper management can be bias to there ""friends"". Many STLs and ETLs are bosses not leaders which effects the moral of the store."
good,"Nice place to work but hours are not consistent. The managers seem to come and go like a revolving door. Lots of great people though. Lots of satisfaction when you help the guests, especially the older ones."
good,"It was cool working in Target. The position of Electronics just wasn't a fit for me. If I could stay as a cashier in Target and have more hours doing so, I wouldn't mind at all but I can only work so much and there are a lot of team members in the job market already."
good,Pulling stock from the backroom.  Working the stock to the floor and arranging the stock for optimum presentation.  Restocking any remaining stock.  Keeping assigned areas clean and in order.  Cashiering when needed.  Management personnel and styles vary from day to day dependent on scheduling.
good,"Depending on the location you can receive good or very little training. You have multiple bosses, which is confusing. Hours fluctuate regularly for flow team, from 12-38 per week. The company has good ideals and some good benefits like maternity leave and 401k."
good,"As a sales associate at Target, there are usually plenty of shifts to cover and it can be flexible for your schedule. The management, the team leaders, were always changing, however they were competent and kind. This is a straightforward retail job with a lot of time standing and interacting with others."
good,"The job as a cashier isn’t hard; follow instructions, call managers over when needed, and clock out on time. Nothing special, nothing majorly bad. Just would not consider it a full-time job for people with different life goals."
good,This was just a job to pay my student loan.  It was OK but would rather be in a more urban environment.  The people were nice but would have been helpful to have some sort of a back support when lifting heavy objects.
good,Every retail outlet is the same. Continue to push your workers to the breaking point. Eliminate non-productive people. Force more work that is humanly possible onto your workers and then add more and complain when they don't finish on time.
good,I learned to interact with people and how to give great customer service. Make sure that the guest left happy at the end of there trip and made them feel welcomed.
good,"I worked at corp. for 23 years. Retired. Highly recommend Target to work for. I do not know how it is working at a store as I was at corp. Benefits are good, flexible work, work remotely when needed."
good,"It was a great place to be employed by, and my coworkers was very helpful, I learn to work fast when the items came on the conveyor belt and load it onto boxes"
good,"The only issue I had was the way the team leas spoke to people. I'm excited to reapply now that I have resolved my personal matter, and relocated to Ohio"
good,warm working conditions.  Tried to keep up with technology.  Management changed a lot.  Nice to help guests.  Worked well with your requests off. Very small location with a lot of freight.
good,I worked the Christmas season and I loved the fast pace. I don’t get stressed out easily so being super busy didn’t bother me. You must push to get customers to sign up for their credit / debit card. You must cash the customer out quickly because the register times you. If you are not in the green management will approach you to see if there’s anything they can do to help you. I was disappointed that they didn’t keep me on after the season was up.
good,"Pay is decent, but the constant influx of new work to do, grouped with lack of proper training and the never ending pressure to do everything required of you in small time frames make it hard to want to go to work each day. If you don't care about the order and flow of the job and only want the money, this is a completely fine job to have. But if you're passionate about keeping the place working smoothly, it becomes very stressful. Managers pressure you to push new products, make the aisles organized, and focus on helping guests above all else, all while telling you to go faster. The job can also be physically strenuous and many managers do not consider the workload being exhausting. Despite all of that it is still a very fine place to work and it does pay really nicely."
good,When I first started here I was told I would receive anywhere from twenty to thirty hours a week. I have yet to receive more than twenty one hours a week and the schedules are not steady. I am also switched from morning to evening shifts and back again.
good,"I was seasonal overnight stock, I asked for part time hours but I was always scheduled full time hours and asked to stay later. A lot of work to do with not enough people. The management did a good job connecting with the team but the could have better organized their system so that we could complete more work in the amount of time given. Very fast paced if you have insufficient team of managers it may make the job harder then it has to be."
good,One of the biggest things I have learned working for Target is how to set goals and manage my time. I've learned on how to time myself in a way to challenge myself in order to reach my goals and grow.
good,"Great pay, great benefits, management team is working crazy hours, especially graveyard shift 10PM-9AM+ can’t leave till entire truck is put up and put away while employees can’t work past 6AM/7AM because of a million reasons"
good,I enjoyed working at Target! A very fast paced environment meaning there is always something to do! Room for advancements / growth! Management was great while I was there.
good,"It is a good place to work for a start, but not to make a career of it. The pay isn't that great they are giving all of them a raise now but the funny thing is they are cutting back on their hours. so, they could have left their pay where it was."
good,The shifts were reasonable and the pay was alright. Mainly we focused on making the guests happy and doing everything to help them have the best experience possible.
good,"Target is a great place for students who needs a part time job, so it can allow them time to focus in school as well. You have to weat the same colors everyday so you don't have top worry about what to wear everyday."
good,Good environment for learning growth and recognition. Very maintainable and organized. processed very efficiently and effectively. Would absolutely recommend to others
good,I enjoyed my time here but got tired of cashiering.  Managers were good at working with schedules. Enjoyed working with customers and deflating tense and upset customers
good,"There were no ""mean bosses"" or anything. Everyone's pretty close and they encourage getting to know your fellow team members. Cool place to work while finishing up school."
good,Target was a great experience to gain more experience. Managers were professional and the job was very beneficial. There could have been better scheduling with the team members.
good,I originally got this job because I need to support myself while being a University Student. Working here is great if you just want a part-time position.
good,My main complaint is that you get pretty scarce hours and are expected to do a lot in minimal time.  They don't always account for the many obstacles you face and just assume your workload is always doable.
good,"Within the span of time I worked there, immediately went to working almost 40 hours a week. It was a good opportunity to make money, coworkers were great, and I was shown exactly what to do and how to follow the ropes my first couple weeks."
good,"Great environment with friendly employees, fast-paced, easy to pick up new materials, amazing management, can get a bit overwhelming at times, hours can run a bit low"
good,No matter where you work there are pros and cons.  For me and what I needed it worked I had fun and it was great experience.  I liked my department and I was supported by management.
good,I start off clocking in like anyone else but immediately I had to go to the back room to see what I have to do for the day. They would either tell me to pick some item in the store and ship it out or they would want me to put the item in guest service for order pick up. And that’s pretty much it for what I do in Target.
good,"Good place to work for retail. Friendly place to work in. I used to work as cashier. Handles money and answer any question to customers. Also, Price match ."
good,"I loved working at Target, the fast paced environment , the friendly team, and the Guests were awesome. The hardest part of the job is when new managers move in every 18 months and you have to relearn your job to their expectations. you could go from being excellent in the eyes on one supervisor to hated by the next because their expectations were different. Also when I was there the payroll was always being chopped to give to the overnight teams. According to Target - starbucks was earning 150 hrs of payroll , but we were only given 110 hours weekly which  lead to my being injured by overuse of my hands."
good,Target was a good job. I worked overnight so a lot of unloading product and getting it to the sales floor. Whatever did not fit on the floor I used PDA's to backstock items.
good,The work was decently easy but everyone relied on us too much to do everything. managers would just stand around and do nothing while everyone else is doing all the work.
good,The guests were so friendly. and if you provide good guest services they are very appreciative and willing to give u recommendation. Also easy workloads and team work.
good,Target is a fun job it's fast-paced they're always doing something the people who work there pretty cool they give you good hours to and they're pretty flexible with scheduling
good,You will learn how to effectively lead your team as a manager.  Great training program when you first hire on.  Upper management can be difficult to work with/for.  High expectations at all times.
good,"INCREDIBLE is an understatement of the management. Great supervisors and coworkers, with a fast paced environment helping guests check out, find items, and take returns. Teamwork makes the dream work! Working as a team to help guests have a wonderful shopping experience is a great feeling, although sometimes it can be difficult if a guest is unhappy or upset with a product. "
good,"I worked seasonal. Had me on the register on and off until Black Friday, and then never put me there again, which sucks, because I liked it. I was in General Merchandise, which was the WORST. They will give you four one-tiers of boxes stacked to the ceiling from the morning truck, and expect you to unload it all in two hours. Management was all over the place and kind of difficult to get a hold of (it's a big store), but were nice."
good,"I had great experience, it was a great place to gain some work experience and the schedules provided were perfect for college. I would recommend this experience."
good,"Target, overall, is a good retail environment, and a fun place to work. A typical day usually involves working out freight from the truck or setting sales planners for new products. It's a good place to learn basic retail processes and procedures, but management is often unhelpful in explaining why a particular thing is done the way that it is. It feels like there is little accountability on the part of managers for when things go wrong, and that a lot of the blame gets pushed to the team as a whole."
good,It was decent but was a bad experience because management was messed up an I had to do my Team Leaders Job and keep everything up and running smooth an make sure everything got done an made sure we made most of sales in all makeup and skincare brands when we had meetings (walk throughs) with people over the regions targets and more. Very unorganized and stressful to a 19 year old at the time. But overall Target is a good place to work just that target needed better workers as well as better management.
good,Fun place to work. Can be stressful at times. hours vary. Freedom to work independently. Company paid vacations. Available to work optional shifts. Employee discounts.
good,"Target was a great place to work, and everyone there is extremely friendly and helpful. However, after a while dealing with guests can be a bit exhausting, and managers who don't seem to respect their employees anymore get old quick."
good,"Overall you always had something to do and different tasks to fulfill. Very active, greeting costumers advising giving options. Cashier and customer service ready for back up Incase not enough staff in the cashier area. Always smile and good impressions."
good,It’s a great place to work but things change constantly so you always have to adapt. Ive been working for target for 2 years and they’ve cut hours but hired more people which makes no sense and they’ve started to ask us to go the extra mile by being overly friendly and converse with every single guest you come in contact with or you’ll lose your job. Management isn’t on the same accord so you have to follow different rules when different management is available.
good,It was not a bad job it just became stressful with the remodel. My location was also located in the mall which made it even more a little hectic with the customers being frustrated with the new changes.
good,"It varies for each company, but I got lucky. My boss was great, my supervisor was decent. They can lack in communication, but it's not huge. They're not big on flexibility, so know the role you'll be playing will stick for a good amount of time."
good,"My position included a lot of fast paced work, which could become very stressful at times going across the store multiple times as quick as I could, and I would often be expected to do different job while trying to keep up with fulfillment needs."
good,worked here when i was in college. They will work with schedule but will also request for you to come in if they need extra hands. The people you get to work with are really great but I wouldn't say the same for management. They are stand off ish and will treat you differently since you are under them. Specially the people who have been there longer
good,"Hard part was the inconstancy of the work schedule."
good,It was a nice company to work for. The managers were good and pay was great for a part time job. Cashiering was a good time. Some days could be relaxing and some were stressful.
good,"I worked at target for a minute, ~3 months, and in that time I liked my work save for the fact that the manager was constantly breathing down our necks. She was unprofessionally biased against our department, and unfairly targeted me. I have even spoken to some of my fellow employees about this, and they agree with me, corroborating my tale of woe. So, in summation, work at your own risk."
good,"Working at Target, was a pleasant experience. While there was always lots to do, our team leads would always be on top of whatever was going on. If there was an issue, they would take care of it within minutes. If something was going on, they made sure that everyone was informed and that everyone was working effectively. Management always did a great job and it made the work everyday go both smoothly and quickly."
good,"I started off by unloading the truck early in the morning then stocking the merchandise on the shelves. The hardest part of the job is lifting sometimes heavy boxes. I enjoyed working at Target, it was fun and I learned how to work with different cultures of people."
good,Non stop work must work fast to maintain store appearance as well as keep it organized.  Guest come first so i recommend learning where everything is.  Management has changed several times as well as team leads and associates
good,Target is a solid job that's really what you make of it. Not a great career unless retail is what you love. Things change a lot and not always for the better. There is a resident high turnover rate so you'll always have been employees
good,"If you work hard ,Every one appreciate you and recognize you. You get many advancements . Hours are not so friendly.but you make good hours in busy times."
good,"I worked in the backroom of Target and even though it had it's bad days, I never felt like I couldn't get through it and look forward to another day. So many positive people there and a great emphasis on teamwork."
good,Keeps you on your toes and encouraged to help all guests. The systems are easy to understand and items easy to locate sorted by sections. Encouraged to often takes additional training in multiple areas.
good,"New modernization program "
good,"Only worked part-time at Target, so they would often schedule me several days a week with extremely short shifts. Managers are not very understanding."
good,"Its an alright entry level job. They work to be flexible with you, and try to provide advancement opportunities if you are looking for them. I have a great relationship with a lot of my co-workers."
good,"Worked with the company for over 3 years. Some advancement opportunities, but minimal at best. I was really lucky to work in departments with great co-workers. Some of the Team Leads were amazing."
good,As a Cart Attendant. It was pretty relaxed. Only feet hurt because of my bad shoes at the time. I would recommend it to anyone starting out and they pay well.
good,"Co workers were good, job was okay. Manager made me feel stressed out all the time. Customers were unreasonable at times. I strongly disagree with the saying “the customer is always right”"
good,"Lots of changes most are good.  Online shopping has exploded.  Drive up pick up starting soon.  Less people on the floor with more responsibilities.  One person per department doing it all.  Longer hours for the individual."
good,"Working here isnt bad at all if you're a full time team member. You get insurance if you're full time. If you're part time, not so much but they always make sure to work with your hours and at the very least most of the management is friendly and willing to be kind when it comes to calling off or sick days. I would reccomend working here if you're on a money crunch."
good,Working here was easy as far as the task load goes. It was fast paced making your shift for the day by a little easier. The hardest part was the come and go of angry shoppers who pass a unnecessary comment or two. Also it was hard when shoppers would try to push the sale their way instead us corrections their confusion. Management was wonky if you had a boss around the same age as I did making it a bit awkward should they have to speak to you about anything.
good,"Target was a pretty good place to work as far as retail jobs go. The management was nice, team members were chill, and the company is very accepting of people of all backgrounds. The main downside, which is really the only one, is that it was a retail job. And retail is retail. You'll deal with kind customers but also rude ones and that's just retail life. You'll also question humanity a bit with how inconsiderate certain customers can be, but working at this level you learn to appreciate all the people who also work retail. And I feel like everyone needs to work a job like this (or food service) at least once to get a humble perspective on society."
good,Where do I start. Well the salary is incredible $12.50-$13 an hour. Overtime is always available. Super relaxed company. Very relaxed policy’s on dress and appearance. Free lunch almost all the time. Management is great and easily approachable. Staff is great to work with. Bummed that I was only seasonal. The only thing I hate is it’s almost impossible to get hired or even an interview. Took me four try’s to get in and that’s a long process because you have to wait 60 between applications
good,"Great place to work and gain experience, compensation is highly competitive, if you plan on spending time with family on a regular basis or celebrate holidays with family outside of where you live prepare to make sacrifices and prepare to sacrifice your time as well adjusting to business needs and schedule needs."
good,"very laid-back, to the point and easy to focus tasks, must be well at working with others and customer service, great discounts and benefit options. flexible hours. must be comfortable working on your feet 5-8 hours a day"
good,"Sales floor helping guest with items stocking backroom making sure areas were clean and cashiering when the front end needed help."
good,"The managers pushed a little hard, and sometimes expected unrealistic things. The discount was useful, but does not apply to apple products. If you get along with your coworkers, you will enjoy your job."
good,"My position was seasonal, but doing my time at target I made several friends who I talked to even after the season ended and I was let go. The management was also friendly and willing to chit chat so long as everyone stayed busy."
good,As a Guest Service Team Lead we were put in charge the first and last impressions of every guest that walks into the store. A welcoming and friendly experience was a must and I had to convey that each team member I managed and those that worked with my team. There were times when I would need to step in to defuse a situation and insure the guest left happy and the store wasn't negatively impacted. Those challenges were never the same and always provided a learning experience. The best part of the job was creating a since of competition between teams members and helping individuals set obtainable goals. Over the years I worked there I created a number of lasting relationships that have lasted even after leaving.
good,Target was like working with family.  The team worked together together to get things done.  Structured with specific job requirements. Uses technology to benefit itself.
good,"having to chose work over family time.  Over the years target as changed from having a work life balance, to no longer having one.  I have always loved my job but missing family time is something that can't be sacrificed."
good,"great first job to learn the basics of working and how to interact with customers in a professional and approachable way. while working for a large corporate company came with its own challenges, I do not regret my time there and the experience I gained from my time there."
good,"Most days I was done with the things that they had scheduled for me to do, and for the rest of the night it was just a free for all. Some days were quick paced others were slow and not much to do. Everyone there is great to work with and you definitely make friends really fast."
good,"simple place to get hired and get into the work force. Jobs are simple and easy to learn and are difficult to mess up. other employees are nice and helpful. Management have occasionally been seen not applying store policy by letting guests walk around with typically locked up products or siding with a guest rather than upholding and backing up the team members on store policies and rules because the guest has gotten slightly annoyed or causes a scene."
good,"I learned you need to come out of your comfort zone and really talk with guests and meet their needs and wants. "
good,Good place to work.  Target provides stable work environment.  The environment can be somewhat bureaucratic at times though.  Target does make efforts to listen to their employees and encourages employees in advancing their careers.
good,"Just fine. Not super fun or engaging, but not awful and boring. The funnest part of the job is re-shop; putting things back when customers don’t want them."
good,"If your young it’s a good place to start and work your way up.Discounts was 10% ,meeting new people and enjoyed the work ethic,learned a lot from here,great benefits if you are full time."
good,"While politics are a part of any job, in my experience, if you really apply yourself, Target will offer opportunities for advancement. However, as a new employee, be prepared to work hard consistently, if you don't have the gift of being able to make friends with managers easily."
good,"Overall it was a fun and upbeat place to work. Upper management was good to us, paid us well and took care of us for the most part. Lazy people got the boot, hard workers got promoted - just as it should be."
good,"Working here was okay, the customers were your normal customers.  Some dude, some not.  There were some team members who behaved like high schoolers, but that's everywhere, HR was cool though"
good,"I worked as a sales associate in the clothing department of target. The amount of stress that comes with all of the clothes people return and the amount of time we have to put them away is insane. With low sales currently hours are low which means there is a lot of stuff left unfinished or undone. It is very hard to work in an environment where management can’t see the issue of not enough people, not enough time, too much to do."
good,WORST LEADERSHIP TEAM EVER. Target is a great place to work if you find a location that adheres to the Target policies and procedures. This location needs to replace all the salary leaders.
good,Target is a nice place to work for awhile but after some times it starts to feel like you cant move to any other positions. The management at my store was really bad but I don't think that would be true for other stores.
good,"I worked there in my teenage years, I cannot really attest to how they are now. I was responsible for replacing stock and general cleanup. My manager at the time was pretty nice"
good,I had a great staff and enjoyed my time at Target. I spent many years there and would have stayed if I were able to advance and transfer to another location. Was trying to transfer out of state but they didn't allow that for me
good,this place took a huge spiral to the ground. do not invest your time or energy if you want to advance. favorites are played the the quality of customer service was and is on the decline.
good,Make sure your willing to work. Your also expected to stay pass your schedule time if your part-time. Part-timers are usually scheduled 4 hours. Beginning of the year is a very slow period for Target. Hours aare cut dras if your not full-time. Management turnover is frequent.
good,"Its not rocket science. Stock shelves till full. If it can't fit send it back. Management let work. Nothing was hard. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with, and the legendary spades games at break time."
good,"I am a cashier and the job can be extremely hectic around Christmas. Other times of the year it can get really slow unless you are working on the weekends or during high traffic times of the day. I enjoy the $12/hr and that we have an employee discount. However, the employee discount is 10% off if you pay cash, check, Target GiftCard, or Target REDcard Debit/Credit. You can not receive your discount with your regular debit or credit card. You are able to combine your 10% with the additional 5% for REDcard as well as any Cartwheel promotions or store promotions that a regular guest would get."
good,Work hard and management will try to help you to advance towards your goals in the company and advance your career. Only problem is when the customers get upset but otherwise it was a friendly interment.
good,"Target is a great place to work when finding out what you want to do in life. Most of the managers are great, my coworkers were great, and most guests are great. I cherish my time spent there and wish it would have lasted longer. I wish some of my management experiences had been better, but they were not, and for that reason I thought it best to leave."
good,A typical day at target required a plethora of energy. As a flow team member I would manage the merchandising truck. As well as unload and stock the equipment.
good,The job is fast paced and the mangers can treat employees unfairly. The break room is nice and they provide you with decent breaks and lunch. They also provide food in the break room
good,Was a good work experience. Great team and awesome customers. Management was ok. Some unprofessional but over all a great environment to work in. Was only a seasonal position.
good,"As a Human Resource Team Member, I was constantly interacting with our leaders and team members to get everything handled smoothly. Having worked at one of the largest stores in the company with around 450 team members normally and upwards of 600 during season, it was not always easy to get proper communication from everyone. This position  taught me a lot about HR and a lot about what goes into such a huge retail store!"
good,Working at Target was an overall good experience. Management was always flexible with my constantly changing availability due to school. The pay was very fair. Management varied but was mostly positive. The most enjoyably part of my job was the team members I met and worked with.
good,If you're looking for a decent 2nd job to get extra money. Target is good one. It's easy to get hired there and the hours are short. In long run you don't want to stay there.
good,"Working at Target is mostly pleasant until the holiday season from my experience as cart attendant."
good,"Great place to work. Coworkers are friendly and very helpful towards one another. Job requirements can easily get out of hand, and times can be very stressful. Expect to often work later than you're scheduled. However team members help carry you through, and benefits are nice. Great job to start with, and start a career in."
good,"This Job was great, but the managers would not work with the school schedule. There was times that I would get a shift swapped with someone and they would get mad because I have other responsibilities like school."
good,"Target is a pretty good place to work. The other employees are nice and around the holidays , the hours really start to increase but the way target operates is really unfair and they should think about hiring some new store managers"
good,"Working at Target has given me better insight into customer relations, You're working hands on with helping customers in store, those who are placing pick up orders,and those who order online. My day usually consists of picking out product for guests that have ordered online and packaging and sending them out with care, if not that then I'm refilling product around the store and helping guests with product questions. Management could be better due to some only knowing about the job on a surface level and not understanding the inner workings and details, but overall the workplace is a very lax and relaxing one with minimum requirements to fulfill goals. The hardest part of the job is the most enjoyable, which is looking through our rows and rows of product in the back of the store to find the customer exactly what they're looking for."
good,Definitely need to pay their employees more! But they are pretty good to their employees when it comes to your home life. They also feed us a lot which is way awesome!
good,"I worked as a cashier for 6 months, also about a month in the food court.  You will have to fight for hours usually, but I was able to get 35-40 hours a week pretty consistently by picking up as many shifts as I could.  However, this also meant I often worked 6 days a week.  My managers were all friendly and reasonable, and I was never faulted for something I didn't do.  I found another job because cashiers are required to try to enroll customers in Target's credit card program, and this did not sit well with my conscience.  Your experience may vary based on location and management, but for a low level job, I have certainly had worse."
good,"Fast-paced environment, which kept it exciting.  Loved my co-workers.  Group interview forged early relationships/friendships among potential employees, beginning with mandatory group activities.  Management staff is pretty personable."
good,"Nice place to work."
good,I have a very busy job. I enjoy my job but it can be overwhelming. I have a good manager that helps me be the best team member I can be. I would have loved to been advanced. The best part of my job is vendors. I have a very good relationships with them all. The hardest part of my job is the lack of personal able to do my job. Sadly if I'm behind I don't get much help catching up.
good,"I started out as a cashier but was moved to being in charge of the new grocery department. Unfortunately, I guess I took my job too seriously because if something were to go wrong I would take the blame of course and apologize even if it wasn't my fault.  I was then sent back to just plain old cashier again."
good,Everybody was out for self. The mangers were ok some were better than others. It could have been a better way to schedule the team. And the breaks weren't long.
good,I loved working at target met alot of nice people and got to learn alot about logistics and how a store is run they made me feel like I was a family member
good,"working for target isn't that bad but it could be a lot better. the pay rate is pretty decent but it's not something you can live off of, unless you're getting 40+ hours a week which isn't promised if you're a regular crew member. as far as the actual work goes, its very simple and easy but can become very tedious. most enjoyable part of the job is my break. the least enjoyable part of the job is having to pick up the slack for other team members but besides that the job isn't half bad. i do recommend getting another job if you are not full time!"
good,"I’ve worked customer service for many years and have excelled at it.  A typical day a work would have me at various work stations. Checking out customers at the registers, resolving Customer concerns and or returns. I’ve even been sent out of my home store to new opening stores to train other team members. I’ve learned that creating an excellent guest experience is the key to any business. Guest experience is King. The workplace culture is very friendly yet business of course is business. There seems to be some favoritism but on the whole my manager is fair. The hardest part of the job is dealing effectively with irate guests but the most satisfying part is finding workable solutions to guests  conundrums."
good,"Always something to do , great for people who like to interact with others. Fast pace , eventful and an amazing learning experience for those who are interested in things such as foods and eletronics and how things work"
good,I just like too talk the the guest that shop at target while I work on the register some people are pretty interesting and funny. Target is a good place too work but they lack hours.
good,"The workplace varies from day to day, the managers have their days, The days can be as short as a 5 hour shift up to 10 hour shifts at times, really no room for advancements but they stock the break room with goodies"
good,"It seemed that everytime you are sick and call in they try to make you come in anyway. Yes, I understand when people call in it's rough but it's also hard when you don't feel well. They just assume you don't want to work."
good,Management was terrible and disorganized. It felt like co-workers had a better control over some things than managers. Managers stood around not doing a thing so yeah other than that it was a good job
good,"As far as customer service jobs go, this is the best one I've had. Unloading the truck and stocking the floor seems almost calming to me after years of frying food and listening to customers complain. If you're looking for something quiet in customer service, this is it."
good,"The store manager is very rude 90% of the time and no one has ever said anything nice. I was offered a permanent position their and they ended up letting me go saying it was only part time. READ  YOUR CONTRACT. It is fun at first but just slowly gets more stressful as the time goes by and you get so much thrown on your plate and not enough time to do it. And, if you do not get everything done then you will get called into one of the LOD's offices and get yelled at."
good,To be honest it is the people you will be working around that make the job worth staying. Managers aren't anything special to be honest. They don't ever promote people to better positions from the current staff they always just bring in someone from some other target.
good,"It’s a good place to work but not a place to stay, I would say it’s good while your looking for something better. They are not very sympathetic towards your schedule but will call you and give you more hours if your serious about it"
good,the team leaders are excellent..the store just remodeled a year ago. very clean environment. I like working with the co workers there..its the reason why I m still working there
good,Decent place to work and great people. The manager is great and the work place is very flexible. It is a great place for a student or someone  in need of flexibility  in hours.
good,"Retail work is not glamorous, and Target is no exception. However, the company of Target is one which makes you feel valued and can be proud working for. Of course, it may depend on the stores individual store managers, but generally, working there was a positive experience."
good,I enjoyed my time at Target. It’s a fast paced and true customers were always nice and understanding. The management were also nice but a lot of them played favoritism which I do t care for.
good,A great job but not enough time is put towards connecting management to team members. Lack of advancement to team members who know a lot and not enough compensation for those who know every department.
good,"The job itself is easy enough, however, it can be mind numbing and irritating at times. You have the customers that can range from your loving grandma to cheapskate. Most of time, guests will come up not knowing what they want to do, which is why you want to double check a lot of the time.  Some guests can be hard to understand so patience goes double for them. You have to learn to be independent as most of the time your manager will probably not be in arm's reach. Since they are all over the place and never sit still it will be up to you to figure out how to deal with something if a problem arises. Main problems that occur the most are lack of change, registers freezing, missed coupon or your lunch."
good,"Overall, I enjoyed working here. Management was great, and for the most part they communicated well. I enjoyed the people I worked with and they made the days bearable. I worked seasonal for the holidays, so a typical day was pretty busy and fast-paced. Also, I felt it was a tiny bit on the clique-y side, but I didn't mind since I never felt as if it negatively impacted my performance. I enjoyed interacting with a lot of different people constantly, it made the days go by quickly when people were friendly and made small talk (no matter how awkward at times it could be). I guess the hardest part of my job was when people were a little on the rude side, but it wasn't anything I couldn't handle."
good,"Unload semi trailers full of merchandise, build pallets, scan merchandise, make sure customer's get the correct items, pack boxes that are then shipped to the stores. Quailty"
good,The workplace culture at this place was very team oriented with friendly co-workers working together.  A typical day was spent restocking the sales merchandise and assisting customers.
good,"During my time of employment, it was always a fast paced environment to work in.  Efficiency and customer service was always a main priority while ensuring that a great guest experience was provided during their visit."
good,"Working at target was great on somedays but on others not so much. Sometimes I would be doing my job in the cosmetics section and I would get pulled 100 different directions. They would send me to the clothing section or to be at the registers, sometimes they would even send me down to the starbucks area to help them at the registers and i would have to leave my area, and because of that my work wouldn't get done and the managers would get angry."
good,"Overall, Target is a good place to work if you enjoy learning new skills and interacting with new people. Everyday is a little different. On average you will learn new things that will help you further down the road."
good,"Target is a decent place to work. The team has an overall great attitude and the atmosphere of the store is good. However, the hours fluctuate every week and are rather inconsistent. Management was always helpful and provided good guidance throughout my time at Target."
good,"It is a job, but it can do better when it comes to its employees, as for hours. It is a retail business and retail don't make sales everyday. It should not be like that. Seem like they don't care if our families get taken care of long as theirs are taken care of. They should understand how the employees feel when we don't get any hours."
good,"I only worked here part-time so I don't really know how the benefits and such worked. It was a decent job, despite what everyone says about retail. It's a good starter job or if you're looking for something for the interim."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Target as an Electronics Team Member and appreciated the work opportunity. Target pays well, and gave regular breaks and hours that were not too long."
good,Being their i learned a good way of customer service and to move at a timely fashion as far as getting my work done before my shift ended. Working there was a good way to meet new people and and build new friendships as well as become a outstanding employee i will say i enjoyed working there during my time of employment
good,"What a typical day at Target would be:"
good,"Teamwork environment fast paced"
good,Working at Target is a good place to learn to deal with customers needs and concerns.  It is a good place to gain experience in all types of aspects. All supervises are friendly.
good,"Loved the group of people I worked with. Everyone was always usually happy and ready to work. My position was great, go around the store shopping for the online customer, to packaging them and getting them ready to get shipped out."
good,If you are stillin highschool or want a part time job in College. COme work at target! You will be efficent without money and how to handle a budget. It never hurts to start from bottom and work you way up
good,It was a temporary  job and it wasn't a bad job. Applied for a different job within the store and placed me in a different department half of the time.
good,Its a good job to have and is consistent money. If you are struggling to find a job this is the place to go you won't regret it. Good stepping stone until you find something else.
good,"Target was a health job environment, with nothing to stress about. Leaders where always there to help when you needed it. Interacting with different people everyday made the time go fast."
good,"i liked working at target they gave me no reason or problems. The team members were fun and nice. everyone got along, and all the customers were satisfied or even better"
good,"It was a good experience, nice people, nice coworker, nice staff, it is a little bit boring, the uniform part is okay, you can bring your own stuff as soon as it meets the standards."
good,"A typical day at work. A good place to grow. Offers great benefits. 401k isn't to great, but as long as you do your job you won't have any problems. I would recommend."
good,"Nice place to work at,"
good,Plenty of heavy U-boats to put out on the sales floor all throughout grocery and dry goods the items that could not fit on the Shelf you had to back stock
good,"I liked it but the people working there made it great."
good,working with customers was amazing. your coworkers are like a family but management is horrible. they are very unprofessional and act like they havent left high school. they also have no respect for their workers under them.
good,"Days were particularly the same, as one would expect. Go in, wait for the truck if it inst already there. Unload the truck, sorting product out in the process."
good,"The managers had plenty of team-building activities, during which they made sure that we had fun and worked well together. The hardest part of the job was that frequently instructions for our tasks (restocking, setting up displays, etc) were unclear and managers would rather throw newbies into the deep-end than take a few minutes to talk us through the task at hand."
good,A lot of good people here. Very good leadership for the most part. I realized new people weren’t around very long from them quitting. & certain shifts available.
good,Great and steady work. In the holiday season you can almost work as many hours as you possibly can. Pays decent but not ideal for long term. I would go back at the drop of a hat if I needed to. Work hard and do not be lazy and you will do well.
good,Great place to work but very competitive and the push employees to promote things customers don't want or need. They are very cut throat and will fire you.
good,"Target is a fun, collaborative place to work. The only thing is the pay. It is not great. If you have a good HR team your time there will be fun with all the activities that they have, especially around the holidays"
good,"overall the coworkers make the job family oriented. Cost cuts to meet  store goals, they have higher paid employees with long service train and then let them go for financial reasons."
good,"overall not to bad. "
good,"Contractors are expected to be a part of the team but treated like outsiders and not compensated fairly compared to teammates. Perks aren’t included for contractors, i.e., company events and parties and all benefits. This was a good role to gain experience and get a foot in the door but overall didn’t love their culture."
good,"When I arrive in the morning's I would either need to change out the parking lot trash cans and or pick up lose trash in the parking lot around the outside of the store. Then I would reload the bags in the front lanes, check the spill stations, and check on the restrooms. After all that is set and done I would just get the shopping carts for the rest of the day, do carry outs , and check the restrooms every few hours. "
good,"I learned how to manage people, and also the kind of manager I wanted to be. Hardest part of the job is wanting to do the job right and not having enough time to complete all task on a daily basis or to your expectations."
good,The team environment is what i enjoyed the most. Our food team was the best in the district and had won awards for freshness and in-stocks.  Target is a great way to learn multi-taskings skills.
good,"Making sure the floor is well stocked in all areas."
good,It was a fun and interesting job especially because it was my first job. It was also very easy because all I did was stock and cashier and help customers with questions.
good,The job wasn't bad.  Having a good APM or APS helps out a lot. I don't think TPS can make apprehensions anymore but are allowed to assist. Overall it's a good job if you are going to college.
good,Great place to work managers can be non-understanding and very cynical with comments depending on the day and weather! Great work culture and coworkers.
good,"Not a bad place to work, just unsure of retail future. With increasing online shopping, and still being fairly young, I did not want to bank on target being around long term"
good,I enjoyed working at target for the short time I did but they simply did not appear to care enough about their employees for me to continue working there. If you don’t have any trips planned in the near future it is a fine job.
good,Communication skills learned with customer service. Being able to assist the guest. Handling money and management responsibilities with Store Managers
good,Target is a decent place to work if you're just looking for a simple retail job. They were going through a lot of restructuring while I worked there so it was a little more stressful than I expected with everything changing all the time.
good,Target help me to grow as a person and a team leader  and there was little  chance  to grow in the company  corporate seem to not really  care about staff
good,"At Target you work as a team but you're also expected to carry your own weight. Hardest part of the job (as with any retail job, honestly) is dealing with difficult guests. This job definitely helped me learn to better appreciate customer service workers. A lot of team members were friendly and helpful though I can't say the same for management since they can be rather unaccommodating and dismissive at times."
good,Very flexible with your work schedule. one of the managers was very friendly. A lot of young people working there with no work ethics. I like the idea of the employee discount plus my discount with  my red card.
good,"Nothing special to talk about. There is always work that has to be done and it feels like there aren't enough people to do it. They don't work you to the bone, they just keep you busy. After a year you can apply for benefits, depending on the hours you work, and they will work with you to get you the hours you need."
good,"My opinion would vary depending on the location and how your team members are, but it's been generally what you would expect from a retail job. I think the best benefit you could get as an introvert who tends to shy away from strangers is that you get better at interacting with people in and outside of work."
good,I enjoyed my time at Target and truly enjoyed the people that I worked with.  They provided me with great training that has allowed me to excel in future roles.
good,"This was a good company to work for, there is a lot of areas to work for and a lot of responsibilities. The environment is easily the best part but with the pay and inconsistent hours, it’s difficult to work here for long enough to move up."
good,I worked for target for a relatively short amount of time. While I was employed I found that the schedule was given in a fair amount of time in advance. However not that long after coming to that conclusion did I have calls coming from my manager about not arriving on days I was not scheduled; It turns out that the HR department had changed my schedule hours before without telling me this happened on a few occasions.
good,"A very exciting work environment and a lot of fun, but the managers don’t really care about your ideas and it’s hard to move up. If you don’t work in a specialty area, you really aren’t treated great. Beauty, electronics and clothing are the specialty areas."
good,"Having this be my first job ever was a total mistake.  It was the most stressful job ever, it ruined me psychologically and emotionally.  Every day was quick paced, especially during the time I worked there, during the summer, all the USC students were shopping, and it was hectic. All the managers were grumpy all the time time. The customers were rude, especially the ones in suits."
good,I worked as a cashier in the beginning and transferred to Guest Services. I got along with everyone and I enjoyed working at Target. I helped guests with their returns and purchases. I helped with sorting and returning product to the shelves. I answered phones and helped gueste pick up their online orders.
good,"Target starts you off at good wages. If you're full time, be prepared to work a lot. Even on days off. Understaffed most of the time. Will call you in on days off to cover. The front end is disorganized most times. Be prepared to jump from one area to the next and multitask. Overall good atmosphere and team work."
good,"normal retail hours; sometimes you have too many hours and sometimes not enough, depending on the time of year. target is rolling out a ton of new changes including new sales training that they expect to be followed. you dont have quotas to meet (yet), but if a leader sees you near a guest, you better be interacting with them, and in the right way. some of the managers are great and do everything they can to help nurture your career growth and to also just be a friend; others are very bossy, have a complex, and can be a nightmare. inquiries to move up usually fall on hushed ears; they pick out whomever they want and if you arent one of those people, too bad for you. there is also a bench (read:waiting list) that you must interview to even be on in order to land a leadership position. transfering is easy and is always an option after your first 90 days, but is a gamble because all stores are not the same and you never know what kind of team, management, or guest culture you are dropping in on. benefits are great (insurance after working 1,000 hours), with the exception of hardly any PTO. Requesting time off is easy though."
good,"I worked at the Super Target near UCF, one of the busiest Targets in Florida. That being said, it was a very well managed store. I enjoyed my colleagues and my managers, although if they mess up your schedule, you're still on the hook for not being able to show up."
good,"I found Target a very friendly place to work and really enjoyed it, but for cashiering the mats they have for you to stand on are not appropriate for standing on for 2 hours at a time. "
good,i would unload delivery trucks as well as stock the store... overall it was a good place to work and the only reason i left was miscommunication.......
good,"I worked with amazing co workers on this team. I learned a lot about the retailer. Such a great area to work in, very fast paced and always changing !!!"
good,The job was fine. It just didn’t pay enough. The management was perky and excited. They were good at their job and want others to be good at their job too
good,"This was a pretty good job. It was also my first and I got minimum wage, so that was reasonable. "
good,Target is a great place to work for. They are flexible with your schedule and really promote the work life balance that you need! They provide many to succeed in Target but in life as well!
good,"Target is a fast-paced, evolving workplace where our guests are our primary focus.  As a Service and Engagement Lead, it is my responsibility to ensure that all of our guests have the greatest experience possible in our store.  The best part of the job starts with interviewing and hiring the right applicants to build a great team, training that team for success, and putting the right team members in the right place to maximize sales and service."
good,"Working at target was very easy-going. The staff were engaged and very respectful. Working there was nice, the only downside was when the day slowed down and there wasn't much to do."
good,"Working there is ok, I'm not a stranger to hard work. Never had a bad experience. I like the management they are friendly. But the wage will not support the cost of living in the area of it's location."
good,working with the team members. management was great to work with if you need help or need any type of guidance they were there to help every step of the way.
good,Great benefits and 401K. Good team atmosphere.  Taking the right steps towards the future of online retail sales. Work/life balance can be hard in upper management positions.
good,"You can dress comfy for a long ten hour shift, it does get tiring moving all day the same way. I've learned all the skills required needed for the job. Management is helpful and understanding, hardest part of the job for me personally was the long ten hour shifts with constant motion and the sense of urgency at all times. I enjoyed the pay and over time being available."
good,"I enjoyed what little time I was there, the pay was decent at an hourly rate of $10.00 per hour. The management however was not the most pleasant to put up with. I would happily work there again if it were more than just a seasonal position."
good,"Not a lot of hours from the end of January through May. It was a struggle to get 15 a week. Now, im getting about 20-25 and its September. I love my job, but good luck becoming a manager. It's not likely. But fun job, facial piercings/fun hair color/visible tattoos are all welcome!"
good,Not paid enough in the pharmacy department for the skills that pharmacy technicians have. We are the life-blood of the pharmacy our pay should reflect
good,"Customer oriented job, learned how to be fast and efficient, not first priority for management, great culture inconsistent schedule, enjoy interaction"
good,"Easy retail job. Great Job security. Flexible hours and schedules. Amazing discounts. Not many career goals included, so little room for advancement or the opportunity for promotion. They like to give extra responsibilities without the extra pay."
good,"Target is highly competitive, but I understand the need for it.  High pressure for clean and full stores with high sales.  Need a good attitude.  Fast-paced environment."
good,Working at Target has been a good experience. I have worked here for five years and I have met wonderful people. The job is not hard and it pays well.
good,The work there is very easy to do but some of the mangers there aren’t fair and they are not professional. They show favoritism to certain workers and make it hard for others.
good,You work independently so no pressure. Overnight so no hassle of having to deal with the public. This discount was definitely a plus. And the coworkers were awesome.
good,"Job in general was enjoyable fast paced fun,fellow mechanics with the company knew what needed to be done, the mechanics lead did not and used outside help to the excess as well as determent to the existing workers,"
good,"My job was a typcial cashier role, i got compensated well for this job and the managers were overall friendly as well as most coworkers. Its a good second job or a job for a college or highschool student."
good,Fast paced with a variety of tasks and issues to attend to each day. The culture is changing. Cost cutting measures are being implemented at the same time as a complete overhaul of in store processes. This is resulting in more daily responsibilities and focuses to be accomplished by fewer team members.
good,"Employees, at most departments, get paid less than their department managers, and are forced to substitute in their positions at times of leave, paternity leave, or in absence of a position. Due to this, i felt it was unfair for me to take on the position of team leader, without being given the title, for nearly a year, because the company could not relinquish the position as the department manager remained on leave for an ungiven amount of time."
good,"This was the most positive supportive place I have worked at."
good,It was fine at first but the management was not the greatest and some employees were treated better than others. The other employees are nice and helpful. Hours and pay aren't too bad.
good,"The management and most of the workers are young, from high school into (my guess) mid-thirties, which gives an atmosphere of youthful energy and fun among the staff.  The customers are almost all pleasant, and Target encourages staff to be accommodating."
good,"Work was hard but they Pay better.Enjoyed with customers.Friendly atmosphere.Can work as Cashier,which was fast paced.But we enjoyed it.Good Place for Lunch.Sometimes free cookies."
good,"Job is fast paced, leaving much room for improvement for the cashiers especially. Have to keep an eye on your own lunch and break times because supervisors are hard to locate"
good,I have never worked in retail or logistics before working at Target. I learned it's more than just stocking the store shelves. I learned a lot while working there. I started stocking shelves but quickly moved to the Backroom and finally to Presentation or Plano. Presentation is a great position that challenges you.
good,"I love the people i work with, so much fun, and we always get everything done. great culture, everyone is so helpful, and great at training new team members."
good,"I mean Target was a very fun job, to where you learn a lot of different positions. Learn new things everyday. And have a lot experience around the store. You know your store more, and that way you get to help people “guest” even better."
good,"Some of the managers at Target could use a little training in common courtesy and communications.  However, the customers were the best part of being a cashier.  I was able to inform c.ustomers of the various ways to save money via coupons or the RED Card.  The employees are a great group of people to be around in a busy environment."
good,the co workers are great but the management does try to take advantage of you if you are younger they will try to do you dirty they fired me because they did not want to adjust my schedule for school and I only went two days out of the week
good,"Good atmosphere, fast paced but laid back, clean, respectable, nice co workers and good customer service. Started in January...love it more and more...clents are great"
good,Target has given me the opportunity to advance my career and given me the tools and resources to do so.  The team culture at Target has been one of the things that has been great.
good,I enjoyed working over nights and the management was fun to work with.They provide a lot of guidance during the shift . Some times we had to make our deadline to finish .
good,"I was hired in 2016 and got promoted to manage the grocery department, we got a new CEO and he cut my position in February of 2018 so I lost my guaranteed hours as well as cut the positions of the Starbucks and cafe team leads, same thing happened again late this year and into 2019 are cutting three more lead positions, I was lucky enough to survive the lay offs as Many life time employees even did not, the job was I would say very slow paced when I started so you could be passionate about fixing the many, many problems in the store and helping every guest with a genuine smile and actually had time to care what they needed, but they changed everything and now each team member works every part of their areas together so you get to learn about every part of everything in your department but you not longer get to make any of your own decisions or have any control which for me made me feel useless. Target does not give you consistent hours you’ll jump from 15-35 and back and fourth constantly working up to 10 days in a row maybe more but still never breaking 40, (you are not allowed OT) but I still belive it’s a good side job or college job to have, you will not be promoted to a team lead or full time unless you are pursuing a degree."
good,"Their work culture first taught me about the necessity of a sense of urgency. I worked with the overnight crew, so I didn't have high hopes going into the experience."
good,"unload semi 4 am 3 times a week, when got done with truck had to take merchandise to floor and stock shelves ,hang clothes and pull merchandise from back of store room to put on shelves."
good,the store basically had to just hope for its best everyday. it was very unorganized and tedious. for the amount of employees youd think more would get done everyday.
good,I did like working at target but because of payment that was every two week was not a lot to pay a own apartment and I have to go because I did have to go in a emergency to El Salvador.
good,"I was always working never sat down, but that's why I kinda liked it it went by fast, got to meet nice people, it's sometimes a hard working place and back breaking but if you got what it takes and you got energy I suggest to work at target"
good,Target pays very well and managers can work with your schedule. You become friends with the other employees very fast and feel like you are apart of team. Only downside is how demanding the managers are especially if you work in hardlines.
good,"Everyone should work at Target at some point in their career. One of the many great things about working at Target is it forces you to be diligent in the finer details of your work. Leadership pushes you to be prepared for any situation in order to maximize a given programs success. "
good,My overall experience with Target was good. I have been to many different stores of the past 14 years and saw that every store is ran differently and had its ups and downs. I have to say I enjoyed being at all them except this last store.  I did not feel welcomed when I arrived and the the employees were not very nice. I did not even get a chance to speak with the store manager and I was there for a year! I was so disappointed.
good,Fast fun and friendly environment. Team oriented atmosphere. Great benefits package. Long hours!! Room for growth opportunity. Discount is horrible...
good,Great employment for dual-income household.  Not great for a single mother. Great atmosphere of teamwork and superior guest service culture. A great starting place for experience in the work world.
good,As long as you have good managers you can really excel here. The company as a whole strives to provide every guest the utmost service and the leadership wants team members to feel the same.
good,Great place to work. Business structure is changing so management is less hands on now from before. A typical day is the same. Routines are set and team culture is improving.
good,"Customer service focused job.  Every day was different, meaning every day there were different tasks to complete.  Would sometimes be fast paced because of customer traffic, or can be very slow depending on when and what time your shift was."
good,The actual job is fairly simple but there is a lot to do constantly. You will always be busy whether it’s with the tasks at hand or with helping guests.
good,Target supplied training that allowed each team member to explore other areas in the store. The hours were flexible. You were able to pick up additional hours by cross training in other departments.
good,Target believes in supporting its mission to bring amazing shopping experiences for the Guest every day. Target supports the local communities through donations and volunteer events.
good,Target was a great place to work as a seasonal employee. It was nice to help customers and also to receive the employee discount for my holiday shopping.
good,Has lots of determined people who tries there best to get a particular task fenish one after the other as fast as possible and as professinal  as possible
good,"Working overnight, I didn't have a lot of interaction with the day time side of things, such as sales and the like. Between unloading the truck and stocking the shelves we never seemed to have enough time or people to get everything done."
good,Work environment does not congratulate full-time worker. Scheduling is for part-time worker like student. Not sufficient to sustain a family. Results in two-job careers.
good,"I was part of the planogram and presentation team,  every day we followed planograms accurately in order to create appealing, customer-engaging displays that drive sales, every day I really enjoyed what I was doing because we where doing different areas and planograms. I made good friends, the hardest part of the job was to look sometimes at you're schedule and you didn't have enough hours during the week."
good,"It's a retail job so you have the problems of a retail job. Random work hours sometimes hard to get time off, but usually very accommodating. It was a good college job."
good,I loved working the night shift. The employees treated you like family. The customers were always so nice to see you and would thank you for the big or little things you did for them.
good,"I loved this job so much. My coworkers made me feel involved in their lives outside of work and they were just nice. Although there was one gsa who just was so rude most of the time. I had a customer come up to me and tell me that she had been so rude to her too. At that moment I knew it wasn’t just me that she was rude to. Despite that, working here was truly amazing."
good,"Target is a great place to work but it does have some negatives. It is retail so your shifts are always rotating, one day you open, the next day you close, they you are off, and then you close. This really takes a toll on you. My management was great from my Store Manager to my regional Business Partner."
good,Its a lot of teamwork involved and lots of available training. Growth and stability are definitely covered along with some benefits as well. One of the best jobs I had!
good,"Was typically very enjoyable. Most of day was spent stocking or Reshops(put backs). Management was fair but at times were not very satisfied, also lot of times were asked to stay past scheduled shift. Working here was fun and met a lot of great people, but unless you really dedicate your life to Target, job advancement was slim, despite how hard you worked."
good,They pay great on the hour in their warehouse jobs.  You will work hard though they have high productivity expectations.  If you want a high hourly day in day out same thing for many hours a day this is the job for you.  If you want to advance don't even think about it with out a degree.
good,"Benefits are not the best, but for the most part it’s a good place to work. Sometimes management isn’t the best and the stress the bosses are under can influence the atmosphere of working there. Also the work load can be unfair."
good,"If you're looking for a really nice job with helpful staff and an ability to even move up in the company Target is the place for you. If you're looking for great pay and a full time position outside of being a lead or management, you can forget it. The management is cool and they do events each year and have great flexible scheduling."
good,"This is a pretty great place to work as a temporary or short term job. You will be loved by management if you work quickly, all personality types get along well short of whiney ones. As you would expect in retail, the hours and days change around so much it can be draining."
good,I enjoyed my time and learned a lot among my fellow target members. They are very open about attempting to try new methods of getting the work done. Its a very challenging and exciting place to work.
good,Target has a high turn over. Managers are obsessed with making the quota for red cards. You will get fired for not making enough red cards. Management is inconsistent.
good,Enjoyed all my time working at Target.  Team is great and store management does a great job.  Bad work/life balance if you have a family and children.  Otherwise I think it's a fast paced work environment with room to grow if you have the right work ethic and time.
good,"I work in the front end of the store, where each day there is something new to experience. It is defiantly a location where you can advance your skill set, and learn new skills. in most cases the atmosphere is upbeat and excited. if anything the hardest part of the job is the unexpected."
good,Enjoyed my time at Target.  Started out as Seasonal but was offered to have part time so I stayed.  It was flexible and worked around my other job.  I thought it filled a need at the time.
good,working for target was Ok. i liked what i did but im a mother so sometimes i have child emergencys. they focused on attendance a lot if u call out 2 times and are late 2 times one month then do it again they call it a pattern  and put you on probation with or without paperwork. i loved logistics but i had a bad experiences there.
good,"While working at Target can be stressful, the management does attempt to make it a positive workplace. There are a few kinks to work out, as with any company, but overall Target is a good store to work at. They are accepting of all genders, sexualities, and personalities; as well as encouraging."
good,Target is a Fast fun an friendly place to work.. guest are always put first. The pay is great an is also going up every year or so. Benefits are great as well.
good,Everyone is helpful and helps each other . My best experience was when I moved to Starbucks i love the environment of having a team and working at a fast pace.
good,"Target is a good place to start out at if you're looking to get into the job market and to gain experience. The people are welcoming, the managers are willing to teach, and overall is a good environment to build up in. That being said it wouldn't be a place I would recommend trying to build a career."
good,"Management was friendly but never really on the same page for more that half a shift. Super busy location and crazy during the holidays. Great entry level job after high school, but a high turnover rate, most of the management left after my year of working there and a lot of coworkers would either quit and come back or look for another job in the meantime."
good,"It was a cool environment to work in, but the only frustrating part was that I would fix a table of clothes then a customer would mess-up the first couple pile; my supervisor would tell me to fix it even though I just did. It happened pretty often."
good,"I provided great customer service and maintained the store’s quality by keeping the merchandise presentation my priority. kept shelves fully stocked, maintained a clean and safe environment, and resolved guests’ concerns in a positive manner."
good,Hardest part of the job was trying to get everything done.
good,"Overall Target is a good place to work. While it is fast paced and stressful it can be fun and a good place, laid back as well. Management would do special things for employees for holidays and special occasions as well as incentives for red card goals. But they did close the doors at our location so we no longer have one but the pay is good."
good,They were very flexible on hours with students. Pay was ok but not quite enough to support yourself while working part time. Would recommend for highschool or college students.
good,people there are cool and fun to work with. leaders there do a great job at ensuring that all the team members are doing theyre job well in order to ensure a great guest experience.
good,Job was perfect for my needs at the time.  I needed a flexible schedule and Target more than accommodated.  Store was a friendly work environment and provided training for all new tasks assigned.
good,Place to assist people and meet new people. Good management and friendly colleagues .place to feel secured cos of good security provided .place to learn how to multitask since you are required to assist at different departments at all times
good,"Love the company and co-workers the hours at my store are not enough. No full time positions available at this time, but the work environment is outstanding."
good,I overall I enjoyed working there. Team work was important. Its a fast paced environment with something to keep you busy at all times. A lot of younger people work there so it can be a lot like high school.
good,"Target is honestly the best retail job you could possibly get in the Washington area. Management is very respectful and tries their best to be fair to everyone. They encourage you to do your best at all times and give constructive feedback to motivate you. The job itself can be very quick-paced, especially on busy days. There's always someone who is always willing to help you out if you need it, though."
good,"Target was a great opportunity for me, paid well coming out of college and helped a ton with building my career and resume. They are very in to corporate politics and generally hire externally unless you are an absolute superstar performer which usually only happens if your lucky enough to be in the right position at the right time. Targets workload is immense with all the product they push to the stores and they tightly control labor hours leaving most tasks under staffed and if you cant do the job of 2 or 3 people you will be coached on being an under performer. Management and upper leadership look at big picture ideas and strategies, and dont listen to employee feedback or ideas. Then they scratch their heads and point fingers/have in office under performance conversations with you thinking that will make you work harder to make up for their incompetence."
good,"Enjoyed the work and the people. Clocked in, on time, did my job to the best of my ability, and clocked out at the end of my shift. The hardest part of the job was working when understaffed."
good,"You are unable to progress in this field unless you know, and are friends with management. Easy job to get just dont expect much learning or raises with it"
good,"Every Target location is different, the previous stores I have worked at were more friendly and helped you prepare for promotion. I feel like the hours given to each team member is unfair for the work load given. Great place to have your first job at."
good,"Work hours were full-time, with 15-30 minute breaks about every 2 hours. The hours only started to dwindle as the season came close to an end since it was only a seasonal job for me. The co-workers were nice, and it was very convenient that Target has their own restaurant and Starbucks. It was also across from the mall, so there were a lot of close-by options for lunch."
good,Working at Target was very fun and they let you pick up and set your hours as needed. Management was very supportive and trained me as cashier and self-checkout cashier. Pay was very good and discount works right away.
good,Target is a very busy environment. But if you were dedicated there is lots of growth in the company. It can be very challenging and a lot is asked of you but it is required to keep up with the demands of the retail industry.
good,every target is different but if you have a good manager then you have a good work environment. Generally everyone understood what he had to do and when we had free time we would help eachother out.
good,"Once you have your daily meeting, you would have to go to your own department and stay customer focused. Working at Target teaches great customer service skills and independence. Management does change often, The hardest part of the job was not going into overtime. The most enjoyable part was being able to learn daily."
good,Great place to work if you're still in high school or college because you get paid so much more than other low skill jobs. After a few months it will get really boring and you'll stop caring because the job won't take you anywhere.
good,"As a Team Leader at Target, I would have to follow daily instructions provided by the Executive Team Leader and work independently and proactive on completing projects.  I would have to micromanage and delegate task to other team members and collaborate and communicate on any issues or concerns.  I had to create and distribute corrective actions on performance and any other issues with team members.  Also, I had to write and distribute annual performance reviews to team members.  My responsibility is to work directly under the Executive Team Leader to accomplish overall store goals.  I really enjoyed the idea of putting projects together, initiating them and completing them for an overall sales goal accomplishment.  The hardest part of the job was not having enough time to put all plans into place."
good,This was your typical retail position. It is good for those that are still in school or looking for work while going to college.  It is your typical drama filled environment as with most retail positions.
good,very open minded management and open minded to support employees diversity. ability to compensate for employees and their support to different types of people is good
good,"Target is a great company to work for, but your experience as a team member will depend on your store. My current store is wonderful, most of my team are very good workers and great coworkers. Of course with any job there are ups and downs. Working any type of retail job is stressful, and this one is no different, but it is the people you work with, plus the management that make working the job very tolerable."
good,It  is  my  regular  practice  not  to  publicly  provide  reviews  of  my  previous  employers  because  it  strictly  my  personal  opinion. This is
good,"The job is great and the people are nice, there are some problems but that comes with every job. The main issues at this one, however, is that the management doesn't communicate well to each other and so it leads to the employees over working or getting in trouble for doing the wrong job and that there are a couple individuals who are not accepting of diversity."
good,"Although my employment was seasonal, Target provided a great atmosphere for coworkers and customers to dwell. The savings are great, the coworkers are inviting, and the flow of the store will keep you looking for new things. The company provided lunch provided by them and on expected busy days would provide lunch from an outside restaurant. Target is a well-rounded store and working there made me understand why it is."
good,This job is great for students trying to pay their way through school. This job is fast paced and stressful but can be rewarding if you put in the effort.
good,Working as a store team member was always fun and fast paced. Each store is different as management can make your break a good experience. The real only downside is the typical close-open hours management teams get stuck with sometimes. Pay is fair given the basic retail position most team members hold compared to other retail companies.
good,Management is iffy in the targets that I've worked at. Goals for the day were constantly shifted throughout the day so one didn't really know what was expected of them sometimes. Definitely very flexible with hours but there didn't seem to be very many available outside of the last quarter of the year.
good,"Pay is low, job is busy and stressful.  Insufficient number of work hours.  Dealing with customers can be fun or stressful.   Too many employees don't show up for work, burdening other employees with too much work."
good,Target is a very popular store and we always had an abundant amount of guests. The work flow was busy but manageable. The other employees made the environment fun to be around.
good,Target it’s a relaxed place to work decent pay for full time helpful team members I got a good amount of experience made a typical day at work was setting up a new panel and sticking it before opening hours
good,"Target was a good place for a first job. However, it has been a really long time since I worked there. I believe they are increasing the base pay, but I remember that it was hard to get hours when I worked there."
good,"working at target is a fast , fun and friendly experience, everyday is a learning experience from both team players as well as the operational managers, its a diversity of ideas."
good,hours are scarce at different parts of the year which means inconsistent pay. could be fast paced at times. overtime is optional if you want/need extra hours
good,"Management at the store I worked at was good. sometimes it was challenging to balance stocking with handling customer needs, but overall it was a pretty decent place to work."
good,"learned a lot about guest service while with this company, management and the atmosphere was constantly changing throughout the years i had worked there."
good,Great part-time job.  They worked with me on my hours so as not to infringe upon my full time job.  Friendly people.  Great workplace culture.  Loved helping the customers.
good,"A typical day for flow team member was showing up at 4 am, unloading the truck onto pallets my sections, pushing merchandise to floor to stock before the store opened."
good,"Target has been a great company at which to work.  Although I already had several years of retail experience, I've learned a great deal working there, as Target has its own systems and procedures that are different from other retailers.  The Team Members are a pleasure with whom to work.  As I have cross trained in a few different roles, I have the variety of duties that I enjoy throughout my shift."
good,"Target has a good work environment that is hard to find anywhere else.they commit to keeping their employees happy. the work schedule is very flexible. however, recently the management at my particular store has gotten considerably worse from 2 years ago to now, its like night and day. very disappointed at where my store is going. We need better management."
good,I enjoyed working at Target. It was very easy going and everyone working there was super friendly. Hours were super flexible as well. The job itself was super simple and stress-free.
good,Working at Target allowed me the flexibility  with my family life and I was able to meet some amazing people in the process. I would tell a friend about Target it's a good work experience.
good,Target is fast paced and up beat. It can be difficult to deal with the public especially during black Friday. My shifts would go by fast. I loved the people I worked with.
good,It's a great place to start. Great pay. Although hours are not guaranteed can go from 12 a week to Max 30 by season. Not a lot of opportunities. Work is more than expected.
good,"I enjoyed my time here so far, however I wish it would be easier to get additional hours. It seems like some people get the short end of the stick and others are favored and get more hours."
good,I enjoyed working at Target; but they were having a difficult time knowing what work to assign me with my programming skills.  I would often find assignments that I knew I would help with and then check with the manager if it was o.k. if I worked on the project.  I completed my Masters in Software Engineering at St Thomas while I was there and wanted to get into some Java projects and they wouldn't let me.  This is why I left.
good,"As long as you showed up on time and did your work efficiently, no one really bothered you. They were not always quick or willing to assist with your problems and some managers didnt want to help you at all. The hours were never consistent and you never knew what you would work week to week unless you were a manager. Unless you were unavailable to work weekends, you were working every weekend"
good,"Always walking around taking time to make sure that guest were satisfied, I would help the guest as much as I could to keep a smile on his or her face"
good,"Working at target was a smooth easy side job, wasn't too much hard work and was never a job that stressed me out, considering that it is retail and a    s"
good,Start of my day is my daily security checks of the building. I learned how to defuse situations. Management was cool. I enjoyed working with coworkers
good,I am not willing to participate in your survey. I was within a seasonal position and believe that I lack significant time with the company to ultimately comment on the overall company.
good,It’s a very good job for students. Very good starting pay and the management really does welcome you from day one. The main issue is having a lot of tasks for you during your short shift that are hard to get done in the time frame. Good job i would recommend
good,"I helped guests with their purchases, stocked the front end as needed, looked after the customer service area when needed or helped in the pharmacy as needed. I also trained new employees when one of our regular trainers was not available. I really liked Target because I got to help people and that is very important to me. What I learned were ways to improve my service skills so that I could help more people and interact with them in a more positive manner."
good,Target was a great place to work while going attending higher level education. I enjoyed working with my peers. I also enjoyed being able to talk. I liked it.
good,I would say it was a very eye opening and great experience overall to work around others on a team level. It showed me  how to be a better worker In general when working in retail and how to go about giving the customer the best service possible representing not only my character as a intern but a unit within the business.
good,"it required alot of productivity it was fun learning everything ,because the time was moving .and it was interesting learning learnig new things for my self.it was great to work on a deferent company to learn deferent challanges.i was very exited for to be there and work for the company.fun exating great,learn to be more frendly responzable"
good,"Easy place to work, some of the managers are great while others are not. Hours are flexible but not guaranteed, especially right after the holidays. Overall a decent place to work if you work with the right people."
good,"Visual work was sometimes overwhelming; no one ever guides you through your tasks and simply expects you to know what you're doing. Managers are decent depending on the day. Overall, great but could be better."
good,"They are really nice about providing sodas in the break room sometimes or sometimes a manager will buy a bunch of cookies or chips for the break room. They are also all about recognizing team members. The only thing I didn't like was they do not accept doctors notes, and as a person with an autoimmune disease and a weakened immune system, this caused problems with my HR manager as they tried to write me up for having the flu... other than that it's a pretty cool place to work!"
good,"Great Place to work, however there seams to be a lot of management staff that lacked knowledge and experience. I saw fresh young college kids right out of college take on heavy rolls just to see them fail and destroy moral within their teams. I feel that Targets down fall within the store is that they focus more on a college degree to move up in the company vs experience, passion and commitment to success. It was upsetting to see talent be wasted and ignored due to lack of a college degree. In many case it would be considered discrimination."
good,this is a good place to work when the season is in you meet a lot of hard working people that love what they do and treat the other employees with respect.
good,"Was a very nice place to work. Learned a lot and had fun while doing it. The hours can be long, but it is worth it. They seem to care about you......."
good,"The environment is very structured and all decisions are made at headquarters in St Louis. Very few decisions are made at the local level. If your not used to this type of environment, you'll hate it. If you are ok with it, then just know locals don't make decisions."
good,I got to experience a different type of retail than I had before(with walmart). I got to meet new people and experience different walks of life and it was an experience I won't forget.
good,Fun at times. No opportunity for me. Hours are inconsistent and advancement is not based on seniority or work ethic. Rater it seems to be a popularity contest.
good,"Hard work is the key really, put in that work and you’ll be promoted, so as I said hard works the key. It’s a team turned family type of environment with fun and love"
good,Target is great . I always have the most red cards before I leave everyday. Target is very huge. Everyone is nice there. My manager was just Awesome I loved him.  Target has taught me a lot .
good,"Target tends to keep every worker the same as the next, favors those who are over achievers, and does as much as they can to save the company money."
good,A typical day at work was very relaxed and very fun to communicate with so many different people. Management was the best part of the expierence because they are all so nice and kind.
good,"Ensured customers were satisfied with every part of the flooring experience, from initial greeting through order completion. ● Memorized the company’s product offerings; contributed to a 12% sales increase for the quarter by communicating product benefits and providing excellent service. ● Recommended solutions within customer budgets and proactively followed up with all leads."
good,"If you're just looking for a job that can work around your schedule and don't plan on staying there too long, this job might be it for you. They got great benefits, but they'll aim to keep your wages low as much as they can, including a ridiculously low pay raise. I would just use this as a side job or a job between jobs."
good,My overall review is that I value and appreciate Target however it is time to elevate and expand to newer positions and bring my skills to another team.
good,Atypical work day consists of handling Cash and credit cards also customer Service.I learned to work well with others the hardest part was the lifting the most enjoyable part was meeting all the customers that came to the store
good,Its a pretty good job. I work mostly in one department so I get to see all the latest  items that come in. A lot of rude guests that come in and complain over nothing but still a great place!
good,"Target is a great place to work, you must have the correct number of crew to keep the store zoned and product placed of the shelves.  During the Holidays it is very busy and requires a lot of crew to resupply the store."
good,a typical day at target involved keeping ur department clean and helping out customers find everything they needed. but when you were done they reward you by giving you someone else work. they were very little opportunity for advancement.
good,Target is a great company for advancement. They give you the knowledge to lead a team whether or not you stay with Target.  The only downside is you create a target on your back if you don't want to advance any further or start to make too much money.
good,"Working at Target doesn't foster excitement, but it's not hard work. A typical day involves simply being a cashier and ringing up guests. This can cause time to drag. I have learned that customer service is a number one priority. The most enjoyable part of the job was my coworkers and getting to know them and learning about their different backgrounds."
good,I loved my co workers and most team leads. When new ones came in a lot of them were very negative and nasty for no reason and it did not make me feel comfortable and I no longer desired to stay and decided it was time to find a job that paid better anyway. I recommend target for someone who is going to school or something but not forever unless you truly want to try to make your way up to the top. They do recognize when you do a  great job.
good,"At the beginning I loved my job.  Working there was way different than all of my other jobs before this job. I have so many friends that I made from Target, and working with them was the best. The job itself was ok. The reason why I say ok is because they were not always clear of job duties, or they changed things without letting you know.  I got pretty good at my job though. I mean I worked there for 7 years.  in the end though, was the part that had me leave.  The management played favorites way too much!!! For example, there was a supervisor position available around the time I resigned that I wanted, and was more than qualified for.  I was practically already doing this job expect the paperwork side of it.  Which would have been very easy for me to learn.  And after doing the interview with management. They decided to go with a different girl from a different department because she had supervisor experience from other jobs.  But she did not have any experience in this job at all. So they hired her and then they asked me to trainer her on everything except the paperwork.  This made me leave this job and find one where I could move up in the company and get paid more.  I wouldn't say I would not ever recommend someone to work there though. Actually they have changed some since then.  They have better pay and different management now."
good,A typical day at work was to run the day to day operations and service of a store. To ensure everything was neat and organized to ensure the best guest service and satisfaction possible. The hardest part of the job was staying on routine while unpredictable events occurred needing your attention. The most enjoyable part of the job was the Target team.
good,As a hardlines worker on a regular basis I would clock in get my walkie-talkie and my zebra (a price checker)  then I would go get a cart with items on it and start putting items on the shelves.
good,Managers was awesome! The environment was fast but slow pace. Learning different products. Knowing how to use different equipments. I recommend target to all friends
good,"I took the job as an alternate career, after a period of time Target decided to do HVAC preventive maintenance in house instead of contracting out ,I was used as an air conditioning specialist was asked to travel from store to store with no other compensation while still fulfilling my own stores regular maintenance duties I was responsible for, at first I did not mind helping out but if I was going to work in the HVAC field I wanted to get paid  accordingly so I left to go back into it"
good,The atmosphere was very calm and easy to be in. i was always happy to go to work besides nights i was ill. but otherwise a great experience. My only regret is not having been able to work there longer then a temporary position. but i would highly recommend target as a place as work. although as a second job due to the hours being short but they were flexible.
good,Staff was friendly. Atmosphere was pleasant for the most part. Management seemed more interested talking about personal life than being attentive to both employees and customers.
good,i have nothing bad to say about this company. They have there ups and downs but overall it has been nothing but fun working fro target. I am gaining valuable Experience working here and meeting and greeting new different types of personalities.
good,It is not the best place to work and the only redeeming quality was that the people I worked with were friendly and fun to be around. There is little room for advancement and the work environment can be very stressful especially around the holidays.
good,It was fun but the store team leader was unreasonable and the HR team doesn't take into account any of the team member's needs. I had the worst hours out of anyone in the whole store.
good,"Target was an outstanding workplace I loved all my guests, the job was a gratifying experience. I am a very authoritative person so I am fine with any work that may need to be done. I got along with all customers and the job was sufficient. The schedule was suitable and I had time to tend to my 4 kids. I got along with all my co - workers and no problems occured while working my job. I am prepared to do what I have to do in order to satisfy my customers the best way I can. My co - workers would probably describe me as benevolent. I loved my job."
good,Well paced and collaborative. Has it’s ups and downs but target is always ready to work to satisfy the customer. They work as a team as nice flow to making the team successful. I’m
good,"On a typical day of work, I would find myself with enough of a workload to keep me occupied, but not overwhelmed. It would be more often that I would find myself with slightly too much to do then too little."
good,"Target is overall nice place to work at, The best/worst days are around the holidays when everything is fast paced and all the workers are all over the place but once you get the job done you feel great about yourself. The managers are somewhat nice but very bossy and can be unprofessional at times."
good,Its a typical retail situation.  Anyone that has ever worked retail knows what that means.  Somewhere between 20 and 30 hrs a week.  Inconsistent schedule.  Co-workers are very nice and super helpful to each other.  Customers are very fun to help.
good,Great team members  at times during season the team members hired don’t do there job as expected making it harder for the ones that have been there to do there job
good,"Work days are very routine. Same type of work to expect day in and day out. Sometimes feels robotic. Feels like I am the only one who knows how to perform the job duties necessary in the receiving position, including management. Lack of career advancement for someone in the receiving position."
good,During a holiday is too busy which is good or after a holiday is too  slow business it will be less hours( better than a nothing). Some was too easy or hardest part of the job like back stock or pull stock and etc.  Sometime you would enjoyable a part of the job or not and depend on how your feeling is comfortable in work.
good,If you need a job with a flexible shedule this is for you. Mainly for students and supplemental income. A typical day will involve a quick check-in with a team leader then you get to work on various assigned tasks.
good,"I've certainly had worse jobs than Target Corporation. As a temporary position that only lasted over the holiday season, it wasn't bad by any means. I recommend it for anyone looking for extra money."
good,"For the most part I have absolutely loved working for Target. But I do not like that the only people that are promoted are people who are really young (i.e. in High school) or other people I care not to mention. But like I said, I have enjoyed working here.  The dynamic of the people I work with are pretty laid back and fun. I have preferred working the evening shift more so than the day shift.  We have more fun in the evening and the feel is much more laid back and less stressful than during the day."
good,"Target has a great team culture that allows you to feel part of the team and work as one cohesive unit to get the job done each day. The hours can be long, but there is always a lot to do and time goes by quick."
good,Good place to work if you’re hard working. Hours are long but the pay and benefits are good. They do try to make schedule exceptions for those going to school.
good,typical day you meet in the a.m. get the work load for the day stretch then get what you need for the job and get to work.  you will learn plenty management is not the best but not the worst either
good,Great friendly envirement. Once the holiday season cooled down it was a fun place to be. Manager was a few years older who used to joke around. Made the time go by quickly.
good,"Target was a fun and productive workplace, it could be stressful at times but it wasn't too bad. The team members were really nice and helpful, most of the managers were as well. There were a few managers that weren't all that great or helpful but putting up with them was easy."
good,"this job was a few years ago, but it was fairly relaxed. My suggestion is when you start, learn exactly what the basic standards are for a promotion/raise and CONSTANTLY ask for one once you have met those requirements. They do not like to give people raises and will try their hardest to put it off especially if you're young."
good,Target was a good entry level job and the environment was relaxed most of the time except for the holidays. Management varied between individuals as there were so many on any given day.
good,"It was a good, self-competitive, work place."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of me coming in and either on register or managing the carts. This was my first job, this is where I learned my First batch of customer service experience. Hardest part  of the job was nothing. It was relatively easy. Most enjoyable part was helping customers and them appreciating it."
good,"Shift change created a public transportation problems. Learn  about tracking inventory, display design, hardest part was trying to stock the shifts while customers were in the store."
good,Great place to work but can be hectic most of the time. Leadership generally has difficulty communicating company priorities. Work life balance is better then most retailers.
good,I would work for target again because when I worked for them they treated me with respect and they wore friendly every time. I left because I didn't see my self doing this for the rest of my life.
good,"The place was fast paced and if you did not meet your numbers too many weeks in a row, then you would definitely would not be considered being hired on if you are a seasonal."
good,"Great place to work as a high school student, I work there for 2 year and I learned a lot at Target, I did customer service, worked as a cashier, it was a great experience"
good,I worked as temporary sales associate during the Christmas Holiday season in the women's clothing and shoe department. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude  shoppers
good,"Got laid off without being notified, had a week to find a new job. Didn't tell me until I seen I was no longer on the schedule, I had to go to the manager."
good,great company has everything you need you are looking for. not many hours giving worked never full time. hard work backroom also sales floor very busy
good,"we put items in shelf, help customers, have some fun activity for special holiday. It can be hard work especially in the Fall. I learned to be a great person."
good,Great place to work with a team culture. I have learned from many leaders I have worked with over the past 20 yrs and have made some good friends. Would recommend as a place to work.
good,"A great collaborative environment , with wonderful people and a strong belief in TEAM."
good,"Here was a place for all your dreams to go and die. i worked there for 3 years and was never even promoted to team lead. if you looking for some ok cash for a short while, go ahead and apply. otherwise stay away."
good,"Lots of favortism depending on your management team."
good,typical workn day is cool pretty laid back and easy i work nights so everything is smooth at night customers are nice environment is chilled its really cool
good,Ok environment. Just not enough hours . The schedule is never the same. The hours are never the same. No paid time off or sick time. Part time is the reason for that I believe. Never met ceo so can’t honestly say anything about him.  I do love working with people.
good,"A typical day at Starbucks within Target is pretty hectic. I made a good amount of drinks but also enjoyed my time while working. Upper Management isn't the best but my Starbucks boss was great. I have learned so much about guest service while working for Target whether positive or negative. The hardest part of my job was the difficult guests and time crunching required to complete the tasks required of me. All in all, it was a good job but it is time for me to move on to something better."
good,"Fast paced, competitive company, room for career advancement, good benefits. Depending on the Iocation it can be a little stressful. They offer good Lifesource services."
good,"Typical day was pushing out merchandise on a daily basis. Assist guest that were shopping on the sales floor. Very organized with management. Learned to merchandise product, set up new materials,make signs, put up sales ads, and worked a fork lift in back stock area."
good,"Store I worked at had a major clique-ish culture built up due to the particular Store Team Leader that ran it. As a company, gave a great work experience and the opportunity to open stores in Alaska and Hawaii, experiences that I will never forget."
good,"I took this job because Piggly Wiggly was shut down, I needed income. This position was interesting, I did different things. For the most part I enjoyed my team members. My manager wasn't as polite or friendly but she managed."
good,"Advertise as a fast fun and friendly place to work. It is not!  Work ,work , and more work. Always faster. The more jobs you can do each day the better."
good,"Target was my first job. We got a 10% discount which was nice, but there was a huge lack of communication with management. I worked there over summers and other breaks when I was home."
good,"At target it was a fast pace job , giving customer a friendly and helpful service. The work place was fun and everyone worked as a team to get the job done."
good,"I loved this job. It was well balanced, i met new people everyday. There was structure everyone worked as a team. Managers were understanding and fair helpful."
good,Target is usually slow when it's a regular day but whenever on a holiday seasons it's usually get very crowded and you get very productive and busy on those days.
good,"i think Target is a great entry level job, very organized. Hours are good flexible positions. Only downside is the pay comparison to some of the responsibility given to your job role."
good,"My job was to work in inbounds. Which was a little hard but it was a job and pay good.  I had to unloads a truck sometimes by yourself with your hand, had forklift but had to share."
good,"It was a pretty simple place to work, relaxed environment and the people i worked alongside were kind and funny. I enjoyed my short time working there."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is having so much trust from my supervisors and being their recommended cashier to have at guest service. I felt honored but I know I earned it because I work hard and always put my job first.
good,"Target was a nice place to work. They had advancement opportunities, loads of extra hours. Working the night shift your not so micro managed as long as you doing what you are supposed to. Great environment"
good,"Target is a good place to work if, you are starting your career, going to school or just looking for extra income. its fun but it can be lot of work at times."
good,"Best first job, good for students who are studying full time as it has a good work life balance, my co workers were the best, I'm close to some of them up to this day and the duties were easy"
good,"A typical day at work fun, fast-paced, and competitive. Their were always new projects to help the company's efficiency improve. Management was fairly easy going and charity/ volunteer work was important to this company. The most enjoyable part of the job was a feeling of accomplishment and that you really helped people. The hardest part was being hung out to dry if you were promoted to a lead position in another department. Also, the pay in certain areas should have been more competitive."
good,"Always a busy day, very rarely was there slow days. They cross train you in all areas but they don't give you a good enough pay rate for knowing so much."
good,"I loved Target I worked for them over 14 years, grate place. I just never had any free time out side of work. Time goes by fast when you try every day to squeeze 16 hours of work in to 10 hours. As a manager you get no life at target. I would have loved to have stayed but just not as a manager."
good,Success of your store depends on how hard everyone works from the top down. Too often the ETLs' are sitting around whIle everyone else is working. Hopefully you can find a store where this is not the case.
good,Fast paced and structured environment. Must be able to work independently and get tasks done with little supervision. Willing to learn different areas of the store.
good,"My time in Target had a wonderful start that ended in a rather childish way. Despite ample warning of my requested, or even requested and approved time off, I was still receiving rather poor acknowledgement amongst the management at my last workplace (Pflugerville, TX, Stone Hill Plaza), for reasons unknown to me. "
good,"I used to work at a Target store in Kansas City, MO. I really enjoyed my job there. It was easy to learn and the schedule was flexible since I am a student."
good,"great inviroment to work in  , co workers were with. Fun ,fast paced and dedicated to bring a great shopping experience to the custmer. You can always keep yourself busy at Target. they also have alot of community functions with their customers"
good,didnt work that long there but the organization where on point they have team members help you with work making sure everyone get help in there group good friendly people an want to help you suceed in life an career
good,"I've been working with Target for the past 9 years and I to see what other career opportunities are out there. As we move further into this generation many of the big retail company's have been closing their doors etc. Sports Authority, JcPenny, Sears and Toys R Us just the other week are closing stores nationwide."
good,"Work for target is not something that is super demanding. It is very simple work, in most cases. Depending on the department that you work in, you will need a different set of skills. If you are a cashier or a sales floor team member, you need to be friendly and very helpful in assisting guests in what needs they may have. This can range from finding a product to finding out if you have any product in the backroom. There is a wide variety of positions to pick from at Target, and plenty of openings for different shifts. I would highly recommend Target to someone looking for their first real job."
good,Target is a great place to work if you are in school or just need something flexible. It is not a place to make a career as there are not many opportunities to advance and there are store politics that make it difficult to do so.
good,"Target is a great place to work, but given the recent restructuring, there is limited development opportunities for highly motivated individuals ready to make a real difference."
good,"Loaded trucks with products to be sent out to the store. People on 1st shift were nice and helpful. Very physical position. In the summer time while loading boxes inside the semi trucks, it gets very hot. I had it pretty easy because I got along well with my manager. Biggest con was when I found another 1st shift position, I spoke to my manager to give him my 2 week notice and thanked him for my time there. He said he understood. But my last 2 weeks there, he started giving me the cold shoulder, giving me the ""grunt"" work and on my last day, I came in and realized that he took me off the schedule altogether. When I asked him why I wasn't on the schedule, he was rude and gave no explanation and basically said ""oops"" and said I could go home. He obviously did it out of spite since we were very busy and he could've used the extra help."
good,"Typical day was nice, cool , customers were cool individuals. Management were nice people unless you did something wrong. All in all, good place to work."
good,Fast paced fun friendly environment Good benefits many different jobs you can do to get experience and hours. Management was good to work for. they were pretty fair
good,I loved working for target ! everybody was so nice and helpful. I got a lot of overtime and I had days off to spend with my family. It is a faced environment but the pay is good.
good,Challenging work environment with a great work culture. Hardest part of the job is the continuous changes and always changing expectation from leaders. The most enjoyable part of working for Target is the people and opportunity to grow and advance.
good,Very exciting place to work. Constantly busy. Friendly staff. Flexible work schedule. Clean environment and safe. Great discount. Unfortunately unreasonable pay.
good,"A job i picked up in high school, it was great at first but then i started to exceed expectations and they noticed but never cared, they always seemed to only care about their long time workers ."
good,"Greatly staffed and the co workers are extremely well put together team... Just would have liked to have be put on permenantly... The worst part of this job was that i was scheduled on weekends, Love my football.."
good,Although I enjoyed the people I worked with and the customer interaction with so many employees it was sometimes difficult to get hours within a given week.  I do think that the company tries to make it enjoyable and I enjoyed being part of a team.
good,Loved target only reason I quit was I moved. Your day starts at 4 am and ends at 9 am could go longer. The work place was safe.The hardest thing about the job was waking up early
good,"A good place to work if you don't mind repetitive and, sometimes, hard work. The management is fair. Everyone is welcome and treated equally. Team members are encouraged to cross train into multiple areas. Most positions are part time. Target is very flexible with their hours and will work with team members who have other jobs or are going to school."
good,A typical day at Target was to ensure that the customer experience was a pleasant and successful one.  The position could be a fast paced and crazy busy but they also take time to have fun.
good,Good environment depending on location. Hours fluctuated throughout year never perminant for over 6 months. Management was good but situations weren't handled great all the time.
good,They don't really schedule you enough hours. They tend to stick to 4-6 hour days. You can't really grow in the company unless you stay there for years on end.
good,"A typical day would include a lot of walking, answering numerous questions for guests (some angry), and stocking / restocking shelves. The staff that work there are very friendly and will usually help you out when you need it. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers."
good,"Target offers a very Inclusive well rounded team . I lived the camaderie and sense of family the team members develop . Target offers advancement opportunities but only if you're very young, sometimes the older more experienced team members get left behind"
good,"Target you have the chance to grow within the company. Target is a friendly loving store. Target did so much community service it was a good feeling to give back to my city. Flexible hours , make you feel at home."
good,I worked there seasonally during Christmas time and it was a great first job. I made a lot of friends but they rarely keep seasonal people. Great place to work but hard to get on and stay on
good,"I love the workplace and my coworkers, but I am tired of being told I am going to advance and having the rug pulled out from under my feet. I need somewhere I know I'm appreciated."
good,It had its good and its bad. I started of with a good schedule then it kept changing. Less and less hours. I did get along with everyone. I worked overnight so it was more relaxing
good,"provide customers with the help and support they need , also ring up merchandise, stocking and restocking mechandise on shelfs. also responsible for closing on thursdays."
good,one of the best company i ever work at but company is failing and trying to cut down on everything. managers are working all hours and only offer overtime during the holidays.
good,"Target is a workplace that encourages team work and communication. There were ample opportunities to move around the store, learning and gaining new experiences."
good,"Retail can be a hard life to live - but if you love the industry and are looking for a place to learn and grow Target is the place to do it!"
good,"Lovely bunch of people to work with - some elements of a family firm are left over, which is good. People want to do the right thing here. "
good,I was with Target for just over a year. In that time I never once had any issues with my employment. My hours were very flexible.  I was rewarded with a promotion above more experienced team members due to my drive and determination and my performance record and knowledge of company policies and procedures. I was given choices to pick up shifts if I needed extra hours on any given week and We never acted as though we were employees or employers. The team as a whole acted as a family unit. My experience at this company was one of the best experiences I could ask for. I was very sad when my employment with the company came to an end. They could use a little revamp on company policy regarding employee discipline but other than that I felt more comfortable and secure with this company than any other. I strongly recommend employment here as long as you are willing to put in work and work as a team.
good,This place is a very good job if your looking to have a stepping stone or a first job. It has good benefits after the 90 day probation period is up then it becomes an easier more relaxing work area.
good,"The overall environment is determined by where you work, but is consistently full of nice people. The management is helpful, encourages hard work, and knows team members limits. The hardest parts of the job was usually when working alone and trying to keep track of everything while helping guests."
good,"Work was not difficult, hours were OK, salary was OK, work environment was OK. Friendly and cooperative coworkers. Training was top-notch because they wanted you to succeed."
good,"You clock in get your assignment from manager on duty and the day goes on from there. You focus on your task(s) while providing great customer service as customers ask of you. Sometimes you would get multiple assignments from different supervisors so you had to stay focused during your shift to get those tasks completed. There were times where you were not able to get all tasks completed by end of shift due to store being highly busy. On those days sometimes about 50 to 75 percent of your shift time went to stricktly servicing customers. I learned that communication is quite important. There were times however that things did not get communicated properly resulting in tasks not getting done and sometimes team members being held accountable.(myself included) Today, I'm finding there are times that management is a little unrealistic in their expectations of team members getting things completed. Sometimes they would give one person too many tasks on a super busy day customer wise. On positive side I did find it a fun place to work. The co-workers were fun to joke around with and talk to. I also enjoyed making the customers leave the store satisfied."
good,"I loved working for target. Their managment were fair. And i was always busy, from stocking or unloading trucks. Coworkers were accepting and willing to help."
good,"Target is really a chill place to work. Working Service Desk was really good and easy unless you got the rude ones. Other than trying to get red cards, the co workers there was the best."
good,The externship was nice. I learned the work in the pharmacy field for a short time. The paced was good and the work is fun. The manager was always there and was proficient in the career.
good,"I think it is nice working with guests especially when you can relate to them, but depending on the area of target, there can be some nasty people in there, attitude wise or just people out to get their money."
good,Overall a very good work environment. The coworkers and management were very friendly and helpful . I really wish this particular job position was more then a seasonal / temporary opportunity
good,the employees were all overworked  you would expect conflicts between all. the managers were very hard workers and sometimes expected others to do their work.
good,i thought i would retire from Target but it changed 2 years after I started.  It is now CVS Pharmacy so I can't rate it fairly to be honest.  i am not surprised at the change.
good,Friendly staff and leaders.Flexible hours.Occasionally receive recognition for your hard work and contribution to the ccompany.Most projects require teamwork.
good,"It is a fun and safe place to work, but it has its bad moments at time, I do feel like I get under paid for the amount of work I am doing, and I wish it was a little different in that sense."
good,This job taught me a lot about the retail industry. I only had a problem with the manager over my department. But overall this company is great and a good leaning experience for beginner.
good,Its great to learn about how other people think. I felt if you were not well liked you did not get ahead despite the fact that you worked hard. Overall fun experience. I truly cared for the team.
good,A typical day at work is getting to work early and making sure the front registers are stocked and organized. Making sure there are bags and register paper to last the shift. I learned how to separate the items according to their uses. Management was very observing and their communication is great. The hardest part of the job I think is memorizing all of the functions of the buttons. The most enjoyable part of the job is it's super easy and there really isn't many ways you can mess up.
good,"I had a great time at Target, however I was laid off for an arbitrary reason. I had a great relationship with a majority of my leads, HR, and customers."
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with but the life of retail is no fun. Work/Life balance is poor. Expectations are unrealistic, and change so often that it is difficult to keep up."
good,The staff was very frendly and everyone wirked as a team. $10 per hour is also a pretty good starting pay for retail. Target is a very clean store  and an easy place to work.
good,"I enjoyed working here but there were times it was hard and where I felt, as a worker, wasn't heard or even taken to consideration.  However, the team members at the store I worked in made it more worth while even when the managers weren't all that helpful."
good,Typical day at Target would be going in to work at 3:00am and checking email. Then let the team of 20 to 30 team members unload the truck . Total end to end logistics operations .
good,"The management is good at Target. I have learned so many new techniques on how to not only make drinks, but different ingredients you can add to make it taste better for the guest. The workplace at Starbucks inside of Target is busy, yet relaxing to enjoy a cup of coffee and interacting with guests on a daily basis. The hardest part about this job can be when it's busy and having a handful of drinks to make, or when closing and having to wash everything alone. Overall, the experiences here have been outstanding and the job skills that I have learned over the time of being at Target and Starbucks."
good,I loved working with the team that I had there! They made it fun and it felt like family. I like that they did a lot of things within the community and had fun days that they did at work.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Target, the wonderful team members and team leads. It was definitely a great experience working there. I would love for the opportunity to work with Target again in the future."
good,"typical day at work at target Most of the time you come in and you stand in one place for a little more the 4 hours before you leave from your shift. What I learned is being a cashier. Management is okay there, they need nicer people. The hardest part of the job is being able to use the restroom. The most enjoyable part of the job was going home."
good,Working at Target my shift was early in the morning and was able to get more hours by learning different departments.  My position was very physical and worked at a fast past.
good,Great job to start at if you have no job experience. Managers are willing to help you if you need assistance in anything to through your your work day
good,Overall the experience was great. I was taught and I learned so many things about customer service and retail. It was a great challenge for me to experience so many personalities. i would recommend that everyone should work in retail at least one time in their life.
good,Perfect Job for part-time and full-time. There are always hours to pick up in any department. Depending on the time of year work can be very slow or it can be hectic and before you know it your shifts over.
good,Target is a great place to work and learn. I have worked and trained at over 5 store in two states and it is important to work at a store with a great culture. There is always room to grow at Target. Pay is not great for the amount of work regular sales floor employees do.
good,"fast pace, nice house, decent mangament, depending whatshift you take, you get the whole week off, they pay is good to start as well as benefits, nice company"
good,"its like being in highschool again "
good,"Target was a good place to work. Good atmosphere, friendly management. Benefits are standard for this type of company.  Can get boring at times. Heavily involve in customer service."
good,Target provided me a strong foundation of skills for my later career but was cutthroat in its turnover and had offered little opportunity to balance work and social life.
good,"My immediate manager was like working for a roller coaster, up & down. Sometimes she was easy-going & a joy to work with, but then there were the days she would come in after having more than a few drinks the night before & she was almost intolerable to work with or be around. Our manager above her, however, was awesome."
good,The position was great and the hours was good some people are great to work with but the management really sucks. Some of them do not know how to treat their workers
good,"Can be a fun work environment depending on your co-workers and management. "
good,im not really interested in doing a review of target. sometimes i hate it some times i love it.   my co workers are great my supervisors are pretty nice but a lot of our customers are rude uppity mid/upper class people who often talk down to us and act as if we are their personal verbal punching bags.
good,"A typical day at work consists of  greeting and assisting guests , driving sales, organizing displays, and managing inventory. I have learned to be an integral part of a team. Management has the employees and guests best interest at heart, along with an open door policy if you ever have any questions or need anything clarified. In addition to career advancement. Target has a diverse and friendly workplace culture. The hardest part of the job involves managing your time properly.   Great atmosphere as it relates to employees knowledge of products, and environment created to enhance guests overall shopping experience."
good,Working at Target while I was in high school help me learn how to manage my time and being the process of learning how to balance work and life. Good place to build up customer service skills and working with the general public.
good,This was my very first job since high school and I loved it ! Except for the manager switching here & there it was a good store to work at. We did a lot of community work to help children schools and I loved To see those children's face
good,"I was  pregnant when I worked there and it wasn't as stressful as I expected. They teach you different fields to work in not just the one you apply for so you get a little but more experience. Nice co workers and managers, strict when needed. I didn't stay long so not sure about the benefits really."
good,"Good place to work for a short term experience, not the environment I would want for a career. It is a very competitive environment, and teaches you to always look for ways to improve your production."
good,At the time the job was seasonal but there were opportunities to be hired directly through the company. I enjoyed working there it was a comfortable environment.
good,My experience with target corporation was definetly a learning experience. I learned about  cash handling.  I learned how to communicate and problem solve with so many different people. I helped them with all there store needs. I looked forward to seeing all the familiar faces on every scheduled shift. Over the 10 years I literally watched children of families grow up to pre-teen and teenagers.
good,"Works well with personal schedule. Gives decent hours and pay. Utilized opportunities to cross-train workers, such as; cashiers, backroom, salesfloor."
good,"During my time at the Boulder Target I experienced quite a lot. Starting as a cashier and cart attendant I was quickly promoted to a frond end manager then moved to assets protection. Both of these were stressful at times and almost always required a large amount of oversight by higher up managers. As a large corporation, Target does a good job of laying out job requirements although should have greater trust in reliable employees. Alongside this, Target should invest greater in their assets protection. Toward the end of my working at Target, the philosophy turned from protecting store merchandise and preventing theft to minor deterrent procedures and a guest focused mindset. Although this encourages Targets atmosphere, it takes weight off the penalties of stealing from the company and in my opinion makes Target seem compliant with theft."
good,"Liked to work at Target pharmacy since I was able to perform and exercise all professional knowledge with strict company guideline."
good,"All the Team Members treat each other like family and get along well."
good,Great place for children but the staff is great on the outside but others are childish and everyone wants to in charge. There are no benefits and drama will be included
good,I was a seasonal cashier so I was not there for very long. However the time that I did spend there was pretty fun. It was a lot of standing on your feet which was to be expected. The people were fun to work with.
good,"My experience at target was not what I expected, working their was fun but stressful at times do to unrealistic deadlines. A lot of the leads seem to over work the team members, team members are underpaid. It's a good starting job for someone with no experience but only as a first job."
good,"Cashiering at target was a pretty relaxed job, besides meeting your red card goal. You just stay in your area and make sure its clean and organized. You come across a lot of people some negative and some positive but it teaches you how to deal with it."
good,Target is a good company to work for if you are wanting to work in a good cultured retail environment. I found several opportunities to advance and had good guidance through my learning of skills and experience within the company .
good,"great team members , some managers, good discounts, pay could be better, would go back if they needed help. great for going to school hour wise and if you have kids."
good,"Working at Target was great but I could never get a good work schedule going around my school schedule no matter how many times I informed management and HR in person. Overall the job I did was more work than what was actually needed but I enjoyed it still because it kept me busy. I'd recommend working at Target for a first time job no problem, anymore than that, I'd say explore your options. These opinions are all based upon my own personal work experience and Store #2115 and their management at this specific retail store and nothing more."
good,"Typical day~Unpacking and stocking merchandise to the floor, guest service, setting planograms, price changes."
good,"Very enjoyable and fun environment, love the culture and the brand it holds. I learned a lot about providing great customer service and being flexible with assisting with the need of others."
good,"This is a great company to grow in, but you have to be very adaptable to change as the needs and direction of the business are constantly changing. Depending on the geographical area that you work in you will have to always move at a fast pace and exercise lots of patience."
good,"Typical day at work is stressful ."
good,"Working in electronics and toys is fun for me, it's always changing and adapting to the new trends. It's hard to get bored when there's always new technology to learn about and sell."
good,"Working at Target taught me how to keep up with a fast-paced and demanding job.  Although I did not particularly enjoy the workplace, most of the people I worked with were friendly and welcoming.  Overall, I would not recommend a friend to work here due to the low compensation for the amount of work done."
good,Ok place to work. I learned how to work with others and preform my job well. Enjoyed being able to focus on my own task. Poor management in regards to dealing with workers.
good,"The company culture is great, everyone is supportive of each other and keeps things professional. Team leaders take care to know each and every team member and work itself isn't bad. However if you wanted a career out of it I suggest looking elsewhere or at least not a sales floor position"
good,Working at Target was like a love and hate relationship. I enjoyed working with my co-workers and getting paid but I didn't like the disrespect from higher ups.
good,productive and fast paced. working at the Starbucks in target is a great job and keeps your mind and hands busy. very fast paced and demanding job. managers were great and understanding.
good,Target was very flexible with scheduling while I was in college. Target needs to realize that pushing the best employees to the breaking point is not a good way to motivate. The hardest part of the job was pleasing guest just like any other retail job. I enjoyed working with the people around me.
good,Working at target was mainly a fast pace job. great management would help me help when I was new to the job and even if I had any questions they were only a few feet away always willing to help with any questions I had. I learned how to handle money and credit/debit cards also learned how to do refunds and to do wic government checks... The hardest part of the job was learning the new skills that I would need to learn.
good,I loved workin at target i like to meet new people an thats the kind of place for that. Co workers are nice everyone got along we help out one another . Like with red cards at first its hard to do just bout everyother person goin to tell you no so you stop tryin but theres a method i learned is everyone loves to save money why not save alot more with a target red card. If i could go back i would
good,So i worked with Target for a few months. Started working here just before the Holidays. After they were over management decided to let me go. For what reason? I still don't know and understand today. The workplace was great and customers were always super nice and I thought i was the same way towards them and the staff.
good,"Target is a fine place to temporarily work, though unless you are planning to become a Team Lead your chances of actually advancing are slim to none.  Your average team member is not going to do anything besides that, even if they change departments."
good,"overall, the job is fine but they cut your hours to where you are not eligible for benefits. They will cut your shift and then call you to come in to work a shift because they don't have enough employees."
good,Work weeks are 50+ hour work weeks. It really caters to the executives on how well the culture is in your department. Executives aren't guaranteed to be off for holidays.
good,"Target really gave me a good start to an actual job. It provided me with skills that will last me a lifetime. The one thing it lacked was instruction, no one was really advised on how to do your job you were just supposed to figure it out yourself. I feel as if the instruction should overall be better if i had been instructed but at the same time teaching myself turned me into more of a problem solver."
good,"If you work in a busy store, you'll have to expect things that are outside the scope of what your original expectations. Flexibility is the key to success, and you'll do well if you can keep yourself on your toes, and give assistance where needed. Also be mindful of the three F's, Fast, Fun and Friendly. They're all pretty important, but keeping a balance of the three is essential."
good,The overall experience was positive. The flexibility I was given with this part time job gave me the chance to have a second job. Is basically the same thing as Walmart.
good,"Working at target was fun. We had a grill out once. They tend to forget to enjoy their workers. They can be hard on you, but its because they want you to succeed."
good,"A typical day working is an fast past, positive experience. Socializing with quest and making sure that they have a nice shopping experience at target."
good,"It is a good place to work."
good,"Each day varies from the next. Some days are slow and others you barely have time to breath. It just depends on the day. Overall it is a good place to work, great team members, guests are usually very friendly, work is straight forward. Sometimes management can be oblivious to actual workload. But they do their best to work with your schedule."
good,"At first, I didn't think I was going to to able to get used to how things worked wth Target. It was so much different than when I was working with Stein Mart. One of the things was waking up real early to start work. Through time, I manage to make a schedule throughout the week when I work so my body and mind will always be prepared."
good,Target is always open to developing its team members in the company. There are many positions you are able to apply for and it is open to anyone that qualifies.
good,Overall I liked being able to work in different departments and not getting stuck in one particular area of the store. Pay was kind of low Management did care about your life and was very involved.
good,work was pretty much repetitive and simple. management was good; willing to work with you if you needed to take some last minute time off. probably the 'hardest' part of work was working with coworkers because some of them didnt do their job and it affected your own numbers sometimes
good,"Traget has created a world class brand and a culture of praise and accomplishment for it's team members.  You feel appreciated when you work hard. "
good,"The experiences gained from working for this company were no less than life changing. The pay was sufficient for myself, for the most part, but others had more success. Being that I only worked for Target for a little over three months, I can safely say I'd never work for them again. The physical strain of the holidays was filled with waves of telling myself repeatedly, ""it pays more than my last job"". If you're young, and can handle a little bit of lifting for a few hours a day, then this job would be good for you to start off in. However I would highly recommend you either try to get promoted quickly, or move on to a job with better advancement for newer members."
good,"I was unfortunately hired as a seasonal cashie and I had little to no room to advance. The benefits were thus limited based upon my position. However the people, both management and guest, were enjoyable."
good,Had a great time working with great people. Was very customer service oriented. Managers kinda screwed up the chemistry and I have heard it operates much differently since i worked there.
good,The work days seemed long but the workers are ver focused and very polite. There was and equal amount of effort put in the work from everyone and everyone as very professional. Managements could have done a better job with communication.
good,"They had extremely flexible hours. the pay was decent, and the managers were nice. I personally like to be cross trained to other sections within my department in any job that i have and target was good about allowing me to do that."
good,Lots of hours in a building that is in a turn around situation.  Lots of responsibility given to young leaders is a plus.  Expectations and goals often unrealistic based on the tools given.
good,Good place to work with friendly co-workers and managers. Good communications and work place with a lot of growth potential when working with them. Has a lot benefits when they offer to their employees.
good,"Target is a job that is stable,worthwhile,and a great place to get started in the workforce. Unfortunately a workplace comes with a fair amount of stress so this particular job can be quite stressful at times but fair"
good,"Was a fun company to work with"
good,"If your looking to move around and have multiple task, this is the job for you. The atmosphere is different its very slow out there but once you get customers they are everywhere. Overall a great place to work if your in school."
good,"Helped ring up customers groceries, clothing, and toys. Learned great social skills while working. Management was iffy some days but otherwise good. Usually clean registers and a nice break room. Hardest part of the job was the amount of constant changes. I did enjoy engaging with customers and joking around with co-workers."
good,"I was cross trained in many positions at my job because my managers felt that I was ready to hold more responsibility. I worked mostly on the sales floor helping guests, answering phones and stocking the merchandise. I also was a cashier and learned about helping to bring clarity during confusion and time efficiency."
good,Takes time to get used to it but it gets to the point where the backroom is a massive mess and employees will leave stuff wherever. The hours a flexible but there is a major slow period after the holidays so expect to get your hours cut after the holidays. lots of people call out sick or don't show up period.
good,"This company is a great company for somebody seeking their first job, In my experience they are very helpful and friendly, If i was only looking for a part time job i would definately go back."
good,"Sometimes frustrating when they don't replace others causing more mess."
good,Wharehouse qhen the truck came we took items off to assembly line. Seperate items to work them on shelves before the store open. Work backstock and also helped with customers.
good,What I Learned at was my customer services and fast paste  working I also learn how to run a resister also using a PDA  helping guest   with there shopping as in trying to make there shopping a lot easier and making them feel welcome
good,Use forklift to load and unload supplies to trucks. Verify and  inventory all incoming and outgoing merchandise that enters the warehouse for accuracy.
good,"Constantly working, not much time to stall. Three breaks every 8 hours but given a lot of responsibility for such a low starting wage. Long weird work shift hours."
good,"had no issues with working here. great management, great peers. great environment. rather lacking on the ability to progress in the company though. worked here for several years and didn't have a bad time. larger stores are often more exciting and interesting to work at. super targets have more opportunities and hours versus regular targets."
good,"I have got to make new friends but I am currently in year 12 and I have been getting a fair few shifts so I can hardly get any of my school work done. The management are really nice and kind, and the staff are really kind and give a helping hand to anyone"
good,In the past 8 years I have met people who I have been fortunate enough to have built personal relationships with. Both co-workers and guests. I have also met some who have known famous people. That has been neat.
good,Great first job to gain experience and learn how to mange and lead a team. Very political environment where if you know the right people you with be promoted but if you don't you will be stuck in the same position for a long time.
good,I've been doing this kind of work since I was a teen and I enjoy it. Target as a company is a very productive company as far as providing product and opportunity. I work overnights and at this point of my life its taking a toll on me physically and with my life with my family. I enjoy the work I do and the feeling I get when everything gets done right but I need to get something more convenient that I can live with my family as well.
good,Target promotes a great TEAM atmosphere! Benefits are excellent. Advancement opportunities are plentiful. The real draw back is that they tend to hire ETL positions straight from college. This means employees with vast experience are training their own bosses how to do their job. Usually the college hires have zero experience in the retail industry let alone Executive Management experience at a Big Box level store.
good,Coworkers are great but the management changes to often and are outside hires with little to no retail experience. Due to them having the lack of experience managing people they come across as talking down to the lower level team members.
good,This was my very first actual job. I enjoyed it for the most part. Management was iffy. Felt like they were more trying to be your friend than your boss. Trying a little too hard. Not very professional in my opinion.
good,unloading the truck was the hardest part of the job. going on to the floor to stock the shelves was a breeze. we would listen to music to get us motivated.
good,"I worked here while it was in Canada and would still be there today if it didn't close down. The company provided a great starting salary, yearly bonus and the choice to work overtime. Management were great leaders and the company was very supportive of there staff."
good,this target is located next to a mall and we are always short staffed. days are always very stressful and at the service desk not many people are trained so it gets very hard to get the many stuff they want done
good,Was a wonderful place to work. Very fast paced environment and decent training for all specialized areas. Great hours and available shifts. Expect random freight types day to day as well as the amount of freight you'll receive throughout the year.
good,"multitasking skills learned"
good,"I enjoyed the atmosphere and the ""Fast, Fun, and Friendly"" motto. They encouraged team development and collaboration. They allowed for a flexible schedule and work variety."
good,"A typical day would consist of unloading trucks and stocking merchandise onto sales floor. In working at Target, I've learned time management and communication are very important among Team members, Team Leaders, and ETLs. Management is great as long as communication is solidify. Management quickly responds and resolves issues. The hardest part of the job would be unloading the trucks on heavy days, which could become overwhelming at times, especially when merchandise are still expected to be stocked on sales floor during shift. The most enjoyable part of the job is the environment. Being a team flow member means that a team member does not solely work in one environment. Therefore, one may not be required to work in the same department every day."
good,"Working at Target gives you plenty of opportunities to excel in different areas of your personal skills. It is a very solid company to work for, the only thing is that you need to pick a job that you will like otherwise you will begin to dislike working there."
good,Good working condition. Supervisor helpful and easy to work with. Stay busy from the moment you start work to time to leave. Learned process from Truck unload to staging products to pushing products. Also worked with guests as they shopped.
good,This is a good place to work temporarily. They do work around school schedule and co-workers are friendly. At Target you will always have something  new to do
good,"Fun environment. Coworkers are very nice. Management can be stressful. Always on your feet, and assisting guests is top priority. Down-time is non-existent."
good,"I would like to work with friendly, strong leaders in a great work environment, where there is room to grow. I am a full time student and am willing to work hard.  I am a fast learner and great listener."
good,"the environment is efficient and everyone really tries to make the customers feel good.  the sales system kept everything really streamlined, even if there was a problem or concern to be handled.  Although the policies is strict it keeps everything in line. as a cashier i really just aided customers in their shopping needs, or helped them set up a red card. otherwise it was just plain old cashiering."
good,"The most enjoyable part is the team you work with."
good,"I loved working for Target. Target provided me with 5  great years of growth, and 4 of those years were in a supervisor position. If you aren't there to make it your life, then you may not last."
good,typical day at work would be stocking shelves an assisting customer to find what they need management was very laid back an helpful workplace was very chill worked with some really cool people the hardest thing was working on the holidays most enjoyable thing was meeting new people
good,"Working at Target was something new to me because it was my first job I ever had. I worked as a cashier; I was afraid to handle money, but I got used to it. A regular day at work would mostly be busy, and at first it was tiring. One of the hardest parts about the job was that not every customer was nice, but I have patience. What I enjoyed about the job was being able to learn something new that I have never been around."
good,"I liked the job, but the hours and work isn't for everyone. I worked there for a little while. And I loved the pay but, working there is kind of stressful"
good,"Days are fine, i learned patience and time management. The management is somewhat poor with little to no communication. hardest part is dealing with miscommunication. The most enjoyable part is being able to help guests."
good,"Shifts always move on real fast because you are always up to something. Working at Target helped me manage time better ,in the sense that, I had to perform various task and also help out guest in a limited amount of time. Has it was my first job in the United States, it was really enlightening and helped my communication skill people."
good,fun environment. easiest part is the job assignment. the hardest part is dealing with rude customers. but as long as you keep a positive attitude your day will still be great.
good,"I have been working at target for about 3 months now and the flow is productive, continuously transparent. The work is hard yet the culture is positive. I am proud to be apart of the organisation."
good,"When I first started I thought I would only stay seasonally. Then I saltarted to like it and some of the people too. It's always busy, but we manage to get through it"
good,working for target is a decent job to put you through college. it was always something to do to keep you busy and past the time.
good,It was a very dynamic and diverse environment. I liked pretty much all of my co workers and never had any bad encounters with customers or my co workers/
good,"Everyone is entirely hard on you, as a cashier and otherwise, about obtaining guests to sign up for red cards. I was one of the best ones there as far as my speed, my vibe, and even red cards! And they were still SO pushy about it."
good,Management and co workers were friendly and helpful. I worked there during the Christmas season so the store was quite busy but which is nice so the day doesn't drag.
good,Target was very good at providing hours to anyone who needed them. The co workers were very fun to work with and the target team was very hard working.
good,"A typical day at work is coming in clocking in either you are a cashier kr cart attendant. Overall its a good job just really poor management, the work load isn't to bad either."
good,"I worked in the deli. I was responsible for slicing meat and cheese, cooking hot and ready foods, setting up wraps, salads and snack boxes and refilling cold cases. I had to maintain the quality of items in my department and check items daily."
good,"Management Team is helpful, human, reasonable, and is more encouraging than critical.  Team members range from super helpful to completely useless during the holiday season.  The weak are cut off quickly though.  More often than not, your team lead will back your decisions unless your a clear psycho path and a danger to your self or others.   Communication is everything in Target.  "
good,Its a great company to work for and also they pay well. I was able to work with people I knew plus they had great management. They work was hard but it was well worth it .
good,"Opportunity to serve customers/guests and learn how to work fast and friendly in a sometimes stressful environment. Good job for getting into different areas, and good job advancement inside the company."
good,"Lot's of meetings."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is the part where (other than black Friday) that I work not just at one spot the whole day. Some days of course I have to primarily where they need me to be but, I like doing different things effectively with helping the customers at our stores. Like if I'm suppose to be doing cashier and we have enough cashier but not enough staff at customer service then I am brought there to help."
good,"Target Logistics is a overnight job that requires a team of 30 team members to unload at least one sometimes 2 53"" trucks a night.  It is very fast paced"
good,"Fun experience overall"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing I did my best. For me a typical day is working fast for 12hrs.a day. I have learned a lot about working in a warehouse. Learning about labels. How to pick product.
good,Target was an awsome experience. Everyone works as a team to make sure the job gets done. I enjoyed working with people and the target team being a barista was alot of fun
good,"I had a wonderful experience and learned a lot. I gained a lot of new knowledge and learned a lot of new things.   I learned how to set up and takes down Pogs and adjencies, pull and put back from the back room and much more.  I make new friends and also learned a new Point of Service on the register. The management was like a revolving g door so it was very hard to get use to and I was working all the time.  I did not have a solid schedule and always got called in extra which made making personal plans hard.  The most enjoyable part was meeting new people and helping our guests with their questions and problems throughout the store."
good,I enjoyed my time working as a Target employee. I felt the training and work environment were great. The company has an excellent brand and good marketing.
good,I learned a lot about retail while working at Target. I enjoyed the fast pace. I really liked that all team leaders were very understanding and scheduling was very flexible
good,"Hired out of college to be an ETL (assistant store manager). Very intense training, and information overload for 6 weeks. Expected to perform and manage every single day. Weekends, holidays, overnight, early morning shifts are all fair game. Expected to work on average 50 hours/ week (but it's a salaries position so you will probably work more). Promoting is difficult. It's highly political so superior relationships with those above your boss are a necessity. It's a great position for someone looking for a lot of on hand management experience. However, it's retail, it's a lot of managing damage control, cleaning up after others (call-ins, actual mess on the sales floor). Not very rewarding."
good,Be prepared to change direction on tasks quickly. A great opportunity for someone who likes to think on your feet and communicate your opinion. The ability to look for resolution to guest concerns is a must. Being able to do so within company guidelines.
good,When a truck came in you had to be ready to unload merchandise at 4:00AM.  Place merchandise on pallets in accordance with the proper location. Go to the floor and replenish shelves with the merchandise.  Once shelves have been replenish overflow will be taken to the stockroom.  Management was easy to work with and co-workers were easy to work with.  The hardest part of the job was the inconstancy of working hours but it was a rewarding experience.
good,"Technically Advanced projects, always one step ahead in understanding real world scenarios and solutions to the problems. Great opportunity to explore new technologies and tools. No limitation to learning"
good,I worked at Target during the holiday season. It really got  me ready for my future retail holiday times. I worked as a cashier and a customer service rep. I learned how to deal with customers in person as well as over the phone.
good,"It is a good place to work, hours sometimes change each week the benefits are great with the company. i enjoy working with the costumers"
good,"I really enjoyed my time working for Target. I learned more about the business and customer service skills. My managers were great and always pushing me to better myself and I could communicate with them well. I also had great co-workers where it felt like a family. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to see my coworkers that I formed friendships with. The hardest part of the job was how stressful it could be,at least in the Pharmacy. Target also doesn't offer great benefits for part time employees and that is really my only complaint."
good,"A typical day at work is exhausting after pushing carts, chasing them and sweating. I've learned that it takes energy and patience to overcome the obstacles when dealing with certain situations. The management in my store can be better if more employees got trained in other positions. My co-workers are helpful and friendly to the guest. The hardest part of my job is helping out by hopping on the check lanes while people are coming in grabbing carts because I have to go out and replace the row of carts. What I like about my job is that I can come inside and outside of the building and still do my work"
good,OK Place to work. Coworkers are great however managerial staff needs better communication. Constant transition of jobs and task on a day to day basis. The company provides great benefits such as health care and 401k
good,This was a basic job for for me when I was in high school. I was cross trained in various different departments and able to have a long job history through changing departments.
good,Positive Environment but difficult to grow in company if you're successful where you are currently at which causes friction at times
good,Working at Target was a great experience for me.  I learned a lot regarding pricing and data entry.  I enjoyed working the my co-workers made some great friends.
good,"A typical day of work was nice and productive given that the focus of your job was handling your responsibilities. I realize it is important to manage working relationships with peers but often daily chores suffered because of social indulgences. Management and human resources failed to properly resolve a few necessary issues, leaving it to dissolve into possible conflicts. However, daily work keeps one busy and is mostly recognized favorably. The hardest part of the job is maintaining momentum for those who work 32-40 hours per week."
good,Interesting work environment for those willing to work hard and have the patients for customers. Fair retail environment with a lot of diversity.
good,"I did enjoy my time at target. For the most part, the people were friendly, and management was easy to work with. The problem comes when you have management who is less than honest, which is why I eventually had to leave. I won't include details, because that person is no longer there. It was, in my experience, a good job for a single person, or someone with no children. The time constraints of being a parent, especially a single parent, and working there were not compatible in my experience."
good,Typical retail company. Decent benefits and work life balance. Upward promotions are possible if you play the politics correctly.
good,"hard work, fast paced company. compensation is well as well as benefits. Long hours and lots of overtime to be used. Can be stressful but fun at the same time. Needs more room for growing within. Management could be better."
good,The tasks were very easy and the night time were generally quiet and relaxed. The pay was biweekly and the breaks were 15 minutes which was pretty nice. The people were nice and good.
good,"The managers would change rules and routines that employees counted on."
good,"While I haven't worked at Wal-Mart I have had friends who have and by all accounts Target is better.  I left during a major organizational change so the score I gave management and job culture may be a bit unfair, however it was stressful for most employees and management.  I felt that management had great intentions to do right by its people however the execution was probably leaving room for improvement.  I would say that the review process needs work for pay raises, they would not assess your actual performance in all cases because they were restricted to giving out only a certain number of high scores, so even if you met your performance goals and expectations it could be challenging to get great reviews if your peers were also good.  Culture was another issue simply due to the fact that many employees had apathy towards improving their performance and motivational mechanisms were lacking to encourage improvement.  However as I stated before, the company was in a major organizational transformation when I left and may not be the same way now, all in all it wasn't a waste of time and there are some really good people working there."
good,"The best part of the job is getting to work different posts so the duties change.  The worst part is being on call 24/7 and not always getting time off.  I work alone most of the time but when I work with co-workers we have good teamwork."
good,"Target was a great place to work for 8 of the 11 years I was there. the last 3 were a bit rough. I watched many team leads come and go, as well as several executive store managers over that time span. The 3rd shift was usually fun and laid back, which was great for me because it allowed me to be home during the day in case my son needed me and during the early evening as well. I was able to see him through preschool, elementary, middle school and start him off into high school. Get him to sleep the head off to work, be home just in time to get him off to school in the morning."
good,For me the hardest part of the job was not being able to multitask. Zoinng an area and back stocking the items back in there place. But as I worked there for a few months I started getting the hang of things.
good,"Was a good job. Hardest part about it was the 36 hour work week in only three days. Good salary, but the benefits are too difficult to earn."
good,"My fellow coworkers were very friendly and helpful when I needed help and having been great to talk with while working and on breaks."
good,"I loved this job for 5 years. When they decided to let a computer decide our schedules and work areas (eliminating set schedules and often being scheduled 8-12 hours a week), things just weren't the same. And after multiple attempts to move up with responses of ""that position has been eliminated, etc."" I faced the fact I was never going to move up."
good,It is a fun and loving workplace with opportunities to advance into other areas.  The company also balances your work and school so you are able to spend time with your family. My co-workers are people who worked together as a team to make it happen at work coming in everyday with a great attitude for the day.  The hardest part of the job was to please customers whereby not everyone will really appreciate but you still have to put the customer first and make sure he/she leaves happy and is able to come back again.  The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting different people everyday and interacting with them and knowing more about them.  The target I worked for is surrounded by hotels and is near Disneyland so you can imagine the kind of guests we had.  People from all over the world. It is fun a and loving place to work.
good,"this was a seasonal job and i was offered a lot of hours and happily took them, all the staff were friendly and my manager was awesome. He gave me the choice first to get more hours and i gladly appreciated that."
good,"Target is constantly searching for that one ""thing"" to move to the next level. "
good,Great at being flexible with you but do not provide hours all year around. easy job can be fun but hours are based on sales.
good,"Work would be repetitive, I was in charged of the Personal Care & Beauty department. I would manage all incoming packages, shipping, returns, and damaged packaging. The most difficult task for this job was making sure every aisle of my department was up too date and I always had extra products in the backroom. The work environment was very friendly, my co-workers were reliable. The most enjoyable part of this job was having guests come back to the store and ask for my assistance for their shopping."
good,Training was non existent but you will be held to a standard.If you stand up for yourself you will be treated as a trouble maker.
good,"Very fast paced, have to multi-tasked, have to deal with rude guest in person and over the phone. A lot of changes in the company in the past year too."
good,Our per hour rating is not acceptable to what we do for the company. It must be a dollar above minimum wage or more because our job requires a lot of physical and emotional work that contribute to huge effects in our daily lives.
good,I really enjoyed working in Target with a great team leader as I also loved working with a team in that fast challenging environment.
good,want you to finish clean the whole store in less then 5 min. management doesn't really have a clue whats going on! no change of advancement in comany!
good,Working for target has been an experience i really like the work place and the people i work with the down side is some of the people who come in can be a little rude at times.
good,great company. kinda slow for advancement. and the pay was not the greatest. Great entry level comapny to learn and gain experience
good,"Good place for advancement and nice people to work with. I think at a lower level it is enjoyable because you don't have to deal with the constant politics. There is clear favoritism in the company, and they will exploit the fact that you can work longs hours. There is little work life balance even though they say that's what they want for you, but instead they insist that you do what it takes to get the job done; that being you giving your free time to them."
good,Typical cashier job. Like the diversity. But the lack of hours wasn't worth it. The pay should be at least ten an hr. Hardest part was standing.
good,"Fast paced work environment with non-stop movement, as well as a helping hands when needed. Very black and white system with quality and productivity expecatations"
good,It was a real good place to work and the co-workers were good to be around.  Made friendships there.  The hardest part of the job was when they had me assemble bicycles.  It was in a back room so I was kind of cut off from the public.  The most enjoyable part was the feeling of accomplishment whenever I put a bike out on the sales floor and see the happy faces on the kids when they saw them.
good,"Working for Target is a good first job to have and the tasks are fairly easy. At times, restocking the shelves can be a little bit tedious but, you can finish if you pace yourself."
good,"Target was a great place to work. They try to work with your availability. Most long term employees feel under-appreciated. Too much pressure to ""make"" the numbers and not enough attention on guest services."
good,Pick and scan merchandise and drop off at various locations. Reinstate lost merchandise to the correct locations. Clean aisle where we worked last.
good,"The Experience I had with customer service was great, I got along with pretty much everyone I worked with and the way the breaks were split up made the day easier on you."
good,I really enjoyed my time working there until towards the end of my 3 years of being employed there. We had gone through 2 Store Managers and during those periods the store was in bad shape. The management is not what it used to be. It could be way worse but it's definitely not great.
good,"I had fun working at Target. Getting to know all of my fellow employees, and management. Good atmosphere and friendly customers."
good,"In my 10 years of working at Target, my days tend to vary due to the fact that I was always willing to learn something new. My typical day may include restocking and re-merchandising the sales floor. I've learned how to show great leadership skills under adverse conditions and serve every guest with a fast, fun, and friendly attitude. Overall, my co-worker worked together to turn over a great store every day. The harder part of my job was the unnecessary late night shift, especially while I was in college working to obtain a degree. The most enjoyable part of my job was having a great team who kept a positive attitude, no matter what."
good,It was a great place to learn on the job. My co-workers were heaven sent. I still talk to some of them to this day. The hardest part on the job would have to be having the other managers hovering plus your actual manager. Felt a bit like the movie Office Space. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to handle your own work load in a way. You get a stack of plano to work on and you handle it yourself unless it is a massive set up. It gives you confidence. The only thing that annoyed our team as a whole the most was being pulled to help another team when we were behind and then getting told we're behind or need to work faster.
good,"everyday learning something new , very good experience in both constriction field and MEP engineering and consultancy . every day a new working site and different kind of experience"
good,"As a Cart Attendant, you more or less do everything else in the store whenever it's required. Janitorial, Customer Service, Cashier, Hardlines, etc. You get a lot of training in a lot of departments. The people were amazing, the managers were wonderful, and it was just a great place to work."
good,"The days focus is to provide the best experience possible. "
good,"Loved working at Target, had switched from an analyst role to an engineer.  Title never changed to reflect my new responsibilities and got laid off 6 months later - as an analyst."
good,Target is a great company to begin your work experience. They teach you what you need to know and give you the tools to succeed.
good,"I learned a lot from working at target, not only about myself, but about running a company.  The management team is dedicated to making sure that everyone is working to their full potential.  The co workers were great to work with and learn from.  The most enjoyable part of the job, was seeing the store grow in sales and in brand."
good,Fun place to work got along well with everyone their.  A bit hard to try and move up if you are older they tend to go mostly with college age people to fill their store team lead postions
good,Great team of cashiers and management staff. Everyone was very helpful and the work environment was friendly and family oriented.
good,I would start at 4 am and unload the trucks till 6 am. Afterwards proceed to stock and manage the electronics section and help customers who were in need. The hardest part of the job was making the card board bails and getting them shipped out.
good,"The workforce did not take their job as seriously as I did so it was difficult to get a job done with no help.  I felt that I was working my hardest, while others slacked off"
good,Typical day would be interacting with guests and making drink orders as specified. I learned to adept to remembering guests names and specific drink orders to build a customer base. My coworkers are amazing and fun to work with.
good,"This is my current job. It Is located in between Ypsilanti and Ann Arbor, which is a very busy location. There is always work to do and never a dull moment. There is a great management team and they always make it easy to talk to them. They never shy away from helping you grow and improve within the company."
good,Loved the work practices. Loved the other employees they brought you I like family. I liked interacting with the guest. The hardest part of the job was standing for long period of times. It went by fast being you stay busy.
good,"A typical work day at Target for a flow team member starts once you punch in, you begin by unloading the boxed up products from the truck onto skids that will be pushed onto the sales floor. Once the truck is down all team members unpack products and place them in their correct spots on the shelves. Help make store presentable before store opening. Once the store has opened team members push products onto shelves from shopping carts until shift is over."
good,overall my experience working at target was great! I loved my pay & hours. but unfortunately school distance made me have to stop working at target. I would work here again.
good,"Overnight jobs suck because of how early we were up (4am.) But this job was probably one of the best I have had. Great people, Funny Management, 4 hours of work, and all we were asked of was to unload the truck then stock the items. Although it was hard work, it was a Great learning experience."
good,"Great place for someone looking for some extra pocket money. Not a great career. Pay is ok, but the hours are terrible. You are lucky if you get 30 hours a week during the summer months. The only time you are able to get 40 hours is during the holidays."
good,"I enjoyed working with my co-workers. I've made a lot of friends. I loved working in Starbucks because of how fast paced it was. I highly recommend that area. Plus, a lot of awesome people work there. Teamleads, L.O.D.'s, GTL, were very lazy, put work on their employees, took hour lunch breaks, now there were a few that were amazing! Drama at times. Most enjoyable part was free coffee!"
good,"As a first job, this isn't a bad place. From my first day there, I felt welcomed and got the hang of it quickly thanks to my trainer. There was always something to do, even when there was ""downtime."" My co-workers, with the exception of a select few and ones in other departments, were friendly and fun to work with. Most of them were willing to switch with you when you needed it, or they were willing to cover for you. Management worked with you when you couldn't make it in from time to time. There were times where they gave you a slight attitude for calling out or calling in late, and there were also times they weren't very willing to help in your search for coverage. The holidays were busy but they managed to keep everything very organized with the help of HR. Snacks and food were often in the back room for anyone's taking."
good,"I loved almost every aspect of working at target, I mean all retail jobs suck but the fondation this corperation has built is less stressful than a handful of other like-minded companys."
good,"Great place to work due to the positive atmosphere Target management provides. There is encouragement from team leaders to do the best possible work you can, and there is support if you need help getting there. However, despite the positive atmosphere and semi-paced job, it is hard to move past your position, or even move positions in general."
good,"A typical day as a presentation team member is fairly straight forward. Whether we are working independently, or less often, in a group, we start by de-merchandising an aisle or section. Then, we either make the small adjustments (as in a new product) or a complete overhaul (like setting Christmas); then we pull all of the new products from the backroom and stock them accordingly. Each new project comes with a small blueprint known as a planogram, which details where shelves and pegs go, what backer paper to use, and if there are any special fixtures. Additional duties include the usual retail ones like helping customers helping with checkout if there are too many people waiting."
good,"colleagues were very cooperative The hardest was loading and moving heavy loads. most enjoyable whenever staffing was optimal. management was not organized.typical day was stocking, restocking, loading and offloading, interaction with customerrs"
good,"A typical day at work when I was responsible for opening the food court was very fast paced and productive. There was always something to take care of, either  it was cleaning, organizing or preparing the food for the day. My co- workers were very nice and we always worked as a team."
good,"Good place to start working at. Great people to work with whether it is management, regular employees or guests. Sometimes stressful but nothing that you arent able to push through"
good,"Its a decent place to work after you have been in retail for a year or so. It can get very busy and very time comsuming, and that is not just cashiering either. Depending on the size of your store their is also resturaunts and a grocery department which make things even more difficult and busy depedning on the day. That pay isnt amazing but its more than minimum wage about $9 an hour for me and I had YEARS of experience."
good,"There are good and bad apples wherever you go. The morning meetings were like going to church, that is how they keep you cult like."
good,I liked working overnight when I could do it. I don't know the hiring process but there were a lot of characters but I enjoyed working with them. The hardest part on the job was waiting for the supply truck to be unloaded but once you started putting things where they needed to go everything went smooth.
good,fun work place with supportive management and  great discount. I enjoyed working with the great staff as they we always willing to lend a hand when needed.
good,The hardest part of this job was working with a co worker who hit me with boxes causing bodily injuries daily. Sprained my ankle by hitting me with a box. Cut me when I was using a box cutter she threw a box and hit the box I was opening and box cutter jumped and cut my thumb.
good,I look forward everyday to work with a great team of colleagues who genuinely appreciate working for a great company like Target. I love to assist our guests and help them in any way I can. I gives me great satisfaction knowing I am able to make a difference in someone's day.
good,"Fast paced work, with moderately high expectations. Safety oriented, however numbers are high on the list. Attention to detail is a must. Lots of politics."
good,"Good company, there is a bit of politics, but that is everywhere.  "
good,"I always enjoyed working at Target.  Great people, a team environment, and they allow you to have a great work-life balance."
good,"Cashiering is very tedious work, ring items, bag them, collect payment, give reciept. Management was helpful when you asked questions otherwise they left you to do your independent work. Co-workers were nice enough, a bit of drama here and there due to relationship being allowed in the work place. Hardest part were the extreme couponers while at the same time the easiest part was cleaning up the check out lanes."
good,target was pretty much a good place to work some times it was filler with alot of good folks and i liked it i just didnt enjoy the pay very much
good,"This was an interesting job. I enjoyed working with my coworkers, they often made the day go by a lot easier. The manager was very nice and made sure that all of her employees were having a good day at work"
good,Great place to work within a big company. Not the best in regards to monetary compensation but they do offer a great benefits package for those who are working more than 32 hours a week. They do also offer great perks as far as the holidays are concerned.
good,"Target used to be a place that focused on growth and development of each team member, but the longer I work there the more I see it is about numbers.  There is a lot of red tape, and it difficult to go to work at a place where you feel under-appreciated."
good,Managers are amazing and great place to work but very low hours. Managers are always on top of there duties. People working there are amazing and hard working.
good,Excellent employee training and fun to work. Employee support by other senior employees. Interesting phone calls sometimes. Helping customers with their credit accounts.
good,Target was a great experence and i would reccomed everybody to work there becuase they have amzing things on sale and great deals on everthing in the store.
good,Good learning experience about the retailing in different country. Dealing with the consumer on everyday basis. Got trained in every department.
good,"In the beginning Target was fast,fun and friendly for both the guests and employees. Over the past 2 years, that has changed. Making money to cover mistakes made by corporate has became the main concern. No longer a fun place to work, it is all business and self promoting by executives."
good,"You learn an honest days work here. If one shift is too hard on you (such as overnight stock for the disabled), you can opt for a different shift, or different position. This is a cut and dry retail work environment. Inventory is huge. Management is great, and so are benefits."
good,Good company to work for and learned a lot on being a great manager and boss.  Focus in on the team and not the task.  Would have stayed if it had been possible.
good,"Overall fun place to work. Consistently looking to develop leaders. Work schedule can be hectic, but decent overall work/life balance. Perfect for early career individuals"
good,"Good work life balance, fast fun and friendly culture, laid back, too many managers, currently undergoing org restructure and layoffs"
good,I thoroughly enjoyed the work environment and my co-workers. The team was great and the managers were mostly amazing. Sometimes unrealistic goals are set and expected to be met which can cause workplace stress. Plenty of room for advancement for hard workers and college grads.
good,Target was a great place to work I was able to learn a lot of the jobs there when It came to open positions. I moved up through the ranks by learning different position until I found the right place that I wanted to stay. learning all the different jobs was hard at first but once you get the hang of how to be a cashier or how to work the sales floor it sticks.
good,Target is a professional work environment . I enjoyed working for them. They take pride in keeping their store clean . They also have great benefits for all employees
good,"I absolutely enjoy working at Target, I have worked there for 3 years and still going. I am just looking for more of a set schedule and not have different shifts every week. The only downside to working for Target Pharmacy is the over head bosses are only worried about raising our scores and seem to be less concerned about the guest. Myself and other coworkers enjoy speaking with our guest that are frequent and have conversations with them. However, we have so many things to have the guest do and sign up for and push at them, we are pretty much just rushing the guest out of the store. My coworkers are simply amazing and we have a great team and great pharmacist that work their tail off."
good,"this was one of my favorite jobs, I got to interact with all types of people. I learned new things almost everyday, there where some employees that made my days even brighter."
good,"Target can either be a great or terrible place to work. Most of the experience is based on the people you work with. If someone else is slacking you have to pick up the pace and if you don't have lots of friends within target you will have a hard time. Mainly because you wont be able to take your breaks on time, get your shifts covered, or just get assistance when you need help."
good,Target is all about the rules. I started during the Christmas season so it was alot of work in a short amount of time. But management is always there to help and encourage and they are all about making things easy and fun. I love this employer!!
good,I enjoyed meeting new people there and my co workers were enjoyable. working there you grow mentally and physically. Most days were challenging than others but it wasn't anything that couldn't be accomplished.
good,This was a physically demanding job for a good company. Target cares about their employees but I feel most employees were not paid enough for their work done.
good,Needs more Communication with team members. More Flexibility with the hours provided.Needs to have flexibility with the team members on there red card goals.
good,they only bad thing i could say about this company is that the management was kinda bad!! and they would just hire in anyone pretty much.
good,"I enjoyed working for Target  mostly."
good,"A typical day at Target I would clock-in in the back room then check the schedule to see where I was assigned for the day. I would then head to my lane and sign into the computer. My co-workers were all friendly and helpful people, many of them being people I knew from school. They helped make my experience at Target much better. The hardest part of the job was when it got really slow and there was not much work to be done. That was rare, but it occasionally did happen. I liked that the work was generally easy and I was able to catch on quickly."
good,very nice place to grow and have new opportunities thrown to you. the  management was a little disorganized and scheduling was very hectic. the hardest part of the job would be dealing with rude people.
good,"Target was such a fun place to work. I made a ton of good friends there and learned a lot. Seeing as this was my first job, I learned how to prioritize my duties, work on a changing schedule. I, eventually, was trained in many different areas of the store."
good,"This company allowed me to have an exceptional experience. I do believe as a company they could of reviewed and worked more with individual employees. Overall, enjoyable work enviorment."
good,"A typical night at target consists of a long night with no AC, a few short breaks and management that's more to giving orders than being hands on and being a true part of the overnight crew. "
good,"Great place to work.  I stayed for 23 years so they must be doing something right!"
good,Target is a good place to work with a lot of best practices to manage your business. The company invest heavily in providing quality guest service. The hardest part of the job is working overnight.
good,Awesome company to work for! A lot of things to learn and I am able to cross train in some areas which made it a lot easier to get hours on my schedule. I enjoy working with all my team members and there is never a boring day at work.
good,"At HQ, work life balance is definitely achievable. Culture can be quite hierarchical but efforts are being made to change that aspect. Target has a great future ahead and it can be exciting to be part of a large corporation transformation."
good,"Always stayed busy, learned more about customer service and how to operate phones, learned a little bit about retail and management is great but they have their days too. And, although productive, it's also repetitive just like any other minimum wage job. Management provides food and drinks for us all the time in the break room, and they always get their job done. Co-workers are fun and make the job less boring on slow days. Once you get use to it, there's nothing really hard about the job, but if i had to name one, I would say when it's busy, you have to work fast. And the most enjoyable part of the job is co workers."
good,This is a great job for younger people during the summer and for people seeking a second job. It's physically repetitive but go by quickly due to the interactions between coworkers. Management is very loose and friendly but keeps you on task.
good,By working at Target I've learned more about the retail business from more of a management point of view.  All questions are answered by a manager pertaining to the company.
good,"It was a very good workplace to be at, meeting new people almost every single day. Working with coworkers was great, everyone respected and understood each other if we were having a bad day at work. Everyone talked to each other and had fun while we worked. Our management at target was very poor, each employee didn't feel like we were really being heard about some of the problems we had. They would go against or scheduling hours or they would switch hours that had already be up. Such as our Team Lead would assign us 8 hours to work and the managers would go in and change it without our approval..Hardest day about my job at target I would have to say would be dealing with our managers because some would talk to us very rude and disrespectful. Best part I enjoyed about working at target was talking with everyone, I never had any problem with any guest or employee in the store. I connected very well with everyone all the time, guest came in the store to basically come in and get or complain about some of the same things I or any other person would come in to get."
good,"Working at Target basic everyday you are a assigned a task and your are required to carry out your task for that day; for example if you are a cashier you are required to check out guest until the end of your shift. The jobs they give you are pretty straight forward and if all the employees do their jobs correctly, it keeps the store running smoothly.  I learned how to be prepared for anything and everything, I learned how to switch roles or do other task when instructed in an expeditious manner. Management was ok some didn't understand how to do their job, some didn't even know what their job required them to do. My co-workers were awesome they can keep a smile on your face. The hardest part of the job was doing someone else's job and yours at the same time. The most enjoyable part of the job was making guest smile by providing them with fast, fun, friendly service."
good,"Typical day was normally fast-pace, learning to balance duties with customer needs.  Good support from team leaders and manager."
good,"Set schedule is Monday thru Friday from 6am to 2:30pm"
good,Starting off at Target is a great place to work. You have so many opportunities to work hard and move up in the company. Within a year I was able to become a Department Manager. But mostly it just deals with it being a popularity contest. Which is never good for a work environment.
good,"The company is really strict on their fast fun and friendly policy. "
good,"Target is a great company to work for, however, the management team at my location needs to work on communication.  Work/life balance is only important when it is convenient."
good,"The job in itself wasn't bad, but I was unable to perform the job to the best of my abilities due to pregnancy and other issues at home.  I wish that I could have been able to leave in better standing."
good,Had new experience of Learning & Working . The management was also Good & helping in means of requirement. Had provided good Accommodation Facility with all daily necessary requirements.
good,I only work there for the holidays. The employees were nice and the work was hard but it was good for a first job. I don't have much to say since I didn't work there for too long. But overall it was great for a first time job.
good,unloading trucks and knowing the area the products go in is a great stockin experience being careful and recongizing where the items go doin everything that needs to be done rite away and gettin done at a certain time
good,The upper management wasn't the best and the salary as kin of low for the amount of work you are asked to do in a 12 hour shift.
good,"Great teamwork among team members and management.  We routinely answer guests' questions and assist them with their shopping needs. If there is a return of merchandise, we make it as fast and efficient as possible while keeping things organized and clean.  The hardest part of the job is when unique situations arise and have to involve management.  The most enjoyable is the people I work with.  We all strive our best to do our best.  Sometimes, it doesn't feel like we are stressing to achieve company goals, it just happens."
good,Target was honestly the best job I held other than volunteer work. But the manager at the time was very rude. She was also very unprofessional.
good,Its a very stressful job target needs to do more to recognize its emplyees wins the pay is decent but the fact that you work most holidays is not cool
good,It was a fun place to work only because the people around you tend to talk and make it fun. Early morning unload truck isn't fun.
good,"Target was a relatively decent place to work. I learned a lot from there and genuinely enjoyed the people I worked with. The job itself wasn't very difficult but it was just hard enough to keep me from getting bored. Where the company suffered, however, was in it's management of staff. Several of the supervisors had a ""do as I say, not as I do"" policy of teaching and made many decision that didn't seem to be based in logic. That's not to say that all the higher ups were bad people. Many of them were great workers and viewed their teams as co-workers, rather than subordinates. People like them were great to work with and taught me quite a bit."
good,"Flow team unloads the trucks 2-3 times a week, and I was apart of a fantastic team of people. the balance of home to work time was fantastic and management always made sure we were well taken care of."
good,hours aren't always available. management changes a lot. job very tedious. pay reasonable. usually work holidays. pretty laid back place to work.
good,"Target is a great company to work for and they have a great way of treating you like family and making sure you have what you need. Of course there are stressful times and even moments where you get tired of the environment but that's what vacation or days off are for, get away and recharge to continue to have great guest service."
good,Typical day at work is relaxing. Great work-life balance.People at Target give great importance to networking and collaboration. Management is great. Co -workers are good. Hardest part in the job is networking even if it is not necessary.Most enjoyable part is we can learn new technologies.
good,"I came in and had duties, it was always busy. Management was okay, just everyone manager only stayed for barely 3 months and left, I don't know if it was cause of the pressure or scheduling. They liked me a lot that I always was overtime so my life balance was hard to maintain, i felt like they didn't care about that."
good,Working in a Target store is great but working every weekend and holiday except Xmas is hard. /thanksgiving you have to be there at 6pm.
good,Worked in the backroom unloading trucks and sorting merchandise throughout the store. Stocked shelves and helped customers find what items they were searching for.
good,"This job challenges every ounce of your leadership skills and abilities. Every day is different, you must be able to quickly change plans and cater to current business needs. This job is not for the faint of heart, you need to be very confident and able to defend every decision you make. The ability to work with every type of person is a necessity as you are leading an entire store of 100-150 people at a time."
good,"Good place to work, Was better before use of temps.There are several positions available and can post for open positions"
good,"It was great working at Target. There were many positions you could train in, and the team was great to work with. I love learning new things, so being able to try out the different positions in the store was amazing. I just wish it didn't close."
good,"A typical day at target starts around 6 am where we start by setting up the line in the backroom and start unloading the truck. We then take the pallets out to the floor with the use of pallet jacks while fully stocking the shelves. I learned how to work with a team to achieve one goal which was finishing the truck for the day and not leaving anything behind. The hardest part of the job was trying to complete so much before the guest came in when the store opened which was at eight o'clock in the morning. Although the management was supportive, I found it a little difficult to work around them at times."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that I keep the guest happy and satisfied with our merchandise. Target helps their team members work around their school schedule, and also has great benefits."
good,"Busy work day. Learned how to work under pressure with the more challenging customers. Management and the co workers were slackers, no teamwork."
good,Target is one of those places where the job isn't that great but it can still be an awesome experience if you have the right team.
good,"Excellent training and Teamwork experience, I will continue my relationship with my Team.  I would have continued my career with Target until retirement."
good,"I learn a lot about upcoming electronic advancements and new products coming out to the public. I manage mapping out merchandising and run numbers for my departments. The hardest part about my job is trying to balance everything, though I don't like to be idle. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping other people and learning new things in the electronics field."
good,"I worked with a great team of 40-50 team members. I supported a niche market of distribution. I managed the highest volume of interview set up 3 years in a row. I lead a small team of 3 with training, process improvements and development within the distribution market. My team was small and mighty, we collaborated with different levels of management and ability to deliver results quickly. I enjoyed the people I worked with and the work life balance at Target was great."
good,"Stocked shelves, helped customers, worked with some good people who are always willing to help you out. Relatively low paying job, but competitive for field and position."
good,It's been a while since I worked at Target but it is where my husband and i met and I obtained some very great friends. I was even pregnant with my first child while employed there. Although the benefits weren't great the team lead and management staff was very helpful. I worked early morning so 4am sometimes 3am then off by 10am. Target taught me how to truly work as a team. We couldn't complete the day unless everyone was done. It motivated us.
good,"Target is a great place to work. I applied for the job as a full time student for the flexibility, and that's exactly what I got. I learned time management and task orientation skills. The best part of the job is connecting and re-connecting with family and friends that come in often."
good,"Target is a great place to work depending on what area you work in. For the majority, the managers are pretty understanding. However, they do mean business. The hardest part of the job is the holiday season."
good,I only worked there for a few months but the time there was good and the staff was great. Good job for a high school student or a summer job for college student.
good,"Target had its ups and downs. The people and the culture was great. However it did struggle in its practises. "
good,You have to constantly keep moving and working fast to reach the goals that they set and to drive sales to the store. Employees are friendly with great customer service and everyone try's to have fun while still getting their work done.
good,"The company is generally cool to work for. However, the pay, raises, benefits, etc. stink pretty badly. Can be a good company to work for if you can get into management. The hardest part of the job is barely making any money to get by day to day. Most enjoyable part of the job is the people I work with."
good,"Nothing too out of the ordinary at this Target. The coworkers, for the most part, are a great team that works well together. The store does seem a little under staffed at times with the amount of work that needs to be done on an average day. Hardest part of the job was just when the schedules flip flopped for the holiday season."
good,"Learned communication skills, problem solving skills, management skills, customer service. It is retail so the odd hours and shifts are expected, especially working for a larger corporation such as Target. My experience within Target has been great, all because of the positive attitude and strong work ethics I brought in day in and day out. I kept personal problems outside of work and vise versa. I also didn't get caught up with all the drama working in a retail environment brings and by all means I did not do any brown nosing to be successful within Target. I've been promoted 4 times all by having a positive attitude, completing what was asked (of course I gave a lot of push back on numerous tasks), and just worked hard at everything I did. Yes certain tasks are unrealistic, but voice your opinion, challenge what is being delegated, bring ideas to the table, straregize. Management is not always the best, but find one or two Managers you can genuinely trust and leverage them to your corner. "
good,"Target has a great flow team atmosphere. The hours can get a little tough at times and sometimes there is no hours. Management is okay but could be better. Overall great place and would go back any day,"
good,"target was a good fun place to work at. The employees there were great, the management was great as well. Great hours, everyone pulled their own weight around and everybody was very helpful to the customers and as w3ell as the employees"
good,"Target was one of my first legit paying jobs, unlike babysitting or dog walking when you are younger. I was in charge of phones and the fitting rooms and the surrounding clothes areas. My co-workers helped me out a lot by training me, I was also trained on the rest of the floor to restock things and help guests find products. "
good,"I've been there for a year, over all its a good job. my co-workers are really nice. I just wish people would be more thankful of the hard work some of the team members do, and also it would be nice to get more hours"
good,"Target is a great place to work. When I first started I was just a team member, I have since moved to electronics. Electronics is fast paced, fun and exciting. You can expect to have many guests looking to find the perfect item for their house, or for a friend. Many people are curious to know the great features of the electronics they are interested in purchasing. It is my job to not only sell them the items but to make sure they find the perfect fit for them. I have learned a great deal about electronic items since I started working at Target. My co-workers helped me learn about the basics of the electronics department when I first started and now I teach the new electronic team members the basics. I have learned how to muti-task really well since starting at Target, as there is typically more than one guest that needs to be helped, I have also learned to work at a faster pace than I had before. Now I know how to work quickly and make sure the work is up to my high standards. The management at Target is reliable. The hardest part of my job is making sure the guest leaves satisfied no matter how they came in. It is my job to turn someones day around. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing a guest leave with exactly what they were looking for."
good,"I get in at 7:30AM to get a bit of a head start in preparation to clock in at 8:00AM. After clocking in I get the equipment needed to make a customer's trip more rapid. I report to my department turn on all the displays and check the aisles. Then, I go to the morning ""Team Leader Huddle"" to recognize or receive recognition on any good efforts. Then, I do any pending jobs, such as; aisle checks, restock, back push, re-labeling, and cleaning. After, I receive orders from my bosses to do the things I've already done. Then, I spend the rest of the day dedicated to guest satisfaction."
good,"All team members have such a positive attitude."
good,"Would stock merchandise onto the floor and in the back room."
good,I started as a Staff Accountant out of college and learned so much. The hardest part of the job was figuring out new processes without documentation. The best part of the job was the amount that I learned and the great people I worked with.
good,"Target incorporates a fun, fast and friendly work environment to encompass it's corporate culture. Although many will say that you are inundated with ""Target"" so much that it is difficult to see the trees through the forest."
good,"A good environment to work. Seasonal stress due to the thanksgiving, christmas etc"
good,"Management changed, and job satisfaction changed along with that.  They rotate store managers, and you get good ones, bad ones  Overall a good company."
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers, assisting them in finding the particular item they came in to get and helping them save money. Hardest part of the job was maintaining the balance of restocking inventory while running to help cashiers during the busy holiday season."
good,I liked working with my co workers. I liked  my job.  The managers there are nice. The guests that came in were nice. The hardest  part of the job was not being helpful to a guest if I did not know where a product was located.
good,"I actually liked working at target but it was only a seasonal position.  they said i was eligible for rehire but so were a few others & there were not enough openings for everyone."
good,"Good work environment. Very friendly staff and mangers. You will learn time management, customer service. Typical day can be slow at certain times then pick up at different times."
good,"Fun place to work, very good relation between team member and team leader. Multicultural environment, where everyone works together with one goal sales. Stressful at times with the deadlines. The most enjoyable part of my job was creating new layout in the store and use my knowledge and my skills."
good,"I learned how to make transactions efficiently when it was busy. The management is very good, I enjoyed  working with them. They were always very understanding. The most enjoyable part of my job was that we had great team members who were all willing to help one another and also help our guests with anything in the store."
good,Target is a good place to work at. They're all good coworkers and management is fairly flexible and easy to work with. You get out what you put in. Pay could of been a little better but that means the price on everything would go up to the end user. If you're an HS or College student good place to work. If you an adult with a family don't work here. Unless your in upper level management.
good,"A typical day requires guest check out, sometimes I get put at Guest service where they can do returns price match and pick up online orders. I learn something new to do in different departments every time I work. My managers are very understanding when it comes to schedule arrangements. I work with a great group of people no matter if it's morning or night shift."
good,"Day starts out between 4:30 or 6:00am"
good,"A typical day at work would depend on the department I was working in at that time. At Target, I started as a Sales Floor Team Member stocking shelves, straightening products, and interacting with guests, but soon progressed to Price Change, Presentation, Electronics, and Signing. In Price Change I dealt with changing shelf prices and marking down clearance items. In Presentation I deal with transitioning new materials into areas and rearranging fixtures and products accordingly. In Electronics, I performed much the same duties as the sales floor, with added responsibilities for getting accessory attachments for electronics items. Lastly, in Signing I collected store-mail containing the store's ad signage and organized it effectively to help the team set it up as efficiently as possible. I learned a lot about retail, pricing, and specific products, but the best thing I took from it was my experience being a team trainer for three areas of the store. For the most part, I liked the management. Most of my team leaders were supportive, observant, and willing to do what it takes to achieve goals. My co-workers were wonderful, and I made many friends. I enjoyed working at Target largely for that reason. The hardest part of the job was the compensation. Daily, the people I had to deal with and the hard work I put in should have been rewarded better with the pay. The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers. No matter how hard things got at the store, we had each other for motivation and friendship."
good,It Was A Good Experience.  Management Was Great And Understanding.  People I Worked With Were Pretty Good.  I Was A Great Environment To Be In.
good,"While this Merchandising position wasn't the type of job I studied for, the team at Target was accommodating to my schedule and always eager for me to take on more responsibility."
good,Guest are number one. Making sure that all of their needs are meet. My co-worker are team players. Graveyard shift are never easy but when you work with a grate team is not bad.
good,I thouroughly enjoyed my time at Target. The environment and the people were great.
good,I did returns and checked people out. Also packaged damaged goods. also reloaded cards.
good,Not a great place to work for any long term goals or advancements in company
good,"on a typical work day you show up clock in head out to find you LOD figure out what till you had to go onto then after 2 hrs you would get your first 15 minute break (paid) then most times you would go down to the self check outs for an hour. after that someone would come down to switch off with you and you would go back on till up front or do restock or returns. By the fourth hour came along it was your lunch break (unpaid). remember this is working like an 8 hr shift."
good,"I learned that there is no ""I"" in team work learned how to humble my self and work under pressure"
good,Great place to start working if your new to production. loved the atmosphere
good,go in get My rf gun. Pull to the floor what ever merchandise is low on the sales floor.
good,Target was my first job where I got paid an hourly salary I learned how to make a proper transaction happen. I enjoy the advancement and how you can learn a new job and take shifts from people in that area.
good,I learned all the basics of working a job and all of the responsibilities to go with it. I had to take care of reshop and cleaning up the store. I also had to make sure our guests were getting everything they need. After leaving I was offered a higher position and I was able to learn much more.
good,Typical day for me is that I start work a 4am. We unload the Truck then we push product to the floor for the business day. The workers are friendly. Management will work around student school schedule.
good,"Worked at Thompson Creek for a total of 3 years. Quite an experience. I went through 3 different departments and enjoyed them each thoroughly. "
good,A typical day at  target for was anyway from 8 to possible 12 hours depending on coverage.  Management overall was pretty good. Lots lead by example which is one of my favorite mottos.  Most enjoyable part about working at Target assisting someone and seeing how appreciative they are. Nothing like praise for a job well done. It always made me feel good about working there. Hardest part about the job. Holidays without enough coverage.
good,"While working in the backroom I was given freedom to do things how I wanted as long as they worked. Management was horrendous, but it's a corporation and that seems all too common."
good,Very team oriented work place. I was given great opportunities to cross train and get extra hours that way. Management was friendly and hired without bias but Im sure every workplace is different.
good,If you like morning shifts they will hire you right away to unload the truck.  Stay positive and motivated and you can advanced to the sales floor and other areas of the store.
good,"A typical day at work varies on the area you work in or what time of the year it is. It can be very busy and a bit overwhelming but it is fun nonetheless. I learned a lot about advancing my knowledge on things in the store and how easy I picked up on it. The management was very good at first and it really depends on which store you work at, the management soon went down hill. I loved the experience and the friends I found in my co-workers."
good,"opportunity to advance if you are really pushy for it,"
good,Fun but demanding work environment. If hired work to create a balance otherwise you'll burn out.
good,This Is an Up Tempo Unloding job this was my first job nice pay just little hours
good,Good team culture vibe. I enjoy working there for the most part.
good,"- A typical day at work consisted of a big truck to unload and a fast paced day to restock the store by the time we opened "
good,"Printed all HR reports daily"
good,"I was the head cashier. My normal day was checking out our guests at the registers, helping them find anything they might ask me for, keep my cashiers stalked with what ever they might need. Just make sure everything in running smoothly."
good,"I had a good time working here, it was my first job and I stayed for a year until I left for college"
good,"As Senior Team Leader, Logistics I am responsible for largest team in the store and share responsibilities of serving as the Leader on Duty (store manager).  I have learned a great deal about creating an amazing shopping experience and how to relate with an extremely diverse team in a fast paced environment."
good,I cashiered all day but learned a lot about providing great customer service. The management was pretty good for the most part and I got along well with everyone there. The hardest part of the job was during the holidays and back to school when we were really busy. The funnest part of the job was the amazing team I had.
good,"the Target in Abq.N.M was by far the best one i have worked for.I loved everyone their.They really want to see you become a leader,and that's what they did for me."
good,"One thing that I have struggled throughout my career here has been getting the development opportunities from my managers.  The other thing that has been tough is getting a new position within the company."
good,"I enjoyed working at Target, it gave me experience and allowed me to train in different areas of the store. The pay and job advancements were minimal, which is why I chose to leave. "
good,Work Place with room for advancement. Pleasant people to work with and for.
good,"Enjoy working here but do not work enough hours."
good,"We usually start the day with unloading the truck, then we systematically stock the store while making sure all the old inventory gets out there. Most of the time the managers or leadership hasn't been to reliable. They give exceptions to high for a few amount of people to accomplish in the time frame that they want. I don't like jobs that don't follow the schedule they set there are other aspects in life. It may not be all that because we don't have an obligation to stay later than a 4 hour shift but it seems as they (management) intends to use guilt, fear, or the need for income to try to get people to stay. The hardest part is probably the the consistent grind through out the day, but that can be overcome easy. Te best part in my opinion is being cross-trained so you cant get more hours and learn new trades for future jobs"
good,At this company i had my ups and downs but at the end of the day i was grateful to have a job i have a couple of managers i loved to work with because they were fair and understanding and willing to help out when needed. the coworkers were great we always worked as a team what i enjoyed most is the different events that target hosted the hardest part was not getting raises
good,It was a good atmosphere to work in. Fun loving people to wor with.
good,"A typical day at Target for me was coming in at seven a.m. and unloading the truck that would come in on monday, wednesday, and friday's. It would take about four hours in total to completely unload the truck and fully stock the shelves around the store. After the initial four hours, I would spend my time in the backroom, putting away all of the over stock from the truck. I learned how to make quick decisions and adapt to sudden changes and challenges throughout the work day. The management at Target consisted of trust worthy individuals, that would understand personal problems and would work with you if anything was amiss. The co-workers and managers were great and friendly people who were easy to get along with and I never really had a problem with anyone there. The hardest part about working at target is the lack of hours and pay. It's not a place where you can walk in and expect to get a full forty hours every week. They only get a set amount of hours to work with and schedule people accordingly. The hours can range anywhere from twelve to thirty-five at the most. But the best part about working at Target was your fellow co-workers. Everyone tends to get along and work great with each other. No work place hostility and the ""guests"" (aka customers) were usually very nice and understanding."
good,"work on compliance reports."
good,"I was hired on as a seasonal Sales Associate for Soft Lines (clothing) during the holidays. It was a very positive environment with encouraging Team Leaders. They provide you with adequate training before putting you on the floor or behind the cash register. They ensure that all they're Sales Associates are cross-trained as cashier in case the store gets busy and they need extra help at the front. This was great way to gain cash-handling experience and looks good on a resume. My store also provided training for their Softlines team members to serve as Store Operator. "
good,They need some help with managing technology but they feed the team once a week
good,Incredible growth opportunities and experience for a first job.  The company has problems communicating expectations from upper level management to stores.
good,"good place to work, opportunities for advancement, laidback environment"
good,With a no discrimination policy this company has created a diverse work force. Little to no room for advancement tho unless you're all ready in management. Co-workers are great but there is a high turn over. No benefits for associates.
good,"Everyone says hi or hello to everyone but there are still some boundaries and barriers between coworkers, everyone remains tied to their respective departments. Management are nice however when working with employees, pressure and strain can become an issue. Hardest part of the job is getting there early in the morning. Benefits are not that great but its a great job for students or if your unemployed, like a sort of 'inbetween jobs' kinda thing"
good,"Friendly staff/employees but Management needs work along with reasonable expectations, work environment needs improvement, needs to be more understanding of life outside of work especially for employees that have children! Hours suck, as in: they cut your hours to keep you from gaining benefits and ridiculous days off patterns."
good,"busy job, dealing with customer and electronics. Also handling merchandise and money."
good,I liked the overall environment the management set for work. I learned a lot about retail. The hardest part was working 3rd shift.
good,Great place for a recent grad to start career.  Room for advancement if you are inclind.  Strong focus on personal development.
good,"Target is another corporation, who focus more on their customers (Guest) than they do their employees"
good,"Very productive "
good,Work hard for 3 days and get 4 off....Great schedule and good money to go along with it.
good,"A typical day at Target pharmacy is very fast paced and energetic. You can accomplish a lot in a short amount of time. You have to learn to work with others because the environment is somewhat small and personal, hence being fast, fun and friendly. Management oversees all tasks that are completed because there is very little room for mistakes. Details and accuracy are a very significant part of this job."
good,"It's been a long time since I've worked at Target, so I'm not sure what the culture is like there anymore. When I worked there the scheduling was good as was the opportunity for advancement and cross-training in other departments. Benefits at the time I worked there were very good."
good,"productive , most of the time very busy. I learned not to express my feelings to anyone, management was diversified  from one person to another,some co-workers were lazy while others worked their tails off, Hardest part was having to work most nights, weekends and holidays. Most enjoyable was when working with the fun employees."
good,"When I worked at Super Target I was crosstrained for alot of different departments. Everyone was friendly and Management had its good and it's bad times. Higher up management always rotate so your favorite ETL could be there and then leave within a year or two depending on how well they do."
good,"Target offers great salary options. They are always looking to hire right out of college. I enjoy working for them, but I do not want to make Target my entire life. The people who truly do well here are the ones that absorb themselves in work and do not mind. Other than that, it is stressful and very demanding of your time. You are scheduled a minimum of 50 hours a week, always."
good,"Liked working there met a lot of great people."
good,Great company to work for as there are benefits even for team members. Co-workers make the job fun and interacting with guests doesn't disappoint.
good,"A typical day as a Target cashier involves greeting customers and operating the cash register while asking them if they would like to sign up for the Target Credit Card. During my time there, I learned a great deal about how a retail business operates. The management is really hands on, helping where they can and making sure you do your job. Co-workers are really laid-back and down to earth, not much drama really. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the fast pace sometimes as mishaps occur and customers and the management get impatient. The most enjoyable part of the job is just having the opportunity to work in a place where you shop very often."
good,A fast paced environment with change occurring daily.  The hardest part of the job is working long hours to manage the business.  The most enjoyable part is developing others.
good,Very fast paced enviroment. I have learned to manage employees and
good,"A typical day at work included general engagement with customers (better known as guests) the concept that they are aware that you are there to aid them with any questions, recommendations, and item locations. This ordeal taught me how to be patient in any given situation, a rather ideal concept to take out from the experience alongside with operation of store based equipment. The management itself was generally well mannered but the co-workers tended to be the most enjoyable portion of the job very friendly people! If i were to list the hardest part of working there it would be the people who shopped at the store i worked at they tended to be inconsiderate for the most part."
good,"I love Target, it's an overall great place to shop or work. A typical days work consisted of me performing customer service, answering phones, restocking, and operating a cash register. I learned how to use my great customer service skills and became a peoples person. I enjoyed working with managers and other co-workers because they helped maintain a positive environment and great team efforts. The hardest part of working at Target was keeping your score on the register at a minimum. The most enjoyable part of working at Target was being able to help others and being rewarded for performing great at my job."
good,Very fast paced work environment. Pretty routine day at work. Learned how to deal with various customers and situations.
good,The job is very easy I love it but its just not enough pay and they don't give you a lot of hours. Co-workers are very friendly and helpful and I learned a whole lot because I did a whole lot for Target.
good,"The pay was terrible, the benefits were awesome, the team I worked with was awesome, the hours were descent."
good,Great management and very organized company who treats their staff very well.
good,Target was the first job i obtained when i was 16 years of age. It was a great starting Job. The customers were friendly as well as my Co-workers. It taught me alot of what i know today and I still use the policies and guidelines in my everyday life.
good,I loved working on the Flow Team in the early hours of the morning. It was a good team and the management made it fun. We unloaded semi trucks and stocked the store before the store opened in the morning. Sometimes some of us would stay late because everything didn't get unpacked. It is a very fast paced job and the time goes by quickly.
good,"Okay, so it's my first job, and in that regards I absolutely love it, "
good,Excellent job for high school students or young college students.
good,it was a great place to work for family involved care about your outside life. Not easy to move up because they require a degree to be a manager
good,"I went to work grabbed the equipment that I needed for the day, a scanner and walkie-talkie. Then I want about my duties assisting guests and adjusting selves. All of my co-workers were amazing and very helpful, a real team. It's just the hours that were availiable were very limited, that was the hardest part of the job, was getting decent hours. I did love every aspect of the job though."
good,A typical day involved making sure the store ran smoothly and that my team was happy. I enjoyed bringing on new team members and working to prevent turn over. Management was helpful in pushing me to be a better team member. The hardest part of the job was not helping my team as much as I could. And the most enjoyable part of the job was my fellow team members.
good,"A day at work usually consists of helping guest find items, stocking the shelves, and setting new products on end caps. The coworkers are hard working and reliable. The hardest part of the job is completing the multitude of task assigned in a given week when hours are cut back. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people I work with. I learned how to manage a weekly workload, delegate tasks out to ensure completion, and a wide variety of guest services. As well as how to interview potential employees."
good,"typical day was mostly on your feet all day and dealing with guest, making sure they found every thing ok. the staff was very nice including the management. the wrost part was when my dad got sick and he was in the hospital me and my mom also got sick, they where very rude about it and they told me that i need to come in anyway. I was so sick i just quit the job."
good,"My experience with Target was hectic, but exciting. As a Cart Attendant, I was always on the move to try and bring shopping carts into the store from the parking lot. My other tasks were to clean restrooms every hour, trash disposal, taking items to the back warehouse, and assisting guests in any way. The management was professional and my co-workers were supportive. Being the only Cart Attendant proved to be difficult at times. Making sure the Carts were full at the front and going to do a restroom check had to be the most difficult part of the job. The best part about the job was getting a break and lunch to cool off then head back out for more carts. An interesting and challenging experience overall."
good,"Great people, Fast and friendly work Environment. Process retail product from corporate and stock sales floor. Make customer needs first and make sure they have a great shopping experience. Management is decent and have a pretty good idea to press the company forward through the future."
good,"Always came in on time, with a positive attitude and ready to work and help others."
good,"The job was unloading boxes from the truck, bringing them to where they need to be, then opening the boxes and putting the contents on the self."
good,Many of us got along with each other. The job could get a little fast paced but not anything one wouldn't be able to handle. The most enjoyable part was meeting new customers everyday and even the returning customers.
good,"Enjoyed working there.  People that were employed there were friendly and outgoing, but most of them were young and ambitious."
good,"I really have enjoyed working for Target. The company is great with lots of room for advancement. The pay is not the best, and now that I am older, I need something with more stable hours and pay. This is the worst part thought, the people are nice and it is a fun job."
good,Overall Iearned a lot from this company. I have received a lot of my leadership skills at Target and love everything the company stands for however there was very minimal opportunity for growth.
good,COWORKERS in general were great. working with people was good aswell.. some managment issues
good,Target is a great company to work for and always encourages employees to interact with their guests in a positive way.  Coworkers work well together in a team setting.
good,"I enjoy working for Target. A typical day at work is fun, fast paced, and great people. It is a true team based environment. The management tries very hard to hold us all to the highest accountability. I have learned that retail is an exciting place to be. The hardest part of the job is ensuring complete accuracy while avoiding human error. The easiest part of the job is working in a wonderful environment."
good,Very friendly co workers and everyone always willing to help out if u need it.
good,The culture surrounding your co-workers is team driven and family oriented. Very keen on helping the employees grow and develop by challenging them to improve their areas of opportunity. The most enjoyable part is genuine daily interactions with the customers. The downside or hard part is working retail hours (many nights and weekends). The most important thing that I learned was how to challenge myself by forcing myself to resolve difficult or uncomfortable situations on my own.
good,"I work as an instocks memeber which means I take sell items from the back room and put them in their proper places on the sales floor. I moved to this postion from being a sales associate. This postion I currently hold is considered a speacialty area in Target. I've learned the store and where each item is located. I've also learned to move at a faster pace to get the product to the floor so the guest can happily purchase them. My manager for my specific section is a very nice woman, she can be very passionate about our job and how things are done. My other managers are also very friendly, strict; but very friendly. I get along with all of my co-workers. The hardest part of my job would be the newest changes that we have recently underwent. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with different people and interacting with different backgrounds."
good,It was a great learning experience . I love working with numbers. My team leader was a great teacher and very easy to talk to. The most stressful part of my job was during flyer set on Fridays.
good,"Typically when you come in and report to the area you work in you will either be given a task by a supervisor or you will have to find busy work. You must always be ""fast-fun-friendly"" with the quests. Communication is key at Target as it is at any other job. The co-workers at target are usually pretty easy going, but just like other workplaces, issues will arise. The hardest part of the job is finding busy work when the store is extremely slow. The best part of the job are the other co-workers. Management is easy to get along with, sometimes do struggle with communication between each other as far as plans."
good,"Easy and straight forward place to work. "
good,"A typical day at work would either clock in at 3:30 or 4:00 am and to go straight to the back of the store to the loading area. We would start unloading the truck, everything goes down the line where everyone is ready with several different pallets assigned for different areas of the store. Everyone was assigned to a certain pallet and as your merchandise went by we would put them were it needs to be. As other workers are taking the full pallets out to the floor where workers would unload the merchandise from the pallets to the assigned aisle read on the box. When the truck was all unloaded the rest of us would go to the floor and start cutting boxes open to fill the shelves from pet food to chemicals, health aisle, groceries, toys, babies & furniture. I learned a lot from management, from how to work fast pace to how to read PDA's or how to PIFO in the food area, and how to work well with others. The hardest part of the job was the pace and how we had to have the store absolutely clean before 8 am when the store opened. The most enjoyable part of the job was the co workers I got to know, they made the day go by fast."
good,The workflow was typical with regards to the department. However I learned more about the medical aspects in dealing with people and the medicines that were dispensed. Management overall was okay and co-workers too. The hardest part was making sure i was prepare to maintain a good attitude every day with being able to deal and perform my duties for those who were having medical issues. Also making sure that me and my co-workers was together working to achieve the goals that were set for us. The most enjoyable part of the job was hearing from that guest of how grateful they were for me being very helpful and understand being a part of there treatment concerning the medicine and the cost!
good,"I wasn't a fan of some of the team leads.  We had one that would reduce the cashiers to tears.  Over all it wasn't bad, but things could have been better."
good,"Fast work pace. "
good,A typical day would be helping customers by providing information on electronic devices that we  sale. I learn a lot about different types of televisions. Also about activating cellular phones.
good,i have learned alot from working here. some of the coworkers are very helpful and friendly and some are just not so generous at times. There are no hard parts about the job at all. The most enjoyable part is just making sure the store is completed before the shift is over

good,Target Distribution Center was a great place to work.  The pay and benefits were great as well as the hours I was eventually able to get. Advancement was difficult.
good,This job has taught me a lot about retail at a firsthand experience.
good,"When I clock on, I go to the back of the store and work on the line unloading the truck;putting boxes of products on pallets. While the line workers unload the truck, a group of team members bowl the boxes into their correct aisle. After we get done unloading the truck, we unpack the boxes and place the product on the correct location. If there are any products left over that can't fit the location or second location, we back stock it."
good,Fast paced retail environment. Great pay and benefits. Some room for advancement.

It is a great place to start out and advance into higher positions. They are really good at advancing team members within the workplace."
good,"A typical day at work means starting with a huddle and giving recognitions to someone who has assisted you branding the floor, assuring safe and trouble free environment to guest."

I'm typing, filling, labeling, calling doctors office for approvals on refill and prior authorizations, placing orders for inventory stock, dusting, split bills, third-party billing issues and McKesson returns. I take my job seriously but yet I do like to have fun with my co-workers. My co-workers are funny and the best thing about us is that we all work in sync with one another. The hardest part of my job is turning a patient away due to prescription not being in stock to fill. The most enjoyable part of my job is handling and taking care of patients with their prescriptions and any issues present. I like to make sure my patients receive their prescriptions at a promised or given time."
good,Target us a wonderful place to start. I recommend working for the company for its security and stability . mind you they do have their off seasons so hours do get short but all in all if you work well with others and maintain a healthy relationship with everyone you can be very successful in the company.
good,"organize racks by size and style, answer customers questions about the store, there policy's, and merchandise. learned that taking care of the customers needs were very important. Management were there to help with anything you needed. Coworkers were there when you needed them and there were a lot of team work."

good,Great place to start a career as they provide great training and there is a lot of opportunity for advancement.
good,"I learned how to develop a sense of independence, they would give me a task and tell me how to do it once or twice then turn me loose and let me get the hang of it myself which I appreciated immensely."
good,Working at target was a great experience. You get to meet new people and work on your people skills. I was fortune to work with wonderful people who made target a fun workplace. You don't have set schedule. There are times when you leave target at 12:30-1:00 A.M.

Learned mostly about Targets policies on Service Plans, Returns, ETC. already knew a lot about electronic items. Management in general was very professional, but in my area was very strict, and at times kind of rude. Co-workers were all very nice and helpful, except  for one person, who wasn't there for very long after I started.  Hardest part for job, was ""getting attachments""  which meant in short, getting guests to buy added things on there items, such as HDMI cords and service plans, which is something Target is very big on. The most enjoyable part, was the people, in general.  Very nice people, that i will hope to keep in touch with."

good,good people to work with but hours statred going down needed a second job to make up to keep bills paid
good,"at the time i was employed i had a lot of personal things going on. Which, In turn, made me not enjoy it to the full extent. Its a fun place to work, and everyone helps everyone.

good,A breakdown in management during my development was a direct cause of my voluntary termination from this employer.
good,I enjoy working at Target. I have learned that Target is a pretty difficult job to get into and that management can rely on you to much if you get a lot of REDCards frequently. My co-workers are awesome. The most enjoyable part of my job would be the fact that every Guest leaves my check lane happy and fulfilled.
good,A typical day at work is having to make sure the aisles of the store are neat and order before we open for business. I've learned how to multi tasks and work in different departments. Management really help their employees. Coworkers i've gotten along with majority of them. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with unhappy and difficult customers. The enjoyable part of the job would be meeting new people.
good,Working at target is very hectic at times in my view. The work is very demanding and can be very tiring. The most enjoyable part of my job is the customers appreciation at times.
good,"I have a full working knowledge of Target stores and how they operate as far as customer product and sales is concerned.  The store is beautiful, clean and well lit because of the hard work of all the employees.  The best part of my day is the wonderful employees I had the pleasure of working with.  The hardest part was fulfilling all the tasks asked to perform in the short period of time given to complete them."
good,"Retail hours, but typical day for me was watching the front lanes, taking care of peoples concerns, dealing with money."
good,"Working with Target has been the best working experience I've had so far. The evening started with the entire staff working together unload the inventory from the truck. From there, we disbursed into smaller groups and work in divided sections to restock the shelves. Towards the end of the night, everyone would migrate to any areas that seemed to be struggling to complete their stocking. This job taught me so much about working together as a team, and working hard  to complete any task. This job was only hard when the Christmas season arrived. That when the store felt more stress to keep the shelves stocked. The most enjoyable part of this job was working with people who had the same commitment to their job as I had. This led us to making work a fun place to come to everyday."
good,I start out with arranging the clothes by size on the Z-racks before putting them away in soft lines department.  I have learned a lot from target how sales work.  The management team at target is willing to help you out with any thing that you need done.  Co-workers are very friendly always there to help you  understand each department and willing to gave a helping hand.  Hardest part of the job is when some guest who shop at target is not happy when we don't have items in the store that they are looking for.  I enjoy the different people that you meet everyday that comes to shop at target.
good,I usually helped with the unloading of truck and stocking merchandise on store shelves. learned how to do PDQ's and logistics. My co-workers were the best part of my job. I could go to them with anything.
good,"Always on the go."
good,Think that target was a great company to work for but all companies have they up and down and they down was that they did not want to pay you what you need to make.
good,Had no experience when i started but they were great teachers and show me the basics and loved the uniform and the way the have everything set up very easy to work
good,"It's the retail industry, which is very demanding.  Target offers you the opportunity to learn to become a critical and strategical individual.  Retail hours are not your typical 9-5 schedule, therefore you have to be flexible especially during the 4rth quarter.  They give a tremendous amount of responsibility in your first year, and therefore you have plenty opportunity for development and growth."
good,"•	Provide fast, fun service at checkout"
good,"Target's biggest problem is hiring managers who are far too young and inexperienced. Of all the executives and team leaders in my store, only three of the fifteen were over the age of 30. That's statistically anomalous, and common practice as most stores. Even the district managers were in their 30s and had little to no retail and multi-unit experience."
good,"A typical day at work for me consists of working as a team.  The Target I currently work for is a high-volume store so we receive 11 trucks per week.  Each night my team and I will start our process at 10:45 p.m. We offload a trailer that ranges anywhere from 1800 to 2600 boxes.  I also have a secondary team that comes in at 11:30 p.m. to remove merchandise from our backroom via a store device to keep everything systematic.  Once that is completed I will spend my night working with my team to ensure everything gets completed properly.  After 7:00 a.m. everyone will have gone home and I will spend 3 hours partnering with the day-side managers and their teams as well as follow up on any of my own managerial duties.  I also have to make time for developmental activities with the Leaders on my team to ensure I am constantly elevating their performance.  One of the biggest things I have learned in my career is that as a team you can move mountains. I believe that a leader can drive great results through getting the team to have the same engagement and desire that they do.  If one can accomplish that type of dedication the results can be outstanding.  In terms of management, I really focus on getting to know each and every person I work with on a personal level.  I feel that if you can make small connections with people that it will help build trust and raise the morale.  My direct boss is also very friendly, supportive and approachable.  My peers/co-workers are all friendly/supportive as well.  I do not get to spend a ton of time with them due to the fact that I work overnight, which"
good,"Target is a fun atmosphere but it is incredibly enduring, stressful, and demanding.  very long hours, between 10-15 typically for executives."
good,Maintained an accurate cash drawer in a face pace environment. Provided customers with exceptional customer service. Ensured availability of products and services for all customer
good,"Solid employeer in developing Leaders."
good,"Great place to work!  High emphasis on personal development, expectations for performance are high."
good,"I went to work daily after class at the Guest services desk. I worked customer service and processed returns, go backs, and assisted guests as much as possible. I loved my job, and it was a great job while matriculating through college. My co workers were great and managers were understanding and knew that I was only in Port Orange until I graduated and would be moving home shortly after. I enjoyed the interaction with people and being able to assist and put a smile on their face."
good,I enjoy working with my co-workers. We take our job seriously yet we enjoy talking and working with each other. Management jumps in to help when necessary. A typical day at Target is we go through the store and straighten as needed. We ask guest if they need help finding something. I enjoy getting my employee discount.
good,Every one is extremely nice and helpful when it comes to co workers and customers. Management was great.
good,My manager was one that has never been matched since or before.  She was on my side when I right and wasn't unprofessional at all.  It was difficult at times with having two bosses and pleasing them both but I managed and excelled at it.
good,"I keep the produce in stock, Inspect the produce for freshness , Place the order when needed and I over see employes when breaking down and pushing out the food delivery to insure stock is rotated and not over pushed . My co-workers are very friendly and we joke with each other everyday; I have met so many wonderful people . We have team member appreciation day once a month  sometimes it is pizza , donuts ,ice cream ,chips ,different things and the Holidays we get catering for the the entire weekend it is so nice .  The hardest thing is under staffing it make us struggle to try to get all of our tasks done . We are fast fun and friendly but it is not as fun as it used to be ."
good,it was a nice place to work at for the time i was there i got to meet friendly people and learned how costmers are
good,"Fast Pace, Team Orientated Environment a great place to gain experience about overall organizational operations."
good,"Normal day at work would be myself going to the service desk to assist guest with returns and/or answer any questions they have, check out guests, and complete a daily audit of all the items that have been deem defective. I enjoy most of my co-workers and they find myself to be very humorous and a joy to work with. The hardest part of my job would be the lack of staff we have. Less staff would make work harder on the people that are there. My most enjoyable time at work would be the interactions I have with guest and my co-worker including the thrill I get from helping guests."
good,"Typical construction job, hard work, good employee's and foremans"
good,"Maintaining a fast,fun and friendly environment with employees while driving for results."
good,"its a cool job but advancement for management is rare. "
good,"this company is a good company to work for, great hours and time to work during the week"
good,"I cleaned, scraped, waxed, and polished floors. made sure it was up to standard with target personnel."
good,"A typical day for me was ringing up customers and promoting our target discount card. At this job i learned how to interact with many diffrent types of people which made everyday intresting. As for my managers and co-workers they were both very helpful and on point when it came down to trying to understand something ,fix a problem, or just helping with a price check and reasoning with a customer. the hardest part of the job was dealing with an upset customer but the most enjoyable part was when you fufill the needs and concerns or fix any customars problems and send them home satisfied and happy. "
good,"working my co workers all working together as a team and helping each other out, the discount is what i really loved the most "
good,Great job if you want alot of free time and live with your parents.  
good,as a first job it was good and i learnd alot about just keeping a job and meeting deadlines
good,Target is a challenging but fun place to work.  You learn great leadership skills.  However there isn't too much work/life balance but you will grow as a person and a leader.
good,"investigations- internal and external- large scope"
good,"Every day was different at Target, but most days consisted of making sure that daily operations at the store were being carried out in the most efficient manner. I managed a team of about 5 team leaders, so their performance management was a part of my weekly routine. The executive teams at the stores are all very supportive of each other. The hardest part of the job is finding a good work-life balance because you have to work every other weekends and at least one night a week."
good,A very diverse place to work!  Fun to work with all the team members.  
good,"A typical work day is fast paced and a lot of interaction with other team members.  I have learned patience and how to be tolerant with the diversity and culture of others.  "
good,"I started as a cashier the summer after graduating high school. I would say this, if you work hard enough and apply yourself you can possibly have a good future with Target. Management is not all that great, which was one of my main reasons for leaving."
good,Target Provided me with some interesting work right out of college.
good,hours were crazy. learned how to muli-task very well. co-workers were great management was not so great. the hardest part about target was cleaning up after guest who don't watch their children.
good,I have learned a lot about customer service from working at target.
good,Fast-paced retail store with many team members to hold accountable.
good,"Target can be a great place to work, I have gained alot of valuable work experience and knowledge from working there"
good,a typical work day at target was fast pace. i learned how to unload trailers and stock shelves. management was awesome. coworkers were alright people.
good,"I was lucky enough to have a lot of my team leaders believe in me as hard worker. They knew if they ask me to work in any area of the store I would work hard to make sure all my goals were completed. With that said, I was able to work in many of the departments. I was able to learn how to cashier, take charge of the front lanes when the team leader had to step out, how to work in guest service, food service, Starbucks, as well as give breaks to our electronics team. I am glad I have the coworkers that love to help learn their department. I do not have a typical day at work because every day is different. Most days I will work in Starbucks, but for the rest they have me work all around the store. The hardest and most enjoyable part of my job is at moments I feel quite drained with all the responsibilities, but at the end of the day I love the feeling of accomplishment. "
good,Job is fairly fast paced. Always have things to do so there is never much downtime. Good people to work with and always changing to keep up with what is new.
good,Overnights had its ups and downs.
good,"I learnd how to work in a team, all co-workers where helpfull and friendly, the hardest part for was working little time, the most enjoyable part of the job was doing my job and helping others."
good,"Did not like overnight to much, but I needed a job. The employees where friendly, management was nice."
good,Retail at Target is very different than most places. It is an enjoyable place to work but management is very sneaky.
good,Work on a typical day is fast paced. When the truck shipment hascome in the teammust work as fast as possible while making sure the boxes are being separated into their respective departments accurately.
good,Target is the best place I ever worked for. The store is always in order and the service is Awesome.
good,"The managers at Target are so worked up about ""guest service"" and going the extra inch for everyone that comes in the store that they forget about their employees. For the most part, I don't feel like the management cares about me personally (there are exceptions)."
good,Working with multiple Guests inside the store on the sales floor and on the phone. Target gives me the opportunity to have experience with dealing with different kinds of customers in the community. The management is very diverse due to several Managers running the store. My associates and I have good communication on anything Loss Prevention or Store related. The hardest part of my job would be identifying complex situations of what could be causing shortage in the store. When I prevent theft day to day is the fun part.
good,"fun and easy job, very easy super easy, just management is horrible at times and they really don't do anything!!!"
good,Targets moto was fast fun and friendly.
good,A typical day at target was very hectic. I enjoyed my job. I learned to have more social skills and more customer service skills. There were no hard parts to the job. My co-workers were very friendly. Management needed to be more organized.
good,"very flexible schedule, fun coworkers, guests are nice, great hours and hard work!"
good,Great store to work for with great peers. Provides a great culture with high energy expectations. Problems arise daily and scored metrics are taken very seriously.
good,"Since there's a Starbucks in the Target, I liked supporting them, because I am able to learn about the diffferent drinks made !!"
good,enjoyed working at Super Target as a seasonal at an overnight shift however I would much prefer to work at the day shift due of my child was under 10 years of age. Unfortunately it was only a seasonal.
good,"I was a cashier and repleneshed the stock on the shelves. Management very nice. I enjoyed working there, but not enough hours and they did not want to work around another job."
good,"I loved the time I spent working at Target, but the Management constantly changes & it lowers employee morale. Good environment at stores but not warehouses"
good,"I had a lot of fun working here, the people were nice and the job was enjoyable. If anything was wrong it was that there wasn't a very high pay for all the work you were doing. I spent almost all my time at work with little to no time to myself and my check was still always pretty small."
good,"Everything was great about working here except the front end management. The lady was very rude, and she was racist! Sad but true"
good,"My day was pretty basic, help customers, stock the shelves, keep my work space clean and in order. Management changed to often and the managers had rotating shifts so it was hard to do things in consistency because different managers had conflicting points of view. I made a lot of friends with my co-workers.The store also worked with my school schedule."
good,"In my experience at the restaurant,in time of working.Need a presence of mind no friends talk take serious in every move, smile with the customer.We can give time for the co-worker in break time not on duty time,some times customer is always right so this is the hardest part,we need to be patient for the customer because once the customer meet her/his satisfaction then thats will be your accomplishment."
good,"Stock shelves with new and replacement product. Clean up work area and ready store for opening. Some executive team leads were easy to work with others very difficult. As a team leader most employees worked well with me, they know what it takes to become a team leader. Working with the college graduate Exective team leads. They really didn't know the hard physical work it took to keep a store looking great. Working with the Target guests, especially the ones who had problems. It felt personally satisfying too"
good,"typical day at work would be me taking care of customers, or pushing carts.Co workers are easily to get along with good work environment. their are no hard task to do at target. Managers are always support needs and duties. the most enjoyable part of my job is taking care of my customers and putting a smile on their face and leaving work with a good attitude."
good,I was a cashier during my post at Target. It was especially with my coworkers but I would be difficult sometimes during some holidays.
good,Deliver excellent service to Target guests
good,If you just need money and you aren't doing anything on the side target is the best place to be. The management is great at my store but I guess it depends on the store. Work life balance is not there. My Team Lead is pretty good about my schedule when I provide a certain availability. Health benefits are alright. Dental is good as well as Vision. The hardest part of my job is working in a deli no one wants to work there. We are constantly short staffed because of hour cuts and even though we are short staffed they do nothing about it. EVEN THOUGH we make sales everyday for our department.
good,"Target is a fun place to work. If you like to have fun, be rewarded for your efforts and work as a team, then Target is for you. As a former Executive Team Leader, I learned a lot about managing people during my time with Target. I worked with a lot of good people at both the management and the team member levels. The best time of the year at Target is Thanksgiving. Preparing for that day and seeing everything come together is awesome!"
good,"I have been responsible for employee teams of up to 400+ people. During that time, I have learned about the importance of clear and concise communication and how to engage a large team across a large team with varying degrees of tenure and experience. I have learned how to be fair while still ensuring that people are treated as individuals."
good,"Each day brought a different story and challenge when someone came up to do a return. I always had the guests that challenged me and requested a manager in order to make a scene, while others were the easiest to deal with."
good,"Overall, picked up alot of experience especially the operation and management of stander forklifts."
good,Its your typical retail job. I actually learned a lot from them and I was able to move up to management and try new positions. Co-workers varied when it came down to work ethic . I enjoyed making new friends and working in the photo lab processing pictures.
good,busy getting stock out. learned some new stuff in computer problems. there are good managers that work there. well there are very good workers an there not so good workers there to...the hardest part of the job was to dpci numbers. the most enjoyable part of the job was most all of the employees.... coming in an talking to them an make friends....
good,Start the day at 4:00 A.M unloading our truck putting the stock onto pallet and flat beds. Next pushing the pallets and flat beds to the floor to bowl out the boxes to their correct aisles. After we are finished bowling we then put the freight up.
good,"This job was only seasonal and happy it was... the supervisors and management can be really rude. One supervisor in particular tried to make my work hell for no reason. So, i don't have too much to say about this job."
good,"Being an In Stock Team Member, I am cross-trained in several departments. I work the backroom, salesfloor, In Stock team, and sometimes Flo Team and Pricing Team. The pay is okay, but for the amount of work that you do, it should be increased. Target is very customer friendly, however, they hold huddles in the middle of the floor instead of in the office or breakroom. This takes time away from helping guests and doing our job."
good,"Target was a great place to work, you get to know all your co-workers, you go in early in the mornings and have the afternoons off, and you only worked Monday-Friday for the Logistics team."
good,great place to work at but the management was lacking in quality
good,Very fast pace and always changing. Tough to get promoted from within.
good,"Aprendi a ser mais comunicação e proatividade, adoro meus colegas de trabalho e chefia, pena que a empresa não ofereça plano de cargos e salários."
good,"I have learned many skills at Target and the environment there is great! The coworkers are friendly and everyone is like a big family. The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude guests, but thats everywhere in retail. Target does care for its employees."
good,"The setup of new product and maintaining the flow on the sales floor was the most enjoyable. It was like setting up a puzzle, which always changes. I enjoyed working with all my co-workers and most of the management staff."
good,"I need something where advancement is due to hardwork, appreciated and we all cooperate as one in getting the task done that is required by each individual. Also a little traveling job-related which includes little holiday job party if possible"
good,Didn't fit in to culture. Tuff to relate to excutive team. Great training programs.
good,"Management varies, some are great and some are bad."
good,Provide Customer Service; Ran cash register; Made sure all returns were returned to sales floor; Responsible for putting out new merchandise; Kept sales floor area clean; Assisted customers as needed; Conducted store inventory forms.
good,A typical day at target is meeting new and friendly people. what I've learned that each day is only what you make it if you think postive then your day will be great. Management is good they keep you informed with daily up dates and what is expected of you each quarter. My co-workers are very helpful to assit when ever need. the hardest part of my job is when I have exhausted all that I can do to help a customer and have to send them away unsatified. the most enjoyable part of my job is when I can make a customer leave with a smile and satified.
good,"I have learned alot, from cashiering to shipping and receiving. Great people to work with. Not able to advance, since I don't have a college degree. besides that it is a good place to work at."
good,"One day at work there was a guest that was trying to find out if we had a shaving cream product, he looked lost so i assisted him and found the product for him...problem solved and our guest was happy then told my manager that i was a very helpful, i learned that when you do good for other people,good things will come back to you. I enjoy working one on one with my fellow co-workers, we work well together and get alone just great, but the hardest part about the job is making sure we dont get some of the products mixed up because alot of them look the same almost. the most enjoyable part of the job is the great working enviornment and people im surrounded by...I look forward to going to work everyday on time."
good,"My typical day of work consisted of me handling the line the products were unloaded onto from the truck, then we would sort them out and designiate all products to their aile, we all then would stock."
good,"I worked in the Logistics Flow Team department in the morning helping with the flow of products to the floor. Every day was slightly different due to different sizes and types of merchandise trucks arriving. It was quite fast paced so communication and teamwork were important. Especially since the Bellingham, WA Target was supposedly one of the busiest in the country due to the amount of costumers traveling across the border from Canada."
good,overall it was a good place to work but there is no life work balance this is not the place if you have a family. excellent company for team leaders to grow and learn.
good,"A regular day at work would be me handling food orders to stock in the store. If the checklanes needed help, I would be there to help back up until the lines have declined a good amount. My co workers were usually friendly and got our work done on time. The real challenge for working at Target was that their managers always had favorites and prefer people to suck up to them. I was let go because I thought they were being unfair to certain team members including myself, so I stood up for myself in a rather calm way numerous times and lead to my termination."
good,"I would have to ring items up for customers, handle money. standing on your feet for so long Interacting with customers"
good,Work at target was a great iniative to my working career. The supervisors and managers can be a bit demanding sometimes.
good,I think target was a good place to work because it was my first time working overnight so I had to get use to the overnight hours and being in retail but overall it was a pretty nice place to work the people there was so nice they treated u like family and also my co-workers was some of the nicest people to work with
good,"Target has been a wonderful job for the last 8 years, however my work life balance is extremly unsatisfing and I am looking for a career versus a job at this time."
good,"Expect to be busy and on your toes. Breaks and lunches are short. There is a tv in the break room for employee as well as vending machines and refrigerators. Also a microwave, free coffee and a large sink for cleaning. Lots of tables available."
good,Great benefits/compensation
good,Provide customer service
good,Review salesfloor and correct any issues before store hit peak morning rush. Learned a great amount of merchandising skills from fellow team members.
good,"When working on the Sales Floor you're either positioned in either hardlines (everything else other then toys, clothes, and out of canned foods) or softlines (clothes). So, that left you a lot of work to do. I learned how teamwork is incredibly important when it comes to searching for the right item for your guest may need. My co-workers were very helpful in supporting me especially around busy times. The hardest part of the job was meeting their scheduling needs, although it was usually fine, but around Black Friday working a double shift on the same day (That was opening at midnight and closing at midnight) made it quite hard and tiring. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to meet new people and helping them find that special item for their loved ones."
good,"The setting is fast paced and enjoyable. The only down side to target (this only applies to the Madison, lower Milwaukee district) is that advancement is nearly impossible. The district leaders would rather hire someone out of college than promote someone from within."
good,"Target is a great company if you are looking to have a career in retail. I love the people I work with. I m greatful to have this job, but my career aspirations is to be an Audio Sound Engineer."
good,"Working there was a delight, management just needs to improve and make favortism not play into their decisions."
good,"Overal good experience,fair management,good co-workers,a lot of fun working for the company."
good,"Target is a great place to work in my opinion. Your co-workers (team members), are good people to work around, and are there for you when you need them. Management isn't too tight, they give you breathing room. Definitely a good place for a first job."
good,Very fast paced and physical. All team members have a long employment within Target.
good,My job at Target was good for the most part. I left because my hours were cut too low.
good,"Having worked for Target 7 years ago, I'm sure plenty has changed, whether for the better or worse. While I was there, the insurance was great and the pay was good for that point in time, but with everything going up, I can't say how much the pay has changed for the better/worse."
good,A typical day at work was you would be in a team and you would have a set assigned job that you did every day you worked. It was a great job until management did not know how to manage
good,Everyday has new and exciting challenges that have a rewarding feeling when overcome. Majority of the people I have worked with have become friends and a pleasure to work with to accomplish our daily goals.
good,very great place to work with great advancement opportunities and a very friendly staff.
good,"we go in and unload the truck, the put the product on the shelfs. Everyone is friendly, the job is pretty easy, we just have to do it in a timely manner."
good,"Target is set up to measure everyone's performance based on an elaborate system of computer-based metrics. In a retail sense, it's a great place to learn how it's done."
good,working hard and having a fast past. What I learned in target is backs stocklng and locating the iteams.
good,Enjoy working there.
good,While employed at Target it was actually the Superstore! This was my first job and I enjoyed spending time there.
good,"Working at Target taking on new challenges, assisting customers, and conversing with co-workers was the enjoyable part of my sale associates position."
good,"Was a typical retail work place. It was fun working with multiple people with different backgrounds. I was able to learn the basics of speaking spanish from co-workers, develop work friendships and was able to promote quickly."
good,"As a Sales Floor Teammate at Target I found that the atmosphere was very serious. Despite the fact that most of your daily duties are menial tasks, Target expects you to do them with 100% of your effort. At the Target I worked at, even talking to other employees was kind of looked down upon."
good,"Fun, stay busy, always helping customers and assisting with all new projects."
good,Work days consist of unloading product from freight trucks then stocking them on the sales floor. The hours you work are early in the morning starting usually at 4am.
good,"A typical work day includes putting clothes away, sorting through reshop, setting prices, and detail zoning areas. I learned the more customer you provide to each guest the better reviews you recieve, Management was ok. it seemed to change alot. My co workers are excellent. They are always willing to help. The hardest part of the job is adjusting to different management styles. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping guest."
good,"Hard work but nice managers and superiors made the experiance plausible. Fun loving enviorment and nice co-workers. Attainable work loads and small, but decent opportunity for advancement."
good,"I enjoy my job. I have learned something new almost everyday I go to work. I enjoy my co-workers and have fun when I am there. I love to make the other employees laugh, but make sure to stay on task. I wish there was more feedback given when people like myself want to advance in the company."
good,Target is a nice company it jus has bad staffing. Some of the staff will make you have a bad and some of them will make you have a wonderful day. You also have a very organized back room it just can become unsafe at times.
good,First job after high school but requested too many hours for a full time college student. I enjoyed the management and my co workers.
good,Target Corporation (Headquarters) is a great place to start your career. Everyone knows Target and the experience you get working for that company will stay with your resume for years to come!
good,"As a stocker, is not always easy to perform to the fullest in 4 a.m everyday but i have various methods of maneuvering around it thanks to older co workers.Management's awesome but sucks when it comes to hours, co-workers are interactive so is a nice environment. The hardest part of the job is just picking up the pace when starting your shift at 4 a.m. Co-workers make it a fun environment."
good,This job requires you to be independent and to take directions very well. The management is very direct.
good,Easy to make more money with wireless sales.
good,"Target was a great place to work and I enjoyed working there. However I did received few hours after Christmas time and it simply was too far for me to commute from work, school, and home for me to continue working. There was little room for advancement so I decided to expand my horizons. Other than that it was a great job."
good,"I have enjoyed working at Target for last 1.5 years ,everyone has great communication skills and are very understanding.The most enjoyable part of my day are the customers and working in different areas of the store.There are no hard parts to my day I am a driven individual so I make the most out of every day and situation"
good,"A typical day as a Merchandise Planning Business Analyst begins with a review of your business' sales performance from the prior day. Recaps will be sent to the team with an updated projection for the current week's sales. Weekly, a thorough analysis occurs weekly at team meetings where you present key findings related to regionality, productivity, style trends, beats to forecast/LY, and your reaction steps. Weekly, you also communicate with vendors to execute orders and potential contingency plans. As programs are being planned, you will set up items for replenishment and mark-down in systems, build sales history models, develop in-stock requirements. Aside from daily engagement with your buyer, you regularly collaborate with cross functional teams in sourcing (TSS), merchandise presentation (MPD), Target India (TI), and subject matter experts (ie; advertising, supply chain, climate strategy)."
good,"Not a bad company to work for, but in the end it's just another retail position"
good,I was able to really interact with guests and promote positive experiences at target. I learned many things here all over the store.
good,Okay place to work especially if you are working on building your leadership experience. Target values leadership and really sets its talent a part from other competitors.
good,Target as a company is a decent company to work for. Their compensation and benefits are competitive with many retailers out there. There is room for advancement in other areas of the store up to a certain point but not much room for advancement in the pharmacy.
good,"Former employee for Target, i enjoyed working with this company because the staff is friendly, we all help eachother. The store is very clean organized, not only was i an employee but also a customer. The store is very spacesious, many wonderful home improvements. Overall i would rate the store a 4 out of 5."
good,"Management could use a course in communication skills...but other than that, not a bad place to work."
good,I really enjoyed working at Target. I got to experience new things all the time. I went from just a cashier to working in the Cafe area to helping at guest service to basically being a managers assistant.
good,"I did everything just like others on the sales floor but cashier. I will always regret leaving for better pay only and failing my next job. I tried reapplying here often but now days they expect you to do more than my disabilities allow, what a shame."
good,I love working at target. The management and employees are great I just wish I got more hours.
good,"Target is a fun, upbeat, and face paced company. If you are comfortable working long hours and most holidays, including the entire month of November and December, then this is a great career for you. The overall company culture is very positive. You will work hard, and play hard."
good,Target is a great place to work. Its fun & there is always something new to learn.
good,I enjoyed working for target. They were very geared towards customer service. The training program was easy to understand and interesting. They really welcomed me as part of the team right away. I was always had someone that I could ask for help from if need be. Every one was encouraging and nice to me. Great place to work.
good,"Honestly its not a bad job, you need to work double time if you get hired on as seasonal to make sure you get kept on though. Beyond that, its pretty easy, you just need to learn to work relatively quickly. Most of the time if you ask your team lead for help with your section, at least in my store, they will either find someone who can help, or dive in themselves. Also, guest interactions go a lot quicker and smoother if you keep a mental FAQ of item locations. Like knowing where light bulbs are, or art supplies, etc. If you have to stop every time to go, ""Hold on, let me look it up"" people tend to get annoyed."
good,"Working at Target is very tedious but, its very energizing and fun. The only problem I have is that management gets away with saying whatever they want, whether it be threats or extremely personal and unprofessional life stories. And when you bring it up to those working above them, nothing gets done."
good,Like any place there is drama. But it's pretty laid back and straight forward. I enjoy working there. Benefits are only good if you get enough hours. They are flexible and understanding for the most part.
good,"*A typical day is consists mainly in product stocking and organizing, with a fair portion of customer service dispersed during the shift."
good,"I enjoyed working at Target although I was seasonal. And the fact that I was part time, while attending college. They scheduled me way to many hours. The pay was great for a college student, but the job security and scheduling were the only things I didn't like working there."
good,"I worked up in the Cartersville store and it truly was a great place to work. Some managers were excellent and made you feel like family. Extremely flexible with my work/school schedule. I moved up from a part time morning freight position to a full time overnight backroom associate in a matter of two months. $11 an hour wasn't great for the expectations of the job but they have now raised it up to $13 and probably will continue to raise it. I transferred to Marrietta and it was one of the worst experiences working at a job in my life. Absolutely horrible management.. they cut my hours down to 3 a week particularly on SATURDAYS.  Backroom was a hostile and stressful environment.  Manager was rude, condescending, inappropriate, and underqualified to manage."
good,"Target is a great place to work because of the people that you work with. The culture is fun and friendly which makes working there feel more like a family than other places. The pay however, is not very competitive in comparison to other similar workplaces. Also, the opportunity for advancing doesnt reflect that of a meritocracy but rather how much management likes your personality."
good,"Working there for the short time I did I was able to gain a lot of retail experience on top of my previous jobs my customers service improved greatly , if I was to have stayed working for target I would of loved the opportunity"
good,"Very often, I am surrounded by personable people who help create a positive work environment. Management is fair and flexible with my schedule during the busy season; however, hours are limited and not guaranteed during the off-season."
good,"Between the year 1999 and 2000, when I left. I worked domestic dept. I loved it but I was over worked. I trained, worked the floors and cashiered. I did over time at times. And through all my hectic schedule, I still gave the customers an over all success (so what I was told). I put myself into their shoes, giving them great service and product they would love."
good,"Okay, let be real my experience at target was about average.  I went in having the intention of not being there long. It was the summer of my freshman year of high school and I needed a job BADLY. The work atmosphere is very relaxed and the employees are friendly, well the people at my branch were. I can't speak for the other branches. Overall the summer was hot as Satin ballsack and the pay funded my summer activities."
good,"I enjoyed working for Target. The managers were friendly and helpful and most of the customers were nice as well. It was a relaxed work environment as far as dress code and such. But it was still structured as far as breaks and meal times. The most challenging thing about Target was that if you were sick or needed to be gone last minute, they were not very accommodating. The best part was the discount and the people that you get to meet and work with."
good,"Target was a nice change of pace in my working history, the managers tend to be pretty helpful and the other employees are good colleges, the work itself is pretty decent too for the amount you get paid, overall, no complaints on my end. If you can get a position here, do."
good,"Target is a good starting place and overall nice workplace. My employees were fun to work with, the managers weren’t terrible, but a little strict, which is understandable. It was my first job and I was treated nicely for the most part!"
good,"You really learn a lot there! Everyone wants to help you! Managers were absolutely wonderful, showing in various ways that we matter within the company! Customers were nice always appreciated us for the hard work we did, through everything! Great place to work! 😁"
good,"Target pays well for the environment that you're in. However, there is limited growth potential and can often feel like you're being asked to do things outside your function as a manager."
good,Fun and stress free workplace.  Nice people who are very helpful with training.  The hours are not ideal as you will have to work weekends and holidays. Good pay.
good,At target I learned how to keep customers satisfied while also learning how to have teamwork in a work place. They are very diverse and accepting as well as understanding
good,"Job is fun and laid back! Get your stuff done and they are happy and everyone has a good time. Hours get cut and expect the same amount of work done sometimes.. It is probably the only frustrating part of the job, however, this comes with pretty much any job!"
good,"Target is a great company who almost always will go out of their way to make you happy about what you do. There wasn't a single time I was denied a request for anything, no matter what the situation was."
good,"When working at Target they have a routine which is organized and not sporadic which helps a lot. I enjoyed my co workers they were fun and talkative, I learned more about the retail industry."
good,"Management is great, easy to get along with. Work isn't hard but is continuous. The worst thing about them is the lack of benefits (unless you get a Team Leader job, which they only hire from within). Overall, a great place to work while looking for a better job."
good,"Overall Target is a good place to work. The people are great, the managers are helpful, the pay is good."
good,"It is a good place to work at as a first job, you really start to get the hang of everything once you know what to do and how to do it, and if you dont have any Experience, you learn while you working."
good,Job can be fulfilling but the hours have dwindled down and workload has stayed the same. Pay is good but that contributes to less hours. Overall if you get good management and become an asset more hours may become available.
good,It’s cool not bad been there for awhile great workplace great people great opportunities to grow great environment great pay not always easy but it’s cool job
good,"If you are looking for a place to work at while attending school, or as a secondary/seasonal job, Target is definitely a good choice. While not a tightly knit workplace, people are by and large respectful and courteous, and I have managed to befriend people and work well alongside them."
good,"I love shopping at target, so why not work there? This is a great company, everyday is different but never dull. There is always something to do and if you like being apart of a team you'll enjoy working at target as well."
good,"There really is no typical day at Target. I came from a professional office setting. Target is nothing like that. The most difficult part is adjusting to the various expectations of the many upper management people to which one is answerable. Corporate has great ideas, but those are seldom instituted properly which causes great unease in the building. I genuinely enjoy the Team, and I resolve each day to the most I can for each of them whether business or personal."
good,It’s a job that has some long term views but a friend of mine worked there three years and still only gets 13.which is cool but it’s like when are you gonna start giving him a raise .
good,"In my experience, the management team tends to bond very well to their employees and is flexible in offering hours and meeting employee needs.  However, there is very little incentive to grow, especially since they recently docked the pay of the Customer Service Managers to be on par with the cashiers they manage, even though their duties far exceed those of the cashiers."
good,I enjoyed working at this company. I worked mostly in the clothing department but would help out in the stock room  and other areas if needed. I filled in for my manager while she was on maternity leave for about 12 weeks.  During that time I was given an award for the best clothing department in the region.
good,Fast past environment. Diverse culture. Management was fair. Sometimes the timelines on completing work was difficult but attainable. I really enjoyed working with the team.
good,One thing I extremely enjoyed about working at Target is that it always kept me busy which made time go by fast which is nice when you're working 8 hour shifts.
good,I worked in the Tech department and I thought it was a great expirance. Everyone you work with makes you feel like you are in a family because of how willing they are to help new comers and how knowledgeable they are with all products. I wish I could have worked more than just seasonal because I had a great time.
good,"I was very unhappy with the management at Target because they never helped me succeed."
good,"It's a great job if its a summer, first time, or part-time job. I wouldn't recommend making it your career. Higher job positions prefer people on the younger side. A great attitude will get you farther up the food chain than experience and credentials. If you're lower on the food chain get ready for high expectations with consequences if your ""goals"" are not met."
good,Nice place to work but the hours are limited to much.Good working environment. Nice coworkers. Meet new people.Good benefits. Company has good reputation.
good,"- Daily work consisted of cashiering, greeting customers upon entry, assisting customers with questions and/or concerns, and restocking and shelving merchandise. "
good,"target kept me on my toes. always having something to do made time fly by quickly, not to mention the cheerful environment made working there fun.  the hardest part on that job was keeping the guest happy. Not all of them are easy going but we managed."
good,"I loved my time at Target and if I had to I would go back. The management team that was there when I left was a lot better than when I started. However, always be open to change because it will happen, and often."
good,"A typical day at work can vary. You typically would start with getting your area's items delivered from the truck, push them to the sales floor, and put them in the correct spot. "
good,Target is good place to work some managers don’t know how to manage want to use their power to belittle the people we all need one another to make the job easier to do
good,"Its a fun place to work, however management could be better, and they could offer more hours so you keep insurance, the team is fun to work with and everyone there is nice"
good,"it's a nice place to work.  there's people from all over the world that works for target.   Target is fast, fun and friendly.  You can also ask to be trained in other areas of the warehouse."
good,"It was never a dull day at work. A typical day is taking care of guest's needs and making sure the work area was clean, management was sometimes helpful when they are not busy."
good,the people I worked with were great and it was a great job! however its hard to move up in the ranking ladder so work there with plans of just getting experience rather than investment
good,"Management was very unprofessional when it came to the end of seasonal periods, I was not notified that seasonal period was over nor was I notified I was cut from my position"
good,"I honestly loved working at Target. It was so nice to get lost in basic tasks that had me moving around and doing things with my hands. The people where really nice and cool, including management. I actually felt like I was a part of their team. I just wish the position hadn't been seasonal."
good,"While I worked at Target, I as constantly reminded how invested and friendly the teams were in the success of not just their store, but their teams. Each wanted to build each other up and make working there better."
good,"Stationed at Guest Service I dealt with drive-ups, customer service calls and questions, returns, helping customers pay for bills, and occasionally helping guest check-out."
good,I really injoy working at Target . But the store I work at most of the Manager was pretty chill you know . But if wanna work at Target it have its Pros and cons. And the reason I said that because I Worked on the cashier and when I had to learn how to work the Register. It was pretty easy. The Cons about working at Target they will be on your butt to try to get customers. To apply for there Red Cards. And most of the times people did not want the red card . But that was all .
good,"Working seasonal feels like coming into a nice foster family and being treated like everyone else. Target pushes you hard to get as much done as possible in one day, they feed you and pay you decently, but at the end of the day, you still go home after the holidays with a sour taste in your mouth because they didn't want to keep you."
good,It was a great Place to start for retail. I learned a lot. I had experience working in a fast paste but this showed me another level of doing so ! A lot of heavy lifting !
good,"It's just the world of retail I guess. Everytime I worked hard, I felt like I was wasting my time. There's no distinction between a hard worker and a lazy worker. No benefit or encouragement to work harder. But Overall, I loved the people and the job."
good,I enjoyed my time at Target until a new manager started that did not care about people’s health or lives or boundaries when it came to how many hours you wanted to work  The HR person at this location does a terrible job with all the college kids and their schedules and not conflicting with work  This was a second job for me and they would have had me working 30+ hours per week if I let them
good,"Pretty cool place to work. If you do your job, no problems. "
good,Not bad its a job but could be better overall because we have lost alot of family time because we have to close alot  and missed time. So thats why we are losing as a company because we lost time
good,"Retail can be tough... tougher than a lot of people think, especially during the holidays!  The people are fun and really grows to be like a  family!!"
good,"While I have only been employed at Target for about a month now, I highly enjoy this work environment.  Immediately, the hiring manager was very energetic and inviting.  Also, the interview questions accurately assessed my current knowledge regarding guest service and handling guest concerns."
good,It's a good place to work but the pressure sometimes is too much and direction is somewhat clear but the work load is crazy  most of the time just be ready to work.
good,The environment is welcoming . They do these things called huddles and they thank the employees for their growth. It’s quite nice and everyone always has a smile on their face.
good,"I started as a seasonal at Target who at the end of the season got hired. I moved from regular team member to electronics team member and then mobile electronics team member plus which is a team member in ""training"" to be a team lead. I believe at Target you can get one of the best customer experience in all the retailers. The only thing I did not like was management where most of the time I had better solutions that the team leads but never agreed to let me speak."
good,We did an overnight shift to remodel and it was also a seasonal position unfortunately they did not keep me but the jobs was alright and there were some nice coworkers too
good,The job was very physically and emotionally demanding but the managers made sure to make it easier for us. Our leads and structure of the apparel had a lot of favoritism and lack of communication.
good,"Target has been a wonderful workplace, I’ve gotten support from my team and management as I was going to school and volunteering to get my degree. Unfortunately, I am unable to use my bachelors degree at target, and this is the reason I am seeking for employment with another facility so that I can achieve my goals and dreams."
good,"The job is great as a first job, but there is little room for advancement, and when positions open, they hire outside of Target. Other than that, they pay well for a retail position with it only going up from there."
good,"Even though they are very family based company, there are a lot of rules that I didn't learn until later on of me working there. There were management problems that I wasn't happy with."
good,I had a great time working at target. Wouldn’t mind going back part-time. I would still be working for target if I had reliable childcare after my maturity leave.
good,"Overall the work environment is nice, they care about their employees, the work was typical like any other retail job. However I do wish they gave their employees a little more flexibility on giving time off. I never understood that considering we have so many people working in the store."
good,Target is a performance based company focused on leadership and the development of leaders.  Career advancement exists for those with a high success dedication and achievement orientation
good,I enjoyed working there . Even though it was brief because it was only a seasonal postion . I would go back for a permanent if offered. Relaxed but face paced.
good,"Working in apparel and accessories at Target is enjoyable for the most part. The workload is average but can sometimes pile up depending on the week. My coworkers are some of the nicest people, and we all try to help each other where we can. However management does not seem to understand or care about what we have to get done or how we as employees operate. They like to boss rather than lead, meaning they would rather walk around the store telling others what to do rather than try to find ways for tasks to be completed, even if it means that they have to roll up their sleeves and work alongside us. Other locations might be different, but the leadership at my store is lacking, and all of the employees feel it."
good,Deffielty a job you could make into a career. great benefits and job culture you could easily fall in love with the environment.great amount of growth depending on the person.
good,Not a bad place to work at. At least a person was off by 10. The pay wasn’t so great for the living area. But a person can move up pretty quickly because the turnover side.
good,"Some good benefits, lots of local discounts for working at Target as well, management is usually really great to work with, and the atmosphere is good. Target is a great place to work if you are a people person, it's quite expected that you attempt to greet every guest that you see and be as helpful as possible."
good,"A typical day of work consist of being fast paced production to hit your daily goal for shipment. "
good,"Merchandising, helping guests, and having fun was my typical day at target! Team leads were directly involved and were always boosting morale around the store."
good,"Working for Target is rewarding, it helped me figure out more or less where I want to be in life and the friends I've made there made my thoughts concrete."
good,"Working for Target is pretty great actually, just really depends on the store and the area in which your Target is located. There are a lot of good values at Target, but some of the processes is unnecessarily tedious for no reason. Overall I would say it's a really good job."
good,Working at target they were flexible with hours which i liked. It was an easy job. I would clock in and go check in with whoever i was working with and they would send me to my spot and that was pretty much it. They would check in every once in a while.
good,Worked in the stockroom which was the best thing. Had to stock supplies and was able to play music at the same time. A lot of days it gets really busy and rarely had those days when it was slow.
good,"I'm the front of store attendant ( cart attendant), so I'm not sure where to actually begin. I'm usually busy from clock in, to clock out. My immediate supervisor will call me over the walkie when I'm needed. I go outside and rid the parking lot of carts by bringing them back inside. I also maintain the restrooms clean and tidy for guests. I walk around the inside of the store and fill the spill stations with liquid absorbent, paper towels, and other clean up materials. It's an area with filled with young workers, so its very new gen type of work environment. Real subtle, the management is great, really flexible with hours if someone is in school or has a second job."
good,Loved working here while I did. Seasonal time was rough though and it wasn’t for me. Great experience and social. Great starting pay and work atmosphere.
good,"I received a 50 cent raise from team member to supervisor, but the level of responsibility was significantly greater. Furthermore, the managers couldn't seem to agree on how they wanted certain things performed, resulting in a constant slew of misinformation, In short, I was underpaid for the work I feel I performed and frustrated by the inconsistent managerial tactics."
good,"Target is a very good company to work for. "
good,"Typically I would stock the shelves and assist any guest with electronics related questions, as well as cash them out. I liked the management here as I think they tried to be as flexible as possible with shifts and hours."
good,"I would stock shelves, assist customers when needed, reorganized shelves. It’s very fast paced when working there and in an average day it would get pretty busy."
good,"You check to see what shifts you have, you can put your shift up on the board for other to take if you can't work it. You'll go in and do your assigned role, it's great for people who like interacting with guests and enjoy helping others. You get a discount as an employee, the culture is fast paced and modern. The hardest part is getting enough hours, they recently installed modernization and that gives you less hours but you're expected to do the same amount of work as if you had more hours. Helping guests is the most enjoyable part, it's fun having a repeating guest and asking them how they are."
good,"Target was a good company to work for, however, too much pressure on meeting quotas for immunizations and other services made it hard to focus on everyday prescriptions. Also, not enough tech help"
good,"They are very flexible with scheduling, so if you're a student, busy parent, or second jober - this job can be a good place to work.  It's a pretty fast-paced environment, so the days fly by relatively quick."
good,"Target is a great place to work. Everyone is like a big family, we look out for each other and there's always something new to learn everyday. I work in Starbucks and one of the best parts of my day is when the guest makes you feel appreciated because of your great job well done."
good,I learned a tremendous amount of customer service skills and was able to apply what I already knew from my previous experience towards my days there.  The culture was laid back and fun but was serious during those rush hours.  The hardest part of the job was ensuring the customer left happy even when we were not able to fulfill their request when we were out of stock in store.  The most enjoyable part of the job there was the people I got to work with.  They made the work enjoyable even on our slow days.
good,"its a fun environment to work and most of the managers are super cool. the only downside is that your schedule can be different from week to week and your hours can drop at anytime for any reason. one week you can get 35 hours, next week you'll get 12 hours."
good,"I enjoyed working at Target for the fun environment. Target does have some really great leaders, i unfortunately just had an Executive that i did not trust in nor did he really do his best to assist in my career advancement. I did however, have a great HR Leader and HR TL that helped with anything that I needed. My only reason for leaving Target is the level of stress I had to deal with due to the lack of support from my Executive Leader."
good,"When I first began working there we had a direct supervisor, except she would often be scheduled to work in the market department so we hardly saw her. After she left, they took their time finding us a new supervisor. In turn, things didn't go too well. Essentially for the time that I was there, the Starbucks department (in which I worked) lacked supervision and was often looked at as the black sheep of the store."
good,"Understand sales and payroll goals."
good,"You really get your money's worth with this job. Your tasks are straight forward, but depending on what area of the store you work at, you end up taking on extra tasks or work. It's fast-paced most of the time which some people enjoy but others don't."
good,"I learned many different things from working in retail"
good,"I used to work at a target in MA before i lived in FL. MA was probably the best and then when i moved out here it was decent. The managers were great except for 1 or 2 depending on your shift. I was able to take time off, decent pay, good hours. "
good,"As a cashier I dealt with the public. Most days it was okay. Now and then  you had your ""grumpy"" patrons. that was part of the job. I learned how to run the register. The management was helpful and available when I had a question. I enjoyed the co-workers and we all got along very well."
good,"It is very important to be a team player at target, and I love working in a team setting. Everyday we set a goal as a group and we work together to meet it!"
good,"It was fun to work there but there really was a lot of lack communication and people there are really good to work with but there’s lack in the system, and there was multiple mangers hired and some laid off while I was working there"
good,"If you like to keep busy all day, Target is the place for you. Good discounts and extra discounts on healthy foods. Lots of opportunity to cross train in departments to obtain additional; hours"
good,There are a lot of responsibilities which is why they pay so much. Some things seem impossible at times but you are always encouraged to ask for help.
good,"Work environment is fast-paced and often stressful. The stores are large and teamwork is vital, which does not always happen. Smaller department mangers are effective team leads, but higher-level managers will micromanage and overload you with priorities."
good,"It is a very good job, but it all depends on the management. Management changes how the store is run and how things are done in the store. The pay is good for a starting job and the people working there are very nice."
good,Normal Retail Store. It was very stressful and rewarding at the same time. It was nice that most of the time I was doing stuff with customers. It was understaffed though and we got yelled at all the time from the mounds of piled up work that could never be finished.
good,Overall target is a good employer. They pay well for the job they ask the team todo. I would recommend target for anyone looking to gain customer service experience.
good,"I was making a pitiful amount at the last place I worked, so going from that to $13/hour was very nice; not to mention I requested that I receive 30-40 hours per week and every week I receive ~40 hours. The staff is nice and management (especially HR) is very understanding, and the job itself is fast-paced and makes the day go by quickly."
good,"Target is a great stepping stone job. They a flexible to a fault and that is the reason I stayed so long. I had kids at home that needed me and now they are fairly independent so I can peruse my own interests now."
good,"I get along with everyone I work with there. Changing availability is simple and can be done, but in the beginning they tend to schedule you work nights only. Getting along with management depends on you."
good,Target was a nice place to work. Training was a bit poor due to the hectic holiday season but team members were always happy to help teach me something I didnt know.
good,I think that target is a good employer as long as you do not stick around too long. The work culture is nice and they are good at hiring others that elevate that culture but if you work there long term without the opportunity of advancement then it can become the worst kind of dead-end.
good,"mostly folded clothes, cashiering was stressful. management was nice. coworkers didnt always try hard enough. easy to joke around. had a good time. couldnt put in the hours"
good,I was promoted and given a raise within one year of working there. You get recognized and acknowledged when you do something right. The hours are flexible and the managers are understanding
good,The hourly pay can be very good if Target gives you enough hours to make it worth it.  The boss were stressed out all the time especially around holidays but they managed with what they got. My coworkers were the best part of the job.
good,"The days would come and go. you clock in, do all the assessments that were assigned to you and you excel at those task the best way you can. Our management team was okay to say the most. the hardest part of the day was during the weekends because New Orleans is a very busy city meaning our store was packed. It was all worth it once i saw the smiles of satisfaction from our guests."
good,"Make sure you are well stocked and brand."
good,"The management tried hard to create a good, fun, and collaborative environment. Job was not too hard, it had it's moments of stress but overall it was a breeze."
good,"The Target I worked at was very slow most of the time which made for pretty boring work days. I spent the majority of my time doing busy work. The management team was lacking. You would either have twenty people scheduled to work and have nothing to do, or you'd have five people scheduled and be stressed out the whole day."
good,Target is the kind of job you definitely don’t bring home with you. You can volunteer for extra hours on their in store job board covering days other team members want to take off. Happiness in the job depends a lot on the managets’ style of management. Some you can never please and some treat you respectfully.
good,"Target is a good second job for the holiday season.  I did not like it as a full time position after the holidays."
good,"Target maintained a small edge and was always willing to try out new solutions. However, movement was slow and generally most are cogs in the machine. It's a curious business given the rise of e-commerce."
good,I worked there for a year and it was a cool place to work with especially since the other workers were cool and helpful and the managers were nice and willing to help.
good,Provide employees who have worked there on a long term basis more opportunity to advance and increase review rate for longer term employees. Offer better health benefits
good,Amazing people to work with.  Coworkers become your friends and family.  Opportunities to transfer to different locations or to different departments as you grow and your interests change.  Great benefits for management including discount.
good,"If you like retail and an all over the place schedule this is for you. If you like working weekends and holidays, this job is for you.  If you love interacting with all sorts of people, this is for you."
good,"Honestly the amount of work that each individual worker will have to put in seems reasonable on paper, but the expectation is for you to go above and beyond so you may still get nagged at if you are already doing what you're supposed to. The pay is fair for what you do and if you've been a good worker for at least 3 months then most often then not you will get good hours."
good,"Nice people on staff varied duties, and flexible hours. An open door policy,  for communication with management .cross training available for knowledge in other departments."
good,In a perfect world it could be an awesome and simple job with decent pay. But management and changes from corporate make things much harder than they need to be.
good,Is a good place to start. Little advancement opportunities. Lots of hours. Management has favorites. Always nagged about numbers even though you don’t have a “quota”.
good,"Is fun but exhausting some times.  anyways  it is fun working at target, My supervisor trust me with any decisions that I needed to make and that made me more secure and confident on my work and decisions"
good,"During the winter you'll end up with 39 hours, and in the summer you will have 5. Good environment while you are there however. Also, they provide plenty of breaks and the pay is very good for part time."
good,Though the work there was somewhat bland I found the people there to be very interested in the well being of their customers and wore the brand of target proudly.
good,"As retail jobs go, it's gooPeople are generally friendly and fun to work with.  Only drawback is pay -- everyone pretty much makes the same.  I got a small raise, then the base pay was raised for everyone so I wasn't making any more than people just hired..  I don't think it's fair someone who's been working there for 6 years makes the same as someone who's been there only 3 years.  Also, lots of 5 1/2 hour shifts when a 6 hour shift wouldn't cost them any more, but employee would get an unpaid 30 minute lunch - makes for a better break in the day.  Employee discount is good and very useful. Get additional discount for purchase of fruits and vegetables.  Again, as retail goes, it's a good place to work."
good,Do my every day basics of sorting and inventory.  The most enjoyable part of my job was working softlines sorting items for crew to work on the floor.  The hardest part of the job was unloading the truck. It was very time consuming slowing down our progress.
good,"I had a routine to follow nothing really hard."
good,"It was a great job to work at ,later on the Management had a tough time trying to find people to cover shifts since people wouldn't show up . They do have expectations , So if you are looking for some hours and you are a hard working person this job is for you !"
good,It be hard work the boss be on you heavy help people organize stuff at the store the lunch breaks be short try your hardest at anything you know and keep work
good,"Unless you talk to your managers or any form of higher up, they will not move you around or even consider moving you up a position. Also, you have to constantly be on watch about breaks and lunches because they will forget, but it will be a write up for you if you miss it."
good,I had to leave due to childcare conflict but the job was good. The company encouraged cross training and advancement. I wish there was more  leniency with regard to acknowledgement of childcare allowances but I can't/won't hold the management of my specific store responsible.
good,"I didn't mind working at Target, I was a cashier so some days were a little slow but other than that, it was fine working there. I know they have life insurance due to my mom working there as well and passing away and we received the payment without expecting anything from the company."
good,This store was an ok store to work for but if you didn’t kiss their a** they wouldn’t give you hours and they constantly picked on you about every little thing you did and didn’t do
good,"Starting at 7 a.m. I work my area alone for three hours cleaning and helping guests. Then after 10 a.m. I pull my freight out to the floor setting up new features and helping my team. The management there is fairly good, they communicate very well and they hear people out when they have a problem. Overall the environment is very fast paced and costumer service based. The hardest part of the job is maintaining a whole clothing area by myself when my area is busy. My favorite part of the job is interacting and having conversations with our guests."
good,I worked here for almost 2 years and I really enjoyed it! The pay is great and they give you great hours UNLESS you’re a cashier. Cashiers do not get more than 25 hours from my experience. I worked at the starbucks inside & loved it! Management was great besides a few bad eggs. Only thing I can complain about is that it’s not easy to move up. I was promised a promotion that I never saw.
good,"Target employees are taken care of and are offered a generous wage.  If you work hard and put in an honest effort, you won't have any problem with your departments supervisors.  However, it will start to feel like you're not accomplishing anything, the work really starts to pile up.  You'll start to question whether or not you're really doing enough in a day."
good,it was a pleasant experience but the management  team always gived of a vibe that they were better then the employed by the way they speak directly to them.
good,"i missed working at target so i returned to the company at a different store than the one i was originally at and i am the saddest i’ve ever been in my life. target CEO, if you see this, please put out an executive order to send me back."
good,I loved target it was an easy job I caught on really quick and I did it while I was 9 months pregnant that’s the only reason I even left or else I would’ve stayed.
good,"Great place if you like to stay busy while you're working. sometimes can be a little stressful in peak periods, but the pay off was almost always worth it."
good,"I loved the people I worked with at Target, management was always patient with me when I had personal issues, and supportive and enthusiastic when I would succeed. It really felt like a family of some kind during my time working there. I left for personal reasons, and not really anything to do with Target though I will say that I did not feel like I could ever move past being a general cashier, which was frustrating. Target is a place I could come back to though and I would still recommend working here to people that want to work in retail."
good,"Every day at work was a new adventure but it was often riddled with difficult projects and limited time to complete them. Different employees were held to different standards which often put a higher workload on harder working employees. Working in the Apparel and Accessories department had a lot of great guest interaction but there are also a lot of rude guests with little regard for the employees that would scatter clothes all over the floor. The most enjoyable part of the job was probably the good coworkers, although they weren't all good. Definitely dependent on your individual coworkers and management as well as the volume of customers that come through that store."
good,Target is an excellent company to work for if you want to gain experience in the retail industry. You will learn skills that you can use in future positions in your career.
good,"The pay was really good but I felt as though we were constantly understaffed. There was not much help for those working in the Starbucks area because when things got hectic, not many people were trained to help with the chaos"
good,I didn’t mind the work but I was definitely not ready to transition from regular working hours to overnight and it had an effect on my productivity and overall attitude toward the job.
good,I am an older adult so just wanted something that paid well enough to pay the bills. Pay is decent and you can usually get plenty of hours each week. Work life balance is difficult because your schedule changes every week. Some shifts like 1:15 - 9:45 take up pretty much all of your day.
good,The work environment was fairly quick paced. Management was very helpful and polite when asked for assistance. Although the position was temporary I'd recommend this job to people who are new to the work field and/or people who are re-entering the work field.
good,"Overall, working at Target was a positive experience. Gained a lot of knowledge about the retail business, loss prevention and teamwork. Although, the work can be challenging and the pressures that are sometimes put on you a bit overwhelming, at the end of the day it was rewarding."
good,"The people make up Target, I had good people I worked with.The  company over all is good.The only problem is there is a lot of sales you get more hours,if  sales are slow you get less hours."
good,The job itself was fine but the Team Lead was very rude and unprofessional. Threatened with my job if I didn't come in 2 hours early. (Normal time was 6am)
good,I had a great experience working at Target and I would recommend it to someone that is looking for a job or that is interested in working there. The interview process was not that hard.
good,"Target as a whole is a fun place to work with wonderful people, however, i feel communication there leaves much to be desired. 1 person will tell you one thing, another person a different thing. It can be very hard to get a handle on what's what."
good,"Open the store and walk the store to make sure everything is fine with the building inside and out.  Get setup for the truck process to make sure for a successful day.   Once my employees come in; supervise the unload process and maintain a steady pace.  After the unload follow up with the stocking team and other work centers/ departments.  Once the truck process is in good shape I sit down and doing any clerical work that needs to be done for the day (attendance, performance, and trainings).  Workplace culture is great between leaders and communication for the most part runs smoothly."
good,Would recommend to anyone who is nervous about getting a job or getting a job that's too stressful. Target is a great place to work and really knows how to take care of their employees.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job for me was engaging with the guests. I got to meet all kinds of people, some nice and some not so nice. But there were plenty each day that made me smile and laugh and look forward to working the next day."
good,"I was only hired at target as a seasonal, Therefore I don't think I was there long enough to make a qualified opinion on the companies practices or policies."
good,Great opportunities for career development.  Excellent management training available.  Very team oriented with the ability to take ownership of your work.
good,"Great company but did not have the best experience working for them. I could never get more hours no matter how hard I worked, and I even tried to be cross trained."
good,"The Target Management & Team Members are Friendly & Personable, Willing to Advise & Assist You, When Needed and Available When They're Not Working On Their Other Projects."
good,"Target was a fun place to work at. A day at the target I worked at would always be different, whether it be with guests or team members. The benefits are pretty slim, but that's really if you're a part timer"
good,"The pay is really great and awesome discounts. However, its badly managed and very high school drama. You're often required to work by yourself and supervisors barely help. It's very stressful and high-paced so you have to be quick on your feet."
good,Good place to work very busy at times but my co workers are team players management are very understanding when it comes to trying to solve an issues or problem
good,"I liked the job to start off with. It was a good experience to be able to make close friends and learn how to make all the guests happy. My favorite part about working at target is when we get nice meals delivered to us at work from different restaurants in the area to celebrate our hard work for events. For example: Thanksgiving, Christmas, Memorial Day, etc it just depends on our big sales that we have as well."
good,"Target has good reputation for offering competitive wages, collaborative training to prepare you for your new job, easy access to HR if needed, good benefits, game rooms to relax and drop a load off during your break, newer campus in Brooklyn Park, MN, easy access to major freeways, loved it but had to relocate back home"
good,"Target lacks resources needed to advance any further in the company and hours are sporadic, however they do make up for it by having a very positive and productive team, as well as a relaxing and moderate paced work setting."
good,Target was a good place for me to explore my advancments in being a guest ambassador loved the customers and hours were great. Honestly I feel as though the company runs off a senority based scale when it comes to promotions
good,It's a awesome space to work. I worked at Starbucks and target giving me the opportunity to put smiles on people faces was amazing! Everyone is truly nice there and make yhe space great.
good,I have loved my years with Target. I have been there almost 12 years. It has been a wonderful experience to develop my management skills. I have really been challenged to plan ahead and strategize big events.
good,Target is a great company that will welcome you if you do the right thing and its a great way to net work if your trying to get to places because you don't know who will walk through the doors
good,Target is a quick paced organized competitive place to work I would recommend this job to a friend if you are okay with the set rate of pay. Would not recommend this job if you are looking to advance.
good,There was some co workers that didn't like me because i would ask questions a lot. I had one of the managers stand up for me when my co worker was yelling at me because i was in his way
good,Target provides a good work environment for its employees and provides the necessary tools and training needed to be successful in the work place. Target leaders listen and treat their teammates with respect and appreciation.
good,"A constant change in staff, the highest level of managers don't typically listen to standard workers and their ideas/ opinions of operations. The people are very nice however the managers with the exception of one or two do not typically work as hard as they force the general workers to."
good,My immediate supervisors were unpleasant to work with from attitude to just being positive it was difficult.   I really liked my job and target but couldn't take the managers
good,"Really great part time job "
good,"It was very enjoyable working on a regular day. At Target, We were on in this together, helping each other, and teaching each other new things! It was always nice to speak to guests and converse with them."
good,Great company to work for.  Fast paced and very team oriented.  They wanted all employees to be the best and they helped to achieve that through classes and meeting walkthroughs
good,"The cool thing about target is that there is a best practice for every process in the store which streamlines learning and training. Also, you always have access to your direct leader for any needs you may have."
good,"Cashiering is pretty straight-forward and easy. Target does push for RedCards and meeting sales goals, but it is what it is. Not too bad of a job for the pay; however, it gets dull and lifeless every once in a while."
good,If you like the hustle and bustle then this is the place for you. Always something new to work on and something to learn. They really want people to advance in job positions.
good,"the job was fast paced and with cashiers we did customer service"
good,"The first 2 years was a great experience after that I felt that there was no room for growth,but other that that I loved working with people and meeting new guests everyday."
good,"Merchandise stocking and display set up using proper equipment and techniques. "
good,"I had a great time assisting guest. My only concern with the location is that the employees don’t take coworkers serious. I have had plenty of talks of how i could be beneficial to the company, but they looked passed me I am a hard worker."
good,"Target was a great way for me to expand my work experience. I had only worked in food service before working at Target. A lot of responsibility is given to team members which justifies Target's high minimum wage. As an Electronics sales associate I was in charge of maintaining electronics' pricing and clearance end caps, stocking shelves, maintaining displays all while providing a superb guest experience."
good,"Working here isn't too hard the work is pretty straight forward simply helping out customers and stocking shelves, however it gets crazy during the holiday season. The coworkers I've met have been kind people but not everyone takes there job seriously. They are extremely stingy on hours"
good,"It was good, but it was retail. My location was in a huge shopping center so we were constantly packed. It was pretty stressful and fast paced, but luckily the managers there know how much the shoppers can suck and they did their best to make our time enjoyable. My other coworkers were pretty great too. You just have to constantly be dealing with terrible people who can't understand why you should be treated like a human being, as is the standard with any retail job. This one at least had good management and really nice pay."
good,good people and good pay. the guests were usually nice. they never asked tooo much of anty of the workers and the employees were awesome so it was like a brotherhood of men. a benevolent brotherhood of men
good,"As Asset Protection, you were often working alone overseeing the store floor, via cameras or walking the floor yourself. Much like the military, it's a lot of quiet and talking with floor employees, and occasionally helping out with various tasks, interspersed with brief moments of excitement when theft is in progress or someone is becoming unruly."
good,"very friendly place to work, nice management, Easy going, fast pace, standing and walking the entire shift, Very strict about being on time but breaks and lunches are more relaxed"
good,"On an average day you would clock in and go gather the equipment that would help you do your job. Equipment is provided, but from my understanding certain stores actually do not get enough walkie-talkies nor enough PDA's for their floor employees. You get your instruction and tasks by your team lead and go carry them out until done. They'll be in contact to make sure your department area is taken care of and your lunch times will be handed out to you during these group meetings."
good,"A typical day at Target tends to stay steady throughout the day. Weekends are very busy days and holidays. A few things I learned   while working at Target would be how to be respectful when costumers are not, communication skills, responsibility, and leadership. The management at Target could be improved, but it's not the worst. There are times where you have to tell your manager multiple times before they get to what you asked. Being a high school student and working here can be hard. Hours are not flexible here. I learned that it was hard for me to work 20+ hours a week and balance school. Balancing school and 20 hour a week was probably the hardest part of the job. The pay is fair and you get a discount. The staff are very nice and easy to talk to and will make you laugh."
good,"Overall it is a great place to work. The staff is super friendly and willing to help guests. Everyone knows what they are doing and loves to do their job. The workplace is, however, super competitive to advance in. Through working at Target I have learned more people skills than my previous job, I have learned to be patient and to give my full attention to everyone that comes into our store and be willing to help no matter the situation. I have learned how to set POG's and VMG's and learned how to color block for apparel. One of the hardest things about my job is having to stop what you are doing multiple times to back up cashier or to help guests, this is hard because I am the type of person who likes to get stuff done without being interrupted because when I come back I forget where I left off. The most enjoyable part of my job is definitely making guests days when they get exactly what they came in for, it warms my heart to see their faces light up when they compliment not only me but everyone in the store saying that we are all super friendly and our willingness to help them."
good,I liked a lot of the managers and stuff but it was very stressful at times. There was a lot of people at times which made it stressful to me. I did really enjoy thought that they had my back when I was stressed
good,"It’s a great place to start work, but they are currently going through a culture change and a focus seems to have shifted from team members and guest focus to the same thing but with minimal workers. It’s like a skeleton crew but a few ribs are missing. There is a ton of work to do, but not enough employees to do it. And the understaffed front end needs help and the understaffed sales floor has to help, putting them farther behind. And it’s a vicious cycle."
good,"typical day at work would be unload merchandise fill shelfs ,restock merchandise that was returned , markdowns. most enjoyable would be meeting other people"
good,"Every day, I came in fully prepared to work. I got to see how busy or slow it was when I walked in. The management kinda fell apart once our 10 year managers left, but the new managers tried their best. Employees working holidays usually got catered meals."
good,Fast paced job where we unloaded trucks daily and separated merchandise by department onto pallets. Then pulled pallets to departments to stock shelves.
good,it was fun job and i learned more about produce than anyone truly needs to know. management at my particular store was not the greatest but im sure it could be worse
good,"Everyday you went in on a shift you almost had the exact same thing to do everyday. When you got things done you asked what could be done next. During almost every shift, you would have to go help another department."
good,Target is a good stair step company in to something else. Working at the Starbucks there were a lot of times that the majority of my shift I worked alone. There needs to be more people to work at any given time.
good,"I absolutely love working at target, it’s all I’ve ever known. I moved my way up from cashier to front lanes supervisor to team lead over three departments. It’s a great place to practice management and to learn from outside sources that come to work with us. I’ve grown into a better person and manager because I chose the right mentors working my way up. I wouldn’t leave if I didn’t have to."
good,"Target needed more training with the new combers. Advancing was almost not applicable. Raises almost did not exists, do to being such a low raise and some did not even get a raise. There is no pay sick days. Turn over rate was very high. I did enjoy learning how to run the place. After getting transferred to another Target in Highlands Ranch I got taught the proper way of running the Receiving area very pleased about that . Target recommends you to quit the company and try to get hired back on."
good,"There were cashiers who were not pleasant to guests.  Yet they continued to be employed even though management knew the situations.  "
good,"The Target I worked at in Downtown San Fancisco was absolutely crazy and I loved it. As a securty guard, there was always something for us to do. Whether it was arresting people, stocking, or checking inventory, it was something fun and educational. The best part of my job was being able to work with some great mentors and just being able to learn from those guys was amazing."
good,"As a team member I have learned many positions over the years and have continued to grow with the company. The company which I'm thankful to be apart of has, given me a lot in return as well! The management is great but the hours are not always there. Sometimes it's hard to balance everything at once with job duties and guest interactions. The best part of the job is the joy you bring to people!"
good,"Enjoyable but stressful.  New company rollout requires most of your shifts to take place during mid-day, leaving little time for work-life balance.  With raising the minimum wage each year, it is decreasing the payroll in the store, leaving less hours for it's team members"
good,I love my job at target but they need to give more hours. I love the people I work with and the guests. I love that I get a discount but I can’t get full time hours
good,I liked my work at Target.I had to quit because my family needed me to take care of my siblings.Now I am able to work for my family since school is ending soon.
good,Overall Target is a nice starter job with opportunities to advance. However there is slight favoritism. Typical retail job. The pay is decent if they give you enough hours.
good,Work environment was pretty good. Everyone had their set schedule and knew what to do when coming in. Was organized. Was a good experience. Never had a bad experience while working there. Always had an opportunity to do more.
good,"With management they were scheduling me for days that I told them I would be unable to work, week after week and would be upset when I called out. Basically changing my availability that I had set in the system. Very annoying especially with me being a student and having class. Also when it snowed very heavy they expected me to come in... and the weather was terrible. Other than that the staff is really nice and they usually will work with you to find someone to cover your shift if you absolutely can't make it. Sometimes our manager would bring in catered food as well for break."
good,"I loved working nights, very laid back and we were the top performers, amazing what can get done when your jot micro managed. We set our own goals as a crew and had excellent communication as a team. Very rarely would we have to get a manager involved. They let us do our job and we got it done. I miss that."
good,"When I first got the job, it was very intimidating. You never really know what you’re doing since they don’t tell you how you can improve. Just try your best and you’ll be on their good side occasionally."
good,Great job experience at Target. Close to home. Looking to possibly get into management. Need to explore other opportunities. Want to utilize skills in a supportive environment.
good,"With Brian Cornell's leadership Target is making great strides and is back to being competitive. Workplace culture is the same as most retail, fast paced, long days, but great teams"
good,I worked back when it was target pharmacy.  I knew it wasnt for me.  It was regarded by management in meetings like the shoe or electronics dept.  Hence why they sold to cvs
good,"Is a nice place to work for someone going to school, is a part time job so you dont get that much hours but is very flexible and some managers are good."
good,It was relaxed most of the time and everyone would talk to you. The moral was more positive and up beet. Employees laughed and had a good time with the team they had everyday.
good,"I enjoy working at Target just need a job in my career field. Good environment, nice workers, steady busy and managers are reasonable towards employee"
good,Ir was a good place to work at. Can be stressful depending upon the season and location. Nice that you have to be in a position all day. Employees were always nice.
good,"Going into the job, I expected something different than what I did. Truly, I have nothing against Target, the people there were very nice and helpful, I just see myself far, far away from Retail. I want to create and impact people with what I do."
good,"I started as a seasonal worker at Target in 2017, and two years later I've thrived within the store. While working at a retail store can be stressful, the work environment is positive and the people amazing to work with. Management is flexible with availability, and teach you how to work in various departments. Only cons would be the hours fluctuate, and management can come off aggressive or suddenly change your schedule or department. Your pay is negatively impacted by the hours dropping, and there are minor oppurtunities to rise despite one's work ethic or time spent at Target. Despite these cons, overall I enjoyed working there as the flexible positive environment balances with the negatives."
good,"Its a fine job if you want to get paid well and have steady work. Nothing real exciting.  Management can be forgetful and inept, leading to organizational problems. Requires lot of endurance."
good,My time at Target was short-lived but very beneficial with how flexible the hours were and how open they were to opinions. Target was also very understanding of their employees and worked to continuously improve employment opportunities and the overall experience of the customer.
good,"I would work in cooler sections such as dairy, frozen, and produce. The first thing is to pull the autofills(batch to replenish items bought recently). Management is the reason why most people leave."
good,Decently fun job. Good management. Fast paced and stressful at time but a decent amount of downtime as well. Management was great and made us feel comfortable working the long overnights.
good,Mangers very strict didn’t let you talk at all besides to guest. Time will go by very fast on busy days like the weekends. Sundays were the craziest every going shopping for the week.
good,"It is a drone job, tedious but it is just target and they do pay your enough for what you do. They just raised the minimum wage to 13/hr which is a lot for doing such menial tasks."
good,"a typical work day is pretty busy, a lot of customers are in and out of target from open to close. I learned how to interact with customers in such a short amount of time and always keeping a smile on my face. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to talk to people all day. The workplace culture is a very positive and happy place to work."
good,"The job, itself, is just fine.  Helping customers is a satisfying feeling and there is always room to improve how you do things to help more.  The only problem is that you get hours based on the sales of the previous year; so, if the previous year had poor sales you will not get very many hours for those days.  Consistent hours and reasonable pay is key to any job."
good,would highly recommend if you're interested. just be ready to work. in which case good luck and reach for the stars at target. high paced and physically demanding sometimes.
good,Working for Target was a new experience and co-workers are helpful at time specially when its the holidays or and event is going on. Although most of the time you'll find yourself working on other department due to call outs and since most people that are working there are part time and usually just work 4-4.5 hrs a day. Overall it's a good company to start for your first job.
good,Target is a good company to work for they do go with your schedule. People are very nice when your working their depending on the department you are in. You do make good friends there as well.
good,"All the entry level employees are like family members, making stressful times more fun and carefree. Upper management sets unachievable expectations, then strongly reprimands when goals/expectations aren't met."
good,"For a college or high school student, Target being a low-stress work environment was something that I will never take for granted. Managers are the nicest I have ever had, while still expecting you to do your best. It is a very laid back environment that never had me leaving upset."
good,Target was a good job I worked there a pretty long time ago but when I did it was a great place it got busy at times but there were always supervisors to help out and they trained you very well.
good,"target is very fast paced, you have to know, how much inventory you have around the store all while managing the service of the guests and customers around you. you have to be able to think about multiple things at once and be able to get them the things they want while not letting yourself becoming too distracted with the customer that you are unable to do your job in a timely manner, but the bond you get with your coworkers in one i shall never forget. everyone working there was truely a team even when things seemed out of focused and a bit messy and cluttered."
good,"I liked target, they made sure you had breaks, on schedule and easy going it was not a long term job for me at the time. I was a quality employee and always got requested to work more or overtime."
good,Great job especially for teenagers and paid very well. Was not flexible with my schedule as an athlete and the manager would forget and schedule me on my unavailability days.
good,"Many great people work at this company. I learned a lot and was supported to grow. Work life balance is hard, and is the most difficult part of the job."
good,Target was a great place to work due to the environment. The pay was very good along with the amount of hours I was getting in the beginning of the job with just being seasonal. All together it was a good experience and I never had many complaints with the HR.
good,This job worked perfectly for me while I was in school. It was very flexible on hours and taught me . everything I know about providing good customer service.
good,"Loved working there until section leader got a promotion, HR (who does scheduling) changed and immediate team leader all changed within 2-3 months. Afterwards my hours were all over the place from 10-40. Working 6-2 one day and 11-4 the next to 2-8 some others. Approched team leaders multiple times. When I finally changed my availability to stop the crazy hours, the hours were just cut. Worked there 1.5 years and felt unappreciated and like words were falling on deaf ears when the same complaints were lodged by other employees and resolved whereas mine were completely ignored. More disappointed than anything."
good,Target is a high school environment. No hours or overtime. we get paid $12.50 an hour. Some days everything can run smoothly other days are stressful.
good,"Good part time job to have during college. Pretty positive working environment, but often you are just left alone. Requires working with walkie-talkies which for the hearing impaired might be a problem."
good,The hardest part of the job was leaving work at work. The stress of working carried over into my home life. The texts and calls that came when I was supposed to be home with my family was never ending.
good,"Target is a workplace for employees that look forward to a fast pace environment. During season, it does get stressful for the employees since it’s when a lot of Northerners come down, but management makes an attempt to lead all of their employees to complete their tasks with the most effort."
good,"All in all a great place to work, target is very inclusive. Target accepts people of all walks of life no matter your gender or gender identity, tattoos, piercings and is just very accepting and team oriented if I wasn’t looking for higher pay or if the promoted or gave pay raises more often I would stay"
good,"The higher the mangers are in position the less they care about you. I have worked there for five years always looking for advancement and looking for greater opportunities to learn. I might know how to run the whole store, but I will never be allowed to be placed in management roles due to my immediate supervisor believing in the fact that cashiers cannot learn management skills"
good,I love my job at target! I’m always doing something and never just sitting down!!The management is nice and very understanding of my school schedule and work flexibility!
good,"Whether it was from corporate or immediate managers, procedures always changed but anyone with a quick thinking and problem solving mind adapted well."
good,Worked for a few years. Benefits are great. Management helped when they could. Nevertheless acted like the were superiors over you in a bad way.......
good,"(As a Cashier) It is a very typical work environment. Everyone you work with is pleasant and happy and they all get along great. However, you don't get any hours whatsoever. I was hired as a full-time seasonal employee. I started out with 15-25 hours a week to get into the routine. Then my hours started to stay at 15 hours for about 2 months. Then they tell me I will be full-time full-year employee, I was over the moon. But now my hours per week range from 4-9 hours a week. I've spoken to management several times about my hours, but nothing has been done. I've even tried to cover others shift, but others tend to get to them first, which I understand. It is very rare that I take time off, but whenever I request time off, I get scheduled that particular day."
good,"I enjoyed the position, and would have loved to stay. I was told that I would be staying on two months longer than I was given, yet told I was one of the best employees. My only complaints are that I don't work there anymore, and the unnecessary drama people got involved in."
good,The people at target as well as workers were really nice! The hardest part of the job is pushing out items on time as well making sure guest get what they need around the store.
good,"As a former barista within a target, I experienced the usual morning and evening rushes that most coffee shops experience, beyond that the customer waves balance throughout the day rarely reaching such extremes as the morning rush. Target has a history of playing to consumer benefits and free samples would often be given out. In hindsight, Target was an adequate and stable work environment"
good,flexible work place for hourly team members. benefits for full time team members. diverse culture. not always willing to promote within. usually hires outside managers instead of internal due to Target requiring an associates degree to advance.
good,"A typical day consists of the same duties. We takeover from the person before us, we have our assigned duties that need to be done before we leave. We assist customers/guests in any way they need."
good,"Although I really enjoy working at target, there is very limited opportunities for advancement. Team Leads, Leaders on Duty, and Store Team Leaders do not listen to their employees when issues arise. Expect to only work approximately 25 hrs a week, expected to come in on days off, and your hours to be cut unpromptedly. However, your team members are going to be the best coworkers are going to be the best you ever had! Most work is independent. It’s a good starter job, especially for college students. They are very flexible with your schedule! They are committed to increase their minimum wage to 15 an hour by 2020! Best of luck!"
good,"A typical work day for me was a mixture of stress but also comfort, working at Target the management was not the best and could have been better but it was also not the worst thing I have experienced. Target was my first job and taught me many things, such as how to talk and interact with customers on a daily basis and how to work the registers. The hardest part of working there would probably be having to restock and back stock all of the items. The most enjoyable part of my time at Target was definitely the co-workers and seeing al the people I knew."
good,I enjoyed my time at target. I always had something to do and when I didn't I was able to chat with some of my co-workers and I really got to know them. Our responsibilities made sense and we could always pick up another shift if we wanted.
good,"I love working at target!!! Honestly people are so fun although more than half of the time it seems like youre in high school, but despite the children attitude my managers are awsome, well if they like you. My schedule is great i dont really have any complaints, i go to work clock out and come again the next day and do it all over again."
good,Great management and teams at both locations I've been at that value the work I put in. My job is secured while away at college and I got great hours had a good workplace culture.
good,"They love when individuals are willing to take shifts on short notice, but are not very appreciative of it. Therefore, target as a company dont have many problems its the management that can truly ruin the image of the store"
good,"Ensure an exceptional guest experience, locate merchandise as requested, put away reshops, push stock, zone area, pickup strays and back stock as needed."
good,"Autonomy over your own department like a true business owner, while also maintaining the mission and drive of Target as well."
good,"While I've been with Target for 2 years, I've become increasingly more and more tired and frustrated with my store. While I have had a very reliable and consistent schedule, rarely ever interfering with my college classes, and the pay is outstanding for entry-level work. The local management, at least at my store, has fallen apart. Managers rarely communicate changes and problems with team members below them, making large management shifts almost annually and changing methods of store management without the consideration of the employees. Many managers also fail to connect with employees, creating a workplace that seems almost ambivalent, or apathetic, towards you. However, there are managers who do not fall into that category and are very considerate and understanding. Target as a corporation also offers outstanding benefits, including 5 fully-paid therapy sessions, the ability to take leaves from work, even as a part-time employee. Overall, Target's main problem continues to be incosistent management and poor employee management. But this is a local problem, and may not be the same at every Target."
good,Like working there and had good group of people but i needed more hours and a better schedule. Overall it was a job i would like to expand in. Daily work was clean amd not stressful.
good,it's pretty boring you don't really get promotions. the people that work there are pretty good. the pay is ok but still  not enough to afford to live in the area
good,"If there was one company I wish I could have promoted within, it would be Target. I loved the culture of the company! The pay was fine, althoigh they have raised their starting pay since I left. The work is very easy, and Team Leads make work fun! Executive Team Leads are a bit more “all business,” but don’t make it unbearable. Some leaders are not good at all, but that is rare. "
good,"good first time job if you are seeking to get some work experience. would recommend if you are looking for a part time job while going to school or something like that,etc."
good,Good place for a first job and great people. it was my first job and they were very understanding of when i got hurt and was in a sling but my complaint would be i was always very confused when i would end up training people considering i had only been there for a month
good,I would recommend this job for someone who needs a quick job or wants to learn something about retail it teaches you how to become a people person and learn great social skills
good,"A typical day at work is a lot but just focus to get the job done. Everyone helps you and teaches you new things ,my bosses are very good and helpful ,the environment is great to work in . The hardest part about the job is trying to do multiple things at once by yourself sometimes and as well as finishing on time it’s a task but I promise soon as you finish you’ll feel accomplished.The most enjoyable time at work for me I would say is break."
good,Everyone works together for the benefit of the guests.  You are not allowed to skip breaks or work overtime so you do not get burned out.  You have the opportunity to cross train in other areas of the building.  Target encourages volunteering in the community and furthering your education.
good,"Overall a decent place to work."
good,"The work environment was nice. Lots of younger people working in the front lanes, but It something that is either very fast paces or it is very slow paced. Steady stream of people usually coming in. Would recommend for a seasonal or part time job."
good,I worked overnights and we were in charge on unloading the trucks and stocking freight. Overnights are tough when not adjusted to the schedule but for the work it's not bad at all. Managed pretty well and a lot can get done.
good,My day at work consisted of a lot of laughter and smiles. It was a very social environment and I thoroughly enjoyed my time there. I would say the most difficult part of the job was when the holidays came around.
good,"I worked 2 holiday seasons at Target. It was a busy, but fun time. I improved on my customer service and leadership skills in this position. The hardest part of this job was learning where everything was located in the store. Management/Leadership was very helpful and gave us the tools we needed to be successful in our roles."
good,"Working here was the epitome of average. It was a huge step up for me considering the other places I worked at but for some, it can be a nightmare. It's a quick-paced environment and it does seem that the staff has favorites. Like the title says, working here was not bad but not very good either."
good,In my 3 years of working at Target I made more than someone who worked there for 8 years. That was a problem. There are yearly raises but the raises were less than 10 cents. If you managed to get double digits it was rare. I cross trained in almost every department in hopes of moving up but was told I was too valued where I was. The team members are collaborative and offer a hand when they can.
good,"It was alright, usually during the holiday season we ended up working til midnight sometimes even 1 am, the pay was nice though and my co-workers were cool."
good,"I liked working at Target, and you the pay was pretty good. However once season was over I got about 12-15 hours a week, which was not enough for me to survive on. If I could have gotten more consistent hours I would have stayed with the company."
good,"Working for the Target Cooperation has helped me gain confidence in my own work abilities to be able to work closely with a team that is focus driven to give the best Guest Service to our shoppers.  It is hard work to be in the retail business, unloading trucks to disperse boxes of product to be sorted and then taken to be put on the proper location on the self. Working on the Planogram Team our team has to read material, isle schematics, place displays, move product, stay tidy and organized. We all as a team work closely with all of our managers. We strive to give back to the community through Shop with a Cop, and Dr. Seuss reading days for schools, and Volunteer events that give back either through volunteer hours and community service or through donations directly from the company."
good,"fun energetic place to work, great coworkers, and fast paced environment. Would love to continue to work there but they've cut my hours and I have lost my insurance, etc."
good,"Target is a fast-paced work place. The team is really nice and they are really helpful, making it a great and enjoyable place to work at. The employees always feel appreciated."
good,"They don’t offer many hours, I was also laid off without knowing, and someone workers/ managers can be very rude. I do recommend this place for people to work at I guess it all depends on you as a person."
good,"The job was good starting out, although the overall feeling of what is expected becomes blatantly obvious when the first week is up. They give you a few opportunities to learn different areas. Unless you are planning on being in the job for an extended period of time, they will have you all over the store."
good,"Target is one of my fav store so I enjoyed the little discount and it was pretty fun working there. Downside, there are only part time positions unless your are a manager.. which means no benefits, a small amount of hours and the pay is just ok"
good,"Working at Target requires the ability to work individually as well as with a team. A workday in my current position includes continuous movement with lifting, climbing, squatting, etc. In addition handheld computers are utilized for accurate back-stocking and processing defectives. Use of pallet jack, forklift and wave machine is a daily occurrence."
good,"A good place to work. Flexible hours and understanding managers, work with cool people. No substantial benefits to speak of, no paid time off for part time, not sure about full time workers."
good,my position as ship from store was really fun and the team made it engaging to be a packer or sorter the work is extremely fast paced though and the pay is great for the job
good,Very very fast pace workplace fun helping customers have to stay on your toes to keep product on shelves are providing the ultimate shopping experience
good,"I rated Target ""Okay"" because I had a great leader who kept me bought in to the job as a whole. He promoted me 4 times within four years. He is a great guy and now is an Operations Manager for Amazon. Target looks to promote from outside a lot instead of promoting from within someone who already knows the ""Target Way""."
good,Target's corporate offices changes policies to accomodate for the changing consumer environment so you must be able to adapt to these changes because they often come out of nowhere.
good,"Target was a very friendly, fun place to work. Interacting with coworkers and customers easy. The job was relaxing and simple to learn tasks needed. Products in the store were easy to locate when restocking shelves or helping a customer find what they are looking for."
good,Target pays competitively well in comparison to other well known companies I have worked for in the same position. More will be asked of you/expected when it comes to assisting the team in areas outside of your job. Very team oriented environment.
good,"In the morning when I get there I have to find equipment that works. I then proceed to the computer to check how big my workload is, I print out labels. I separate the labels by departments. I go to the stockroom and begin to pull merchandise from the stockroom that needs to have a price change put it in the computer system. Once I am done in the stockroom, I then go to whichever in to scan every piece of merchandise in that department that needs to be marked down. It is a long process but I get through it day by day. I enjoy doing it."
good,The people I worked with were creative and fun. It was a good work environment. I wish I could have stayed longer but we had to move and started a family.
good,"I would say that over half of my job involved the freezers in some form or another. Target did provide jackets and gloves, but sometimes the jackets were dirty (don't know how often they got cleaned) and the gloves had holes in them. Just be aware that if you work in bakery, you're going to have to do a lot of stocking, and that involves temperatures of twenty degrees below zero."
good,"One bad thing about it was advancement seemed very lacking. While it always seemed to be a collaborative place to work, it seems there was no real place for employee opinion."
good,"The fun part about my job! Having the ability to interact with team members and guest everyday.  Mentoring, guiding and problem solving daily. Love the team work environment and friendly culture."
good,"I was not worked as many hours as i would’ve liked. they didn’t work me to my availability. Although staff and HRs were very kind people, i had trouble finding help about my schedule."
good,"Hardest part of the job would be remaining calm when being yelled at by a guest for something that is out of your control, but you learn to have a lot of patience with any retail job."
good,A company that reaches out to their community with fun events that help support other businesses. Competitve wages and excellent healthcare services. Job training.
good,Typical day revolves around making guest/customer experience a good one.  Answer guest questions and locate items for purchase.  Most difficult part of job are the physical demands of stocking and flooring merchandise.  The most enjoyable part of job is the satisfaction that comes with providing guests with solutions to their questions.
good,Very prominent on pushing team members to work while sitting in there offices all the time. Seemed a bit unfair that they would assume people weren't working while they didn't even set foot on the sales floor.
good,People are very nice and want you to succeed. Managers on duty always checking if you needed anything and made sure you were taken care of. Are considerate of your time.
good,"Very easy going workplace culture, hardest thing about the job would be room for advancement; not a lot of opportunities for promotions or career advancement. Great place to get experience and time with starting pay well above minimum wage, highly recommend to students or persons inbetween jobs."
good,"I is sometime face pace and sometimes slow, the workplace culture is mixed management is good and what I like most about my job is interacting with the guest and helping them in anyway I can."
good,"As a barista I don’t get to keep tips, which is not okay to me. I was told I was compensated for the lack of tips, and recently found out that’s just incorrect. I get paid just as much as hardliners, soft lines and market. Same as everyone else. I only make more than cashiers. Coffee is a service job and people deserve to be tipped. If someone leaves a tip we have to tell them we can’t take it. Other than that Target is alright."
good,Management is really good the only thing that was a issue is that they cannot balance the work and home life balance. But other than that they do pay decently and the co-workers are really helpful if you need it
good,"Target has great pay and benefits.  The work is very suitable for everyday performance. I show up to work, put my 12 hour work day in with a smile on my face.  Friendly management and coworkers."
good,This was a good entry level job for someone. The immediate managers were very nice. The work hours were flexible. It was near minimum wage but fair for that time of job
good,"Everyone is nice, managers don’t seemed stressed. Easy going on schedule and time requested off. Always had food in the break room for workers. Only issue is they let off some people the day before their last shift for seasonal w/o a earlier warning."
good,Great work space they were flexible with hours and if something came up when you needed to do something important they were understanding. The managers and team members were nice and helping
good,"You create the atmosphere of positivity at the workplace. It's impossible to be bored if your unloading the truck early in the morning, especially during 4th quarter."
good,"In my time here I have had many bosses and many team members. I enjoyed them all. I got alot of interesting stories from each of them. All good folks just trying to make a living."
good,management needs better communicating always being told different things by different managment or some not knowing about others dicisions. The workplace is clean and fellow workers are nice.
good,Working at Target is a great opportunity for someone who absolutely loves retail or who is in college. As a working adult with children it is not a job that could pay for all your responsibilities
good,"I liked working for Target, I was fortunate to do well in my job but even with that I still always felt replaceable.  It a very competitive environment"
good,"I don't have any complaints really, it was fun to work there. Loved that we got lunch breaks. Management was nice and willing to step in and help if needed. Loved the daily meetings to get everyone on the same page."
good,"I had a good experience at Target.  I worked at the Starbucks, which was surprisingly a relaxing work environment.  Unfortunately, because it is Target you do not earn tips, nor are you able to bring home free or discounted items.  At  corporate Starbucks stores you are able to bring home free drinks, and maybe even receive other discounts.  The management was a bit hesitant about my scheduling plans-due to the fact that I am in college- but it was able to be worked out.  My team leader was great, and most of the people I worked with for the matter.  There were only a few people that I worked with that I was unresolved about.  By the way, I was not able to start work right away after being hired.  It took about two to three weeks then I was able to start working.  They also don't have the best discounts for their employees."
good,"As a Ship from Store/Flexible Fulfillment employee, time is of the upmost importance right next to order accuracy and organization. You go through stock in the backroom and sales floor to pick items for online orders while assisting Target guests when need. After picking, you separate orders and pack them for shipping and troubleshoot any issues that may arise such as; order inaccuracy or system malfunction"
good,"A typical day at target as a Guest Service Attendant consisted of closing and opening the cash registers, collection of the money from each register at the end of the night and organizing it in the Cash office. More of my responsibilities included schedulding my other front end  team members breaks and lunches, as well as handling any guest descrepencies. I was also in charge of training new cashiers and assisting with any questions they may come across while on register."
good,It was a great place to work. A few things could have changed. But over all it was a favorite job. It could have gone better then it did. But ive applied back there a few times.
good,"I enjoyed working at Target until the newest management change. Upper management cut everyone's hours (except new hires) while still expecting the same amount of work to be accomplished. Retail is supposed to be fast paced but trying to complete the work of 4 people (stocker, zoner, replenishment, backstocker) for an entire department is not reasonable."
good,"For a short term job, I was happy. Management did a good job treating employees as people, and were very flexible when it came to scheduling or other conflicts. Not always on top of communicating to employees (I was moved from a seasonal to permanent position with no warning). Pay was far better than similar jobs. Not unionized."
good,"Management was great, though, once the manager over my department was promoted, her position was not replaced. This caused a lot of co workers to not do their job due to lack of supervision."
good,Target is a good place to work if you have few monetary responsibilities.  During holiday season the hours are fairly good but get cut drastically after the season is over.  If you need a flexible schedule they are usually good about being flexible with people.  Every store is run a little differently so that makes it a little hard to write a standard review of the company.
good,"The culture that Target fosters is something I have never seen before you work closely with a lot of people and ultimately create lasting bonds, and life long friends. The only downside to working for Target is its all about politics when you want to promote, make the right people happy and you are a shoe in. With that being said you will look at management and wonder how they even got there, some micromanage for a living while others are just plain rude and disrespectful."
good,"Working at target was good for a bit, but after being there for almost two years and not even getting a dollar raise sucked. Team leaders will dump work on you, but the recognition and pay go to team leaders. Some team leaders were power hungry. Any criticism or suggestion is thrown away. The management will always defend target so don’t put energy such things."
good,"target offered a productive and fast work pace. the atmosphere was always funny, it was a very enjoyable job. a typical workday consisted of ringing up customers and keeping the isles clean."
good,"Target was a very nice place to work, I really enjoyed the time that I  work for such a fine Retail Store, I was sad when they closed the store and moved out of Macon, Ga."
good,Target was a cool job I had just got out of college so it was my first job I had for a long period of time but it was something to start off with I didn’t see myself making a career out of it
good,"fast moving, pretty fast and easy work days"
good,"Once my store came under different management I noticed several false reports made and unfair treatment to younger or lower leveled staff. I did enjoy working with my fellow front end team members, but one lead in particular would write people up just because she felt like it. This cost us several Great Workers and many guests."
good,"Target can be hectic during the holidays, but is usually friendly. You can form good bonds with your coworkers and the pay is good for a first time job"
good,"imagine now that you worked in a large store filled with items from many categories of household goods, now imagine it is red and white themed, congratulations its target, and that was my target number of characters to move on"
good,Target is a good company but the specific store that I work at has hired way too many people and we are only getting 1-2 shifts a week. This wasn't terrible for a few weeks but now I am about to graduate and I cannot live off of 4-9 hours a week.
good,"Overall, team work and team members go hand in hand, but management could've been better. Workdays are normally moderate, but can be either very fast or very slow."
good,"I had a lot of fun working here. It's entirely unfortunate that I no longer work here, but the atmosphere was good and managers on-site were friendly!"
good,"At the beginning of my time at Target things went smooth then employees began to leave a few months into my time employed there. I was competent to fill the voids, but was not fully trained to keep the train rolling. Staff there kept changing and i never got proper training from a veteran staff member but for the most part we did our part in running our assigned departments."
good,"A normal day can be wildly different depending on the season we're in. If we're in the holiday season then work is break neck pace with large workloads. The opposite can be said about non-holiday seasons. "
good,there is always something to do to keep you busy. Everyone is eager to help each other out. management is great and very understanding. it feels great to help out a guest.
good,"I enjoyed my time at target but there wasn't a lot of job security. I was hired as a seasonal employee but they told me that my employment would end in April when I first started. After a month of working they told me I would be staying after the holiday season. Fast forward a couple of weeks, I wasn't on the schedule anymore. Cool place to work while I was there. Breaks were nice and the other employees were fun to be around."
good,"fun place, raises are weak, hours aren't promised, typical retail, ok if you are a kid or for a part time job if you are an hourly employee, get a 10% discount"
good,"I was hired as a seasonal Beauty Team Member and fortunately got to stay full time. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new and soon becoming family with who I worked with. I was trained very well and the overall workplace environment was amazing. A typical day of work for a beauty team member consisted of stocking the floor, helping guest find products and prices, and maintaining the sales floor throughout the day. The hardest thing about the job is just how busy it can get and still being able to finish daily tasks. This would be a great job to start off at to get some working experience. The reason I left was I eventually felt like new management wasn't appreciating the amount of passion and work I was doing for them. Instead of helping me grow like before, I was being put down a lot. Everyone else's spirits went down as well so eventually it became hard to want to step foot into work."
good,"A typical work day would involve arriving at work, stocking the shelves, assisting guest, and finally near the end of the shift ""Zone"" you respective areas, meaning straighten items on shelves and replace misplaced items. I leaned the importance of balancing work/area responsibilities with customer service and overall customer experience. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers, especially the regulars, and also interacting with co-workers."
good,"always very productive day at work, great morning shifts, great work environment, always friendly, happy to work there, great company, enjoyed everything."
good,"There was good mix of personalities at my location, although I did not stay long at the location, the people in my option are ones to be remembered for their kind and upbeat attitudes. The day was always bearable to some degree with the environment that location natural had going for it."
good,"Good people there but they are under appreciated, Do more work but get nothing in return"
good,It was nice and smooth. Customers are loving and happy. The environment it delighting with full of smiles and everyone collectively getting along to meet our daily/monthly goals.
good,"Overall, very stressful place to work as far as work/life balance is concerned but great pay/benefits.  After working for this company you feel confident for any future endeavors."
good,"It was fun working with different people and getting to help the guests that came in but where it became stressful was trying to put the truck away under a certain time frame, as well as helping guest, as well as running up for cashier back up, as well as price changes and updating inventory on the floor."
good,"Not a place I would recommend working your way from the bottom to the top in, but if you're looking for something temporary or seasonal then its perfect while teaching you patience simultaneously."
good,"Lots of management coming in and out"
good,"Pretty cool working there. Make it a permanent position once you get in!! Be smart , they pay very well. I would recommend working there and doing what’s right!"
good,"working at target was some of the best days of my life. it was always fun, the coworkers were just as friendly, customers were outstanding and not many complaints, there wasn't a day that went by that was exciting."
good,"Great place to work. Very positive and interactive culture. I have had the opportunity to learn different areas of the store such as pricing, stocking, signing and working the sales floor.  Also had the opportunity to train new employees."
good,I have been working at Target since i gratuated highschool 3 years ago. I have learned a lot about retail and the business world in general. I am over all saticfied with my experience at target.
good,"It's a relatively simple task; show up on time, sort boxes, place merchandise where it needs to go, always try to be ""Fast, Fun, & Friendly,"" and backstock merchandise when needed."
good,The employees are hard working and go out of their way to make you feel part of the team environment.  The job itself is fast paced and very dangerous at times depending on what department you work in.  It is difficult to advance quickly due to the old fashioned micro management style.
good,"Working at Target was fun because it was casual. The uniforms were a red t-shirt and khakis and tennis shoes. The management and other workers were supportive and fun to be around. "
good,"a typical day could include a cashier having to sell a fair amount of ""red-cards"" that encourage the target customer to come back and spend but this tie with a 3% discount on anything in the store. not only your cashier experience is being watched but also how many cards you sell."
good,"It was seasonal for Christmas.  Enjoyed working there.I mostly worked as a cashier.   I offered the red card to customers and explained the benefits.  When we got slow, I zoned the girl's department.  When needed, I would cover the Guest services counter and took payments and did returns."
good,"Target was an overall enjoyable place to work. Being with customers all day every day can get draining, but the best of us can handle it. I had a positive experience during my employment here."
good,"I absolutely loved working at Target store number 2176. Every team member I encountered was very kind and understanding of the fact that employees have a life outside of work. The store was always clean and the guests always gave compliments. I would have loved to stay, but unfortunately had to relocate. Target really knows how to care for their employees."
good,Target is a great place to work in terms of work life balance.  It has a great team environment as well.  You spend most of your day working with a team and removing obstacles.
good,Working at Target was fun- at times it was very face paced and there was a lot of work to do but at others you find yourself finding things to do. Working at Target you have a lot of individual work to do but at the same time its a team effort.
good,pay is good but hours for inbound workers is low most of the time and can be a struggle. it is a vary fast pace work environment. when the season is up the hours are good but when the off season comes your hours for inbound can go down pretty low.
good,"When I started with Target in 1987 it was a great company and it paid well. I had opportunity to move around then and try new areas. I felt valued as a team member to the company. I became an executive after 3 short years.  As time went on I saw visual and operational changes in the company. It became less work/life balance family oriented and more hard core competitive. I’ve always worked very hard so lots of hours and challenges didn’t bother me, in fact I thrived in that environment.  As time went on, more positions were eliminated and more work expected."
good,Target was a great place to work. I enjoyed going to work every day  and seeing what new challenges were in store. The managers and employees were a joy to work with.
good,"When you start there isn't much training as a cashier, even learning how to bag the say go with the flow.  It's also not one for strict thinkers they are very easy breezy with money to ""make the customer happy""."
good,"Fun place to work , pay is great but management needs to step up and handle business when it come to employees and situations.   Team members not getting alone.  Love that some employees actually do work st team mates with team lift etc... Can talk to supervisor about anything , but waiting for results can take forever and not at all."
good,"it was a very easy going first job , learned alot about the working environment and how important it is to network or be diverse within your working abilites."
good,A lot of work and not a lot of people to do it. Very tiring and hard hours but rewarding team work. Shifts were late followed by early shifts. The work was constant and breaks were short.
good,"It was one of the most fun jobs I've had. They tend to laugh a lot, and accepting of any and every single person there. Employees were great, management was great, HR was great. It was an overall awesomd job."
good,unload truck-take boxes to its right location-stock items-greet customers -assist customers. I didn't like the fact that there had to be boxes and a bunch of workers all in an isle while the store was open
good,"I started working here during college, and it helped me learn the rules of social etiquette, and become a more confident and approachable person in the process. The people are, in general, very welcoming and are willing to teach newbies the ropes as long as they see the enthusiasm, effort and results come into fruition."
good,Leadership is strong and efficient.  Goals and policies are clear and attainable.  The teamwork environment is productive and effective.  The scheduling is fair and creates a nice work/life balance.
good,"Although there were aspects of my job at Target/Starbucks that I loved, there was a lot of work that needed to be done and it wasn't humanly possible to get everything completed when they deemed fit.  They were understaffed, at the time I was there and it caused a lot of issues."
good,"Target was a fun place to work when i first started with company, than management change, then it went downhill from there. Ok place to work, bad management when i work for target. Didn't seem to care to much about their employees,"
good,You work with great people at Target. It is a great starting place to build a lot of different skills. The only drawback is that moving up in the company is really hard.
good,"Theres a sense of familiarity. "
good,my typical day at work is great wonderful guest. i ve learned that customer service is a good job. management is wonderful..work place culture is organized and supported employees. the hardest part of the job is.. people not working as a team. the most enjoyable part of my job is the employees and benefits..
good,"Target was great for the while I was there, however It wasn’t a job that benefited myself for my career. It is very fast paced and productive. Liked meeting new people and always felt comfortable with my work crew."
good,"Target is a great place to work, just not in Food Avenue. We were forgotten about all the time by our supervisors and my fellow team members wouldn’t take on the responsibilities they needed to. I was relied on to basically be the manager and run the stand all by myself. I left to work in a more professional environment."
good,I love working at Target. It has a great atmosphere and almost everyone you will work with is friendly. Work life balance tends to be an issue as there is a lack of a set schedule and it can get very stressful at times. Management is good for the most part but managers don’t stick around long before they  find another job or get relocated to another store.
good,target was a good place for me to start my work experience and the people there all have good energy and very nice  and wiling to help with anything you need.
good,Really liked my job but needed to leave to take care of ill wife They were understanding but I wasn't even able to work part time at the time so I believed it best to leave
good,"Beside bad managers, team was joy and work was reasonable. Worked with a lot of young people and tended to have a larger roll/responsibilities towards quarter 4 and a relaxed work environment for quarters 1 and 2."
good,Target is a great company I love working for them but I do wish they gave us more hours. During holidays send the summer the hours are pretty good for anyone working part time but around mid January or beginning of February I was only receiving at the very most 10 hours a week.
good,Target was a good experience. I like the breaks. The best thing about working at Target was the discounts. Being a shopper deals is something you cant miss...
good,"I have worked for Target for 5 years at this point. I had moved from a store in Washington to one on LA. The store in Washington was amazing, everything from the management to co-workers to the guests(customers) were great, easy to work with, and generally happy. When I moved to California, it was a different story, the management doesn't seem to care unless something goes wrong, or they only care about trivial things. The co-workers are fine as are the guests, but the atmosphere is so anti-team that all that matters is the bottom line and making sales. I honestly feel trapped at this current Target. So if you apply, I hope you get one of the good stores."
good,Target is a great place to work with the best people. I've never worked somewhere that the people are what you keep you at the job until coming to Target. I wish I would have been able to stay with them when I relocated for a spouse's job.
good,"Target works well with the local law enforcement community to deter fraud, waste and abuse. Their asset protection department is high quality and work with law enforcement of a local and state level."
good,"Target is a great company with great opportunities for the guest shopper to get involved with, especially its mobile coupons that they provide in their mobile app."
good,"Most people were nice, it was very stressful on busy days but overall I learned a lot for my first job and it was definitely a good experience for me. Most co-workers were friendly and fun to work with. Managers were super kind and friendly for the most part. There was only a few who were rude. The people in HR knew everyone’s name which I thought was cool. The employees that had been there longer were very helpful when I had questions as well. There were also fun prizes when people would get red cards sometimes. It was a fun environment and I felt super productive and helpful whenever i worked there"
good,"Good place to work for part time/2nd job; hours vary from week to week, but you can ask for what type of hours do you want (nights, days, no weekends, etc)"
good,"I enjoy the many new faces that came to my registrar, most were very friendly and easy to talk to. I loved the challenge of satisfying an unhappy customer. I immensely got along with everyone i worked with especially the other cashiers. the atmosphere was very relaxed and clean. management was very understanding."
good,You have to clock in during your shift. Hit the sales floor where you're schedule says. You have a daily task on top of many different customers asking you questions or request left and right. Base on your Co-Worker it sets the tone for your environment.
good,"Great first job for those with no formal work history. They train you well and are patient. Hard work is noticed and rewarded, managers are friendly and co workers are nice."
good,"I liked working their, I did not want to leave, but thier was some family issues that came up, and I needed to leave,  the people I worked with where great I got a long with everyone I worked with"
good,Target is a great place to pick up a lot of experience in retail and to work at as your first job. The only thing that I would want changed would be the amount of work they give and expect to get done in each department.
good,"Always have something to do, keeping busy and interacting with guests (customers) helping them find or get something. It's a nice job if you can handle retail."
good,Target is a exceptional store because they go above and beyond to help their guest have the best shopping experience possible but unfortunately they don’t have enough staff to get the job done and the pay grade is low for their working expectations.
good,A typical day at work usually meant I was starting the day unloading the truck full of product. Things I learned included driving a pallet cart and techniques to stock shelves at a high pace.
good,This information is not necessary to complete the profile. This information is not applicable to conducting job searches and posting my information to my profile.
good,"We start the day by zoning our department to make sure all items can be easily accessed on the shelf by guests. Once our section looks presentable, we then go to pick up our workload for our section. As soon as we bring our workload back to our section we begin opening boxes and filling the shelfs. When we are done with opening boxes on that vehicle we then take back the trash and backstock (items that would not fit on the shelf) to the backroom. In the backroom we then backstock the items in designated locations to store for future use. We do this until we are completely clean of freight from the truck. This can take from 2 to sometimes 7 hours depending on work load size. When we are finished we shoot outs (empty spaces on the shelves) and pull what we have in the back to fill the shelves to the highest capacity for our guests who are shopping. The whole day you are constantly moving, lifting, and climbing ladders. You learn to treat guests with upmost respect as you are working diligently at the same time. The guests come first in our workplace and its our job to treat them accordingly."
good,Challenging work environment making you to take extra initiatives and many opportunities to explore. Lot of encouragements from leaders and learning environment is highly promoted. Good pay and benefits as well.
good,"Joined the Target team as a part-time member while finishing school part-time as well. The management at my location was great, gave constructive criticism that extended beyond the initial training period and worked with me to adjust my schedule as unexpected meetings and finals interfered with preexisting work commitments. Hardest part of going to work was having to work with a handful of individuals that hated coming to work because it meant having to work, but the management and team member discount helped to alleviate that tension."
good,"Working at Target as a Starbucks Barista was fun, fast paced, and an overall great learning experience. The managers and other employees working there were kind and helpful to myself and others."
good,"Working as a softlines team member at Target, really helped me become a lot more confident in the work place. I had the opportunity to help so many people while shopping, and ensure the happiness of others."
good,This job is okay. i love the people and the surroundings but i do wish the hours were more. cross training is hard to come around when the store is constantly trying to update to fit society standards.
good,"in my time at Target i learned new skills, and ways to assist in retail. i worked with others in a group , and if one person couldn't complete a task we would all help. Target is like a family."
good,they have a great environment for learning and advancement. they will give you all the opportunity in the world to get further in the company. while learning how to help in every area of the store.
good,"Unfortunately had to quit due to a home relocation but would definetly go back.They Team makes you feel at home, and are very welcoming of new members.Great managers as well."
good,"When I first worked for target, i had fun being at work and would be excited going to work everyday. "
good,"Everyone was friendly but the managers where not very understanding and had the problems of siding with others,other than that it is a good work in environment and it is decent pay and decent hours."
good,They want you to do the job your getting payed to do. They noticed those employees who did above and beyond. Its still retail and that can get very stressful  Things need to be done in a timely manner and sometimes there just doesn't seem like there is enough time in the day. I love the team meetings before each shift.. They help to build you up and I had a store manager who made you believe you could get it done and even if you couldn't you really wanted to try for her.
good,"A typical day at work is normal slow in the morning, picks up in the evening and slows down a night. Management is okay. The culture is great. The hardest part is that you wont get a lot of hours so and you wont get over 30-40 hours a week. At most you'll get 28 hours and some weeks you will only work 2-4 days."
good,"I love the managers here. very understanding, worked harder than the regular guys. very fast paced when school shopping and holidays were around the corner."
good,"Loved the job itself, but dealing with upper management was a joke. My direct manager was great, but management above them was very unprofessional. They caused issues with several employees, driving good employees away from Target."
good,"Learned to work with difficult costumers in a polite ""costumer is always right"" manner. Fun people to work with, equal and upper management alike. Most enjoyable was running into people you knew, pretty easy to switch shifts with someone. Cannot rely on some to follow through and take shifts. Target doesn't close no matter the weather- can be good or bad."
good,"Target is a very well known brand. Depending on your market the culture of the store is hit or miss. Like any retail job, working weekends and holidays can be crucial. However, it is a great way to kick off your career."
good,"A typical work day, would include checking stations for cleanliness, and check amounts of change. Mainly, I stand outside of my assigned register lane, waiting to greet customers in. A great part was my coworkers, being friends with everybody provides a great work space! However, I do not work more than 11 hours a week usually. Overall, Target is a great company to start out, and it will open a door to various opportunities in the near future!"
good,If you are young and just starting out in the working field this would be your first real open eye to working with people and being in a fast pace environment.
good,"The people are great. There are daily deadlines that some days are easy to complete, but other days it's challenging.  There is always something to do so you never get bored."
good,"I loved my job title,  coworkers we're friendly.  Keep in mind its a big corporation so there focus is more in the value of the corporation.  They were flexible when it came to the time I was available to work.  I knew plenty of students who were working and target was great with working with their availability."
good,"Target is a fast-paced environment, but the company holds its employees to the highest standards of etiquette and professionalism,  and always aspires to deliver quality service.  As a cashier, your opinion will not be valued at all.  That is to be expected because the company does not value you as an individual."
good,"I worked here over winter break for about a month and everything was a mess, but it was Christmas so it makes sense. Training was quick and not very detailed so I feel like I didn't know everything I needed to before I started. They never placed me in one area or fully trained me for one thing."
good,"I absolutely loved most of the people I worked with directly. But, as usual, corporate was out of touch with the actually day-to-day processes of the store and continued to implement new things that made it more and more difficult to do what needed to be done. Biggest down side was hours fluctuated. I could go from working 40 hours a week to 12 hours a week. You need to anticipate slow seasons and save money and vacation pay."
good,"I was given a set task and was able to complete it in the time I was given. However, when I asked for more work hours, I was denied and lied to. I was told that the company could not afford to give me more than the 4 HOURS PER WEEK they were giving me. Then they hired 2 more people for my team, they were given more hours than I. I then had to leave and find employment that could give me more hours per week. When I announced my resignation, management seemed surprised, and asked what they could do to keep me. When I told them that I needed more work hours they again told me that that wasn't possible."
good,I worked at a few different targets and I liked the targets that were not too big of stores. Most of all I liked that we really did feel like a team. I do wish they would have been more willing to give us benefits but they did give us fair raises. I would like liked it better if they did not make it such a big deal for us to make people sign up for the redcard
good,"Enjoy working for Target, being able to grow as  a leader was very fulfilling.  Heavy workload, and had to problem solve on a daily basis, loved the idea of having to create a game plane to accomplish a task very rewarding."
good,"Nice place to work at, friendly people and great work environment. It was easy talking with the guest and great being able to learn new things all the time. Felt like I learned something new everyday."
good,Target in my opinion is great for Students or ppl who are single. its pay is ok however its not enough to support a family. unless you're a manager or higher.
good,"First few months started out rough. Still had to learn how to use everything. Maintaining cashier speed was hacky. Eventually, they threw out that system in favor of concentrating on REDCards. Co-workers helped a lot. My boss was lenient and not without reason."
good,Target is a good company to work for if you would like to relocate to a different state because they have stores everywhere and you are able to move with your seniority and benefits.
good,Target is a great company to work for but like many others you have to keep up the pace or get left behind because the company is constantly changing. As soon as you learn your way of running things. New process are introduced to the company to keep guests happy and always coming back.
good,A typical day began with reviewing the amount of stock to be handled.  I would then assemble the product items into the various locations to be shelved in the store.  Once I had all the orders palletized I would then offer to assist people shelving the items.
good,"A typical day of work change over the years but for the most part it"
good,"A typical day at Target is constantly on the move and is a very tasky environment. "
good,I worked seasonal at the time. I learned how to multitask and meet the customers needs when working at Target. Working with others team members was great.
good,It is exactly how you would think to work here. Great for anyone with OCD. Management does a great job of pushing morale. Best place to work is in the back staging area
good,I would recommend Target as a great place to work for the flexibility it provides to balance personal life with work life as long as  your work gets done according to expectations.
good,It was a good job to work at. Ive worked hard. It kept me busy as well. Always had a good time. I stayed busy. And when time gets tough its nothing but a good day at work to calm me down
good,"At work they would usually remind me to sell their Red Cards on a daily basis, and then I would hop in a lane and work for the next 5 hours. At Target I learned a lot about customer service and courtesy for the guests. The management was rather lacking, as they scheduled me at many points where I was in school and incapable of coming in, but they were otherwise nice. The hardest part was the scheduling, but I did enjoy working alongside some of the nicest people I've met to date."
good,"Overall, Target was a decent place to work with flexible hours that allowed me to earn income while attending school. The most difficult part of the job would be the numerous problems that would arise as part of retail which would make some days interesting and other days stressful; however, it was good job for someone looking for part-time employment."
good,I really enjoyed my eight years working at target. Alot of good people and customers. I worked every area so i learned alot of different areas that can help me in future jobs
good,"The staff is so large that you can be best friends with one person, and have no idea who another is. It’s really fun to work there, but there’s a lot of requirements that you have to meet. If you don’t meet them, they can be really hard on you."
good,"I would strongly recommend working at Target for my friends. Target has allowed me time off, a chance for advancement, annual pay raises, and the opportunity to train in more than one part of the store when I desired to."
good,This position should be strictly temporary if you have any ambition in life. There is no room to grow as a person whatsoever as you will find the reuteen to be 100% unstimulating.
good,Working for Target kept you busy and with different tasks to be a part of. There was an opportunity to be a part of different teams in different departments in the store.
good,"Hard, but thankful job, but will litte room for advancement which is very frustrating. Senior leadership seems to require little skill and mostly luck acquire."
good,"Lots of consistent change, in people, jobs, direction. Wide range of start times.  Had to work your role as well as Leader on duty 3-4 shifts per week.  Work holidays, weekends, nights. All shifts were 10 hour minimum."
good,I had a good time there just felt I needed something new to drive myself. It gets a little repetitive but he people there are fairly nice. Great place to interact
good,It's a great company to work for. Some of the mangers are not the best but that's every retail job. Customers are customers but overall it's a great job to have and there is growth within the company
good,Overall Target was a great place to work and I enjoyed my time there. I left in part because of the lack of communication between Team Leaders and Team Members.
good,"Great place to work "
good,"It was fast-paced."
good,"I enjoy the work I do I just don't enjoy where I do it (location wise). My fellow leaders really respect each other, and I feel very valued in my position and very respected."
good,"Easy tasks to complete, good hours, good pay. Nice co-workers and clientele. All in all a good experience and would recommend anyone seeking employment to consider Target."
good,it was definitely a fun experience many friendly people working there and always something to do! management is nice and understanding and always working around you’re needs.
good,"Normally days were pretty easy. You just clocked into work and your manager would tell you the sales goals for the day and you'd be off to do your own thing to make sure you did your best. The culture was pretty good, there were multiple different nationalities and we liked to take notice and celebrate all of them when we could. Hardest part about the job would be trying to stay positive if you were behind on ""Redcard sales"". For me the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to get along with other coworkers that make shifts not seem as long."
good,"My location was wonderful. Coworkers are awesome, there’s a lot of room to learn and grow. Guests are usually pleasant as well. Only complaint is the short break even if you work all day and not very many benefits unless you’re a team lead."
good,the coworker and the team atmosphere was very positive I found that I enjoyed the people that I worked with an made some lasting friendships. I must also admit target did try their best to work with whatever issues that would arise
good,"Target cart attendant was a nice job but quickly fell into judgment if you weren't able to keep up with high traffic of customers needing a shopping cart. coworkers were very friendly, & offering a helping hand every now & then as needed."
good,"Usually a day consists of great guests, cool coworkers, and a good time. I truly love seeing reoccurring guests that stops by just to visit. It makes some of the worst days the best. Overall, Target is a great company to work for."
good,"Its a good place to work but they dont really give you too many hours ,especially for a associate with 3 children i would say its more suitable for someone who's looking for a seasonal job."
good,"I enjoy my job at target. There are questionable managers who like to pick favorites. I have worked for target for a few years, but I still make the same as someone who would get hired today. Although the pay has raised atleast a dollar every year. I feel like I deserve more pay than someone just starting out, but I make more here than any other retail place in my town."
good,"i was part of the sales team, i used to work in group or by myself. i learned to work in the different areas that the store had like electronics, home decor, or food products."
good,"I found it hard to move up in the company or get a raise, but the environment was comfortable and accommodating to my needs. I have a hard time remembering any of the names in management because they weren't amazing in any way nor made me feel like I was valued as an employee."
good,"target can be unfair at times with the employees, too hard on the cashiers about credit cards. co-workers are what got me through my shirts most days."
good,"The work is easy and somewhat unrewarding, however, hard work and determination is well noticed and praised by superiors. There was not much to learn, especially having previous retail experience. "
good,Its a fun place to work at. The other employees become your friends and make it fun to be there. Hours are flexible and people are always willing to trade shifts.
good,I truly enjoy the high energy environment surrounding the team. Do not get stuck around doing nothing and always be as productive as you can be doing your role despite any obstacles that may be in the way. Do not be shy communicating with veteran team members because that's the best way to learn how the store is ran.
good,"Leaders are still modeling old behaviors which makes it difficult to make decisions in a timely fashion. Target has a tendency to fall behind because they want to be nice about everything and not challenge industry standards. "
good,"I have spent three years working at my local Target.  Over the past 3 years I advanced from a cashier to a GSA. I have enjoyed my time and all the people I work with. As I have moved up the ladder the work has become more stressful and we, as GSA’s, are not compensated for our work. Other than that, Target is a great starter job/college kid job with flexible hours and, usually, quite a friendly staff."
good,When i worked at target i came in as a seasonal employee and earned my way to a full time employee. Workplace was always tidy and clean very friendly supportive team leads and managers. Overnight stocking is a very fast paced physical work which i somestimes didnt mind allowed for the night to go by fast. All around good work experience.
good,"Target is a great place to work if you are in college or high school. If you want to make a career out of it that is very possible as well. My coworkers were awesome, and made shifts fun. "
good,"A typical day was spent, at least for me, helping guests find exactly what they were looking for, while also assisting the front end as well as covering for electronics.  I liked helping people with electronics (even though I only knew the basics), but my coworkers were never afraid to help teach me things I needed to improve on while covering a different department."
good,"I was there for 10 years, and a back injury turned the company sour toward me.  I wasn't the only person to go through this.  Until I got hurt the company was fun and paid very very well."
good,Worked here for a year a relatively enjoyed it. Amazing people to work with and the management is usually super laid back. Work load is surprisingly heavy for such a small store. Everyone gets a bit perplexed on the stressful days
good,"the most enjoyable part of the job was the pace at which we worked. It was fast paced and very hands on which made the job a lot of fun to do. Also, the people I worked with made it the most fun since we all got along well for the most part."
good,Very stressful and expectations were high and uneven between coworkers.  Too much turn over with management and rules were always changing. Not challenging anymore.
good,A typical day at work is usually relaxed. On the weekends its a little fast paced. Management is okay. Hardest part of the job is staying aware and customer-service like for a long period of time. The most enjoyable part of the job is greeting and meeting new people.
good,"Target is modifying their business model and i would say it both benefits and hurts a lot of employees; however, the customer experience should be better than its ever been. Overall, this Target was a great experience.  My department for the most part embraced a fun, productive, and customer service focused culture with the goal on driving sales."
good,A typical day at work was always busy and sometimes chaotic.I really liked working the cash register. I got to meet a lot of really nice people. Management was friendly for the most part. I learned how to operate the cash register. Workplace culture was average. The hardest part of the job was worrying about making a mistake.
good,"Target has a lot of different teams to accommodate lots of different skills."
good,"Target was a great place to work, the people were nice (coworkers and customers), management was great and the hours were not horrible. There is a lot of opportunity for growth and advancement within the company. Really enjoyed my time there."
good,"Assisting customers with items and questions while on the sales floor. Learned a lot about how to converse with different types of people. Lower management was good, but I cannot say too much about higher management due to lack of knowledge about their main roles."
good,The Management team that I work with are fair and friendly. The typical day is fast paced and energetic. As a Customer Service Associate/Cashier I meet many guests and customers throughout the day.  Target maintains diversity and fairness to all employees.
good,it is a tough job and can be long for some people. i found it to be enjoyable to a point made lots of friends that will last a lifetime (hopefully). started my day before anyone else arrived other than one boss that helped me start the truck (3:30 am) had to take care of everyone's trash from the day before to start. as the day progresses it gets easier as more and more people start to show up. worked there for 6 years then went to collage which they let me take a leave of absence for it so i would still have a job to come to when i was on break.
good,"Target taught me how to multitask and how to finish tasks in a short time frame. "
good,An amazing company with a fantastic team culture.  Certainly a fast-paced environment where you must get creative to meet the many needs of your Guest while working to develop your team around new company initiatives.
good,"I was responsible for the cash office, ordering money and making sure everything balanced in the system.  I prepared the next mornings cash register funds."
good,working here was fun and fast paced. it was nice to interact with the customers every day. they added a brightening to my day. the hardest part of the job was to sell the red card.
good,"The bond between team members is almost family-like, but management could use some work on communication and planning skills. There are many opportunities to learn functions of different departments."
good,"Management training has been the best I've received in my time in different management roles.  Target wants to keep up with the changes in the distribution industry, so being adaptable and fast at implementing changes is crucial.  Fast paced work everyday.  I've learned how to be the best kind of genuine leader who gets desired results."
good,"All the managers were fair and upfront about their expectations. The work was easy, but somewhat monotonous. The only downside to working there was forced overtime during busy parts of the year."
good,I had a great time working at Target. Very friendly employees. Some of the managers were a little scary but they just have to put on a face. I recommend working here.
good,"Was my first job, and honestly the pay was fair. I was moved around to different places and did not mind. Obviously, some customers were terrible, but that's not Target's fault."
good,"The job had a heavy focus on customer service, and consisted of doing the same thing every day. Keeping the area clean was another priority, especially at the end of a closing shift. If you're an extrovert, this could be a great job for you. If you're an introvert, it could get boring and dreadful after the first few months."
good,Every day was fast paced. I learned a lot about team work. Leaned hot to use a cash register. I also learned how to use a price gun. Was a great new experience while learning about retail.
good,Target is a normal retail job that doesn't pay nearly high enough to deal with the type of clientele they get. Depending on what store you're at depends on how much you like the experience. I was lucky enough to work in two stores that had great management and people.
good,Good hours as part time. It was pretty relaxed most of the time. Had multiple managers on duty who where friendly and helpful. Memorizing the store layout comes to you in a few days. Everyone worked as a team and you can always get help with a task.
good,Honestly didn't mind working here. I don't plan on working here for a very long time but it was nice while it lasted. It can be stressful at times but everyone seems to be doing their best.
good,Upper managenent needs to help more and sometimes are unaware of what’s best for the store. My ideas that helped create a better store and effective process were ignored.
good,"The backroom is nice because you don't have to deal with customers 24/7. Holiday hours are the best, but it's retail. Management for my team was great, but the other department heads I didn't care for."
good,The one thing I really do enjoy about Target is how much they actually care about how we feel. If you're sick they call and make sure you're okay. It can be slow from time to time and management doesn't say much unless your work isn't done.
good,"Fast-pace work environement with emphasis on multi-tasking, customer service, and flexible work hours. Daily tasks including, cashiering, stocking shelves, customer service, and task management. Time management and project management experience is recommended."
good,It was a nice summer job. They didn't have a enough hours though plus I relocated to wahpeton after after few months. They didn't pay that good and no hours.
good,"Most of my co workers were friendly so its was really easy to get used to the jobs but as a cart attendant it was usually a fast paced job with little time to rest (not counting breaks). Since your going to be outside for about 90% of the time be sure to stay hydrated, other than that its a fun job with an added bonus of a good workout"
good,This is a good beginner job for those with some workplace experience. Fun and engaging opportunity to expand you skill set beyond your hiring description.
good,"The most satisfying part of working for Target comes from overcoming adversity. Luckily, there is a lot of adversity. If you are willing and able to sell to guests as well as maintain brand operations, this is the place for you!"
good,"I really liked working for Target because of their treatment of the LGBTQ community, and their company's respectful attitude towards anyone who identified as such. Unfortunately, while I got along with some of the workers, there were quite a few (including the team managers) who had a habit of making you feel a bit stupid in comparison to them. Not a reflection on the company, more just the unpleasant working environment because of the people."
good,"The colleagues are the best part of target the workforce there is very welcoming, friendly,  and helpful. I was able to learn so much in the time I have been there and would highly suggest friends and family to work there."
good,A typical day would be to come into work from 4am to 12:30pm about 5 days a week. I would unload the merchandise off the trucks that got sent to the store and stock the shelves afterwards. The most enjoyable part about my job is that fact that I am well respected by my team members and leaders.
good,I sometimes regret leaving the company I had to for personal reasons but if I got a call tomorrow for a ETL position I would take it in a heartbeat. Seems be be promoting from within more and more.
good,"The company is a numbers based forward progress setting where the main belief is consistantly raising numbers to keep the workload compeditive.  Not for everybody, this is due to a very physical and demanding enviroment as well as massive manditory overtime hours."
good,"Target was great, it has some good workers there. The times I had there were the best. It does get busy and at time you will have to help more then one person. You’ll will have to gain knowledge on what area they put you in. Also you have to kinda be fast."
good,"I answered calls for the store. Stocked shelves, assisted customers.  "
good,In my time at Target there other employees were very helpful and there was never a point where I feel I was being overbearing with questions to my manager.
good,"While I only worked at Target for a short amount of time, I could say everything about Target is reasonable. From the company specials to the hourly pay. Target is a really good place to work at,"
good,"Target is a good place to work and it was fun but because there were 6 different managers who would trade off on opening and closing shifts. So, some managers are great and some are awful."
good,"A typical day at work, communicating with guests. I've learned a lot about Target is as a company. The management is okay. The workplace is a busy, fast pace, interactive job. The hardest part of the job is when some of the guest clearly wont listen to anything you say. You try to explain to them whats going to happen and they want to speak to the manager. Once the manager gets there, and the manager has said exactly what I said, they still want to argue. The most enjoyable part of working at Target is some of the people I work with, or guests that I come across."
good,"I was a business intern at the store level between college semesters. It was very interesting, as I got to work in all the various types of roles at the store."
good,"The company was ran fairly well but the overnight workers didn’t feel as if we were treated the same as the daytime employees, but other than that it was an okay store"
good,Work was always quick paced and a lot of teamwork. Everyone has there role as a team and everyone needs to play there role. would like to see more teamwork as well though.
good,Managers could vary on quality but most workers were friendly. Good benefits and fair pay though lacking in hours. Very flexible with life and other obligations especially for students. Overall a good place to work and especially for high school students.
good,Everything that is expected of you is laid out clearly. You are usually given a specific set of tasks to complete and after they are finished you are free to move on to other work.
good,"This was a seasonal position for me during the winter. I worked in the soft line department, I mostly picked up and reorganized all the clothing in the men and women sections. Dressing room is where I would help out after my areas were cleaned, so things like putting everything back such as clothes, shoes, and toys as well as making sure tags are still on the items. Helped answer phone calls at the help desk from time to time and even some cashiering."
good,"Supervisor of photo lab employees, ordered inventory, scheduling work hours.  Customer Service - took care of customers who had returns, questions.  Supervised Customer Service area.  The most enjoyable/hardest part of the job are similar.  The customers who come into the store.  You can get people who are really upset about a product.  However, when you are able to satisfy them, it is a good feeling.  I enjoyed most of the people I worked with and people did help each other out.  Management changed too much in the store I was in."
good,"I enjoyed my time there. I worked day/night/weekend shifts and it was sometimes very demanding, but I got used to it because it is a collaborative environment. I worked Part-time as a student. I liked my supervisor! I left because I wanted to concentrate on my education; which I have finally completed."
good,Nothing special just an average job with a lot of responsiblities. Would not recommend to people with lots of work experience. But if this is your first or second job it would be a great fit.
good,"A great example of retail work. Fairly thankless, but the management is fair, and the hours are flexible. The experience greatly depends on management though, bad management can make the job a nightmare. The workplace is professional but the coworkers are usually friendly. It feels like a team, especially when the bosses aren't micromanaging. Interpersonal skills are a must."
good,Took quite some time to make any advancements of position. Work environment was positive and so was interactions with management. Good job if your interested in a retail job.
good,"target is all about working as a team unit and helping guests."
good,"Target allows you to learn new things to work on in the store, but they don't give you 40 hours whether you applied as full-time or not. They say when you learn a new work area, you will get a raise but that doesn't seem to be true either. T hey always have food available to you - which is nice so you don't have to bring a meal everyday for lunch or buy a lunch. They allow you to take home spoiled food as well."
good,"Target definitely is a fun place to work. Fostering your own team, meeting goals, promoting individuality is only some of the jobs target promotes. Although my job title was more recently created, it was rather stressful. My position did was Executive Team Leaders do at Big Box target but for way less hourly pay (Executives being salary)."
good,"Fun group of people to work with, very laid back. Some tasks could be taken more seriously, such as dusting shelves or checking expiration dates of items."
good,Worked as both a cashier and in the cash office counting and balancing previous days money.  All employees had a lot of pride in the company and in giving good customer service
good,People are nice. as long as you show up everyday you should have no problem. Benefits are okay but kind of expensive considering the low pay. All in all a good place to work
good,"A typical day at work is just doing training and telling customers what phones we have in stock and the promotions that we offer"
good,"A lot of companies pitch family values, and more of a team atmosphere. But this was true, people were nice to each other, relaxed and understanding. You might not make a lot to start out, but they move people up in the corporate world. Managers needed a degree to have that position, so your management staff is qualified."
good,"Target does a great job at hiring friendly and energetic people to work at their stores. "
good,Fun place to work if you buy into the Target brand and culture.  everyone that come in loves Target so it makes the job much better.
good,"Very fast paced work environment, friendly environment, good work hours, fair pay, good management, management takes care of employees, no real benefits"
good,Ive been working at my location for a year and a half now and I like it alot. Target is my only job at the moment and I am only part time but work full time hours. It decent pay and very easy work no matter where they position you in the store.
good,My daily work day consists of pulling and back stocking merchandise for the guests. Target is a good place to work for but very hard to move up in.  Pay isn't the best but is an enjoyable workplace.
good,I worked part-time overnight for about 4 1/2 years then I switched to a part-time cashier. The atmosphere was all right and the worker's were helpful.
good,My coworker made it enjoyable and the guests were very pleasing to deal with. I was welcomed in when I first started working there. It is a nice and clean environment to be around.
good,"Management is usually good at identifying an individual's skills to best match them with a work center i.e. stocking, cashiering, sales specialty etc."
good,Can be a place to grow into. The variety of merchandise coincides with the variety of people you encounter. There is a certain pride in running a top notch store and keeping in tip top shape!
good,"I had a lot of fun working here! I felt a connection with the people who were on my immediate team. I even got a chance to crosstrain in other areas of the store, which was cool."
good,"Manage the salesfloor department, Safety captain for the district, assist Store Manage with leading the team when they were out the building.  "
good,Fast paced and employees are great to work with. It has its ups and downs. Career advancement is not great right now. Generally has nonstop tasks to do.
good,"Working with the team at 2 location locally has been a great experience.  Management tries to keep up with the changing corporate climate, but locally the team works well together."
good,Always changing environment where you get to work with some of the best engineers in tech.  Across all departments technology is important and leaders have a technical background.
good,There is no typical work day as the day is different with every guest that comes through the door. You have a set of duties designated to you at the beginning of the shift but you may or may not finish depending on the foot traffic your store has for the day. I learned the basic functions of my department along with being cross trained in others. The culture of the workplace is fair as you build chemistry with others in and out of your department. The hardest part of the job is the guests mixed with the workload. The most enjoyable part is the flexible hours when it pertains to school.
good,Working at target was a great opportunity and great experience for my first job. They accommodated to my needs as a school student as only gave me shifts outside of school hours. The daily job was to tidy up the clothing sections and fitting rooms and as needed helped out on the registers.
good,Working at Target was great. They do there best to work with you for scheduling and there are plenty of opportunities for more hours if you make it known you'd like more. Everyone works well together and makes the environment enjoyable.
good,Target is super flexible with hours and have no problem working around student schedules. however it sucks when you're working about 40 hours a week and get used to the pay and then when the season changes your hours drop and get paid half of what you were with 40 hours. and the management sucks.
good,"Use PDA to scan inventory for backstock. "
good,I worked in the pharmacy and in the cashier position as needed. It was hard to work a full 35-40 hours a week and survive. Hours were so erratic it was hard to work a second/third job.
good,The atmosphere was overall friendly and the managers worked well with time availability. Miscommunications between the managers and employees were often. I learned valuable skills concerning customer service.
good,"Depending on the store, and which leader is there for the day, can dramatically affect the experience that one would have working there on any given day. For a college student, or someone who is looking to supplement income, it's a great place to work. As a full time job, I would recommend not doing so."
good,"Despite it being in a college town and having a huge rush during the school season and on holidays, would 100% recommend working here. The staff is friendly and will work with the guests to get the desired product. Learning how to grab things from the storage room and learn how to cashier are skills I can apply to similar jobs. The hardest part for me was that I only worked weekends so when things changed at work I was last to know and wouldn't be told until a few weeks after the change. I greatly enjoyed helping all types of guests in the store and learning how to work with different types of people that I run into daily."
good,working for target was fun.i do regret not being able to stay because i was temporary. and for the amount of work the overnight crew does they should be paid more
good,"Working here has taught me about team building and the importance of helping customers on the sales floor. A typical day at work included doing go backs,  stocking the shelves up, and cleaning up our designated areas. I enjoy all my coworkers because we have built friendships."
good,"Starbucks can be stressful , especially when theres a line of 12 people and only two of us, target always says if you dont like a department , you can always switch to another.... but that's a lie , when your in starbucks you are stuck , it is very hard to transfer out ."
good,"-Hours are good"
good,The goal is pretty much the same year round. It just becomes a lot more stressful trying to accomplish the same task with a lot more obstacles. Lots of paid meals during peak days.
good,"Hardest part of the job is lack of sales associates on the floor, great place for a summer job,  Learned a great deal of team work and selling skills."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of unloading boxes of product and stocking them on the shelf. I learned self discipline and got more experience in the grocery industry. Management was great! Friendly, optimistic, motivating, and professional. The workplace culture was safe and positive. Hardest part of the job was doing graveyards. Most enjoyable was working with my best friend."
good,I enjoyed working for Target while they were hear in Canada.  I got to work with a great group of people and Management staff.  They were always willing to train staff.  Hardest part of job is the big sales days and holidays.
good,It was fun to work at Target. Management was nice and always helpful. The only issue was getting enough hours to actually support oneself. I was lucky when I would get more than 20 hours in a week.
good,"opening the department , making sure the place is organizer and making fresh foods on minutes bases, making sure guest need are satisfies. training new hire."
good,"Target was a very busy job, you constantly are staying busy which makes time go by faster. But the some of the managers had a difficult time understanding personal problems. But work with your schedule."
good,"Target was a fun part time job. Honestly the expectations for the team members were high, especially for the low wadges the company paid. Yearly raises were a joke. If it wasn't for the awesome team members you ""suffer"" through your shift with I don't think many people would work there. The company also has very high turnover rates throughout all levels of employment."
good,"If you're like me and prefer to work out of sight of customers, I would recommend stocking here to anybody.  They take care of their employees; I had no problems working here."
good,I was working the graveyard shift which I was not a fan of but other than that the job was really quite enjoyable. Great friendly work enviroment with great management.
good,"Great communication."
good,I enjoy working for Target... the environment and people make it fun to come in to work every day.  The benefits are good as Target keeps up with neighboring warehouses
good,"Target became a family to me really quickly. They definitely looked out for their team members whenever they could. I learned quite a bit in the loss prevention world, which is definitely benefiting me now."
good,"Overall great place to work for, lack luster managers and team leads. If you do get the job there will always be something to do. Avoid working in cosmetics and electronics they will force you to stay in that spot and not leave"
good,"Target is a good place to work. The company and management seem to care a lot about employee morale. There are events regularly (employee art show, art contests, gingerbread house building in the break room) and quite often food is brought in for the employees. They have strict break policies, but they are in place to ensure that employees actually get all of their allotted break time. Overall a very good workplace."
good,At target you are not exactly a cashier you are a Team Member which means you are responsible to uphold some policies like occasionally selling the Target Store Credit Card which would hold on the line and duties of the cashiering side. Was annoying.
good,"Everyone of the team members were always great and they were the ones who made it fun to work there. Good community to work with."
good,It was a great experience to learn from the retail industry. What needs to met and how to really focus on the customers. It had it challenging moments but it was a good experience to learn how to do things.
good,"Overall management was ok, but when you can't go to your manager in food to ask a question its hard. Hire people in food departments that have food experience, not just management. I had to overcome that and make decisions on my own, which worked out for the better anyway. Loved the people I worked with, especially my Team Leader."
good,Everyone was so friendly! Great atmosphere. I really felt a great team work vibe and everyone worked well together. I was tired at the end of every shift but it was a sense of accomplishment.
good,During Holidays it is very busy and you are able to get as many hours as you want. Once the sales go down your hours do as well. If you are a student and are looking for a part time this is great.
good,"it was a great place to work overall but they are not loyal to anyone no matter how long you have been there or how hard you work, management is even let go at the drop of a dime"
good,I had a good experience with all the associates.  I had a great deal of respect for the management team and I believe they also share the same level of respect for me.
good,"worked the 4am truck shift and it although everyone says you'll get used to the hours you really wont. More of less the work environment is pretty ok. If you are lucky to have a good team lead and ETL it should go by smoothly, however a bad team lead or ETL makes working there uncomfortable."
good,It's good and fast paced time goes by fast if you're busy. Depending on the store performance you could lose a shift if the store is not making enough sales. So it's not a guarantee you'll be working everyday . But the experience there with working with equipments gives you confidence on working if you're working on a project on you're own. Team leaders are the best motivation at work. So as the team members.
good,Working at Target was a good experience for me. I learned to work well with others. Target also taught me skills i could use at mostly any workplace. I learned Customer Service and management skills.
good,Working at Target was fun but it was a really fast paced and productive job with a lot of business. The people in there were very cool and pleasant...
good,It is a fast paced environment that is constantly changing.  New projects and systems happen regularly.  It was sometimes hard to get  fellow coworkers to accept the changes and stay up to speed.
good,This job took most of my time but it was good experience for me cause I never worked holidays until I got to this job and it was nice but I wish I didn't have to work holidays .
good,"This was a Christmas/New Years job. I was able to work almost 40 hours a week. It was great! Afterwards, they started cutting staff."
good,"Job is good, there is some stress... but that is what is to wake knowing there could be a difficult guest."
good,"It was more or less an enjoyable workplace to be in; the staff were quite friendly and were willing to help out with any issues that I had. Being a bit of a cleaning freak, there was a lot of opportunities to tidy up products, however their management is a bit loose in terms of cleanliness. I really enjoyed working at the change rooms where a lot of people commute, I became engrossed with looking after people's shopping and giving it back when they came out alongside reorganizing returned clothing; time flew by really quickly when you're enjoying work. I do wish however that there was a more effective way of preventing theft in the change rooms as I once or twice found ripped packaging whilst I was cleaning, although I believe that it was significantly decreased when I continuously checked people's belongings or shopping despite the annoyed glances."
good,Target is a good company that allows employees to acquire work experience in retail. The main goal of the company is guest satisfaction. Management is flexible with the schedule.
good,a typical day at target is fast paced and lots of exercise is involved moving the boxes. what I learned is to organize and consolidate pallets. communication is key in a warehouse environment. safety is key.
good,"A typical work day for my assigned position would be fast paced and occasionally stressful. I learned how to set aisles, planograms, etc. Management is terrible. There is a tug-of-war between managers and team leads where individuals fight for authority. Workplace culture is a friendly atmosphere where co-workers work together to accomplish a task."
good,"I have had friends who love their job here, but I was rather unimpressed. The only saving grace was the pay: I made $12/hour and that was at the low end of hourly earnings compared to some of my co-workers."
good,"You must be on point and Not slack. Depends what department you work at target, you would have daily tasks to do. For example I worked in the market area I would make sure there's nothing on the floor that needs to be done. Then I would go to the back and start pushing merchandise through out all of market."
good,"Target is a great company. Unfortunately, at my location I was not given a chance to move higher up, and neither were any of my fellow team members. There was a lot of favoritism and our management was not very good at all. So personally, I would stay with target, if only I weren't at the same store."
good,"Target is very fast paced work, stressful work, especially when you have to deal with lines and lines of customers. One thing I learned from here is to treat all customers with kindness."
good,"By far, the most comfortable job I have had. Management is so hands-on. They have no problem helping when needed . "
good,"Use you until they don't need you any more, have no interest in what may be going on in your personal life as it pertains to work. Very biased when it comes to who gets the most hours, and very messy too worried about who is who instead of the persons work ethic. A great company to work for under the right management."
good,"Target has been an enjoyable, hardworking job. There are some days where I am needed to get heavy merchandise off of shelves in the back and there are some days where I am needed to just put light merchandise on the sales floor. All of my managers have made me feel welcome and they are very personable."
good,"Advancement in all  areas of my job, Training constanly . I  have learned a lot fro team leaders and team members. support teams are great with training ."
good,"It is a great job for retail. I loved cashiering and it taught very good skills., it was my first job. They give you a lot of great advancement opportunities and they pay you well."
good,"I've worked at Target for over 4 years now, always payed above average but expected to do more work than any realistic expectation. Most managers were/are very condescending even if you've been around for years. Lazy team leaders that rarely get any sort of slap on the wrist even let alone discipline. Most lower level workers were perfectly fine, little to no trouble and plenty of friendly faces. Taught very little but expected to know things above your pay grade. The average customer was fine though you'll always have a few that are stuck up on their high horse just like in any job."
good,"good and bad freight"
good,Target it a flexible workspace willing to work with you and help you grow in different areas of the store. They allow you to set foot in different areas of the company and explore the wide range of roles through the store.
good,Employees and managers at Target are very friendly. A typical day at Target involves ensuring all employees take their scheduled lunch breaks and that they are on task with their responsibilities.
good,For the most part it is a good job. Just got tired of the 4am start times. They will cross-train you so you can get more hours in various departments.
good,nice place to work at depending on what store you are at. Just an all round decent place to work at if you like retail. not much for job advancement..
good,"A typical day as a cashier involves checking customers out at the check lanes or self-checkout.  Managers encourage cashiers to ask customers if they have a red card (store card saving them 5% off) and remind them of coupons on the Target App to use.  When it is slow, they can aid in a variety of other duties from restocking, ""zoning"" (,making products look tidy and pulled to the front), to putting away stray product."
good,"Working in customer service was rewarding being able to help customers find what they need. The best part about working at this company was that everyone was willing to help in other departments in the store. We were very flexible when it came to ""titles"", just as long as we knew that we were helping the customers have a great Target experience."
good,"They run you like mules, but if you can keep up with the pace of the work you have opportunities to climb in the company. Management was poor, too many OM's directing the workers. No real connection with your superiors. Great benefits and pay and the hours are great if you are looking for a 10-12 hour shifts."
good,"at target i was a cashier and i worked in the starbucks , its had its busy times but that every business . they strive for the best customer service , best to always smile ."
good,Target is a good place to work for high school / undergrads.. definitely would recommend for kids having their first job or have no experience in anything else.
good,"While I am still working there I can say I work with a lot of amazing individuals, Though the work is easy given my experience, It's a place that anyone should work to get experience in retail."
good,"typical day at work - a lot of demands with little to no help"
good,"Typical day at work is to read emails from previos shift for informatin needed to work in my area. I break out the schedule so the team knows where they will be working for the day. Visit with the team members about the tasks and duties required for the day. I supervise the team and coach as needed. I provide education when needed. Purge clothes from the back and bring to the floor, bring out pulls for the team to work out to the floor pad so it's available for the guests."
good,I worked overnight so the hours were not that great. Some times of the year I got very little hours while around the holidays I worked nearly 40 hours so if you want a steady and reliable schedule this is not the place  for you.
good,I wanted to stay however when the season ended that was it they cut me loose.  I'm going to keep trying to get back in to Target full time.  they believe in total teamwork especially at closing time if your behind you will get help.  If you are not a team player this job most likely not be for you.
good,"I truly enjoyed my time at Target, I did a multiple of jobs here, customer service, cashier, photo center, and sales floor. I do believe that their starting pay is not enough."
good,"I would recommend this job to someone who enjoys guest service, backroom work (stocking, pushing new items, relocating product), and cashiering. It was a great experience for me."
good,"Target is an excellent big box corporation...may hey last another 100 years."
good,"We started downloading the truck. It was the funnest part of the work."
good,The store managers are to approach and talk to. The team leaders know their stuff. Everybody is know by name and face. Everyone is helpful and easy going.
good,"Calf delves, get the scanner gun with cart and pick all items in allot time. After you get done put up inventory in correct place. Pallet jack some items around. Use baler"
good,Very fast paced with good pay. Worked 10 hours a day 4 days a week. Over time around holidays. Good place to work. Highest picker for 3 years. Learned how to pace myself for 10 hour shifts and be very productive.
good,Its fun and easy to learn if you are willing. Lots of great people within the company from the managers to the workers. I learned so much working there like building bikes to running cash registers.
good,I worked many hours and got paid a bit over minimum wage.  Great managers and a great staff.  Everybody always happy.  Pay was prompt and for the hours worked.
good,"constantly working with customers, also making sure aisles and shelves were neat and presentable for customers, also making sure customers purchased items were properly handled."
good,"Good work place, managers weren’t bad but not over the top good either. I was let go because I was quick enough which is understandable. I did enjoy the job a lot, I’m a hands on person and that’s the perfect job for it. I would recommend it."
good,"The worklife balance just didn't exist sadly. I was an ETL Log and love the job, but I was missing out on my life. I also wanted the holidays with my family which  retail doesn't allow."
good,"It was a fun experience, and I actually enjoyed being a cashier, and bagging very much. I love being around people, so the fact that is was all customer service was a plus for me. I love to talk while working, so I'm glad I was able to do a lot of that. I only worked with 2 to 3 people at a time in my work space, which was relaxing in a way. The hardest part of working at Target was when it got extremely busy and there were issues with the registers. Other than that, it was relaxing and pretty simple. Managers were everywhere if you ever needed help, or advice which was great."
good,I loved my job at Target I was there almost 10 years. They say go to Human Resources when you have a problem but when your human resources is the one making your life hard it's hard to feed ur family and pay your bills when your job is a 40 hrs per week job and it keeps getting butchered to 32 or 34. Especially when u do the work of many people always there when needed.
good,"Target is a great company to work for, don't get me wrong but as an executive team leader it can become overwhelming. You constantly have to keep up with payroll that never seems to be enough to get you through a week's work. Also, ETLs don't get paid enough for the amount of time, work and effort they put in. The best thing about Target is work culture."
good,Target has a good working culture. The stores are clean and employees tend to be attentive to guests and fellow employees. Employees discounts are nice.
good,"Target has a lot of benefits including discounts with products at other companies. The paid time off is based on your hours worked per paycheck. Unless you are management, hours are very unstable. However, they are good about working around your personal schedule as long as you give them enough notice."
good,Clock in make pizza wash dishes wait on guest pop popcorn clean and bake foods keep hot case full and cold drink space clean stock the mayo and mustard
good,"A typical day at Target as a cashier was mainly to get ""Red Cards"" red cards is a credit card for target. It was a big competition, but always a tough time because not everyone wanted to sign up for a credit card. That was the hardest aspect on the job, my coworkers were really nice in the time I was at target. Target employees do work as a team and help each other out though."
good,This job was great all around being my first job. But that's all it was. I wasn't an average employee overall. I recommend this job only for beginners and managers.
good,"Working at Target isn't the most amazing thing in the world, but its not bad either. It's a good place to start working for your first official job. However, unless you really want to pursue a career in retail, it's not for the long run."
good,people were fun friendly and hard working got along and always recognized each other for our roles we played at our store. we worked together and hard to keep the store in good shape so customers would enjoy their time shopping also had a lot of regulars and it was hard when we shut down for all the people who worked and shopped.
good,If you're looking for a part time or full time job and not looking to advance then its a good place to start. Often times you work for awhile with little to no incentive. It's difficult to move up there and stay where you move.
good,"As telephone operator, my days were consistent. I would sit at the operators desk in the fitting room, greet guests and anser phone calls. Pretty laid back job."
good,"I worked in the distribution center for 8 years. Loved it until the GM left. Great benefits, cookouts every now and then, good discounts. The co-workers there are very competitive"
good,Overall it was a good working place. Friendly employees. As a high school student it was kind of hard because they gave a lot of hours for part-time job.
good,"The coworkers are the best, made the work day so much fun and easier to go through. as a instock team lead a typical day usually is very fast pace, performing stock count on the sales floor with my team, performing inventory adjustments, and maintain warehouse stock count as well of making sure shipping and receiving process is done the right way. The management is very helpful on helping with issues throughout the day, and made it easier for me on taking on the role."
good,At TARGET I learn to leave my outside issues at home. I also learn how to deal with people who seem to be getting hostile. Management  is understanding for the most part. The work place is very diverse. The most enjoyable  part of work are my co workers they make the day worth wild for me.
good,"Target was a great company to work for!! Everyone worked as a team, from the front end to the backroom.  Target is more organized than any other Retail company I've worked for."
good,"Early mornings, learned how to organize and restock, management could not remember my name, working with other fun people. Discount was 10% and could be 15% with RED card."
good,"At target, your assigned to different positions to where you've applied to mine was cashier/ trainer. I greet customers while checking them out while at the register which is an easy position to obtain. I've learned how to obtain knowledge of the register and during the time I've became a trainer and advised while training new employees"
good,Target is a fun working environment as long as you are working management will let you do your own thing. Your coworkers are supportive and helpful whenever they are needed.
good,"Target was my first job after high school. I learned a lot. From cashiering to putting milk out for the next day, you really have the opportunity to do it all and really get that experience under your belt."
good,"supervisors and other employees were fun to work with. Caring management. Opportunities to advance. Pay and hours were low if you were a new employee, and benefits were not the greatest. Overall a fun environment."
good,Met some great people there and gained a strong bond with them as well. I just would like some career development in my life. Amazing company though I can admit
good,"Average day was usual good. I was primarily a cashier but was given the opportunity to learn the Customer Service Desk. I liked that! The hardest part of the job was dealing with some management and a lack of communication. Occassionally, my hours were changed without being notified (like I read it, leave and it's changed). The best part was the variety in customers."
good,"As a High School student during my time working at Target, they worked well around my schedule. Work was straight forward and management really pushed you to do great. If you needed help they were there."
good,On your feet all day. Fast paced retail environment. Pushes those who want to grow and do more. Structured in a way that sets you up for success. Work life balance is biggest con.
good,It is a fun place to work. The workers and guests are very friendly. The hours are flexible and the bosses are nice. I would recommend that people work there.
good,When I first started out there were great managers and it was a fun place to work. Management changed and they wanted you to work almost every day. Said they allowed overtime but when you were in overtime they got mad at you.
good,"Working at target is pretty typical to working anywhere dealing with retail. The management was alright, but the hours are not enough if you are living on your own."
good,"Doing the same thing all day every day. Not hard mentally, but can take a toll on your body. Work four 10 hour days or Three 12 hours days. Not a bad schedule. $16 an hour to start"
good,"Target is a good job to work at except for the managers. Target will work with your schooling, your other job, and family affairs. They pay good, thay may start you off at 10 or 12 and i think its every six months or quarterly a pay raise."
good,"as a cashier, i enjoyed working at target very much. there are always great ways to help guests and other team members. work environment was fast-paced but not too stressful"
good,Overall I enjoy working at Target. Most of my coworkers are great. I wish the hours were better and they didn't push us so hard to get redcards all the time.
good,Very fun place to work. Fast paced. Lack of leadership because of lack of communication. There are lots of ways of moving up in the company. Overall good place to work.
good,"The supervisors made sure you had no questions and were sure of how to complete your job in an efficient manner. They made sure you were aware of how things worked, and put guest's happiness a top priority and employee a close second."
good,I enjoyed working at Target my co workers were friendly and so was the managers. Around holiday time gets so hectic and crazy over there it was a very frustrating time but i managed to get through it with my helpful team members.
good,"I worked in most positions within this company on a store level from logistics to sales to everything in between, and although I was a great worker and advanced remarkably quickly in this company, as soon as I became a logistics team leader, I had no options to continue moving up in the company without a 4-year degree even with a plethora of experience not only with the job but with the company. Pay was not appropriate for the level of work and effort I was exuding as well as positive results. Management throws employees under the bus too often to save face."
good,Overall an awesome company to work for. Target is constantly growing and looking at ways to stay on top of  the competitive market. There are lots of team member benefits!
good,"it could get better in terms of pay  and advancement, more holidays will be appreciated. fun culture, very competitive and goal oriented. A typical day is filled with outlined goals and meeting them in between snacks and great conversation among peers."
good,target is a place were you work to learn how to work in other areas of the store.  working for target gave me a lot of working experiences in other areas like hot food.
good,"Was a decent place to work, the big problem is that with outbound they promise training but wait forever to actually do it. it took almost a month and a half to get trained on a forklift when the job almost requires it. Instead i would have to find someone else to load the 2000 pound pallets of water for me and with them being busy sometimes it would take a while or never happen and depending on the boss you could get in trouble for not having things cleaned up by the end of the night. Thats my only real complaint, if you dont mind working hard its not a bad place to work and they have great benefits and a decent vacation system."
good,"Target is a great company to work with my complaint is the turn over in management. Some say its stress, others say they don't get what they need career wise. They have great benefits and can work with your schedule within reason. There is a lot to learn and if you pull your load you can move up and also learn other areas."
good,"Working at Target has taught me many things, one strong point is to treat others with kindness and work efficiently and timely. I take passion in my role at Target and hope to use the same skills somewhere close to home."
good,"I recommend this job as a first job. The pay wasn't much but it also wasn't horrible, becaue I was young with no bills at the time. They are really good at customer service and I commend them for teaching me early on what great customer service looks like."
good,busy pharmacy but good staffing.  relaxed atmosphere regarding customers due to their ability to shop while they wait.  Learned first hand how an innovative company can affect retail pharmacy.  workplace culture very friendly and customer oriented.
good,"The place has only 36 hours a week which was alright since it was a 3 day work week, the only problem was the team leaders there didn't do a very good job at training."
good,"Love working at target, one of the nicest we target with great people and management. "
good,for a first time job its a great and perfect place to work but unless your a manager or higher then its not a place to call a career. like everything it depends on your location also like my location is terrible because its nothing but couponers and a lot of fraudulent activity
good,"The job requirements aren't usually difficult to grasp, but the physical aspect can take a toll if the day is particularly full of duties. The management is willing to help when it is needed. Juggling responsibilities is the name of the game and is the hardest part of the job, but if they can be balanced well then the work goes by quickly."
good,I loved the constant flow of work.  No time to be bored when there is work to do.  Enjoyed the team.  made the time fly.  Only issues were between shifts.  Days not keeping up with the Cleanliness and systems night shift put in place.
good,Great benefits. Great pay. Great safety and first response teams. They could have better management who communicate with team members more efficiently.
good,"Includes sales of credit cards with no commission or stipend and didn't really motivate workers to sell credit cards. The management was sub par, young people that would cause drama or not a great work space."
good,"If you are looking for something that keeps you on your toes, is fresh everyday, and has great potential for growth this company is for you. Just make sure you are willing to relocate and come in at the executive level. Moving up internally from anywhere lower than a executive is hard. and more hoops than most go through from the outside. "
good,"The company has some of the best employees around. "
good,"Workplace culture was friendly. Colleagues willing to help always. "
good,"Target is a great place to work for part time work, unless you are management.  The work is not hard and the people are usually friendly.  I think they have raised pay in the last couple of years to stay competitive."
good,Job was great. Flexible hours. Fixed schedule. The people who work with you (team members) are friendly and are willing to help you. I would recommend this job.
good,Really fun and competitive place to work. Good management. Good customer service as well as team work. Organizing and working as a team is a really good experience
good,"Great place to work.  They hire employs of all ages and work around an employees availability.  The focus is the guest experience and you are empowered to make it a great experience for the guest. A big piece of the job is to get guests to sign up for Red Cards.  Performance/raises are based on your success."
good,I worked here while attending college at LSU. I worked the night shift while attending college during the day. Management was very flexible with me and took into account that I was a student. They made sure that I worked my shift and still had time to focus on my classes and other duties as a student. I will always be thankful for what they have done for me.
good,"Target can sometimes be challenging, but that's with most jobs especially working in retail, my typical days work would be assisting the guest with the best customer service that Target can provide. also cashiering making sure that the guest do not stand the check out line more than five minutes. Target can sometimes be fast paste, during the weekends and Holidays. there's nothing hard about working at Target. The most enjoyable part of my job is greeting different guest and just having different conversations on the daily basis."
good,Working at Target was a quick spaced job but it was fun and the co workers are very friendly. We carried heavy load which was more like men job but other than that it was a comfortable job.
good,Always have.  Always will.  Retail is just that.  I worked there to get through a time when I needed a flexible schedule near home.  I was a Barista and Front end cashier.
good,"Target was a great learning experience for me, however I do not see myself growing with the company in the near future. Target has stopped challenging me in my current position and with no signs of advancement I am looking for a new environment to thrive in."
good,"Very quick-paced"
good,"I am grateful for Target to let me get back into the workforce after staying home with my kids for 10 years.  They will work with you for flexible hours and they do provide opportunities for advancement.  They have high expectations for work load, but it is never boring.  There is always so much to do."
good,"It was a good place to work during college but after college is over, it's time to get out and find an actual career. Advancement is easy and it's a great culture to work at."
good,A typical day involves a face-paced environment with consistent changing priorities. I learned the value of working as part of a team to accomplish large scale goals. Management was tough and sometimes inconsistent but generally very fair. The hardest part of the job was that it always seemed like the work never ended. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning the various aspects of working for a national retailer.
good,"Positive work environment.  Management is encouraging and willing to work with employees as far as schedule, sick time, personal time, training, etc..."
good,"Overall, working at Target wasn't a bad experience. The team members were nice and welcoming, but some of the Team Leaders weren't that great. One thing I did notice was that there was a lot of gossip going around. Probably the nicest people were HR amd front end. The HR was very nice and extremely helpful. If you want to advance and move up the rank in the company, you need to be very competitive. I saw many newer people get raised to a higher position over other people who had been there for some time."
good,"the hours for overnight stock were changed to 4am-12pm making the pace to be faster, but difficult to complete work with customers in the store. the team work was great the managers even helped"
good,It is a good first job for anyone to learn all about customer service. You will also learn how to work as a term to get tasks done. Your term become your family!
good,"When you're not short staffed, it is actually fun doing the role you are designated to do and not having to do everyone else's job who doesn't show up/call off."
good,"Target is a very productive work place that is very busy majority of the time. The job tasks aren't too hard but you must be fast, fun and friendly in order to grow within the company."
good,Working on the flow team is pretty self explanatory. You unload the truck and stock the shelves. I personally prefer the backroom. The work tends to be fast paced and time goes by quick. You will however feel rushed to complete tasks in order to help other people with their tasks.
good,Target was a nice place to work and it's a place where u can grow the money wasn't everything but it could have developed with time raises didn't take to long to come by but you definitely had to put the time in.
good,"It was temporary job so did not expect much out of ot. Wish they paid better. Environemnt was prety diversed between color and ages. Hardest part of the job was the uniform, need to wear better colors."
good,Team members are not reliable and are not help accountable.  The ETLs don't take responsibility for their mistakes and put the blame on the team leaders.
good,Great advancement opportunity.Great atmosphere to work. The people were really nice. Management was fair to coworkers. Fun place to work. Great place to work.
good,"I worked in the distribution center in packing department. Each day we received orders of what we would be packing. Responsibilities included packing individual items for wack store location. We marked each box, taped and shipped. Cleaned at end of shift and set up location for next shoft."
good,I love working at target. I enjoy interaction with the public. I don't like that they keep you part time to avoid Benifits. Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
good,"A typical day, you are continuously working on merchandising in one way or another. Company not really focused on customer service. Depending on the store you are in, will depend on the teamwork."
good,"Target cares a lot about personal development of its people but unless willing to relocate, there is not much advancement in the local areas. Company is going through a lot of changes right now to best prepare it for the future."
good,I worked for this company for a short time and decided to leave for a better opportunity. My coworkers were fun and management was flexible and encouraging.
good,Worked as a night stocker there. Pretty solid work and pay. Management decent and attentive though employee moral is low. This could be attributed to the graveyard shift as i believe that is common though. I like how they do make an effort to treat employees every now and then to keep the morale up. It's really too bad nobody noticed the work i put through when other employees would feign business. Making sure each employee is doing their job is important after all.
good,"Usually pretty relaxed day, management doesn't really micromanage too much, everyone is pretty friendly, I didn't learn too much and the hardest part of the job is keeping occupied when it's a slow day"
good,"Depending on the hours you plan to work for, it can be really fun once you get the hang of it. I've learned that its always important to make the customers happy and to always keep a smile. Management in Target is very professional, always there should you need help. I would say the hardest part of the job would be how often you must be able to flex in any given task should it call for it. The most enjoyable part of the job would be how its a great place to make friends with the staff"
good,a decent place to work. There were some problems with management but some were pretty good. benefits were not really all that great and pay raises were pretty low.
good,"Working at Target was only stressful at busy times (i.e. weekends). The management was very understanding and cooperative at the Hanover store, and HR always tried to meet everyone's requests."
good,In all honestly working at Target is great. It's a fast-pace environment and you are always up and moving. Learning various different skills in different departments comes with the job as well which is great for experience.
good,Has a wide range of working areas where it helps you build on you skills and qualities while keeping you busy with the daily schedule. Management is outstanding and everyone is very friendly and cooperative.
good,"I think Target is a good place for a first job. The workplace is clean and organized, management is well defined and structured, and the work is easy enough for anyone to do. "
good,"Working at Target at first was great, but as many members left as well as management, it has become a bit difficult to work there. Not enough members are there to help the guests as well as no chance to grow within the company."
good,Target backroom and customer service mainly dealt with customers. I would have to assist them with returns and damaged products as well as answering customers phone request.
good,"Always kept me on my toes, being prepared to help in any department that may require assistance. Multiple departments a day. I learned about sales, phones, displays, signage, logistics and clothing/cosmetic departments here. Workplace culture is some of the best, and non-judgemental. Most enjoyable part of the job was setting things or correcting things to how they should be for the guests, as well as some of the personal relationships I had built with the guests. Hardest part of the job was general retail struggles such as an area you just cleaned getting destroyed within 10 minutes of you fixing it."
good,"It was an easy job, but they did not want to work around my summer band schedule (it's in August for 3 weeks prior to the start of school). Other than that, the job was nice and I like it there."
good,"They are not very lenient or willing to work with student schedules. In order to get your time off you suggest, your schedule created properly, or anything along those lines, you have to suck-up and be buddy-buddy with whoever is doing the schedule. They tend to play favorites which can be extremely off-putting and unmotivating."
good,I truly enjoyed my job at Target. Aside from a manager who talked down to people the job was enjoyable. The pay however was an insult to those who have been in retail for many years. They could improve on that one.
good,"•	Managed a team of 7 - 8 employees in the maintenance and stock of inventory in the back room until the product was placed on the floor"
good,"The job is cool, my coworkers were always fun. The pay is just mediocre, management wasn't always great. They had high expectations and goals that weren't attainable. But it's a good place to start. Sometimes my hours fluctuated. One week I might have 30+ hours then the next week I barely have 15 hours."
good,"Good benefit including merchandise discount , paid time off, flexible work schedule. Supervisors are relatable and understanding. Fun work environment."
good,From what I can remember target was a face paced job that you had to learn and pick up things fast. I typically work well with high tense job. Working overnight was killing me so that's why I found another employment.
good,"Organisation un peu moyenne, heure de travail qui pouvait être plus flexible et plus stable. "
good,"often asked too much from entry level roles but overall, a fairly nice company. work wasnt too bad, demanding during the holiday season though. some managers arent too agreeable"
good,The teams you work with are amazing. However working retail at over 50 hours a week gets extremely draining when you are promised promotions that don't appear.
good,Enjoyed working for target. The only reason I moved on was they didn't offer much growing room. Extremely small raises and no positions open for management really.
good,"Management is friendly and approachable.  Open door policy.  Higher standard of guest (customer)  satisfaction than most places.  Ask questions as much as you can and you will learn a lot.  In less than a year, I have learned more than most people do in retail and have had advancment oportunites.  Advancement is self paced, meaning you can advance fairly quickly if you push yourself toward it, or you can maintain any current role you have without pressure to move."
good,"Target cashiers meet and greet customers, ring up purchases, handle returns and refunds, and answer questions about products, services, and merchandise. Job duties may also include stocking shelves and assisting in sales. Ideal candidates for Target cashier jobs exude a friendly and positive demeanor at all times and work well with others. Team-oriented workers with personable personalities generally fair well during the Target hiring process. Basic mathematic skills and customer service experience also prove beneficial."
good,The company is evolving to the needs of a modern retailer.  Great benefits and work/life balance.  Fun atmosphere surrounded by hard working people.  Great community outreach.
good,greet all customers with a smile. everyday I learn something new. Management is always on the floor helping as much as they can. the culture within the work place is diverse and acceptable. hardest part of my job at this moment in time is trying to move forward within that career. most enjoyable part is working with nice and pleasant people.
good,"loved working there, great people to work with. Would still be working there if they hadn't closed. I was there for the full 2 years that they were open in Kingston."
good,"It was an enjoyable place to work, and the other co workers where very outgoing. While I was working I had noticed that management at the Target I was working at was lacking in several departments. I would have liked more professionalism."
good,Typical day of work at target is greeting customers providing a fast fun friendly type of environment for the guest. I came into target being a sales associate but leaving the company after two years with the knowledge of Branding the store. What it means to be more knowledgeable about the store and its Core Vaules.
good,"There was no typical day at work - each day was different and always challenging. The culture was very inclusive and team-oriented, with frequent encouragement. I would recommend this internship, but just know going in it's not for the faint-of-heart.  Being constantly hassled to sell Redcards was a drag.  Permanent team members who don't make their Redcard quota usually lose hours and eventually get fired."
good,"A typical work day was consistent from when I started until I left Target. Target was my first step towards retail management, I admired the managers ability to connect with the staff. Management is something I have wanted since I left Target, when I was hired on at Payless I was told that there is always a way to move up thoughout the company. At Payless I was hired as a part time associate and worked my way up towards Multiple Store Leader."
good,"A typical day at target comprise of unloading of main days pallets of truck to then be unpacked and sorted out by department. There is a also other courier delivery's which are dealt with as required. The hardest part is when there is a over-wheeling amount of work to be done with little to no help but the expiation is that the work still is required to be completed. "
good,"Very consistent schedule! "
good,"The benefits and career advancement are nothing special, but the culture is great. There's a strong emphasis on collaboration and accountability. It has undergone some significant changes since I was there, but I recall change being a bit of a slow boat. Any process evolution seemed to require selling expectation changes through multiple levels of leadership."
good,"I worked truck unload. to be up so early in the morning, my co workers were fun and helpful. we always got the job done. management was always encouraging and giving."
good,"Working at target was a decent and well paying job, the only part I didn't enjoy is they were very hard on us with getting people to apply for red cards."
good,My shift usually began at 10pm.  My position was considered full time.  I learned how to operate a power jack and how to pull inventory.  The workplace culture was fairly solitary.  Everyone concentrated on their job and worked quickly to finish. Management was good most of the time.  I most enjoyed the quick pace of the work and the ability to stay busy.
good,This is a great company to work for. However I find that it has been difficult to climb the ladder. Leadership is a unique set up. There is no specific structure to how promotions happen.
good,"Pay is awesome for a recent college graduate. Unfortunately, you will be working 60+ hour weeks and every single holiday and every other weekend. SO when you do have a vacation, you will spend the first few days trying to recover on sleep. Decent exit ops..caveat retail or sales jobs only."
good,"Target was a great work environment for me. The coworkers were very pleasant, and the management was always willing to listen to me with any concerns. Very good place to work!"
good,"Target is a company that focuses on great guest service. There number one priority as a company is to take care of their guest. Target is a Company that prides them selves on expecting more and paying less. The CEO values the team members health, so he offers benefits the promote health, which includes an additional discount on fresh produce and workout gear."
good,"The everyday work environment is nice. Management always seems to try to help you out. Co-workers are generally friendly. Wear comfy shoes. The job isn't hard, just busy all of the time. For me the most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the benefits of my hard work. I.E. my whole work area, clean, neat and organized. Overall, I have enjoyed working at Target."
good,"I would recommend target to many people, the only down side is that some younger people that have been working there for a while feel more entitled to things and it may cause confrontation"
good,It's great if you are an exempt employee. If you are not the company frequently underestimates your value and contribution to the company. There is also clear separation between how  Exempt(salaried) and non-exempt (hourly) are rewarded and recognized if at all.
good,I worked here for 2 years and easily moved up in the company. Within 2 years I got 3 pay raises (being underpaid was why i left the company I was with previously). They are also super LGBT friendly; I came in a month before changing my name legally and they were super accommodating to that and when the whole situation with the CEO coming public about the bathroom bills was going on all of my team members stuck up for me in the face of bigotry.
good,"greet customers - cashier"
good,"Very friendly, helpful, managers are very respectful and can balance work and social status. Hardest part is working a lot and not being compensated for it. Responsibilities outweigh the pay."
good,"I was hired as a seasonal employee. I was able to get over 40 hours a week. They also offer cross training and i was trained on over 10 positions, So i had flexibilty in what i did at Target. However, once the holidays were over, my hours were cut. I also was not able to work in the positions that i enjoyed the most. This is why i ultimatley left target."
good,Expect to work or get fired. Hard working people to work with. Expect to have a clean store and work hard to keep it that way. Nice people and nice customers. Poor pay.
good,"The lack of communication, growth, unity, moral at the current store that I work at is unbearable now. The upper management doesn't appreciate any of the team members or team leads."
good,Target is a very Good place to work. I really enjoy working with a diverse group of people. Target goes above and beyond to accommodate their employees.
good,"Working for target is like learning another language.  They speak in Target speak.  ""R Plus"" and "" lets have a courageous conversation."" It can be a fun company the hire you move up in the ranks.  Not so fun at the bottom.  Be positive, and shine everyday, and you will do great there."
good,Very fast paced environment to work fun steady traffic of customers makes a shift go by with ease. small talk can go a long way to make some ones day just don't get too personal
good,Target is a great work environment with great customers. The place encourages people to learn and grow with the company. I would recommend people to work here for the experience.
good,The work was very predictable and consistent.  Most of the people I worked with were fun to be around and had a good sense of humor.  The leadership team was good but not great.
good,My experience at target changed based on the day of the week and the guests that shopped that day. As a member of the Starbucks it is a very fast paced and demanding job. BUT you end up learning the regulars and loving the people that made the job enjoyable. It doesn't hurt to have a great team to work with.
good,Feels like there are not enough people working some days on the floor when we really need it. Great people to work with and everyone is kind.  I have an okay management.
good,"I personally had some fun working there. The atmosphere was pretty good, I liked my team members. "
good,"Good job for people who want summer or holiday work. It is pretty demanding even if you're sales floor. When I worked there management was awful, and judgmental. Money was great and so were the hours."
good,"The employees are friendly and that's what really matters to me the most, getting along with my co-workers. You're constantly busy, whether you're on a lane or doing anything else."
good,Being a barista in target is very stressful. There are no job advancement opportunities and the STL barely notices us in starbucks. But the people I work with are some of the best people I know. So the up side is everyone under management level is a good person.
good,Great place to work if you work with the right people. Did not like the mandatory working on Black Friday and the day after Christmas. Customers are not always right.
good,"the most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers, good and bad. hardest part was cashiering and standing in one place for hours on end."
good,"I worked morning shifts as a stocker, it as hard but at the same time still loved it. I had to leave due to my children and not having someone to watch them."
good,"This is my first time working in retail, and was hired as a manager. The first several years on the job were great, and i really liked working there. Then the management team changed, and it was nothing like it had been before. There was too many changes, so I decided to continue on with an other career."
good,"Lets be honest, working retail can be a pain. No one like to deal with a soccer mom, that is throwing a fit at 9:30 on a Thursday morning because she didn't understand how the buy 3 for 12 sale on soda works.  But, just because you get an earful from some customers doesn't mean everyone is like that.  Most of the time customers are actually very kind and patient, so working retail isn't that bad.  Also, the people you work with are usually some of the nicest most down to earth people you will meet.  At least that was the case for me.  My coworkers had fun with their work but still took it seriously enough to not get yelled at by management.  Working during the holidays isn't terrible and actually working on black Friday isn't as bad as people make it out to be.  Don't get me wrong its hectic but it is actually a lot of fun.  Would I recommend pursuing a career in retail? Not really, unless you go into management. But its still an enjoyable experience."
good,"My biggest issue was being targeted by a previous team lead for my orientation and not being protected by upper management.  Eventually, this is what led to me leaving target."
good,"A typical work day was pretty easy. Being a cashier, responsibilities were straightforward. Keep the lanes stocked with gum, keep your area clean, put back stock in designated areas, greet your guest with a smile and be informative. Target taught me a lot about work ethics. It taught me to take my job seriously, especially if you're working for a company where there is a possibility for a chance of growth. Management could sometimes get in there feelings. You had a few good ones that actually helped and there were a few that seemed as if they didn't like their job at all. To be completely honest, the job was never hard. If you can follow directions, then you could do this job. The most enjoyable part of the job was when you could wok in a different zone or area. It gave a chance to do something different, a chance to learn something new to expand your skills and it gave a change of scenery on what you did on the regular."
good,Don't call out before the end of the probation period is over and talk to the team members to schedule a time off instead of calling out a team member could switch with you if approved by the supervisor. Easygoing and easy to get some time to get a doctor's appointment or anything else done without leaving the team short handed.
good,Very much a big box environment. Lots of hours and hard work. Great job for someone with no outside commitments. Culture was good but you have to keep to the rules.
good,Tried to work with new management for over a year and could never please him despite my hardest efforts. I have since then been very appreciate for my skills elsewhere
good,"I am trained in several different departments each with their own pros and cons. The departments in which I am trained are: cashier, hard-lines, soft-lines, fulfillment, operator, and flow team. In all department the main responsibilities are being friendly, fast, accurate, and reliable. I currently work flow team which comes into the store around four in the morning depending of the season and how many trucks we are getting. All of the jobs except cashier require the ability to lift at least 50 pounds."
good,Overall great atmosphere and diversity. Would definitely suggest as a place to work for anyone seeking a job. A degree is definitely needed to even be condidered to advance.
good,I worked in the back doing stocking and logistics for the coon rapids target. The management never really got on me for anything and we were able to play music over the raido which made the day more fun.
good,"Working for Target can be good and not so good. If you work hard, but people around you or above you don't, they try to throw you under the bus. Power hungry management, who feel entitled and better than you, but they are taught to be that way. The good is if you stay there long enough the benefits roll in. If you work for Target don't let the bad leaders around you take you with them. The company has changed."
good,"All and all target is a great place to work at but like any other places it has its moments that are more stressful than others. Most days team leads assign so much work in such little time. On the stressful days, we are running around like animals but most days target is calm and stress-free."
good,I love working for target especially with  they're 'no judgement Zone' just ready for new experiences. They're a great company overall but just depends on management.
good,"A typical day at work brings me joy knowing that I went out of my way to help any customers that approached me. I have learned many ways to deal with a more difficult of angry customer, scary situations, or just tricky situatons. The management and workplace culture is great! The most enjoyable part of this job is helping people and seeming them smile."
good,Lots of friendly workers and customers.  Did not like to work holidays.  Helping a lot of people at the service desk with returns and problems.  Loved my team mates.
good,"This was a seasonal job, that was actually fun and challenging. They  treat every team member as part of one big family. The family aspect made Target a comfortable place in which to work."
good,"I loved working at Target. It was fun, fast paced, and the incentives to get sell our Target Red Cards were often good. I loved the pay, the benefits were good too. The only problem was the lack of hours and the not so flexible schedule."
good,El trabajo me gustaba mucho bien dinámico trabajo en diferentes áreas todo como un equipo
good,"Target flow team is not for the lazy, unloading trucks by hand and stocking them at a fast pace and still helping guests in the store keeps you really busy. Management gives you the opportunity to move up and work with you on school and other parts of life."
good,"This is the first job I have had. The staff was great to work with, I was terrified about working with upset customers but my manger gave me some great tips. The hardest part of the job I would say are the upset customers. Even though it was not a daily thing. Every now and then you would get someone really difficult to work with."
good,"Working at Target as a guest service team member is very entertaining to me. I like that it always keeps me busy and I'm never bored. My bosses don't make work impossible, and I get along with all of them. I've learned so much from being there considering it was my first job. I love cleaning up Bullseye's playground and restocking it. Target is a great place to work."
good,"Good place to work in sense of having something to do.  Pretty ""laid-back"" depending on what department you're in. They offer a 401k that Target will match you. You are able to accrue paid time off, but it's not a technical vacation pay. We do get holiday pay for certain holidays and we get Christmas and Easter off, but as of now we have to work Thanksgiving night/Black Friday and Christmas Eve.   "
good,Assisted customer with purchases and credit applications.  Provided  customer service to all customers.  Job was  only seasonal but I think it was an enjoyable expierence.
good,"It's an easy job but not very willing to work with your personal schedule, not much consideration of ones personal situation. I learned a lot such as how to deal with guest and how to say things so that it won't be misinterpreted."
good,"The shifts usually go by quick."
good,"Working at Target has been an amazing experience. You meet a lot of wonderful people and you build life long friendships with them. Working with wonderful people, makes your job a good working environment."
good,Great place to work where management is eager and open to listen. Clean and neat work areas with minimum risks. Co-workers always helpful and friendly.
good,"Ability to work in a fast-paced environment while adapting  to change."
good,"A typical day would be to push carts of new merchandise and stock them on shelves, neatly organize the shelves with merchandise in the correct order, help guests on the floor with any issues, use the walkie talkie to communicate with other co workers to assist in any issue and work as a team to complete a common goal of the day."
good,"Their scheduling is ver flexible and by saying flexible i mean if yoou were given a certain shift to work but it may not work into you secon job or you family balance, you were allowed to change your scheduled shifts with other team memembers."
good,Target is a fun place to work. Very young audience as well as diverse. Time flies while working at target. Nice compensation for its employees. NOICE.
good,"Good place to work. Didn't get benefits because I was only a seasonal but heard good things about them, good people to work with, fairly organized but could use some improving."
good,"cleaning out the stock room of unused or unstocked items, the shelving these items to their appropriate aisle. once the aisle have been destroyed by the guest repeat the same process and also help customers who have questions about your products"
good,it was a good experience it taught me a lot a things like time management and it also taught me how to last throughout a long shift and not get tired and work to the best of my abilities throughout the shift.
good,"I did like the fast pace of the store, always wasn't any bad paychecks, but the store could leave you overwhelmed due to crazy guest and crazy demands from management."
good,Target was a nice company to work for they really treat their shoppers as if they were guests in their home.I enjoyed my interaction with customers along with coworkers.
good,Target was my first job ever. I worked the floors restocking shelves and doing re-shop at the end of the day. It is fairly easy work to do. My only issue was management showing favoritism.
good,"I wanted to stay there, but no one paid attention as I kept asking to change departments and learn new things. I liked the people I worked with and the managers were good about most things."
good,"Target was a unique place to work as everyday brought about a new set of challenges.  You need to be able to utilize partnerships in order to get your job done, can't do it by yourself"
good,"Boring job, on your feet all day, but good pay. No hostility, good work environment. "
good,"I liked working at Target, because my area had a great team. Other departments however I always heard management slacked off or did not care for their workers as much."
good,Even though the store that I was employed at was understaffed I had many great experiences and it allowed me to experience working in all the different departments from grocery to electronics.
good,"Co-workers and supervisors are overall pleasant and  co-operative. They are willing to extend themselves to accommodate, consequently making the job environment much more bearable than an average 5 plus hours stint of standing would normally engender."
good,The management went out of its way to accommodate me with having to go to the doctor or needing to trade shifts with other coworkers. They were probably the most pleasant part about working for Target.
good,Target's a great company to work for. Mainly because of the job culture (Target vibe) and the benefits. Advancement is also widely encouraged and easily attainable. My only problem has always been some of the managers but I believe that's different for every team member. My experience may not be someone else's.
good,It is fine to work there if youre putting yourself through school. The pay is decent enough with flexible hours if you choose the right store. Wouldnt recommend to anyone who values family holiday times since you are more than likely not going to get the time off.
good,"Everything was good, but the pay.  The atmosphere and culture were great, but when you can't get forty hours or better pay it's hard to support a family of five."
good,Most of the staff is kind and work well together. The most difficult part may be the the pressure to get Redcards. Most of the time you were able to switch shifts with people and on a rare occasion you were offered to stay late for overtime.
good,"Great place to work at great atmosphere nice  hard working people."
good,"One of the better places for a work life balance in retail. It is a great place to build your resume. There is a lot of turnover in leadership. Be willing to play the ""game"" to get ahead."
good,"Depending on our level of business, days can go from relaxing to chaotic in a matter of minutes but everyone does their best to hold things together and ensure the store always runs at its' absolute best, no matter what. Communication is something we've been having an issue with but we still try our best to make sure we're all aware of what tasks need to be done and what we need to be focusing on each and every shift. Management is 50/50 since some of our leaders on duty do an incredible job while some tend to leave certain departments to fend for themselves. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the people. This company seems to attract very personable and friendly employees and shoppers alike so that always helps to make any stressful shift more pleasant."
good,Very innovative fun company.  Loved the products we sold.  We had great customers and a nice environment for a pharmacy.  Too bad CVS took over the pharmacy operations.
good,"I have learned many things ,how to remember where merchandise are stocked with out using the scanner to look for it in the store. The hard part is the flowing the boxes by hand one box at a time.The store need better management."
good,"A typical day at work is pretty normal. Consists of folding clothes, putting away clothing items, and attending to guests in need. The management at the store is hit or miss, sometimes they are awesome, but they do rotate store fairly often."
good,"This job can be incredibly stressful, yet rewarding. I've learned a lot about managing people, but they can also be the most enjoyable and difficult part of the job. Corporate is not aware of anything going on in stores, so there's a disconnect in that sense. A typical day of work is hard to describe because every day you deal with something new."
good,"I like working there. There is always something to do. Coworkers were fun and friendly. Never had a problem with anyone, everyone is willing to give a helping hand when needed. I would like to get more hours"
good,"Stocking Housewares after the truck was unloaded.  Stag freight down the isles until truck if finished.  Expedite freight, read UPC , back stock, trash."
good,working here is good unless someone calls out then your work load is doubled but the work is tedious at times depending on your position you are responsible for quite a lot ting i your area.
good,"Coworkers and supervisors were always kind and helpful. Working with customers was usually easy. Getting in touch with supervisors on the floor was easy."
good,"I worked here for 2 years. I was moved around a lot to different work centers and I enjoyed my time in all of the areas. The management in my store at the time was not very good, but overall it was not a bad place to work at all."
good,The Guest Relations department was a very fun place to work with great people.  The job is sometimes very stressful.  Guests call in with concerns about a store experience or product concern and are sometimes very escalated.  The job is mostly number oriented and all about your stats.
good,helped me with my great customer service also learned how to cross sell. fast pace. kept my area clean and spotless and very organized. fast fun and friendly!!
good,"Typically, you would restock, ""zone"" (tidy) your given areas, or you would be placed on the cash register. As far as managing went, there tended to be this feeling of being rushed. They often pushed quality and quantity so much that they forgot there's only so much one person can do. Otherwise, the benefits were wonderful and they, generally, worked really well with schedules and were very friendly. I learned a lot about patience, as most people do when working retail. I also learned a lot of organizational tips that I hadn't known before."
good,"I've experienced alot of learning experiences in different departments of the store. Overall each day working here, i feel happy to be at work. My management has the best communication and work excellent under pressure. Working Independently here isnt as much an option. Because of everyone working as a team. Solving issues as a team is an everyday thing. Targets team members are valued , and thats what i like most about this job."
good,"Target had a very diverse work group. and I loved that. It didn't matter what color hair you had, piercings, nor tattoos so it was very cool to be able to be yourself. It was fun to work overnight when the store was closed. Its great to see how things go and how quickly we can make a store look great."
good,The environment is very unpleasant. They do not have enough of staff to perform the job which makes it somehow stressful at the same time. I would not do it again
good,"Overall team driven Store, something that can probably be said about alot of locations, but nothing quite says it like Target's atmosphere. Use radios to comminicate all the time with team members, expect to be engaging customers as a priority. General/Basic product knowledge required."
good,"Not a fun place to work. Employees are treated and feel as though they are expendable. It was boring and I was left to feel as though, I were expendable."
good,"It was a fairly simple job at first. Once the rhythm is learned it becomes second nature. The people who work there are some of the best people I have ever met and worked with. Unfortunately the management has a severe problem with micromangement and half enforcing rules. Heavy favoritism is clearly seen in all departments. Temps and Seasonal employees have absolutely no job security or guarantee of a solid work week. Once hired on as a full employee they will not fire you unless you have an excessive amount of ""strikes"" against you for being late or no shows. If you are hired on full time it is an amazing job, if not, I would not recommend."
good,"Target really strives to bring the best out of you as an individual, and to utilize those skills every day on the sales floor. You really encounter a sense of belonging, and an almost family feel with fellow employees."
good,"The company believes and acts on taking care of its customers and employees and takes efforts to take the steps to make that possible. Retail is retail, but Target is a good quality company."
good,"Busy days and calm nights , job is for people who can stand for long periods of time . Management is not bad but like any job there are a few who could use some improvement on their management skills"
good,"Working as a night stocker was hard work, but the community at work made it actually kind of fun. I think the hardest was unloading the truck every day due to all the heavy lifting it involved."
good,This can be a loving family or a dumpster fire at any moment in time during a day. Lots of terrifically talented people in all levels who can be negatively impacted by poor decisions or neglect. A wonderful place with the right people in the right places. Office politics and cost-cutting have ripped the heart out of the store. Priorities are in the wrong place.
good,"Fun place to work. A great team experience.Great management and you can get some awesome guest. The people I work with are great, sometimes it feels like one big happy family."
good,"Fast, Fun and Friendly work environment. Room for growth advancement and reasonable medical deductions. I was promoted to a Guest Service Assistant (GSA) which gave me a greater since of responsibility and confidence in my self. Established trustworthy relationships with management."
good,"This was a great starter job!  Learned all about Customer Service, how retail businesses work, learned supervisory roles, and learned about cash handling experience.  This was a great place to learn, and the staff really was fun to work with.  Supervisors wanted you to succeed and helped you do that too!"
good,"good overall job experience, you learn a lot of different areas of the store and most of those areas you will be able to maintain by yourself. They will teach you to use all equipment and computer programs that you might need"
good,"I will say working at Target was very layed back. If you needed any support it was there. Otherwise, you were left to do your job independantly. Hours wre open ended. You could come and go as you please as long as you put in your 8 hours."
good,"I liked my job at Target, the hours were good and the people were nice, customers got a little mean at times but the work was good. Lots of opportunities to learn and advance"
good,They worked well with schedules and it was a good job to gain experience. The managers were nice all though there was a high turn around rate. Good place to relax and take it day by day.
good,"My typical day at work would be to go in , speak to my co workers , and have a good shift. I like to work hard or always be productive to keep my mind going, if I always got a task a hand it keeps me focused ."
good,"The Target philosophy centers around three words every team member follows: fun, fast, and friendly. Fun, we make the workplace positive, fast, we complete our work in a timely manner and finally friendly, it is in this area were we thrive to provide a positive environment for our guests to shop."
good,It was very easy and straight foward.  The job was mostly folding and looking up items for customers.  It did not take much skill. The job was fun and easy
good,With the right staff/people it is like a family. I learned a lot of things. the hardest part was pushing red cards .I wish everyone luck when it comes to that. I enjoyed interacting with the guest and being the last part of their visit because you never know how your interaction with them might have lifted their spirit.
good,"Great work/life balance especially for students, decent pay, fast paced environment, and lenient management. Very engaged with the customers. Great learning experience."
good,"Target to work at. Bi weekly pay checks, the team at my location is very solid. If you are looking for part time work Target is the place to be. They do an annual review for raises."
good,"It is a very busy environment."
good,"Like all retail, there are busy days and slow days.  Busy days can get incredibly busy.  The registers get such long lines, that a cashier going on break will get dirty looks from the guests.  People on the sales floor are trained to work register, so help is available.  When things are really busy, there will be only one or two people on the floor available to help all the guests shopping.  The supervisors are available if a team member has a problem, whether personal or work-related.  Fellow team members are usually friendly, and will listen if you need to vent.  Often, there isn't enough equipment for all the people that need it, and it takes a while for corporate to send someone to repair broken equipment.  They do teach basic heavy lifting safety, as well as how to deal with spills."
good,"same task everyday, but the work piles up. "
good,this job is always on bored and quick pass there s never a time where you sitting around and twittling your fingers the people are great to work with though the communication between teams are little bad but we still get the job done
good,It was a okay place to work. The customers was very hard to deal with. If you are not a people's person it'll be very hard to deal with. Crazy busy around the holidays and on weekends.its a full time job!
good,"Target was OK I can say it was the same as Walmart except"
good,"i learned a lot. people are nice management good .learned to do planograms,inventory. stocking ,time management.working with others to complete a goal."
good,"Good company, benefits for 32hr.+ employees. Sad to see the culture they created falling by the wayside. The wide aisle, great guest service seems to be something of the past."
good,"Decent place to work overall. Management is pretty lazy, depending on who you have for the shift. Overall though, nice place to work, especially if you are a student. If you communicate with them inn time they will defiantly work with your scheduled."
good,"Target is a great company I've worked. It is my first job ever, i was in the truck team, unload and after us the team members will stock items, i was working for almost a year until i was officially unemployed for 3 no call no show. I know i have my reasons but the struggle in life was bad at that moment, but now i am looking for a better job for me and my future."
good,"When hired seasonally I was offered a full time position, which I accepted. When it come time to transfer over to full time after the season, I was told I wasn't ever offered that position. Although management was decent and everyone was friendly, I was disappointed in their unorganization."
good,Target is a great company to work for that values its associates. In most cases they are willing to make sure that the overall experience of it's associates is pleasant.
good,Can sometimes conflict with other life obligations but is overall a good job experience and worth giving a shot. The diversity and relationships you build with coworkers is something very special.
good,A typical day at Target is always busy. What I learned at Target is that you never give up and do your best. The hardest part at Target is the hours at the lane.
good,"I like it and i look forward to get back to target.Team leaders are great! freindlly and hard working,fun...I love working at target"
good,I've worked at Target for about six months so far and I enjoy the environment.  The staff is great and they are accommodating when it come to family issues.
good,"Depending on the help required from employer my duties could change for example, my shift can start as a soft line worker who solely works on keeping the clothing organize to cashier when lines  are getting long to operator, whom works fitting room dealing with re-shop and answering questions from guest who call. Being apart of Target you learn how to work with individuals and emphasize communication skills. Unfortunately the management could use some help however, they are not terrible. But, the hardest part is the ability to be on your feet all day. However, the most enjoyable part of the job is the willingness to stay busy and learn how to network."
good,This was a very good company to start your first job. The hours were good and you gain a lot of customer service experience.
good,my typical day of work at target is. i go and clear the parking lot of carts. then go in the store and pick up baskets and hanger from all the cash registers and cashier sometimes.its a fun great job management is great very supportive will listen to what you have to say.but the only thing is that this job dosent bring in many hours so its more purtain to kids in highschool.
good,"A typical day working as a Target team member includes, punching in, checking the schedule, swapping job days if needed, or taking time off if needed. Next, going to the back room and checking for ""pulls"" which, are items that need to go on the floor. Next, scanning items and putting them in their locations.  If shelves are empty then I will scan the price tag and collect them items from the back of they are available and place them in the corresponding self spot.  Next, if I am called to work on the register then I will stop what I am doing and help guests check out and bag their items.  If a guest needs assistance I will help them find what they need by searching for it on my device, asking other team members over my walkie, or take the guest to the location of the item they are searching for.  "
good,High and low traffic. Management could be a little better. Great teamwork.Equal opportunity for everyone. Guest can be challenging at times. Pretty organized
good,"I liked working in Target, I enjoyed my coworkers, I liked the team leads I worked with, and I didn't mind being register. I had an issue with one LOD though, and I also never learned, in the few months I was there, how to use a MyDevice. Other than that, it was a good experience."
good,When you come to work report to your manager to find out what you'll be doing for the day. You will most likely spend your whole shift in your assigned area doing whatever task and helping guests as well.
good,"Some TL (team leaders) act very childish and always gossip causing problems for other employees, that way the only down side of it but I don't think most are working there at more  when I worked there."
good,I was a back up cashier and floor sales associate. I enjoyed the job overall because the people were easy to get along with. Everyday was a smooth sailing day. Nothing was to complicated and I enjoyed my co-workers.
good,Target was a good job I learned a lot of new things and got a promotion within the first six months of me being there. Then as time went by hours begin to decrease
good,"typical day at work,get there , clock in , figure out where they put you, for me its bowling which means whatever pallets come off the truck have boxes on them then we put them where there suppse to go. then after we do every section of that we open and stock the shelves."
good,"High Stress, but great compensation and opportunities for upward mobility for those who can survive the backstabbing and politics. Job duties are impossible to meet 100% providing the leaders with an ever-present opportunity to find some cause to fire you if they want...like the vague requirement to be ""Fast, Fun and Friendly""....just forgetting your name tag at home can be used as a violation of that requirement or god forbid you fail to smile at your boss when they want you to."
good,"I really enjoyed my time working for target but as usual there are pros and cons working for any job and this is no different. Being a logistics team member requires a lot of physical work such as lots of  lifting, pulling, and stacking. Add that with the shifty seasonal hours the job can get frustrating. But having a great team and good leaders helps everything run smoothly. "
good,Run day to day operations in a food distribution center.  Enjoy the people I work with and the job.  Loved the hours.  Target provides good benefits and cares about their employees.
good,This company was one that worked hard to supply a productive work space for all the worked there. It would promote within and give many the opportunity to move up.
good,i learned how to work with others.... co-workers are kind and helpful. management takes the time out to work on the improvement of the work environment.
good,"I've only worked with target for two months but in this small time frame, I got to get a feel on how the work environment really was on a ""Team Member"". I thought of it as a relaxing place compared to Wal-Mart, having to deal with rude customers all the time and judgmental Managers that got you trouble. It's good place to work and decent management."
good,"Been there 27 years "
good,"A typical day begins with email, store goals, metrics, year to date sales. They day is followed by routine walks through various departments. Compliance walks through food centers including Starbucks. District partnerships with Starbucks and various vendors. "
good,"High caliber of talent, strong managers/Sr. Leaders, work-life balance can be challenging (lots of flexibility to work from home/remotely, but expected to always be on).  "
good,Target is a perfect place for students to work. This type of retail experience helps build your skillset and customer service skills. Target has a pretty good teambuilding culture as well.
good,"Each day at target was an active day for each team member. I learned a lot about working with people, merchandise, and how to remain professional at all times. Management was pretty much well established overall along with all the other team members. The work was never difficult for me in most cases but it can get frustrating at times when you have to multi task to complete your assignment. Last but not least the most satisfying part part about target was satisfying the customers, doing my job correctly, and fishing the day as safe as possible."
good,"Had a really good experience with them, and learned a lot as far as stocking and unloading trucks. Wish it was permanent but it was seasonal .. had some great supervisors their"
good,"target is a great place to work for anyone looking for their first job; the pay is decent, the dress code is flexible, and is overall a fun place to work"
good,"Met my needs financially, great team of people always willing to lend a hand and answer any questions i had. I was comfortable because of the staff. They treated me like family"
good,Nice entry level job if you're into retail. The work environment is  relaxed throughout the year but the holiday and back to school rush can be overwhelming if you're new to retail.
good,"big company many opportunities"
good,A great place to advance and a challenging experience for those out of college. I do emphasize that it is very competitive and efficiency is an absolute must with no room for error. You have to have a passion for retail.
good,I work on POG which is the presentation team. I have been there a year. My hours are getting cut and some of the people that work there are rude and show that they do not care. Some of the work ethics there are not making other people there happy.
good,"I worked there 5 years and I stayed for the people that worked there, and the people that shopped there. I loved working the electronics department and the customer policies that were set helped greatly with customer service reviews"
good,"I enjoyed working at Target. It got a little crazy for ""Black Friday"" and all the Christmas shoppers. I had worked there before and I went back just to help out for the holidays, so that should say something."
good,Good company tio work for. Job is very rigorous. And demanding but I enjoy that. Very challenging company with awesome pay and benefits. I am saddened that I had to leave due to family reasons
good,"A typical day would include bagging guests items and handling the transactions as well keeping area clean and organized. Bright, positive attitude. The hardest part was when we would be super busy and your trying to keep things moving along and check guests out as fast and as efficiently as possible. The most enjoyable part was communicating with guests and sometimes making personal connections, along with the friendliness."
good,"The job was really nice. The pay was great, the environment was comfortable, and my breaks were always on time. However, selling REDcards is to the point of which its making customers AND employees uncomfortable. There's a difference between suggestive selling and trying to force the same people who come in every day to sign up for a credit card."
good,"Target has created a very professional environment in their stores, with clear goals for each and every day and visible paths to promotion through development. Management and team members beneath them are paid well and motivated to be there. The only con is the work-life flexibility-- it's nonexistent, because retail requires long hours, working holidays, etc. So, don't work here if you're not open to flexibility. In personal experience, not having a 9-5 really kind of sucks."
good,"start day by making sure all supplies are in your register. ring up guest transactions, and ask for target cards. bag items and ask if need help out. while slow straighten your register and front aisle. at the end of the day you make sure all paper work and bags are filled and reshop is taken to guest service. most stay in the office not out with the crew. all made it feel like you were at home. hard part is getting the courage to ask a guest to open a credit or debit card through Target. i enjoyed the free holiday meals, the samples given of new food products, the community projects they set up."
good,"The really do live by live Fast, Fun and Friendly. They make sure that it's not just a job but you are having fun.  Everyone is approachable."
good,"We would go in and unpack boxes on floor, made sure to have store stocked and ready for customers. Match barcodes to where the merchandise would go. Made sure store safety."
good,the work was pretty easy and self explanatory. I learned more about cashier and great customer service. the management was ok. the hardest part of the job was the early morning shifts. what I enjoyed most was the customers
good,"I pull heavy boxes, open them and feed them down the line to our packers. I enjoy the people I work with and the fast pace it makes the night go by quickly."
good,nice company to start your career with. they have friendly team members that will help you find anything you need. good culture and the work is the same
good,Target company happy to doing job. best place to prove yourself i am learning from that company how to handle the pressure situations. it is a good company
good,"I enjoyed my time at Target.  They have a positive culture and really understand work-life balance."
good,"Great job, just not enough hours. Need more time to do job and leave for day feeling accomplished. I love to do a good job. I love the family time at the holidays."
good,"Helped customer in different areas throughout the store, Worked at cash register for back up, cleaned the store if closed. Provided excellent customer service"
good,A bit skeptical to create an idea of making this a serious career move. Also because of the down and up scaling in stock lately.
good,Target expects a lot out of it's leadership teams and focuses on constructive feedback and recognition to develop their teams. Compensation is fair although ETL and STL work/life balance is compromised and is largely dependent on the condition of the store you're assigned to. Personal accountability is also a necessary quality to having a successful career with the company.
good,"I come to work and help our Target guests with any questions they may have and provide a great customer experience. I have learned to help run a team, set up sales planners and overall work as a team to make our store a great experience.  I am a self starter and enjoy working in a positive environment."
good,"A typical day at work involves interacting with a multitude of guest personalities.  Assisting people with problem solving has been mostly enjoyable, sometimes not.  Management seems more interested in reaching corporate goals than in the individual workers. My co-workers are mostly fun, energetic, reliable and helpful.  The hardest part of the job is reaching goals of signing guests up for Target RedCards.  It seems like an intrusion to most people.  The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing I have saved people the most money possible through coupons, apps, sale ads, etc.  If they are also using one of Target's cards, that's bonus savings."
good,A typical day at work is very slow pace early in the day towards the evening and night shift it tends to become fast pace and a little hectic if there aren't many cashiers at the registers. I learned how to handle many of tasks in little time. There is lots of time to socialize and ask for help or advice about certain tasks on lunch breaks.
good,Great job. Great people. Be prepared to work. Unloading trucks is no joke but way worth it. I had an amazing time working there and wish I didn't have to quit.
good,"A typical day at work usually consisted of at least one co-worker not showing up to work. Management has a very fake smile at times. Regardless of how dedicated and enthusiastic you are, in the end they don't really care for you."
good,I worked here during the holiday season so it was very busy everyday. But that being said it was a good place to work. Both coworkers and management were very helpful.
good,Target was very enjoyable. It had a quick but satisfying environment.  If you were new and did not understand to do something another team member would get up and come to your aid. There was no bad part about not knowing something. Anyone was willing to help you no matter the cost. There were always tough people to work with but that comes with every job. There were also very few at Target.
good,Work life balance is great. Lots of management changes in the past few years; morale is lower than when business was better. Make sure you know what you are getting into before you apply.
good,"Hard working customer service oriented culture; It's retail must be available and ready for anything; money oriented company, lots of work for little pay"
good,"The typical day at Target consists of gathering all the merchandise that has been brought up to the service desk and placing it back on the floor at the appropriate locations on the sales floor. Aside from that, it also involves helping guests with any and all inquiries they have in a friendly and professional manner. Another major duty is to help maintain the store's clean image on a day to day basis to stay appealing to guests every day."
good,I have gained a great deal of patience working at Target. It is very busy as well so I have become accustomed to working in a fast-paced and hectic workplace.
good,Management is really nice. The store I work at is very fast paced. Guests are very nice for the most part. The best part of the job us interacting with different people. The worst part is working closing shifts almost every schedule.
good,"In general, it's a great place to work with fun co-workers, great guests, good pay. Some managers are a little iffy- but other than that, there's a reason I went back for a second time!"
good,"Great Flow team."
good,"For a retail corporation, Target is one of the better ones.  Working retail is hard, not something most people want to do for life. The shifts you work can change from working early morning one week to working graveyard the next.  Also, the amount of hours you work can be unpredictable, making paying bills stressful."
good,"Decent job to have, would try to make sure you don't get put as a cart attendant. Otherwise most other positions are enjoyable. Once you have been there long enough - leaders might start using you to do their jobs... irritating but depends on store management."
good,"a typical day at work i come in greet everybody smileing. check in with the manger laugh a little, get to my work station and begin to work hard non stop. my day is pretty much work driven but is easy because i enjoy it. the hardest part of my day would be trying to finish up fast before my shift end and i have to stay longer."
good,The people were nice. But there was no opportunity for advancement. You had to work holidays and weekends. But they were really good about giving people time off.
good,"I like the drive behind the job, but it's hard to have people with the same mindset with such a large team.  Good company to work for."
good,"- Stocking shelves, maintain a clean workplace, help customers with transactions, operated gas pump computer "
good,Overall good experience. I learned a lot of things while I was working with my co-workers. Enjoyed it a lot and I would not mind going back to working here. If offered employment here again I would surely go back.
good,This company is good to work for they just have to work on getting better candidates for manement and also give the team member a better idea where their future is going with the company when people tries to move up in management.
good,"The job was a great place to learn great customer service skills."
good,Target is flexible with scheduling and swapping shifts. They are also great at cross training. fun and friendly environment.
good,"Assisted with customer service in the sales floor with any questions or concerns. Managed the Cash Register and check out out customers. Used pallet jacks to move merchandise in the Retail environment to designated areas off of trucks and into the back room.Used PDA's to manage backstock and bulk items."
good,Target can be a rewarding experience if you can connect with your team and be motivated by the work you are doing. The culture surrounding the Executive Lead positions is from what I have seen cut throat and sometime can be taken out onto the associate team.
good,Target delivers exceptional brand standards that keeps customers wanting to come back.  Employees are sometimes overworked and underpaid but if they figure out the system they can get promoted a little.
good,"I have worked with Target for almost a year and I have noticed that the front end staff and most of the sales floor has a pretty consistent crew that works full time. The turnover rate is quite low compared to other stores in my area. While I love my job and the people that I work with, it sometimes feel like management is expecting more than you are capable of doing. While many expectations are reasonable, there are many times where there are just not enough hands to get the job done. Hours are not always great or reliable, but if you are one of the lucky ones that does receive decent hours, you will never be bored due to lack of work. There are many opportunities for advancement if you are a reliable, hard-worker. There are also many opportunities to volunteer through Target, in my area it's the Relay for Life. Most management is friendly, and nearly every team lead, ETL, and even the STL has an open door policy that they follow. It's not the perfect job, but it's a great one."
good,"it was a good place to work with friendly employees and a good paced work environment, but there was not much room to move up because they kept bad managers in there current positions."
good,I worked this job throughout college. They are very flexible with college students and allowed me to go on leave when I would go back to school because there was not a Target near by my school. I learned a lot working in retail and was treated well.
good,"Receive payment by cash, check, credit cards, vouchers, or automatic debits."
good,"If you are a retail manager, then you know understand the challenge of people management. As a Target ETL, you are given the tools to succeed and lead your teams to generate great results! Logistics is easily the most challenging role, with usually the most challenging team, but it is also the most rewarding. There is nothing new as a Target ETL than at any other company. Management is management and it all really depends on who your leaders are and how you personally decide to come into work to make a difference."
good,"Assigned a store for delivery, given the correct trailer number and ready time.  Show up at distribution center hookup to pre sealed trailer, inspect trailer for any safety related issues. Drive to the store trade out the loaded trailer for a empty trailer the return to the distribution center"
good,Target is a very fast paced work environment everyday is a busy work day. In which requires you to be at the ready. learned how to do tasks in a quick and efficient manner. Overall the workplace is fun and friendly.
good,Typical day at work was full of energetic co workers that made the day full of fun. The different people that I met through the day (tourist). Also knowing the new product that were coming out before the guest.
good,"Target is an excellent company to work for unfortunately, I had to deal with some of the most immature mgmt. I have ever encountered"
good,Over night was fast paced and fun. Learned time management and responsibility. Co-workers were fun and energetic. Hardest part of the job was finishing the amount of tasks given per shift.
good,Target is a really fun place to work but the pay is pretty bad especially for having 16 years experience. The chances for advancement and full time are severely limited. Benefits are only eligible for people with 30 or 32 hours averaged per week which they conveniently keep me just under.
good,"it was a very great work experience. Wouldn't mind working in this type of environment again. the amount of hard word that is done on daily trucks, the pay should be more."
good,great place to work but from someone to be a team leader or etl I think must be a team member first to understand what target it's all about.
good,"Directed sales-floor staff in all aspects of great guest service, including filling the floor, fast friendly checkout and maintaining the Target Brand guest have come to expect."
good,"I love the Target I worked for in Vernon. It helped me find my strengths again."
good,"The company as a whole is horrible for advancement and the management is very self-centered and it is a very stressful environment, but the department i worked with had many great team members. "
good,"Working at Target with fun employees makes the work environment more enjoyable. On a day to day basis, I unload the products from the truck and stock on the sales floor. Attention to detail and maintaining strong organizational skills is a must. The most challenging part of my job is lifting heavy boxes. It's important to practice safety  when lifting, so often I get another team member to help me lift the box. The most enjoyable part of my job is moving at a fast pace. It's convenient working early morning shifts as well."
good,"It's a pretty good place to work. Fun crew, good management, and strict policies give much more customer driven focus. My co-workers were often fun to be around and tried their best to work as a team with me so we could complete tasks. The hardest part of the job is when we were short-staffed."
good,"It was fun stocking for each season."
good,"I enjoyed each day I worked there, granted I no longer work there I would love to have the chance to change that. Retail was fun in the fact that you could witness the smile on a guests' face, you could feel the positive energy from them and thats how you knew you had done your job."
good,"I really enjoyed working at the target store . I learn how to scan for perishable products. These are the products that are spoil and out dated. I really enjoyed working in the stock room because there were a feeling of serenity and joy. I would work alone some days because the manager didn't have to tell me what to do. I also learn about recall. Recall, means that the product has a defect. An recall product would be taken off the shelf. The hardest part of the job is working into the freezer. A target  employer must work accurate and fast in this cold environment. It was a pleasure working at target because every one was a team player."
good,"Target is a great place for a full time job, the benefits are alright as well as the discounts. For the most part working at Target isn't to hectic or complicated."
good,"the team and bosses know what they were doing, but about half the team was in a constant state of turnover. Surprisingly, they were pretty flexible on the hours I worked, but the main problem was that the job was not satisfying and it was hard to balance work and personal things"
good,"With a long 12 hour shift ahead of us, only way to prepare was to stretch properly, speak briefly with the supervisors and get straight to work. "
good,"The experience will vary depending on the location you are at.  The location I am at has been a great experience.  The management team is approachable and looks out for your best interest.  Considering this is a major retailer, the benefits and pay are decent.  Outside of that this is a retail job, expect some co workers with poor work ethics, weekends, and bad hours.  Out of all the retailer's i've worked for, Target is the best.  Lots of room for advancement if that's what you want to do, and the opportunity to transfer locations."
good,I did enjoy my job at Target. Most people were nice through my check-out lane. I even had people who would specifically come through my lane when they shopped there. I left because it was a seasonal position and I had the job at NE Medical Associates already.
good,"I enjoyed working for Target.  There is always plenty of work to do and in a fun, fast paced environment.  I spent most of my time in the backroom with unloading trucks, stocking freight and moving items out to the floor."
good,"If you work at this store, you are expected to drive sales to no end, but management wants you do it at the expense of other departments. They also expect you to do the jobs to their exact specifications without providing support. Not all Targets/Executives are like this, but many of them are."
good,The managers were the best managers I've had. They were mice and understanding. The job itself was alright. It got repetitive after a couple months. They did move me around to cashier and night shift sometimes.
good,I worked for Target for 10 years and over that time had many great opportunities across a broad spectrum of roles. Great company to work for.
good,"management is okay, not all of them hate their job. the customers are awful human beings who should probably be sent away."
good,"easy environment to work in, co-workers are great to be around, typical day involved helping customers find certain products and show them to it if necessary."
good,Constant changes in upper levels of leadership and ongoing uncertainty about future layoffs has led to very poor morale.
good,Overall in my time working here I had a lot of fun. It is a lot of work but the people and team members make this place great. Just an overall great experience at Target
good,"At work i would come in and access all my tasks for the day. I would go to my designated area and start my work. I would put out items on the sales floor, make sure I am talking to the guests about the new sales, always being fast,fun, and friendly. I would make sure that my area is neat and presentable to my guests and staff for my whole shift at work."
good,Very hard work. Not a very fun and happy environment . Very fast paced . No time to even think. Just throw boxes as fast as you can for ten hours.
good,"Real star has/had some great managers and staff in head office. The staff at the buildings not so much. stoke to residents that they were trash, and beneath them. Very judgement people."
good,"Great workplace, wonderful people and environment, not reliable for a single house income. Great perks and opportunity to advance.  Great workplace to learn more about working."
good,Great Company as long as you aren't a Contractor.  Co-Workers have a lot to teach.  Difficult during corporate restructuring
good,"Great company, lots of work, great people to work with. However, management in my level and above had little work/life balance"
good,"Working at Target has been very rewarding for me.  I am always"
good,"a typical day 3 to four people worked in clothing department to zone, we split work to finish faster."
good,"I work as a guest service team member. I handle with returns, guest,and sorting products that people didn't want. What I learned most about in customer service is how you have to understand the customers concerns and have quick problem solving to help their needs."
good,"The most enjoyable part of this job is the people ( co-workers/guess) on an average day you may encounter some 20 guess and share a brief conversation on any topic from the weather or what the guess is experiencing in life at that moment being in the counseling field I enjoy offering a kind word of encouragement to my guess and making them small, yet the hardest part of my job is maintaining enough equipment for teams to carry out their duties on a daily bases."
good,The company had great benefits. The only change needed would be to focus more on the work/life balance.  Great company yo work for overall.
good,"Overall a great organization to work for.  A typical day depends on your leadership.  Some Store Leaders are better than others and will create a great work environment. Others Leaders will talk down to team members, micro manage and run people out of the building."
good,"Uma empresa agradável de se trabalhar, com flexibilidade de horários, cumprindo suas obrigações sempre em dia, porém, não incentiva o funcionário a se especializar e não abre oportunidades de promoção."
good,being a cahsier was alright but i applied for a back room position and they put me on cashier even tho they said the just wanted to train me then move me they never did. but it was a good job none the less.
good,"The management need better organized leadership, yet over all the people were friendly, and understanding. Enjoyed the quite but quick pace and that ideas were often heard and placed into action."
good,"I like my job overall. I like the customers, my co-workers and management. I don't find my job too difficult to handle and I can easily make a boring task into a fun one. The only thing I don't love is that my hours are crazy early. When I first started working at Target I was expected to come into work at 6:30 am. That lasted about one month before they started asking me to come in at 6 am and then 4:30 am and then 4 am and finally I am up to 2 am trucks. I enjoy working at Target but being a full-time student and waking up between 1 and 3 am for work is extremely tough on my body. I am also an 18 year old female and I have to lift very heavy boxes every day so I will admit that is taking a toll on my body as well."
good,"Management is decent but a little distant, pay is pathetic, advancement takes years, lots of hours if you take someones shift."
good,"Complete simple organizing skills, as well to help customer find products. Management depends on the person, but overall most are understanding and friendly."
good,"Learned alot from this team. "
good,"I would have continued working for Target, but the location closed and I made the decision not to transfer to offered locations."
good,"I work as a hardlines team member and the work is pretty easy once you know what you are doing. You are on your feet all day, so that is a drawback. Can be repetitive because you do the same thing almost every day that you work. I enjoy the management at my location, they really support you and care about you. I have great coworkers who make the job fun. It is retail, so no matter where you work the pay is not substantial and your schedule is all over the place. If you are a planner who likes to make plans in advance, retail isn't for you."
good,"Target is a wonderful place to begin a career in supply chain, business, or human resource management.  Target will provide all the tools you will need to become a driven manager and positive part to any work enviornment."
good,"I worked in softlines and a typical shift depended on whether it was day or night. During the day I'd work on returning clothes to the sales floor. They are grouped by brand so that was usually helpful. I would help stock items from the back that were specifically for our part of the store. We consider the baby section + clothes to be part of softlines. Usually the stocking only took 15 minutes and it was normally baby supplies. Every team member on the sales floor is given an ipod like device. You can look up what aisle an item might be in with it and check to see if it's in stock in the back room. Only downside to that is that they never set me up with a login username and password so I kept having to ask others to plug in their user info for me. Every sales floor team member also gets a walkie talkie which is helpful. If you cant find an item for a customer who stops you to ask simply say ""Team, where can I find (name of item)?"" And they usually answer if they know. "
good,"Target is very dynamic.  There are many moving parts that align to make one goal.  Their motto, ""One Team, One Goal"" is very apparent when working in any position.  The people there learn the culture and are great to work with.  "
good,Friendly work place with supportive management. The co-workers were very helpful. The hardest part of the job doing inventory over the whole store. The most enjoyable part of the job was appreciation week.
good,It was a great job to gain customer service experience. All coworkers had great personalities which made it a fun work environment. Got to help people with what they were looking for. Put in orders for out of stock merchandize. help keep merchandize stocked.
good,"Fast, fun, and friendly environment! Higher up management isn't great but other than that its a great place to work for."
good,"Fast, fun, and friendly place to work with an outstanding support system. A large company with high expectations and competitive wages."
good,Working at Target was an overall good experience. Team members were very helpful and friendly; the job wasn't TOO demanding and it paid well.
good,"Target was a great place to work and everyone was friendly, willing to work with customers on finding the right products for them and helping one accomplish a task!"
good,"The co-workers in surrounding departments were very helpful and really know the meaning of team work. Daily work was to (as the closer) was to first fill the floor of produce items that were needed. Price cut any items that are overstocked or going to expire soon and toss out any that were not fit for sale. Mean while attending to guests in the store. Lending a hand to other departments such as; bakery, consumables, deli, and meat. Also ordering items and filling the back when we have a truck day (four times a week). The hardest part of the job was the unpredictability of business; for example, I would have my department stocked, cleaned, organized and scarce of guest, I would go to the front lanes (cashiering or any department that was behind) than upon my return to produce, anywhere from 30 minutes to 1.5 hours my department would be in dire condition. The part I really enjoyed was the interactions with the guest and the physicality of the job."
good,"Target is a great place to work and learn new things. Metrics and numbers are very important in your day to day routine, but so is growth and development. Each day comes with a new challenge, so always trying to figure out your next move can be annoying. Every store is not ran the same, although the same rules apply. This is a fast paced environment, If you have a problem with multitasking and and keeping up with a long todo list, then this job is not for you. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my peers and team. I loved our daily huddles which gave everyone a chance to take your mind off work and play a few  games to get everyone involved and excited about their work day."
good,"A busy workplace where time moves quickly and there's always something to do. The bottom line is the order of the day and if you pull for your managers, they will pull for you. What red tape you can find is easy to cut through, and transparency seems to be a watchword in the clerical offices there."
good,"Target is a great place to work if you're looking for a part-time job. The people are friendly and management is professional, overall a nice environment."
good,i learned a lot from the people that i worked with they did not mind helping me learn the new cash register.and how to do coupons and gift cards.
good,The best part of the job is interacting and helping the customers. Management was a great part of my success in the company. Target allows room for growth for those who seek it. Excellent company.
good,"Wonderful people, amazing talent, solid design. Technical challenges are hard to confront in a print-focused medium.  Lots of great ideas and refinements can be implemented, but not without onerous overhead."
good,"A typical work day depends on whether one gets a morning, afternoon or evening shift. Their duties can range any where within that time frame. The TLs (team leads) were great individuals and knew what he or she was suppose to do; however, I felt HR really did not do a whole lot during the day. I enjoyed working with my coworkers that were on the same shift as I."
good,"As a seasonal employee, there is a lot of work to be done however benefits are not part of the package. Being part time leaves a good work/life balance. The job culture was pretty good."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers and being able to build a good rep with them. To me, the hardest part of the job was promoting the REDcards because it was hard to convince target guests to apply for one, especially if they already had a strict set opinion about the target REDcard dues the Target fiasco a couple years back."
good,The most enjoyable part of this job was to be able to take initiative in some areas of the store and maintain them in a way that is easier to shop for guests. The hardest part is getting everything that is necessary of my position in a short amount of time. The co-workers have become some of my closest friends in real life and the management shows that they care by being emotionally supportive of the tasks you need to accomplish.
good,Every day I would check customers out. I would give anwsers to questions they have. When the days are slow I would go on the floor or help out anyone of my coworkers that need help getting something done. Over the years I started training people who were also going to be cashiers.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the team, providing support, and learning from each other. It is often a fun and engaging atmosphere with a supportive management team. It is very much about the numbers but also about personal and team growth to accomplish objectives. Regardless of whether the situations and resources are ideal or challenging in nature, problem solving skills and critical thinking methodologies are useful disciplines when ensuring business needs are met with the most advantageous outcome."
good,"Good company culture, employees treated with respect. Good customer service.Friendly co-workers."
good,"Too many supervisors and directions from different people."
good,"Target was one of the better jobs that I have had in a while. The managers and team leads were always friendly and were a on task team. Employees at Target, were alright to work with at times. The customers, or to Target called Guests, were enjoyable to talk to, even the rude ones. By working there gave me an insight on my improvements as an employee. First, if there is a problem with internal and external things, I would have to speak to a member of management and then go about my work. Secondly, it helped me understand more of a team leader role than just an employee of a company. It also helped me with being more of a people person not just to customers but to my co-workers. Working there we had to promote these discount cards called RED cards, which you would save 5% on your purchase every time you shop there. Now there are two ways that you can obtain these cards, one way is through your credit and the other is the debit, which is tied to your bank account. Some times it would be easy to get ""Guests"" to get one but it wouldn't happen everyday, which lands a problem. Management would talk to us cashiers about why we didn't get at least one card a day but sometimes it would be repeated ""Guests'' that shop there. So either they already have one or they knew about it but didn't want to get one. As employees we would sometimes get compensated for getting one or two, with snacks, drinks, or gift cards from the store. I liked the job overall, but it just was not enough money for me. It would be a good job for teenagers and college students."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working for Target for the first 2 years, then began to lose work/life balance and confidence with new management."
good,"A typical day at work was to come in and get everything ready for the day if I was opening. That consisted of putting cash in every register and making the schedule for the day. Throughout my shift I would help any cashiers that needed it, stock the shelves, answer phone calls, bring carts in, make sure everyone took their lunches and breaks. I learned time management and a lot of patients. I loved the people I worked with, it all has to do with communication. The hardest part of the job was having to be a supervisor of many people that were older than me and worked there a lot longer than me. The most enjoyable part of the job was the store itself, management and my co-workers. I got along with everyone and when guest left happy because of my decisions it always made me feel good."
good,It is a fast pace company that continues to change with the economy. Target is an innovator and values change. One good thing about working at Target is the work schedule. Four ten hour shifts and three days off. No rotating shifts
good,"Fun, great, however I realized t the job that I disliked people very much. So being  a cashier wasn't the best of job for me, along with my skin set not being used fully."
good,"Mostly part-time hours, not much in the way of full-time without being part of management. People and nice, including the managers so its a very friendly place to work."
good,"Target was a fun, fast, and friendly environment. I made a lot of friends here and had a great time working at this position."
good,My typical day working at Target is okay. The best part of my day is helping a guests find what she/he is looking and seeing they're face after I've help them find what they are looking for. My co-workers are great I love working with a team because it really gets the job done faster.
good,"A typical day at Target consisted of a lot of customer service, and standing on your feet all day, not the most challenging job, but however it can be if you do not go to work with a positive attitude. the most enjoyable part of the job would have to be interacting with the customers and knowing that you helped provide positivity to someones day."
good,"using the cashier till, stocking shelves, using the PDA equipment, printing price labels and sales banners organizing displays. it was a great experience for me, in the time i worked at Target I had the opportunity to learn duties for other positions. My team leaders were always friendly and helpful, i liked bonding with my team members as well. helping do team lifts, guest carry outs, answering questions, helping navigate the store and recognizing regular customers were all great experiences for me. i felt like i belonged and was often told i was very helpful by ""guests"" and my fellow team members when they needed help aiding a guest, navigating the PDA system to create pulls or locate items in the store. the hardest part of the job i guess would be getting off of work at 10pm. other than that everything else came pretty naturally and worked well."
good,The job had a fun environment for the most part but things can get pretty hectic when business doesn't go as expected. The management was sloppy but in the end everything went okay.
good,"Target Canada was a great place to work. A typical day at work included restocking shelves, helping customers with item inquiries & zoning the isles. I learned that time management is essential to get all tasks completed & presentation is key to attracting customers to products. My co-workers were very diverse and extremely friendly, everyone made me feel welcome and they never hesitated to clarify on tasks. The hardest part of the job was dealing with isles that were a complete mess and micromanaging small products. The most enjoyable part of the job was the fast paced learning environment."
good,Target allowed me to grow within the company.  I learned so much about the business and to treat our guest with high standards.
good,"Enjoyable job. Physically demanding. Consistent work schedule, fair pay. Friendly co-workers and team leaders. Frequently provided breakfast and coffee for early morning shifts"
good,"This is retail, so the hours are expected to suck. Holidays and weekends spend with your friends and family are non-existent. Management is very great at giving feedback, recognition is superb, pay and benefits are quality. There is some room for growth, if you have your degree. Once I got my degree, I left for better hours."
good,"The job experience at Target is really enriching. Great eco system , collaboration & fun. "
good,"I loved being employed by Target Distribution, the hours were great, only three day work weeks & the pay was great. I was on part of a team that packed product for half the shift and then worked solo putting incorrectly picked product back in the system, auditing my teammates boxes for efficiency, reprinting any damaged labels so that the order could be properly processed etc."
good,Was able to learn the behind the scenes part of how target gets merchandise into stores. Was able to set records for recieving and work with great people.
good,"Learned a lot about working in retail. Management was great, always made sure you knew what expectations were throughout your shift."
good,"Would go in a 4 am unload trucks and put stock away, Learned new department in the backroom and moved up to that position, Management recognized the hard work as they were willing to work with me and move me into another department, Coworkers were like family worked well together as team mates and always willing to help out wherever needed. The hardest part was adjusting to the schedule of getting up at 2:45 am in the morning, The most enjoyable part was helping customers when giving the chance,"
good,"It was a fun environment, great coworkers, decent customers but management was poor. I don't think the job is really hard as long as you can meet the goals such as selling the red card to people. If you couldn't do that. They were hard on you. I personally didn't have any trouble but it was hard to watch so many come and go because of it at the front end."
good,"Although, my day never goes as plan because changes happen within the store and my ability to assist the team is needed, at the end of the day, my job is mostly done.  What I've learned in the past 3 years in my current role is adapting to the whole team.  Everyone is different and has different needs.  The management team can trust me when I need to make a quick executive decision during a busy moment.  I believe that my co-workers feel comfortable approaching me at any time when they have a problem or even if it is just to vent out some anger.  The hardest part is time.  Sometimes, I do run out of time and I would end up passing it to the next person or continue that task the next day.  The most enjoyable part of my job is that I get to interact with the team from early morning, day side team, and sometimes the evening team."
good,The store is clean they have everything you would need and they can help if u can't find something A customer was never unhappy they found everything they needed they are always on top
good,"Great team, you'll spend minimum 50hrs per week trying to ballance multiple priorities set by other LOD's and your specific role responsibilities."
good,"Target is a pretty good beginning job."
good,"Was allowed to work very autonomously. Have great time management skills. "
good,I enjoyed my time with Target and met a lot of great people. The compensation was very good but the work-life balance was challenging. My work hours were very flexible but I was on call 24/7 and would often be called in to address a myriad of situations.position
good,"Clock in find the manager, find out where you will be at in the store that store for the day. You'll be trained in all of the departments in the store in which you may or may not be working in for a short or long period of time. Managers and co-workers were great. learning new things was the hardest of all the Jobs! Enjoyed my co-workers we had fun in mostly all that we did no matter what we kept smiles on our faces."
good,"A typical day in the Pharmacy at Target was accurately entering prescription information and completing Return to Stock (RTS) report daily, Resolving Third Party Rejections, and completing any manual claims.  Going through drugs making sure none of them were out-of-date or expired. Providing the highest level of Customer Service in all situations.  Perform all register transactions.  Performing daily inventory of drugs that were on the shelf."
good,Very busy but great company all around. Worked during holiday season and it was crazy. late hours and long shifts. Like company still
good,"Over all it was a great job. I got along well with the other team members and the guests."
good,I transfered to a few Targets in my career.  I have noticed differences in management.  My current store it is a struggle.  I feel that the Team Members know more that the upper management.  There is a struggle with communication through out the whole Company.
good,"Target was a fast paste environment, love the atmosphere working there, team leads were always on point when it became to help out employees, Definitely recommend"
good,"good place to work, however no benefits offered to associates typical day is receiving merchandise, and stocking floor."
good,I Enthusiastically greeted 100+ customers per day entering and exiting the store resulting in a pleasant shopping experience
good,"this was my first forklift job and going into the job with no experience, was very well trained and learned the job duties of a forklift driver very quickly"
good,"You will usually dot he same mindless tasks everyday as a cashier. Guests are always first. Then you restock and clean your area. If you have a GSA that favors you, you may be able to get off your lane to push One Spot or fix accessories. The only way to move up is kiss butt and HAVE your degree; working on it is not enough...and it must be a bachelors. Associates degrees are not accepted. The hardest part of the job is not taking it personally when you are ""encouraged"" to apply for a promotion, then constantly rejected. Target likes to take advantage of low paid, skillful employees, and if they bring someone else from the outside rather than promoting you, they can pay the new employee less than if they moved you up."
good,Overall Target culture is great and makes you really feel like you have a voice. Also collaboration is pushed and a great team effort is encouraged. However as a strength it can also be a weakness. Cross functional teams can take too long in the scope of a project to make decisions and it can be extremely difficult. Feedback is great and always given to develop your talents. overall Target is an excellent place to work.
good,"A typical day at work would involve helping customers with their purchases, directing them to the appropriate departments, and providing excellent customer service."
good,"In the backroom I would start every morning by pulling product from their backroom locations and putting it on the sales floor. Once that was done I would put away the product we received in on the trucks. When working on grocery product I would constantly check for expiry dates and that it was properly organized."
good,"I think the fact the I worked for this company for 8 years really says a lot about the quality of this particular business.  Although Target is an enormous retail chain, it did a very good job focusing on the needs of the individual employee.  My co-workers were friendly, hard working, upbeat and enjoyed their jobs."
good,"a typical day was making sure the store was clean and ready for business. setting up the cash register for sales and making sure the electronics department was fully stocked with product (i.e. TVs DVDs Blu Rays Video Games etc)"
good,I worked at the store for 5 years and was definitely fun. Learned a lot about communication and interpersonal skills. The work atmosphere is very fun fast and friendly.
good,The most enjoyable part of this job was when my former DM was still working there; she kept a very well and happy environment with all employees
good,"When  I worked at Target it was a fun experience for me. When I first started, I was a cart attendant and from there I went on to become a cashier, guest service, Starbucks  and food Avenue team member and  sales floor team member.  I meant a lot of great people and made a lot of friends working at  target. the only problem I had working there what I was getting paid to low and weren't getting enough hours.  I was usually the one who was going back and forth doing things. Target is a good place to work at to meet new people and to make good friends. I would consider working here again."
good,"Each day while working at Target is unexpected. You practically can't assume each day will be the same as before. There is definite room for growth within the company, however it is not easy to come across. The hardest part of working for Target is obtaining the Target Red Card debit or credit option."
good,"enthusiastic, enjoyable, learnt how to set up layouts,grocery merchandise know how,great team work. hardest part was leaving work when not finished your daily job, most enjoyable was going to work and seeing everyone. Really enjoy working and talking with staff where I work. Good staff and management, mostly always cheery and still friendly even after the job is done."
good,Receiving and stacking of store merchandise and verifying the same with the items listed in the purchase order.Sorting the goods and merchandise and assigning relevant price tags and labels to the same.
good,"Really great place to work and develop your skills to move up in  your career. If you plan on putting your degree to work right after graduating college, they can most definitely help you out with developing you and your skills."
good,"Typical retail job. Computer system is very user friendly and they allow you to take initiative to help with the guests' problems if any arise. Most of the guests are friendly. I don't like how aggressive they are about getting the store credit and debit cards. Sometimes it feels like that's all management cares about and helping the guest gets lost in the quotas. "
good,"Since Target's layoffs there has been a reduction in career paths that makes it difficult for advancement.  However, work/life balance is great."
good,good place to work for if you like little hours and dont have bills to pay and you have to get everything done in a certain amount of time or they let you go.
good,"Target has a good vibe going on, with friendly team members who aren't too afraid from approaching you. The jobs are varied, but will trap you into doing the same thing for more than a week. Most team leaders know what they are doing, but work productivity almost plummets when then inept one clocks in. Overall a nice place to work if you can stand doing the same thing for a long time."
good,"Work/Life balance is a high priority at Target. Overall, management cares about it's employees. However, in the changing landscape of the retail world Target has struggled to make the right decisions. I say this because they closed 11 U.S. stores this year and all of their Canada stores."
good,"Target is going through a lot of change right now.  It's not the easiest to be on the inside, but I truly think that once the CEO implements his complete vision, Target will come out on the other side stronger, more nimble."
good,"working for target was a fun expierence . i like how the enviroment there was friendly and peaceful. What ive learned at target is that no matter how hard anything is, you just gotta work hard to be a better person than you were. my managers were ok but one team lead was great. she gave me confidence and hope and always helped me and never gave up. Our Store Manager was not so great to everyone. She never greeted us, never talked about situations just assumed someone. my co-workers were pretty good. i knew alot of friends there but was hard to be focus when one is trying to be in your way. the hardest part about that job was trying to stock products and get aisles done before the store opens and rushing yourself sometimes makes me lose focus. but the most enjoyable part about that job was knowing i was working for a great company and being a team member at my favorite store, getting discounts and being in a enviroment that is great."
good,"Typical day at work usually starts out in the morning and I start ticketing for clearance or new prices for Price Accuracy for that day. I also help out with pushing out clearance, pushing out merchandise from the back if asked, and whatever my supervisor asks me to do if I am done early with Price Change. I have improved or learned how to better work in a team, to learn how to collaborate with others, and how to multi-task. My co-workers are hard working people, and friendly. I would say the hardest part of the job is when we are short on people. It is sometimes hard to get the price accuracy job done. It does get tricky sometimes. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the guests and co-workers, also being able to volunteer in the community with your co-workers is a fun experience too."
good,"Its a decent place to work although there are constant changes and constant management transfers, which sometimes can make things somewhat difficult."
good,There was always something to do and I met a lot of great people while working at Target. The hardest part of the job was any form of holiday but that's to be expected in a retail store like Target.
good,"Passenger Service Agent. Many different duties being a PSA at an airport. A few of many, gate preparation, planing and deplaning aircrafts. Carry on luggage, bag transportation, boarding pass check, flight attendant check-ins. Fun job to say the least though. Great environment to work and I think its because of the people and the nature of that job that we all endure. Tuff hours, and sometimes mandatory overtimes but nonetheless decent job."
good,"Target is a fun place to work.  Friendly management staff.  Good atmosphere.  The busiest days are normally the hardest; however, the customers made the day pass quickly."
good,It is a based morning schedule so it is great because it is fixed but sometimes it can be frustrating the amount of work given since the ETLs or team leads expect results with no collaboration.
good,"I am a cashier but I also am trained to work in guest services and the café area. I don't mind working with co workers or customers. I learn that working around a lot of people comes with different attitudes as well as different work tactics that you just have to obey. A typical day is just asking the guest how was their shopping experience, and ask them about the store debit or credit card that helps you save 5%. The management is good."
good,"My team member's are amazing and provide excellent customer service. The management there is great, the HR pay attention to your concerns."
good,"I learned a lot at Target and it's a great place to start out, but few people are able to have a lifetime career there.  You can have a large impact if you are driven enough to push."
good,Typical work day starts early in the morning when we unload the truck. Then we stock all the product that we unloaded. We must also recycle all the plastic and cardboard before the day is finished.
good,"Target worked very well around my full time school schedule. While working in the Electronics department at Target I had to always be on top of new releases for video games, tablets, cell phones, and wearable technology. The best part of my management team is Target requires all their assistant store managers and above to have a minimum of a bachelor's degree so they had a first hand experience of the time needed for school."
good,". punch-in 5 min before shift scheduled get to work right away!"
good,This company emphasizes its job completion through achievable goals. Plans are always managed efficiently to team members. Everyone has a clear direction on his/her tasks to complete the overall goal of the project. Cleanliness is a common practice used store-wide and customers notice it right away when coming.
good,Management is not that great at target or maybe its just the building i'm currently working. over its a good place to start a working career just as long as you can handle the obstacles that come your way.
good,"shifts were okay"
good,Target Pharmacy is a fairly aggressive retail setting for outpatient community Pharmacy. I feel they want the Pharmacy to be a valuable part of the Target Team. Not sure what the current Target Pharmacy physical layout in terms of MTM and Clinical services means for the future of Target Pharmacy. My store has no private consultation area for an example. Target does have an excellent computer system for filling prescriptions and inventory control. I have excellent co-workers who are dedciated to their jobs. I most enjoy my customers and help[ing them reach their healthcare goals.
good,"After being at this company for about two years, I found there is a really good support system amoung coworkers. There is an understanding that the store is a team and many different responsabilities will have to be shared in order to make the goal for the store each day. One of the harderst parts of being at this job is there are not enough people trained in each department,so if a team member is trained in multiple departments and that certain department needs assistance a certain day, the work day can become extremely stressful. Other than that, the fast paced, always moving atomsphere is something that I personally really enjoy at this  company."
good,it was an ok job the hours i feel could have been way more but was a decent job didnt mind working hear but the pay is really not great
good,Target is a great place to start out because you do not need prior work experience to work there. They have a very friendly environment and accepts all ages even for people still in high school.
good,"Merchandising, Cashier, CSR"
good,"Lead team toward company goals & constant development"
good,"I fully enjoyed my time working from Target.  In the 3 years I was with the company I held 4 different roles.  They focused a lot on personal development and had a lot of great programs that helped stregthen your development and advancement.  I LOVED the people I worked with, from my immediate team to cross fuctional partners."
good,"The best experience for your leaders is to be a part of Target.  You can never learn more anywhere else, or have more responsibility thrust on your shoulders."
good,"My typical day at Target consist of being flexible, providing customer service,and collaborate with other team members to complete assigned tasks. I have learned good interpersonal, critical thinking and time management skills. Mangers at Target are always available and active throughout the day.I enjoy working with my co-workers. The hardest part of my job is working when we are short staff. It is a challenge, but I welcome challenges. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I can make a customer's day by having a product that they were unable to find or just being a listening ear."
good,"Typical day of work would consisted of arriving an hour before shift to plan staffing and goals, start the shift, engage the Team Members and remove obstacles for them, then stay an hour after shift to write a shift summary. My Co-workers were fun and engaging to work with. Hardest part of the job was advancement. Most enjoyable part of the job was engaging with my team."
good,"Working in such a large company such Target, it was hard to get a grasp on everything that was happening around you in a short amount of time.  My particular job reached out to several teams all at one time in order to gather information and make inform decisions and document processes"
good,"Target has a high bar for excellence and a strong peer to peer culture. Target employees speak a different language, which sometimes sounds funny, but their is a lot of focus on communication and delivery."
good,"Each day every team member must set a standard of conduct, performance, work ethic by creating a fast paced, energetic environment and a traini for the best guest experience"
good,"a typical day starts with punching in then going to your assigned place, whether that be the floor or a register or the guest service counter. helping a flow of customers complete their shopping expirience."
good,"Wile working at Target, I learned more about driving sells, and how much of an impact I have with making sells. The co-workers are friendly and willing to help and support both team members and guest. What I enjoyed most while working at Target is knowing that I was able to help guest find the product that He/ She was looking for in fast maiming time"
good,Great opportunities to grow within. Provided tremendous learning opportunities to adapt and further you retail career. Very fast paced but effective logistics methods in comparison to other retailers.
good,I helped set and open this store and was a cashier and a Starbucks associate.  I did returns and worked dressing rooms. The management team was very unprofessional and not attentive to detail
good,Target was a very nice place to work. Learned a lot from my employment there. Management changes was often so you had to adjust to different people
good,productive and fun work place with great co-workers and managers. learned a lot about retail and how a store operates. typical day started at 6 am and ended at 2 pm. very structured break times. Lots of fun activities for the employees.
good,"A typical day starts at 8.30 in the morning until 16.30 every day except for Saturdays nad Sundays."
good,Amazing place to work! Learned about customer service and how to unload a truck fast. Learned where everything in the store needs to go. Working with a great team of men that care about you and want to see you increase in the job.
good,"Target has been a wonderful place to work. I have learned so much about the retail world as well as the business world. Majority of Team Members are helpful and caring and always willing to lend a hand when needed. Hardest part of the job would have to be the different types of management styles and personalities. Tend to clash with others and can make for a very stressful work environment. Most enjoyable part of the job would be making a guest day. They come in looking for an item and cannot find it, I love to go above and beyond to help them out and see a smile on their face."
good,"Target is much more store cleanliness oriented rather than sales oriented and while I keep a neat work place, I enjoy speaking with guests and would rather be in a place where my sales skills are fully utilized."
good,The management was very helpful and team orientated.  They were always available.  I learned alot behind the scenes scheduling and hiring practices helping out in Human Resources.  The most enjoyable part of the job was making customers leave happy and the hardest part of the job was when you couldn't.  There was no real typical day because as a team member you learned all jobs and went where you were needed the most.
good,"I loved my jobs at Target. There was a lot of opportunity to do many different things and follow your interests. There was a culture of understanding your ability and not getting hung up on your specific experience in order to move into new roles and opportunity. "
good,"A typical day involves helping customers with questions, handling the check out process, and making sure the customers experience is positive."
good,"I would be responsible for leading the movement of product from the incoming truck and the backroom to the salesfloor. I would review daily sales metrics to find the daily focus area in which we would better. My favorite part was deep diving into areas and finding better ways to make them the more profitable. I would redirect the team to improve the area of focus. A few times a week I would be the Leader on Duty, in which I lead the entire store to ensure that all operations were smooth, all guest issues where met and all tasks were completed."
good,"Great company to work for - strong collaborative, feedback-oriented environment, with opportunity for work-life balance."
good,"Great working environment. It is fun and you learn something new everyday. No matter which department you are placed in, Target gave all individual opportunity to develop or better their communication skills, and encouraged everyone to interact with one another and the guest."
good,"Go to work and given 48 hours of work to get done in 6-8 hours.I learned to work with what you have .Management should have listen to ideas and opinions of the team members.Co-workers are all hard working,the most enjoyable part of the job is when you sit with co- workers and discuss the job."
good,"In retail, fire fighting in between meeting deadlines is par for the course.  I am stimulated by environments like this where prioritizing is critical to keeping the business moving forward."
good,"-Typical day at work; check emails review my work load to prioritize tasks"
good,"i will attend work at 8am til 6pm Monday threw Saturday. i had no experienced but with the help of my employees i learned fast. what they teach me was sales.they told me about the company, the pitch we have to do for the company, how much we can make from the company."
good,I always had something to kept me busy and moving. learned new skills and was trained for various jobs and tasks. everyone was rewarded for good work
good,"Target has taught me how to engage a guest with any question from big or small. It would enable myself to answer any questions, the day would usually go by really fast because I would find things to do without anyone telling me to do so. I would always take the initiative to do work, My coworker is one of the very reasons that I enjoy working with because everyone is very happy and pleasant to work with."
good,My position is a great place to work its just when everything is up to par there's nothing to keep you busy if there is nothing else going on around you
good,This is a typical retail job where it can get hectic at times. Great atmosphere although you do leave drained from time to time.
good,"Common complaint among middle management is the lack of growth potential.  I learned a ton there and management is very driven to make sure that they are constantly challenging and developing their staff, but it get's very narrow near the top.  Also, the company overvalues leadership and undervalues job knowledge."
good,"Coworkers were great, manager willing to work with your schedule, very poor starting pay and not much of a chance for increase"
good,"Great place to work for. It was early start day at around 6am but earlier if the season called for it. I learned so much being here: Eye for detail, what customer service really means, great team memberships really counts and how management should treat their employees. I made so many friends working for Target and my bosses were outstanding people. The hardest parts of the job were the short inconsistent hours. Hands down the best part of the job were the amazing people I got to work with everyday between management, customers and other co-workers. There was never a dull moment."
good,All my co-workers were friendly and fun to work with. Everyone was friendly and is a great starter job for anyone in school.
good,"- Target is a great employer with a real honest passion for social and community service. "
good,"I am sorry to see Target pulling out of Canada. This company was a pleasure to work for as they are accepting of an individuals right to express themselves in whatever manner be it colored hair, piercing and tattoos. Target does not discriminate and offered employment to alternate lifestyle persons as well."
good,Target treats managers like gold and there are a variety of benefits and advancement opportunities.  I found this to be one of the better retailers I have ever been a part of.
good,"mostly was driving so i was by myself for the most part other than loading and unloading the truck "
good,"hard work for the pay. fun environment and people, very fast paced. Do like the people I work with but it isn't worth the pay."
good,"Target was a great experience for me.  It taught me a lot about managing a very large group of employees with various cultural differences of whom I really enjoyed working with.  My more seasoned colleagues were very helpful in their partnerships throughout the store and allowed me to be a very independent in my development.  My Store leader of whom I was directly reporting, was very supportive of my ideas and really allowed me to grab the horse by the reigns and drive the team in a manner in which not only I was comfortable, but successful with as well.  The hardest part of my position as an Executive in a high volume location was the work/life balance... I hardly ever got to see my 8 year old son in the way in which I was accustomed. I found it to be a little difficult for a single father raising my son by myself."
good,"Clientele: "
good,"A few of us would work really hard, and those were the people that got it hard. If we called out, harsh punishments were brought down on us; ie. you cannot call out again or you'll be put on corrective action (for one time!) Whilst the people who seemed not to bother with the job would call out multiple times in a week and not receive even a warning. "
good,"Friendly staff and supervisors. Overall pleasant, fun work environment. Great part-time work environment for students."
good,"•	Run day-to-day operations including checkout experience, guest services, and Food Avenue."
good,"Working at Target helped me to become more of a leader. Each employee at Target is eager to help one another become better employees of the company. Generally, our main mission is to give our customers great guest service and allow them to leave happy and satisfied with their purchase"
good,I didn't really feel apart of the team...In a way. The management was very wary of extending a bond toward new team members. We were robots that were programmed and told what to do. It was sort of unprofessional. I wasn't properly trained on everything. There was a guy that's been there for 4 years and didn't know everything. It was an easy job and very straightforward. I just wish the management made more of an effort to do their job more effectively in training areas and building a relationship with it's seasonal members.
good,"My experience at Target was a very memorable one. It was a great experience helping improve operations at Target. I've learned valuable things about teamwork and collaboration through working with some of the greatest managers and co-workers."
good,"Target has been a great experience at the Courtenay Store.  A fun group of people to work with who were all extremely focused on a positive customer experience. "
good,"I enjoyed it, besides the fact it was not permanent. I remodeled store. unloaded trucks, stocked shelves, cleaned, customer service. I didn't get a lot of hours I worked about two days a week. The coworkers and management were very well together."
good,Target gives a pay above minimum wage for a retail job and offers each employee the opportunity to advance if they wish to move up.
good,"Target was my first job, and I have been with the company for years, at two different locations (albeit with a leave of absence for schooling), and it was a company that for a while, I had been very proud to work at, it was only when morale started slipping and as a manager I was only given 20 hours a week that I had to leave the company. As a guest service attendant, the manager/supervisor of the front lanes, my day consisted of prepping registers for the day's sales, or shutting them down, organizing the cashiers and support team members for things like breaks, locations, etc, and the biggest part of the job, making sure that everything was a good experience -for guests - the customers. The team of GSA's was very close knit, although at times it was felt that upper management didn't always communicate effectively with us, regardless of the fact the the front end was the first and last thing a guest would see. I always enjoyed working with my team and directing them towards profitability, and always liked interacting with guests, be it positive, or solving problems in negative situations."
good,Target was my first job.  I have only had two jobs in my lifetime.  I loved working there.  I also was single and had no children at time and I was in college.  Overall I was say it was a great first job experience and I loved the work and helping people. The management was very helpful.
good,This is a great company with many different job titles to choose from and go for. If you have a bachelors degree then you can advance even higher as well as seek a competitive wage to support you and your family. The insurance and employee discount also go a long way in terms of perks.
good,"After signing out my walkie, keys, and other equipment I move to Electronics.  I start the day usually by pushing product from the stock room, setting planograms, and/or cleaning up.  Once that is finished you straighten up the Electronics department and then move into toys.  If you finish early you help other departments close by such as seasonal, infants, and sometimes furniture."
good,Working at Target had its problems like every other place but the people there really made you feel like you were at home. Everyone was so welcoming and cared about you. I enjoyed it
good,"I worked in the packing dept.,where I packed product in boxes for shipment  to stores. The management all had college degrees, most of witch had nothing to do with handling people. the co-workers all worked together well with little supervision. it was a job not a career"
good,A typical day at work is providing efficient customer service. I've learned telephone skills and how to solve problems. The hardest part of my job is understandings the customers return. The most enjoyable part is greeting and engaging in conversations with customers.
good,"-a typical day involved  developing assotments, working on advertising, negotiating with vendors"
good,"Routines were the same day-to-day for the most part. Didn't really learn too much, besides how to manage my time better when it comes to my work duties. Management was fine for the most part. Co-workers were amazing, kind, and unbelieveably helpful. The hardest part of the job was working with guests, they leave carts wherever they please, rain or shine, day or night and you won't believe the places they put them. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with fellow team members and getting to know them better and encountering wonderful, friendlfy guests."
good,"Shopping at Target was a lot more enjoyable than working there, at least for me.  I was a cashier, though I really wanted to work on the sales floor.  I did not enjoy standing in one spot all day long.  My co-workers and management were really nice and friendly, and most of the time the job was fun."
good,"Target is a great company to work for. The management team is the best, they really care for their team and take time to help individuals advance in the company. Hard work won't go unnoticed."
good,"I worked here for two years being constantly harassed by an older Caucasian team leader. She didn't halfway want to let me do anything and constantly treated me like an idiot. I would call her over to my register to assist a customer, whether it be for coupons or a price, I would tell her what was wrong and she would deliberately ignore me to talk to the customer instead, like I said nothing. Then she would tell management that I was 'calling her over and ignoring her when a customer needed something'. I ended up having to leave because it got to the point she lied to management about me and I was threatened with termination without being asked my side of the story. I literally went home crying. I explained what happened, truthfully, to my team leader and she just told me to talk to the store manager, who did nothing the multiple times I went to her."
good,"Tareget was a job that required lots of patience and multi-tasking ,which i can say they help me improve in ."
good,"I love working at Target. It's fast-paced, energetic, sometimes crazy, but always fun. I work with some amazing people who inspire me everyday. Although Christmastime in retail is generally hectic, especially at Target because, well, everyone loves to shop Target, but it is still a great place to work!"
good,"A typical work day would be to clock in, go to my area, look around, clean up the clothing racks, make sure everything is where it's supposed to be, help people out, get store ready for next work day. I learned how to straighten the area up and where specific things were. My co-workers were nice and helpful. There really were no hard parts of the job at target. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was helping people find what they need/want and see them get happy with what they got."
good,es una empresa con un muy buen ambiente de trabajo trabajo en equipo con una gerencia bien establecida pero lo único malo es la falta de prestaciones
good,"Great place to work especially if you hope to move up in a company. Target strives to hire within and will prepare you to do so. Management that I worked with when I was there was great, very friendly and always making sure the team was doing okay. "
good,"Overall fantastic place to work, was not impressed by some management representatives. They are quite understanding to team members needs, but at the same time it is difficult to please management, or do a good enough job in their eyes. It is also virtually impossible to make enough notice to get a promotion."
good,Overall good place to work. My job is very exciting because I get to investigate thief and make apprehensions. Communication tends to be a issue among leaders in the building. There are so many leaders that decisions are made and not communicated.
good,"I am the Mobile Representative so I am mainly in electronics selling the postpaid phones with the companies Verizon, ATT and Sprint. I've learned to approach people and start up conversations. The management is okay. They don't really try to get to know their employees. I did enjoy meeting the people there, everyone is very friendly and helpful."
good,"This makes an excellent job for supplementary income, but don't expect this to be a career. They pay better than most retailers in my experience, or at least as well, but it still isn't enough to live on. That said, the culture that they've created is probably the best I've ever encountered in a company this large."
good,"Great worklife balance"
good,"A normal day on the sales floor means you will put a lot of miles on your shoes. You will answer calls, cashier when needed, assist guests with anything they need in the store, but mostly in the baby area. You will need to be familiar with the Target Apps and the Red Card. There will be a lot of clothing to put away from the fitting room, and hundreds of shirts to fold. You may have one or two people to help you throughout the day. The management was always top notch, and I find myself missing their positive management style. The company culture can get a bit overboard with the positive attitude, uptalk, and slogans. My coworkers were some of the best. The hardest part of the job was the amount of ground covered when there may only be one other person on the sales floor besides you. The most enjoyable was the teamwork."
good,"My particular job focused more so on customer service. The managers that were in charge of my particular department are always nice to work, made the environment a easy place to work in."
good,I love Target and due to the amazing leadership team that I had when I started at age 16. They made me want to continue with a great company. My typical day is very busy but I love it because I get to interact with the team and guest. What I learned in my time with Target is how to get others buy-in when it comes to getting the results to be successful as well how to be a sound bar and at times the leader that everyone needs to be fair. The hardest part is the long hours and how much Target requires you to be flexible.
good,A friendly environment to work in. The management is very flexible with my military obligations. The majority of my coworkers are very hard-working people that make the environment fun to work in.
good,"Typical day at work is busy making sure the shelves and items are filled appropriately for customers. "
good,"A typical day includes filling store orders, helping guest,back-stocking, and keeping store clean. Management is easy to get along with and very helpful. Co-workers are fun, very helpful, and amazing to work with. Hardest part of the job is dealing with rude guests, and sometimes being the only one working back office. Overall very fun place to work as a first time job or if your just really love a retail job."
good,"A typical day was working a 7-7 and a half hour shift with some of the best coworkers I've ever come to know. I would give fast, fun, and friendly service to our customers while making their orders correctly and in a caring way. I would typically do dishes or clean other parts of my work station is I wasn't busy.  Management was always there for what was best for the workers and for the customers."
good,"I worked at Target for six years. I began with a seasonal job working stock in the backroom and left with the highest position I could attain before I complete my bachelors degree online. In my final position, I oversaw the entire store operations as the Leader on Duty, and maintained my own department as well. My store was the highest volume store in Nashville doing forty million dollars per year. I learned so much at Target. I learned how to lead, how to relate to others, how to make personal connections, how to deal with any obstacle imaginable, and how to achieve what I want. The work life balance was difficult as I am a workaholic and would often work eighty or longer hour weeks in November and December. I found so much enjoyment in organizing a large scale plan for a Black Friday and seeing it executed without a hitch. I got more satisfaction knowing that my efforts were protecting the lower level team members on the front lines from a miserable night. I decided to leave the company after I moved to Tucson with my girlfriend. I simply wanted to experience more of life. I had been working at target since I was an eighteen year old pup. Overall, if you're in need of a job, Target is not a bad place to work. They take care of their people as long as their people show any interest in being there."
good,"Your experience at Target will vary on which store you are placed into. For the stores that run well with minor operational issues you will see that about 50% of your time you will be doing hourly team member work such as, cashiering, stocking, zoning, ect. But the other 50% you will be able to strategize, lead your team, plan for new sets and events, ect."
good,"Scanned, unloaded and stocked merchandise throughout the store."
good,please i believe this is a repeat of a previous job please see the previous entry
good,"Target is a friendly environment to work. All the team leaders are helpful and knowledgeable on their job duties. I learned lots of new things  at my position as a sales floor team members, customer service, telephone skills, time management. My co workers are very friendly and understandable. As a team player there was no hard part. we are able to ask questions about any thing to solve our problems."
good,Good place to work as a student. Very flexible hours. Co-workers are amazing. You can spend most of your money while working due to the amazing sales offers.
good,Working there the management was knowledgeable enough to recognize that the employees that were good at there positions where allowed to continue while those who needed help received it. That was really good.
good,The job seem fair but not at all what I expected. The manager was rude and annoying.
good,"People friendly, was promoted early and the people that worked there was very informative"
good,"T typical day at work consist of unloading a truck down stacking the boxes in the lanes they go in to take a 15 to 30 minute break (depending on the size of the truck) unloading the boxes and placing the material on the shelves a round 3:30 is we break for a 30 min lunch, after lunch we go back to placing the materials on the shelves."
good,The job was a pretty decent one. Working 40 hours a week and having every other weekend off was a plus. Working with other Asset Protection associates was fun as well.
good,Very business workplace. Overnight job unloading trucks n unloading stock onto the shelves. I learned how to unload trucks at a fast pace. The most enjoyable part of the job was to see how much stock we put on the shelves before the morning.
good,"Very fast pace from the time I got there to the end of my shift.  Everyday was mostly routine work so its a fairly easy job once use to it.  I now know how a major retailer keeps there shelves replenished.  It was hard at first to tell the difference between co-workers and managers, everybody was working side-by-side."
good,"I was able to move up, my work efforts made the difference.  "
good,"After my husband was in between jobs close to Christmas time, I decided to try seasonal work at one of my favorite companies.  I love to organize and help people.  My job was to organize shelves, racks, and tables to make the shopping experience pleasant. I kept up a good pace, made myself available as needed, did what I was asked, and I was asked to stay a little longer than usual to train new associates.  The hardest part of the job was at the beginning when customers expected me to know where everything was immediately; however, I learned quickly how to make the customer happy by taking the initiative to find their items immediately without affecting my job performance.  As a team member, I learned to ask for help when needed and made myself available whenever possible. I stayed optimistic and took my job seriously.  The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing when new products arrived and organizing them to make it easier for the customer.  I also enjoyed the increasing responsibilities, placing signage where needed and using the pricing gun."
good,"It was a tough decision to leave. Target Mobile was purchased by another company shortly before I decided to leave. They had cut Managers bonuses and taken away many duties. I enjoyed working there when the other company had them because managers could manage the business and after the purchase the duties and responsibilities were taken away. The company was back and forth with growing pains and nothing was working. All of my co workers were great, they made it enjoyable to go to work every day. The hardest part was definitely putting up with computer systems not working."
good,A typical day at work was not very stressfull. I learned to assist other people and coworkers when it was needed. The management was somewhat strict when it came to meeting a time limit. My coworkers were diverse and easy to get along with for the most part. The hardest part of the job was trying to meet time whenever we were short of employees. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting kind and uplifting people and the free food they provided from time to time.
good,"* busy, requires multitasking and time management"
good,"Enjoyable place to work with very nice people.  However, no benefits are offered for part time employees and it is very difficult to get full time hours."
good,"Many opportunities for advancement, in the right district you can really go far in the company. The schedule can take a toll on work/life balance."
good,"A typical day at work at Target included sorting non-conveyable materials, and loading outgoing trailers. I operated the forklift as well as other machinery such as the pallet rider and auto depalletizer. I learned how cube of a trailer affects the company and how important safety and responsibility is in a warehouse. My co-workers made work fun and we worked well as a team to get things accomplished efficiently and on time. The hardest part of the job was managing twelve hours shift with the heat of the warehouse. The most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers and friends."
good,"As a flow team member, one wake up very early and arrive at the store two hours before business hours. Hard-line members unload truck and others organize product to be dispersed throughout the store easier. The majority of the unpacking and filling of product is done before operating hours, though it usually does continue while guests begin to shop. During business hours, along with unloading shipment, one must also engage with customers while also provide great and speedy service."
good,"∙ Separate various products from repack boxes into individually marked shopping carts."
good,"Great management, easy place to work. Might have to deal with rude people on some days"
good,The company is big and you are able to transfer and meet alot of people but there is not much room for advancement
good,Providing great customer service on a day to day basis at Target was easily achieved! Its a great place to work!
good,I don't mind Target. I'm always complimented on how nice I am to the guests. I try my best to make sure all my guests are my number-one priority.
good,"I started off as a cashier and was quickly promoted to cashier team leader, I was responsible for leading a team of 15 cashiers, making sure they had everything they needed, while providing service to customers in need."
good,"I worked on a cash register, or I'd collect the shopping carts, or work out on the sales floor. I didn't have a set area because I was kinda the jack of all trades at the store and I was bounced around everywhere and anywhere they needed me. Witch was fun because I was always busy but annoying because i couldn't get really good at just one location of the store."
good,Good Place to work. Team members are fun and enjoyable to work with.
good,"The HR Manager supported the store manager. I would open the store, close the store and take leader on duty shifts in addition to my HR responsibilities. "
good,the people I work with are amazing although the compensation doesn't equate to the amount of work that is expected in a 6 hour shift.
good,One of the best jobs that I ever had. The management could have been more experienced.
good,"I always closed, so I have NO experience with day shifts for Target. That being said, my night shifts went decent most of the time. I clock in, go to the food section of the store and meet with my co workers to discuss what we needed to get done that night. Usually I would zone (re-stock shelves, make them look nice, clean the area up, and remove out of area products and place damaged goods in a cart to run up to the front of the store after we closed.) and re-stock the freezers (frozen and dairy). If needed I would occasionally (more then i liked too) go to back up cashier. Closing at 11 or Midnight is not so bad, considering Target put into effect a rule where employee's MUST be out of the door after 1 hour of closing. So don't worry about staying there until 4 in the morning, they changed it."
good,"A typical day at Target would heavily include helping and handling customers needs and wants.  This job was almost solely based on how well you dealt with people's personalities. That was also my favorite part of the job, I love interacting with people and I feel very comfortable doing so."
good,The work can be repetitive but the people are a lot of fun to work with.
good,Target is your typical retail store. Overall management is fair and what is expected from each employee is made very clear.
good,Target is a great company to work for. Of all retailers you have to give it up to Target for the great job they do. Everything about their approach to the business is spot on.
good,"My typical at Target  was going in at 9am gathering my equipment, running reports,getting my team task list available before they came in for a fun day of work. Preparing mt tools for my task to start building sales planners.On Thursdays we would have our team lead meeting about the team and current events about Target more like updates and address issues and team performance. I enjoyed what I did for eight years I had no hard part of the day. My most enjoyable part of the day was meeting and helping my team and guests.It was a fun workplace with activities during huddle time created by the leaders and human resources on a daily basis."
good,"I work 8 to 12 hour some days"
good,Typical retail job. Managers expected multiple tasks to be done without being fully staffed or supervised. Pay raises are a joke. Managers only care about the store when there is someone visiting from corporate.
good,Target as a company is driven by results and providing the best experience for our guests.
good,"Regardless of your position, the focus is simple:"
good,"Basically like any other retail job, hung and sorted clothes. I was the operator so I answered all of the calls that came into the store."
good,Lots of different areas to work in and people to work with. Very team motivated.
good,This a a challenging position with a wealth of resources to support leadership development and growth.
good,I walked over 12 miles a day in plain clothes sometimes without even catching a case. I learned the in and outs of retail. Management mostly looks out for themselves. I was lucky to work with some good managemet and my co-workers we cool to get along with. Hardest part of the job is trying to keep your job. Some things as a security guard are contridicted by the rules of target. I just loved catching the criminals and listening to their sorry excuses lol
good,"Good work environment, great business and employees its just not very flexibly."
good,"There's a lot of work to be done, always busy running from here to there filling orders and keeping things organized. Management always helpful but can forget that associates are still people. I've learned humility, how important communication is to teamwork. the hardest part of the job is smiling when your having a bad day, and keeping up with all the demands a backroom associate is responsible for, but what i enjoy the most about my job is seeing happy children smiling and laughing while they make their parents buy them stuff."
good,"Assist managers in creating clear documentation, guidance and follow through, especially when performance management plans are required"
good,"Target is much like a family knit environment. Everyone there is friendly and helpful. They welcome you with open arms and are willing to answer any and all questions you have. "
good,"Unloading work truck and stocking the store product"
good,"It was a job I had while attending high school and it was able to be balanced out well with my school schedule. Professional work place, good management and team. It was a good place to work."
good,Target has been a decent place to work the last few months. While the job is monotonous and unnecessarily stressful the management is great and the other employees are a blast to work with.
good,"i would usually be doing a double shift almost always when i go to work. i learned almost everything i could possibly switch my job description to secretary,food court, customer service and pharmacy"
good,"its good place to work but hours not met my expectation and my budget"
good,"I do enjoy my work due to all the co-workers are friendly and Management try not to have a authoritarian over the team members. But a lead!"
good,Target had got in the way of alot of things.  I left because the hours wasnt much and i didnt like the pay i needed more.  It was time for a change.
good,"Target was fun, fast paced, and worked with customers very often."
good,"Typical Day at work is fast paced, always changing each hour based on the needs of the business. A good thing for me."
good,"Not much to complain about, however not much to rave about."
good,There a good place to work if your young and have no work experience.
good,I enjoyed working with people of different backgrounds and Target also didn't discriminate against those with disabilities which was a major plus for me.
good,"Target was a fine place to work at, I would punch in and head straight to my head cashier to find out where I would be placed at.  Most of the day I would be at the front lanes or customer service.  I learned more cash handling skills & to handle more credit cards, checks, or WIC payments.  Management was fine, some shifts they know how to handle the rush well, some do not.  Co workers were great and friendly.  Hardest part of the job would be handling the rush of customers, every customer in a rush or needed a product we were out of.  Enjoying target with my coworkers was great, I enjoyed each minute with them, they were fun."
good,"During my 7 year career with Target, I worked in various departments, ranging from the presentation team to the sales floor team.  Target is a great place to enter the work force, specifically if you are still in high school or college and you do not need full time employment or benefits.  Some of the management was difficult, in that they did not fully understand what exactly went into tasks they would ask of their team members and had grossly unrealistic expectations of how long certain tasks should take.  Headquarters also did not fully understand how certain fixtures worked or needed to be moved or set, and therefore had no grasp of timeframes needed to complete sets.  "
good,"Management works very hard to keep workers happy, motivated, and productive."
good,Days are always active whether due to guest traffic or priorities and tasks. Can be overwhelming but peers and team members continuously willing to provide support and help.
good,fairly easy job easy to get along with co-workers the job is not hard to do
good,This job required much multitasking to get the job done in a timely manner as well as help customers.
good,"A typical work day starts with reviewing emails and taking a look at the previous days sales and payroll report to determine if we as managers need to make any adjustments for the day to accomplish the workloads of the day.  These tasks include receiving and pushing general merchandise shipments from our distribution centers, receiving and pushing food shipments from our food distribution centers while maintaining food safety parameter. Ensuring that that all new areas are set and that mark downs are completed daily.  Maintaining full and properly signed displays to ensure maximum profitability throughout the sales floor. Interviewing, reviewing and training staff throughout the day ensures that we have the right people in the right place ad allows our workloads to be  completed completed with minimal supervision.  "
good,"A typical day at work consisted of zoning the sales floor, unloading the food truck, and helping customers find what they were looking for.  Here I learned the basics of customer service and how to interact with people in a professional environment.  Since the store was so big and consisted of a large team it was a little difficult to get to know your co-workers.  Having said that, however, the teams that you did get to work with were supportive and were willing to lend you a hand whenever you needed help.  Management was easy to work with, but it rotated everyday, so you were always working with somebody new.  The hardest part of the job was getting everything stocked and zoned in a timely manner while still making time to assist customers and help backup cashier.  The most enjoyable part of the job was always helping the customer find what they were looking for."
good,I spent over 10 years with this company and advanced all the way up the ranks to store manager. There was a big focus on development which is why I loved it. That changed when the new CEO was announced. The company got away from development and focused on just getting positions filled not necessarily with the right people.
good,"Target can be a great company to work for, but it has gone downhill in the last few years. With a greater emphasis on promoting the Target Redcard, they have really lost touch with their customers and do not have a clear understanding of what they want. Many of the employees are very task-oriented which is great, but overall customer service begins to suffer. Management will come in with radically new ideas that deviate with the overall goals of the company and the employees are left confused. The compensation and benefits are a plus and getting time off is relatively easy. There are many things that Target can teach you about various fields (including inventory management, human resources among others) but it should be seen as a launching pad for your career and not be the ideal career choice."
good,"Target is a great company for recent college graduates to start a career. There is a huge emphasis on leadership development, evidenced by the strong feedback culture and opportunity for promotion early on. Within the stores pyramid, workdays are very fast-paced and most of the work occurs on the sales floor or back room, as opposed to within an office. Although management positions involve responsibility for strategizing, executing best practices, and managing the talent of team members, the job is very hands-on. It isn't odd to see store managers pushing product, organizing product on the shelves, or cashiering alongside their team members. "
good,"Pagamento e vales transporte e refeição em dia, apesar de não trabalhar dentro da empresa e não ter muito o que avaliá-la neste sentido, mas onde eu era lotado, Palácio Itamaraty, o serviço era bem executado e o relacionamento com os outros funcionários era muito bom"
good,"Great  team members"
good,At Target all Team Members punch in before their shifts start.  They encourage a productive day at work. Co-workers are friendly and helpful to each other and guests.  I would say the hardest part of the job for me is being on my feet for a the longer shifts. The enjoyable part is working with people.
good,"Target is a great place to work.  Super friendly and sharp people.  The company is not afraid to pay for top talent and pays a premium relative to other retailers just because of the Minneapolis headquarters.  Working hours are very manageable.  After 5pm the buildings start to look like a ghost town.  There are some nuances about the day-to-day culture that don't mesh with everyone.  That is probably why turnover is really high.  As a result, the workforce feels extremely young and energetic.  I recommend trying it out for a couple of years to see if it's a good fit.  If not, you'll end up like many others who flock to warmer pastures."
good,I really liked working here until i started noticing that management picks favorites. If you don't suck up to management then you will not be treated fairly.
good,Good company you can move up and advance in your career ok management but overall a good company
good,"Target was a starter job when I didn't return to college."
good,"If you are a good worker, this place will be no problem. Worker ethic is nice. But if you are going to college, make sure to have a schedule for them for your available hours."
good,I enjoyed my 12 and a half yrs working for Target. The store I worked was great and loved meeting all the people I did. I was treated with respect and working as a team is what helped in getting jobs done.
good,"A typical day at work is answering calls transferring them to correct departments. I also had to assist customers to dressing rooms. I had to repackage unwrapped merchandise or damage, salvage merchandise. I learned how to be fast, fun and friendly (Target's Motto). I also learned how to deal with customers who were upset about their visit to our store. As far as coworkers we all worked together. The hardest part of the job was being at work on a Saturday night and not going home til 1:30 or 2 in the morning. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and working with different people."
good,"A typical day at work would consists of clearing the backroom out, preparing the line to unload the truck for the day. After the truck is unloaded I'd head to my assigned area which was ""soft-lines"" where we unpacked all the boxes containing: clothes, shoes and accessories to be separated and placed where they belonged. I learned there's more to the job than what I originally expected...management was okay but, could use some improvements. The hardest  part of the job was trying to get everything done before the store opens, sometimes we would get boxes that someone left behind at the very last minute. What I enjoyed the most about work was being able interact the guests, it feels good to know that you were able to help out a customer.."
good,A typical day at target consist of making sure the soft-lines sales floor was ready to be shopped. We would make sure that the tables were nicely folded and the floor was free from merchandise for our guest. The best part of the job was helping out guest and knowing that I made a difference and gave them a good shopping experience.
good,I enjoyed working at target because I got to interact with customers face to face. I was always moving and I liked the ppl I worked with. The management was ok they seem fresh out off college so it felt like they where very new to what they where doing. Also I wasn't paid what I was worth.
good,"Great job t work at good people, good learning experience ."
good,"I enjoyed the goal driven environment, the pace, constantly having something to occupy my time, and working with customers."
good,"The typical day for a Target manager is one that is ever changing and there are never enough hours or team members to complete the workload. "
good,you come in everyone was friendly. most days were spent straightening up the backroom
good,"My typical day of work consisted of organizing re-shop, putting the re-shop away, making sure each assigned section was clean, neat and organized.  I also worked on the cash register when I was needed to clear out the lines. I learned how to be a team player, working with other employees that were in other departments as well as mine.  I learned how to work with the guest professionally. I learned the proper procedure of how to handle cash, credit/ debit cards and gift cards.  I was able to collaborate with a diverse group of managers.  I learned the importance of time management by completing my assigned work task. I was able to complete my assigned work tasks well within the allotted time allowing me the opportunity to asset others in other sections of the store.  The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with guests when they needed help or had a question on an item."
good,Target was a good place to work at. I enjoyed the time i was there. Management was always available.
good,"My typical day of work consisted of working with contracts, invoices, manual checks and customer service.  I've worked on Prolog, SAP and Pacman.  The hardest but most enjoyable part of my job was making sure all invoices were paid on time and having the customers say thanks the next time they saw you."
good,"Making sure to properly check out all the customers items and materials quickly and accurately especially during peak holiday hours, while at the same time being a team leader and motivating everyone to reach their daily goals while positively greeting everyone in stress free environment. Closing cash register, stocking lanes, and doing carry outs as well."
good,Target had flexible hours with the opportunity to pick up more if desired. Co-workers were friendly and professional. Management was often unsupportive.
good,easy customers are nice clean environment sometimes we get free food and there's days for certain foods
good,Fullfill orders to provide excellent customer service. Lifting and productive job.
good,"-interactive memorial moments with customers"
good,"A typical work day would include unloading the truck (on truck days) and after the truck is unloaded, we would replenish the sales floor with merchandise that was on the truck. After the truck process is completed, each team member has their own work area. On non-truck days, I would clock in and start on pricing immediately. "
good,"I enjoyed my time working at target. not everyone fits into this review, but the team i worked with does. they made the job fun and the day go by fast."
good,"- Process Payroll every Monday"
good,"Working there for so long definitely gave me more patience, but not much room to move up with so many people going for the same position."
good,Overall great company to work for... compared to others they are organized which makes a huge difference.
good,Working at Target is easy going and sometime fast pace job. I get along with my co-workers very well.  We all have great attitudes and strive to get our tasks done in a efficient matter.
good,work is important here. have to be in a good mind set all was on time . they have a  great work setting
good,"Over the almost  past 3 years I have cross-trained in many areas of Target. "
good,Co-workers are nice and flexible with schedules.  Target closes for lunch. Great learning experience.
good,"A typical day at Target will be to interact with guests making sure that they have gotten everything they needed and by doing this you will ask ""Can I help you find something?"" "
good,Its not my carrier goal. The people are fun and the work is fun.
good,Its a great place to work! I enjoy working in the community! They really care! Target is a great place depending on management! When I was first hired… the team was great then new management came and the team went down. The customer are great bc I am great with customer. Target will feed you! well organized! Human resource team is the best at schillingers in mobile al!
good,"A typical day consist of finding a scanner, and walkie-talkie, checking in with leads, letting them know that I am here. Checking the back to see any items needed to be put on the shelves, helping customers find items, checking customers out on the registers. I've learned how to not be afraid of approaching customers, money handling, cross-training. Management can be a hassle a time, especially when you're busy, you have to multi-task, and make it work. Co-workers are always willing to help you out. Hardest part of the job would be, making sure you finish zoning your designated area. The most enjoyable part of my job would be the job itself. Some days you don't know what there is in store for you, from catching someone steal, to some interesting things you find around the store at night."
good,"I can come to a general conclusion that I enjoyed working for this company for the past 9 years. For the most part, job duties were quite challenging and diverse. A typical day for me now involves a combination of successful collaboration and communication within my team in order for a smooth process to be carried out. Working with a large number of people on a daily basis requires superb communication in order to reach a common goal, considering the variety of job titles and duties."
good,"I work for instock. I keep track of inventory. I also know how to backstock, use the cash register and load the trailer."
good,"Courtesy, helpful to all customers is a must, learned how to do a xmas display, my first, stocked shelves, searched for items, by scanner, notify customer of stock, or other availability of item @ other target stores, working hard standing is bareable, as your so busy w/customers, time goes by quickly, coworkers were great, good teamwork, shortterm trained, but learned handson experience by working w/customers."
good,"Friendly co-workers, management easy to talk to, flexible schedule.  Best part of my day is talking to and helping our guests of the pharmacy."
good,"Target was a good company to work for. I enjoyed all the volunteer work that was available for the team. Relay for life, St Judes, National night out with the boys and girls club, Food share, donation trucks, and the list goes on and on. I had built a wonderful team with very little turn over. It was a place you could call a home away from home. To this day I still have a great re pour with a lot of the team members still there and have moved on. Target gives you the ability to learn very quickly and lead with good merit."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of a team huddle or meeting in which sales were discussed and where we stood in comparison to our daily goal. During my time at Target I learned how to help guests and direct them to where they needed to go while being considerate and courteous at the same time. On the job I learned basic skills such as cashiering, using a radio properly and the safety guidelines needed to properly navigate and retrieve merchandise from the back room. The most difficult portion of the job was simply being a new employee in a big store in which receiving a radio was rare and as a result you were inclined to memorize the layout of the store as quickly as possible to direct guests properly and timely. My co-workers were for the most part double sided. They maintained a sense of professionalism only when in front of newer employees and guests in order to set the example however their attitudes completely changes once alone."
good,I liked working for Target but they make it difficult to advance if you work there. They prefer to hire outside of the company.
good,"I got to be moved around a lot which helped me learn about different departments and how they run. I worked very closely with my HR which was also my supervisor and she was great. We always worked as a team at Target which made things easier with such a big store. I enjoyed my time at Target. They only hard time working there was during the holiday season but with or staff and team work, everything went smoothly"
good,I had exceptional teachers during my time with Target and learned a great deal about management and retail practices.  I have a great passion for retail due to my time with Target.  The issue I had was that there is little merit reward with raises or even promotions.  Although I loved my job I felt that after all my time with the company it was not in my best interest to stay longer with them.
good,"Great work environment, I was able to cross train in various parts of the store.  The only down side is this is not a full time job due to the fact that their main income is the students of UC Davis. Other than that it is a great place to work in. Clean store and polite supervisors."
good,"I worked for this company for about three years. During those three years I learned some valuable lessons and skills that come with the position. What I liked about working for Target is the flexible scheduling, the informative coworkers, and the employee discount. The managers and coworkers were very friendly making it very easy to build friendship outside of work. This job also comes with some stressful situations such as customer overload during the peak hours of the day ( typically from 4pm-8pm), standing on your feel for up to nine hours, repetitive twisting and turning (bagging groceries),  as well as dealing with upset customers. The most enjoyable parts of the job is making someones day, putting a smile on the faces of children and adults alike and clocking out at the end of every shift."
good,Target is a great place to start a job.  I enjoyed working with my team members and the customers.
good,"Target is a great company to work for however the hours and work was very demanding. Scheduling was not that flexiable. I understand due the nature of the business, I learned sufficient amount of managment styles. This position challenged me and made me look ahead, prioritize the day and be prepared for anything. I greatly appreciated this company and would work for them again."
good,It's ok to get right out of high school but they only pay minimum wages for sales floor and cashier.
good,"This is a good company to work for, with my skills I expected more in advancement and that opportunity is no longer available."
good,"Normally, a workday at Target begins at 6 am. My responsibilities have personally taught me how much of an impact we all provide based on our individual performance. To do what is necessary in not only a fast pace, but as well as with precision has enhanced my work ethic in many different areas. The co-workers within the corporation all have a similar characteristic, regardless of their difference in backgrounds. For the most part, everyone is kind and extremely diligent and great guest service is always a priority. The position in which I work is time based, so there is a degree of pressure that accompanies our tasks. That pressure, in itself, coincidently provides a sense of accomplishment each time our goals are met."
good,"when working the cashier it was a very busy day, my day would go by fast and efficient. hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers."
good,I enjoye dworking at Target but they can not give enough hours
good,"Great job, they will train u in multiple departments, and move u around a lot so u get great experience. and definitely have a chance for advancement"
good,"Working at Target was a great way to make a bit of money while attending full time college classes.  It is a very casual workplace, and management works with your personal schedule."
good,"The job culture is great the management is great. Its much better then many of the targets in Michigan, theirs no drama are customer service is wonderful. Our store is always nice and clean we give a 100% everyday to drive sales, we keep the vibe going with are fast, fun and friendly attitudes."
good,"•	Defining business problems, with analysis and vision, articulating success factors and risks and issues related with the project, managing client expectations and communicating the status of the project with clients"
good,A typical work day consist of making sure merchandise is accurately pulled from and stocked in the backroom. I learned how to operate multiple equipment used to help get the job done. My co-workers are all team players when it comes to handling work task.
good,Great learning experience out of college. Managed diverse teams and grew professionally. Work life balance was not so good but it is retail.
good,"My typical day of work was usually very busy, which is a good thing. I like to stay busy when I'm working, and I enjoy a busy environment. If I wasn't helping a customer (or guest), I was putting away stock, or working on the large list of ""to do's"" that we had put aside in a folder. Very rarely did I work on that list, simply because I was so busy."
good,"- Scheduling Interviews along with preparing job offers and making an offer as well."
good,"I'm on the pricing team where we go through every isle in the store and make sure all price labels are correct (date, price & numbers). I also am trained on the register and sales floor team."
good,"the managerial staff was very friendly towards the team members and also to the guests. We gain relevant training related to the job and jobs in the realm of advancement. The hardest part of the job was  getting respectable amount hours for a week.Another hard area was the lack of ability to move from retail to a more corporate area of the business. The best part of the job was the constant contact with the customers, the ability to to converse and brain storm to sloe problems for them, and while working guest service the ability to make a flexible break schedule."
good,The hours are very flexible. They work with your schedule for those going to school. Provide job security for those that attend school out of the area. Team members are usually very positive and helpful. The managers themselves were top notch but they switched work ares day to day so it could get a little confusing when you needed help. The communication within the store could have been improved.
good,"I have worked with this company for a few years and moving up has been very difficult for myself and many others. However, I hear from employees all over that this is really just my store in particular. Outside of my issues with trying to move up, this really isn't a terrible company to work for. I have rarely had issues with them adjusting to my previous school schedules and there are many opportunities to learn if willing."
good,"Target was awesome, if you did a good job you were rewarded for it in cross trainings, pay increase, and promotions. When Target sees good customer service being demonstrated, they acknowledge the workers treating their guests well."
good,"Working at Target is fun and energetic"
good,"It's fun, but tiring. I learned to stay positive no matter what type of customers I have in my checkout line."
good,"Target was a great community full of employees to rely on, and opportunities to succeed. There was hardly a day where coming to work was not fun. it always seemed to me as a ""fun hard working day"""
good,"I've had my good and bad day's. i like Target to an extent. I was not happy there at the time. Because i had problems with my eyes back years ago. Insurance was getting bad for me. I had kept trying really hard and pushed myself as far as i could go. the Staff were good to me and some rimes they didn't want to work with , me. So i turn and went somewhere else. i had problems or unless thing were setup that i would get yelled at times. But i had showed what i was made of and also had games i had pulled to make them smile. I had shown what i can do. and i would always go to the guest service team leader. and tell my problems."
good,A great company to work for.  With values based in their people  and development of those people.  Target offers opportunities to develop and grow with many resources to accomplish goals.  Well defined expectations of said goals and expectations
good,"A typical day as a Team Leader consists of me planning out my team workload based on our hours of payroll within that workcenter. Also partnering with my Store mananger on opportunities that need to be prioritize within the building based on high importance.

good,"Stocked and back stocked"
good,Target is a friendly safe work enviroment. All team members work together to reach production through out the day. i enjoy working with others. management does a great job by letting all team members know where they stand at with their production to be at %100 by the end of the day. target has train me to learn how to drive a stand-up forklift. working by the best practice target police helps me meet my production goal by the end of the shift. i love the way my manager trust me to supervise other team members to get the job done. thats why i encourage other team members to work at a %110 to be at %100. i enjoy helping my distribution to be one of the top performance distributions in the the world. i always feel great after i get the job done.
good,I checked customers out. I learned how to use Targets POS. The management was fair. My co-workers were helpful. The hardest part of my job was standing in one place all day. The most enjoyable was helping customers.
good,Local bom para se trabalhar. Ambiente agradável e desafiador. A cada dia acontecem situações diferentes para ser solucionadas.
good,"I worked here as a teen and it was a great first job. There are a lot of opportunities for advancement if you wish to stay in the company and are a hard worker.  They are fair to their younger employees and try to stick with your schedule when possible.  I highly recommend working in the photo lab area, as it was my favorite."
good,"I clock in at 3:55am, and work until I clock out at 8:00am. In between that I am learning a variety of new skills like how to use a pallet jack, and how do stock products in order by reading the codes on the boxes. Management and co-workers are always there to help if I have a question. The hardest part of the day is just trying to stay focused because I am working at night. The most enjoyable part of the job is continuing to learn new ticks and skills to help me further my career in Target or maybe another job in the future."
good,"A typical at Target starts in the backroom pulling orders & pushing product to the home location, and return the unpushed, item to be back stocked."

good,A good place to work. They train you on how to lead teams and develop team members that want to advance.
good,"A Group Leader's typical day was 3-4 days of 12 hour shifts. The great thing about Target is that they hire GREAT people. Your co-workers are similar, like-minded individuals like you and everyone genuinely gets along. I learned a ton about managing and supervising. The hardest part of the job was the shifts and balancing work- leisure. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with. Absolutely top-knotch!"
good,i learened alot working at target it was my first retail job that i have ever had and i loved it
good,"Advancement is encouraged, as long as you abide by all the rules. Despite encouragement, they will easily let you go because of an infraction"
good,"Provide support in the area of operational compliance and safety awareness. "
good,Lots of guest interactions while trying to complete tasks in a timely manner while different managers are steering you in different directions.
good,Its an okay job. being a cashier that means you must get red cards. also their raises are nothing but they do give good hours and have a decent atmosphere.
good,"Fast, Fun and Friendly place to work, but I feel Target is moving in a direction that does not properly compensate it's employees for the amount of work they are required to complete. At the store I am at there is a large turnover at the leadership level."
good,"Target Corporation is a company with a Fast, Fun, and Friendly atmosphere. There are a lot of expectations for the team members and leaders in the building. These expectations are for the development of the team members and leaders. The development for the employees is very important to the company"

good,Responsibilities included night stocking of merchandise on sales floor. Lots of product to move out to sales floor. Fun co-worker and management. Getting stock out to shelves when customers were in Store.
good,"Managed a starbuck inside target store.  Typical morning would be making coffee, putting out pastries and make sure I had plenty of inventory for each day.  Make drinks for customers and give legendary service.  I learned how to make the different starbucks drinks.  I worked with higher management in implementing store planograms  and presentations.  The hardest thing was when employees would not show up to work.  Pleasing customers and hearing their stories was the most enjoyable part of the job"
good,"My day starts at 4am and usually ends around 12:30.  This gives me time to spend with my 2 year old son.  This job has always accommodated my schedule and that of my family to give me a good work-life balance."
good,"great people , good supervisors, management needs alot of work especially upper management,,, they are not professional towards their employees other than that i enjoy working with my team"
good,Target Corporation had everything a person needed in a job. Great pay and good Benefits there was room to move up and a lot of Equipment to get trained on.
good,I had a great time working there. The job was simple and the hours were pretty good until they opened up a new Target down the road that took all of our business.
good,"Typical work day involved coming in for the morning meeting which focused on providing positive feedback to all the employees so everyone was focused and in a great mood. After the meeting I would go to my assigned department typically either the electronics or garden center departments. As an electronics team member I assisted guest in finding any item they were looking for  be it movies, music, books or general merchandise. Also as an electronics team member I had the key to any of the locked merchandise and it was my responsibility to make sure it was checked back in at the end of my shift. As a garden center team member I had to water the plants and enure that they thrived and were salable. Both positions also had the secondary duty of operating a register and zoning shelves and aisles. "
good,"The job is mostly enjoyable, the pay isn't that great but the people are a good part of the job. The biggest problem is a double standard of employing and promoting family over others."
good,"Decent company to work for, However, management could use some review and the pay could be better."
good,"A typical day at Target consists of assisting guests in finding desired products, reorganizing the store so guests are satisfied, and stocking product onto the floor. I have learned how to operate PDAs, zone properly and work well with other team members so that the day is successful. Fellow team members are quite friendly and make working easier."
good,Great people and a great place. There are some deadlines give you a fun challenge.
good,A typical day was cleaning and providing guest service.Following leadership from my managers on what they wanted done and taking on additional tasks to help the work center thrive.
good,The compensation made up for the hard labor. The pay and the benefits out weighted all the daily bumps and bruises.
good,"I started off as a normal team member, then was promoted to a specialist. As a specialist I was in charge of enforcing policy and supervising other employees, on average eight during a shift. I learned quickly that supervising wasn't easy if you didn't learn how to talk and treat people. One of the hardest parts of the job is managing time, priories, and people. It didn't take me long before I had all that in the bag. My cohorts make working there fun. We laugh and get things done while being on time for the most part."
good,target was a good job. i learned how to work with others. i enjoyed being around my coworkers. my manager made sure we got thing done. i will say the hardest thing about the job was how late i had to go in to work but i enjoyed seeing new faces
good,"Target has a very positive work environment and a ""can do"" attitude. You can tell that the company cares about its employees and the community."
good,Not real complaints about Target. You will your good days and bads just like with any other retail company. Good starter job for high school students or part time work.
good,"Stocking for Target was a new experience for me. With plenty of people to work with, it is hard as it is to be able to fill up an entire Target. With goals being put out and having so long to do them, it is a fun challenging experience. The management was helpful, though some days they can get on the nerves of co-workers. All in all, Target  was a good starting area for myself."
good,You see a variety of customers and most are pleasant.  There is a lot of cleaning and rearranging to be done.  I learned a lot about controlling my thoughts and actions.
good,I learned the wokflow process and what it takes to keep a store running as a overnight stock employee
good,"This wasn't a hard job but there is a lot of work involved. If you are a seasonal worker than you need to be dedicated to it because it's busy and messy. It was the first job for me after being a stay at home mother for almost 4 years so it was a little weird but I did like getting out and interacting with the customers. "
good,Management has huge expectations on how the store needs to work together to meet deadlines. Expect a lot from you. Constantly on your back about stuff. Overall pretty okay not too bad.
good,"Target is a great place to be for those whose careers are dedicated to retail. There is so much to learn from just the in-store responsibilities. I was given the opportunity to work in every department, which actually creates a more fun work environment because you are looking forward forward to learning something new, and more knowledgeble about products storewide, as well as a great value to customers that need help with their shopping experience."
good,We work together as a team to get the job done. Great work ethic
good,"Each and everyday focuses around guest service; we are responsible for making our guests feel at home while completing everyday tasks/duties.  There will always be work that needs done and a situation that you must deal with in addition to that workload, multitasking and leveraging resources is a must.  Strategizing and planning is key to an effective work center, along with great training that can be difficult to deliver affectively given various factors.  The most rewarding thing to see is the guest interaction with team members and feeling satisfied with their expeirence.  Its all about the guests!"
good,Great place to work and gain experience with patient contact!
good,"I enjoyed working at Target, being around customers who were as nice as I was to them. The management were very polite to me and the other cashiers."
good,"My job at Target began at 10pm and we were expected to unload the truck stock and zone the complete store in 4 hours."
good,"Working at Target is fun. The team members are awesome and are always available to help you whenever you need them. We have so much fun at while working, sometimes it feels like I am working with my closest friends. Management is alright, depending on how the store is. The store I work at is very strict but it is very understandable, they want us to do a great job. Red Cards, that is a must if you want to work at Target, you might get a little annoyed by them but it is part of the job. Overall, great place to work at, with a great team."
good,"As a District Team Leader (District Manager) at Target I had full P&L responsibility for 11 stores with annual sales of $474 million and over 2,000 Executives and Team Members.  "
good,Very courteous and hardworkers.Great benefits and managable hours
good,"A typical day at work includes being responsible for the day-to-day management of store merchandise, including stocking, receiving, storage, and organization of extra merchandise and customer service. Management communicates well with their teams members while doing everything in their power to create a fast, fun, and friendly working environment. My co-workers are friendly, energetic, and extremely hardworking. The hardest part of the job is working under sometimes unrealistic time restraints. The most enjoyable part of my job is assisting customers with their needs. "
good,Working here was an experience. I loved the set up of the job. It was independent but also a team effort. Management could have been more effective on how they handled work related conflicts.
good,"The job is fun, i learnt a lot "
good,Typical night at work receiving the truck at 3am after out hour and fifteen minute break. I learned how to work with your team be more of a team player because of our time limit. My co workers where great.

good,Worked with great people in a fast fun and friendly environment 
good,"a typical day at work is always fast paced but very fun and entertaining to do"
good,"I have learned a lot from my time with Target and gained many skills. I am not so happy with where the company is headed and I do not agree with the lack of incompany promotions. I see good, hard working people get looked over everday while the positions that they should be promoted to are taken by much less experienced lower paid people."
good,Great place to work with a friendly team atmosphere. The hardest part of the job is working most holidays and working long/late hours.
good,"Fashionable retail, always trying to move forward.  Fun fast paced environment. "
good,"A typical day at Target was filled with activity, whether with customers or tasks, as well as opportunities to organize people, places, and events."
good,"*always busy"
good,"I work in the softlines area of the store which consists of clothes, shoes, and accessories.  Workday starts at 4 a.m.  Pallets of boxes are offloaded from truck and pulled to sales floor on pallets. The softlines team opens boxes and distributes contents to their designated locations.  Management demands that we finish our work within a specific time period.  My coworkers are hard working and fun to work with. We work well as a team."
good,"Target is filled with talented, highly motivated people that are fun to work with.  I really enjoyed my time there, I had a number of opportunities to promote and to work in different pyramids and business functions.

good,"Nice place to work, the management tries very hard to work with you to find advancement opportunities. Fairly demanding for the wage on availability, especially to parents who cannot afford daycare."
good,"Each day, just assist guest in any way. I learned product info to better assist guest.  Management was very helpful.  Co-Workers did thier part, which may the job smooth. Holidays were the hardest time to work: full of people and the store was a mess. The most enjoyable part was assisting guest."
good,"Hard work and lack of recognition for the hard work."
good,"Target was the most fun job I've had to date. It was fast-paced, fun, nice customers, coworkers who were awesome and management was nice and understanding. The only draw back I found was the pay. "
good,I worked here during my high school years and it was fun at first but could not see myself dealing with the management and fighting for hours and little promise of advancement but if retail is someone's dream job then it may be a perfect fit. 
good,"Excellent company for growth and work with great teams. A HR position with this company exposes you to challenging situations and good management. The company is very structured, therefore, provide many tools and helpful resources. "
good,On a typical work day I was responsible for the daily task and following food safety regulation in food production. I enjoyed working with hard and friendly workers.
good,"From stocking to guest services. From electronics to apparel. From telephone operator to market. I've worked in just about every area/department in the store and I love being able to do so. This provides great challenges, more opportunities for hours and keeps things exciting and always changing. "
good,"get to work organize thing, sell some things, break, sell some more things for a couple hours, another break sell some more things, organize stuff & then leave. i learn how to manage a department kind of. the management was alright but not the greatest. the co-workers were great. trying to do customer service & organizing at the same time was the hardest. the 10% discount was the most enjoyable part."
good,cashiers usually works just long enough to get one break and no lunch. Exp. (12:00pm - 5:45pm) 6 hour shifts get a break and a lunch.
good,"Decent grunt work.  It's not very creative work, which is a con for me unfortunately, but the people who I worked with were very friendly."
good,A nice working environment helpful staff. Target  is  a great place to shop for the whole family and home.
good,I liked my work at target I stock the store with items and help customers take items back to there cars
good,a typical day at work doing what i'm schedule to do. i enjoy working with the different managers at work it's a fast fun& friendly enviroment that i'm happy to be apart of. it makes my day to see our guest leaves with a smile on their face's knowing that they were satisfied with the customer service they received. the hardest part of my job is when i cant satisfies a guest needs but as always i know i go the extra mile meaning i do my best! thank you.
good,"Overall, target was a great company to work for. There was a great team. They were always ready to get the job done on time and with accuracy. Management and the co-workers made it very pleasant and lively. I would say that the hardest part about the job, was the fact the it was overnight. However, after a little while, I got used to the hours, so it didn't bother me as much. "
good,"On a daily basis, Target was a cool environment. Never felt pressure to make sales or to keep guest happy. Management was very encouraging and always looked to offer a helping hand. I learned how to communicate better with everyday people and I didn't know how easy it was to make people laugh and be comfortable. My co-workers were very laid back people and I enjoyed working with them. The hardest part of the job was trying to get guests to sign up for a Target credit or debit card. The most enjoyable part was seeing kids smile when they got the toy they wanted or when a kid was having a bad day, a simple Target sticker would brighten their day."
good,As with retail companies the goal is customers. The primary task was to keep the sales floor stocked with merchandise so that it is available to the customers.
good,"Fine place to work if you are just out of high school or just out of college. The managerment staff can be difficult to work with at times, mostly because it's ""their way or the highway."""
good,"Overall good company to work for even though they don't promote properly and don't train their managers as well as they should. I work with good people, just inexperienced management. A normal consists of helping guests with movies, games and televisions, stocking shelves and working new merchandise to the floor. Most days are slow, while others are busy, overall 4 out of 5 stars."
good,Really good company to work for. Target helped me progress my career in Supervision/Management.
good,I like working at Target. My co-employees are very nice. I get along with my co-workers and Management. I have really learned to be a better team player while being employed at Target.
good,Working with people at Target.com is amazing - I love it.
good,"While working for Target Mobile( RadioShack) I had a great time learning everyday the responsibilities of managing and improving on my management skills. the people I worked with were great and we worked great together they helped me and i helped them. I know i gained a lot of experience as a manager, from improving my inventory skill to training and finding unique ways to train and work with everyone i worked with because everyone has their way of working and learning. the hardest part of the jobs was getting customers to understand that we were looking out for them by providing them great service, amazing prices, we had some customer think we were pulling their leg, others thought we weren't legitimate. I have to say that the most satisfying part is when i helped someone who had no clue what they wanted or how to use it, I went above and beyond to help them and trained them to use their new device."
good,"My typical day of work consist of me opening up Target Mobile Kiosk, which I have to count the register and send out the daily email of daily sale goals. Also try to engage customers getting them to maybe start a new line of service with Sprint, Verizon, and AT&T."
good,"Target is a great place to work they really work with your schedule to accommodate school and family. A typical day for me is helping guest find what they need as I fold, hang and put away clothes. I will sometimes cashier as well. The hardest part of the job is time management, as you have a lot to do with several interruptions so you need to plan accordingly. The best part is all the people who will come and go, from the co workers to the guest. It is a great, friendly environment."
good,Fun place to work great business culture! The only disadvantage is that upper management tends to be pushy.
good,a day at work consist of making sure all items get in a cart inorder to be put on the salesfloor. this is usually a proceess that starts at 8 am all the way to 7 pm. after this from 8 pm to 12 am we make sure all stock rooms are cleaned for overnight process. we clean but stocking all over pushed items back into their rightful place. also crush cradborad and sweep trash. i learned alot form doing my job to doing others just in case they are shorthanded and being able to help myself. managment changed alot throughout my years there but they were dedicated to making the company much better. i had a relatinship with my co workers i try to get along woth everyone i never start trouble among co workers and everyone can atest to that. the harderst part of the job was not having enough people to do the task. one person to do a four person task is very taxing. the most enjoyable part was meeting new people and building relatonships
good,A Target the motto is FAST FUN & Friendly. It is truly and great place to work. If you come in with a postive attitude is will take you a long way. At my particular store I have learned Patience. We a various of guest and fellow employees personalities to deal with all day. The hardest part is to try and make everyone happy at once. but when you work hard and you see the smile from the guest and you get the recognition from other team members its worth it.
good,Did advance to returns counter. The job was only seasonal. Management helped me and answered any questions I had.
good,"It's a great, interactive place to work...but many of the workers have thier ""favorites"""
good,ive learned how to work as a team and learn different areas and handling money

good,"I was able to work in a fast, fun, friendly atmosphere and maintaing excellent long term cliental. I maintained a clean work are and priced and organized merdhandise"
good,A typical day at this job is very fast paced phones and alarm monitoring.
good,It was a great job growing up. I helped opening up 3 targets. I worked my way around but i wanted something different
good,Target Super-center had grocery clothing electronics stationary and meat section. Working in the meat section one was responsible for pulling out of dates helping customers organizing freezer and responding to fast service (cashiering when busy). It was a fun job in high school stress free and was able to contribute in customers having a great day.
good,"There is not a typical day at Target. You never know what your day is going to like until it happens. You could be helping customers, answering phones or sorting clothes all at the same time or you could be running merchandise to the shelves and helping customers. Management and team members all work as a team to get the job done for the day. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting different people."
good,A lot of politics and favortism. Co workers are great and typical day at work is the same everyday. Customer service is a huge part of your role.
good,i wood go in and start with unloading pallets on then main floor.then i wood start putting merchinedice on shelves and then work each area. working with other employes.
good,target was a good company to work for. the best one i ever worked for
good,"Meet with floor supervisor for assigned areas after team warm ups.I learned an area of the warehouse that some days included making boxes at start up and printing labels and placing those with lables on belt to destination within warehouse.And sometimes placed to pack items,wrap,seal,and label at outbound area.This was a position that required me to be standing,bending,upper body movement.I think the enjoyable part of the job was working with different follow employees who have woked in all areas of the warehouse,though this job was seasonal and on-call Target was going to have a new contract for the early part of 2013 and I'm open to availabilty if that should come about."
good,"Overall, Target is a good place to work. The management team is a good group of individuals to work with; they provide flexibility with the employees."
good,"Working at target was a good experience. I was allowed to work with an outstanding group of people from management all the way to the employees. The hardest part about being a cart attendant was dealing with the weather and being in the south that is a lot easier said than done, but management did provide drinks during the summer, boots and panchos in the rains, and gloves during the winter. All in all I enjoyed my time there."
good,Fun but very little pay
good,"all the people who worked there where amazing. But i did get trained in multiple areas such as Service desk, Cafe, Cashier, Carts and Assistant Manager. I did responsibilities for all these positions but when i asked for compensation for these they were not open to it."
good,"everyone is really nice, but if your at entry level the pay is not going to be greeat but better than others"
good,had to get use to my hours at first but soon after it became clockwork.
good,"I learned how to deal with customers more effectively, worked as a team as well as working alone, and how to be more flexible in other departments. Target is a fast paced environment and there is always something to do. You have to very flexible, willing to help out as a part of a team, and go above a beyond for customers."
good,"Target for a long time was a great place to work. It really embodies the saying ""you get out of it what you put in."" They have developed a good, fun culture, and tend to hire very friendly and fun people. The harder you work, the more responsibility you are given. My only gripe with the job was the upper management at my store; They tended to vary in quality and helpfulness quite a great deal. Some areas of the store were given priority over others, mine being all but ignored unless there was a problem."
good,"Nice place to work, everyone is very friendly and caring. Very fast paced. Only down fall is the hours and the strain on your family"
good,Target is a good place to start if you're just getting out into the working field. You will learn retail and how to interact with customers
good,"Fast pace work including helping guest in a timely manner, co-workers are always willing to lend a hand to help each other when needed,Learning all areas of the store."
good,I enjoyed working at this store. It is easy to get to. It is on a bus route. Vacation time is standard. Reviews were fair. Management was fair. Hours were good.
good,"Great experience, great fast pace work place. I learn how to change NDC on labels, and use the computer system."
good,"One -two weeks train, 90 day probation, arrive at work -clock in, report to designated area of work, asscess which flats or pallets need to be moved to floor. Move them to the floor, distribute boxes, stock shelves, If you are assigned to check outs -report to check-outs and ring up customers. Co-workers help when need help, no real hard part to job, everything enjoyable."
good,Dealt with different personalities of the customers returning merchandise.
good,"Helped unload truck and maintain inventory, maintained valuable electronics section."
good,Typical day is very busy
good,"Everyday i went in to work, i checked in and counted my drawer. I learned alot about working with money, and the public. My imediate manager was great to work with, friendly and always helpful. My co-workers were nice to work with, and for the most part around my age group. The hardest part of my job was not being able to work enough. I always wanted more hours. I enjoyed every part of my job, working with the public is very easy for me."
good,Absolutely Love it team members are great. and work is actually fun. what more can you ask for?
good,"target was a fun place to work, I cant say anything bad about it. the people working there are great and had fun helping people. their positive energy was contagious."
good,"Just your typical regular retail supermarket store. Co-workers were good supervisors were always busy, had a lot of good times and bad times but was still a good job to have. They didn't really work around people availability like people asked for had to wait to long for time for the HR department to change things."
good,"As a fitting room attendant my day is performed alone with little to no outside help to complete my tasks depending on my work load. I have to keep myself on task and use great time management skills to accomplish my part to play in the overall function of the store. It is a rewarding job with interaction with many different guests that shop the store. My management team is always willing to help if I feel overwhelmed and my co-workers are pleasant to work with, even though I work somewhat alone in my position. The hardest part of the job is feeling like you fight a never ending battle against the store merchandise, putting it out, getting it back from a guest who tried it on, and again returning it to it's place on the sales floor. However when you win the fight at the end of the fight at the end of the night and have nothing to leave for the morning crew the sense of accomplishment is the best feeling."
good,"Very Busy Work place. Learned How to stock shelves new items, also more about the company."
good,Gained management experience while employed with Target Mobile.
good,Hard to work long hours with a young child at home. Love the set schedules. Worked at hiring and training with orientation team building with new hires. Monitor benefit enrollment and team captain for community service. Company encouraged team building with Managers through out the district so there was always ongoing peer meetings.
good,I cant really cant say much about my job besides it is a place i go and do my work. I have been at target for almost 3 years and i have learned a lot to take it with me to another job. I have done parts of my job of being a supervisor. meaning when ever they where in need i was always there to help. I have also been in the cash office which is a big responsibility. I get along with all my co-workers. i am a out going person that can be friends with you but also i don't play with my job. I am a hard worker. The most enjoyable part at my job is that i love what i do. I love when my boss can tell me how good of a job that im doing and how well im doing it.
good,"Great benefits, overall goals are smart and attainable, leadership in store isn't always solid, hardly ever available when you need them."
good,"For the time I was there, the people were very good to work for and with. They are very willing to help you to understand your job and anything else you would like to know about working for them. The management team worked well together to help you know what your job consited of."
good,I was in logistics with really good management. We worked in a team enviorment. I worked overnight.
good,"A typical day at target is getting to work at 7am-330pm, working on food prep, setup and inventory."
good,Kept workers Busy with different task.
good,Work for logistics at target store means work in a fast pace and setting goals before start your daily work.
good,"I learned how to negotiate with unsatisfied customers, help customers locate merchandise and make purchase, and learned to greet customers in a warm, friendly manner. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and helping others out."
good,"Target was a good place to work, being I love gardening my position in the garden shop was ideal. My experience there enhanced my gardening skills and my co-workers were great! Fighting the weather every day was a challenge, especially in the summertime; the heat was unbearable at times however, in the spring and fall working outside was tremendous. I enjoyed meeting the ""guests"" and many became personal friends. Management needs iimprovement but overall Target is a good place to work."
good,Stocking the shoe department. How to be productive. Management was good. Most co-workers where very nice to work with. Sometimes the pace. Meeting many differerent people.
good,Although management was absent at times there where many experienced workers with a friendly atittude who often offered a helping hand. Most enjoyable part of my job was making successful apprehensions and being a part of the success of our security team.
good,Everyday is pretty much the same except for some the the chores. Working on replenishment every hour then price changes and then backstock items for later use. You learn how to use a handheld computer/scanner to find what is needed and to stock items. Management is willing to help but they would like you to do it yourself. You can easily find out what you are capable of doing by doing this job. If you are willing to work hard you can get better. Speed is a high priority in this work place.
good,"Although Target is a pretty good company to work for it involves retail, therefore, we do have our moments when our hours get cut drasticly. As a Target Team Member you get the oppotunity to learn different position within the store, and get the chance to go help at other stores when neccesary."
good,.stock shelves
good,"The start of a shift was mostly the same every night, it began with unlaoding the trucks supplies, then organizing the merchandise on a palet that was placed in the area it would be shelved, and the neatly and promptly I would prepare the store before its opeing the next day. I didnt really learn much during my time with target, but they did pay quite exceptionally."
good,"My schedule stayed fairly consistent which was nice, I learned a lot of valuable skills, pertaining to customer service, time management, cashiering, inventory control and more. The management there was generally flexible and willing to work with any schedule you had, and the co-workers were all good hearted people. The hardest part about the job was only during busy Christmas season, however with the right time management skills and use, it was very manageable. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to go and help people get what they need and see them leave the store happy."
good,A typical day was alot of multi tasking in my postion I worked the front of the store which was keeping an eye on the cashiers and also helping with any issues that arose involving customer service. I learned how to reslove issues in a perfessional manner. The management team was very helpful with giving instruction on dealing with different situations. I enjoyed working with my co-workers because we frequently did things as a team effort to insure the best customer satisfaction. The hardest part of the job was being on my feet for an entire shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers and satisfying there shopping needs.
good,It is always a busy day with a lot of work to do from all departments.
good,Its a good job for a teenager in the store department thier is that much room for growth im sure each target is different but this is based on the the one I worked at.
good,"Work there was great, I open that store with a great team, and made that my career and home."
good,"Target helped me grow as a leader. The company is very big on self development, and improving on leadership skills. I value the relationships I have gained, both professionally and personally, during my time with Target. The people, co-workers and Guests, have been the most enjoyable part of my job."
good,I worked for this company in two different state. I enjoyed many of the years I spent with company. I help the company brand with two national food chains and grow its business.
good,good to know everything and my bosses were good and my co workers are always good to our group of 5
good,I thoroughly enjoyed working for Target. My experience and time there was an experience I'll never forget. The other team members were very welcoming and friendly to work with. The management was always there if you needed someone to talk to about any problems. I was always pushed to do my best work. Everyone was always willing to give constructive criticism.
good,"I've learned how to deal with multiple people at once, you learn something new everyday because of how busy the place gets, you have the chance to take the initiative to making executive decisions when the time comes."
good,"The best part of working there, is the amount of support you have, but your success is determined by your ability to influence people."
good,"It a good job but the pay is horrible and the hour. You have to beg just to get hour. The job is great, they communicate with you. Give you free lunch and played game. It always something positive going on. Management is friendly and fun. You get to work and learn new thing everyday. You do all the work for low pay."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of, selling attatchments for all electronic devices, greet customer's, stock shelves, and give overall great customer service. All co-workers are friendly and self-motivated in my department wich is very important. I would say that the hardest part of the job would have to be getting the number one spot in the district, yet we were able to pull it off a few times for the rolling four week period. The most enjoyable part of the job is that we get to meet new people everyday and help them choose the best quality electronic device possible."
good,I really learned alot as well from this job. Got most of my training as a manager being here. They really developed me when I was younger and really saw something in me. The best part was the people I worked with.
good,Our team has a daily task of lanograms that need to be completed. We may break off and work individually or as the team to complete the planograms. Read planogram to specific on hanging product on pegs or putting them on shelfs. Clean area that was in and continue giving 100% to guess service. Getting the planograms finished ina timely manner when some fixtures annot be found or if certain problems persist. The best part ofthe job is being able to work as a team
good,"A typical day at Target is""How can I help you find something"", greet customers. Every other day you learn something in new. Have great co-workers when you need help they are there to help.Open has many red credit card.Every week we have activity in the breakroom for all the team member."
good,Working as a cashier helping the customers find items and ringing them up in a good manner and having respect. Also watching managers operate the store with their many duties and whenever there is a issue or problem.
good,A typical day of work has me pulling product out of detailed areas and pushed to the floor to stock. I learned how the inventory and retailed based companies work on a daily basis. Management usually only delegates work with very little interaction with the standard employees. My co-workers are the most enjoyable part of my job and they are some of the hardest working people I know. The hardest part of my job is the repetitiveness of the actual work.
good,"Cashier, with minor housekeeping. tried to sell target red cards"
good,If you work here try to be on the sales floor. Zoning and walking around talking to people is easier than standing in the same spot for hours behind a cash register.
good,"loved the fast pace work; it made my day pass by faster. typical day includes handling the register, doctor calls, cashiering along with will call, auto fills, fill on arrivals, etc. learned how to operate and type up scripts. co wokers were very supportive as well as my boss. hardest part of the job was dealing with troubled patients, yet the most enjoyable part was seeing patients happy."
good,I liked working at Target. It was one of the better retail experiences that I have had.
good,"I learned a lot of patience of working with the public,the hardest part is standing in one place for your work day,enjoyable part meeting new people."
good,"Management was nice they always helped when you needed, even the employees were nice"
good,Its always a fun day when I get to work. I learned how to price items and find items on a scanner. I nerver did any managment. My co-workers we're fun people to work with. The hardest part was that I didn't make enough money but it was a great place to work.
good,"this job is a good place to work but i know i will like something that is better compensation, and also something i feel i can move up in and appreciate my dedication."
good,Fun place to work with good benefits. Structured schedule (very unusual for retail). Good ability for advancement if you use the tools provided
good,A typical day at work is you work with a team to do a certain task and work until the very end of your shift. I learned how to use a PDA and acquired more work experience in a backroom. There really is no part of the job that is hard it just might be repetitive and boring at times unless you are working and chatting with a coworker.
good,In a typical day I would proceed to review a list of tasks I needed to complete for the day left by my team leader. As I finished my tasks I would help any customers that needed help by giving the their needed items and ringing them up. Then I would fill any empty shelves and fix or add any signage that needed to be replaced. The management was good and they were good in giving good recognition for good employees.The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry guests but I knew that it had to be done. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people.
good,Customer service oriented. I was a cashier over the holiday season. High paced environment but they had enough employees on hand so everyone was helped if they needed it. Supervisors were very good.
good,I enjoy working the Target Store. I get along with other employees and I do my job to the best of my ability.
good,"I would pretty much stand at the register all day, there were a few occasions where I would stock merchandise. I learned how to be a more outgoing person. The Management there was really good, I liked their idea of a ""Team"" Based environment. My co-workers were awesome, and super friendly. The hardest part of the job was that it was around Christmas time and just crazy busy. I enjoyed my co-workers and manager a lot. It was my first job out of high school, and they taught me a few things about myself."
good,"I worked 25+ plus years with Target. My daily responsibilities included leading salesfloor team, gocery, apparel, households goods. This generally included a teaom of 10-15 employees. The part of my job I enjoyed the most was training the new employees and seeing them advance with Target, during the future months."
good,"I worked at Target as my first part time job. I enjoyed everyday there, and would recommend it to anyone as an introduction to working."
good,"a tyoical day at target would be unloading the freight truck seperating stock for departments, backroom clean-up then floor stocking and backstocking. mangement was tough but fair all my co-workers were fun to be around. hardest part of the job backstocking in the freezers"
good,"Better for people looking to start a career. Long hours, weekends, overnights, and holidays required. Work life balance is Ok day-to-day, but when it comes to holidays, be prepared to work. You will work every other weekend as well. As a company, Target is superb. The work/life balance is much the same as any other retail store. If you are looking to start a family or spend more time with the one you already have, be prepared for some tough shifts."
good,"was moved from department to department, learned store quickly, typical retail with no holidays off,"
good,An average day at work was hustling all around the store doing every job from helping customers to keeping the shelves stocked.
good,"A day at work began with checking inventory of all floor products. I learned that proper customer service etiquette, cashier training and stocking items on the floor and backroom. Management did not understand the value of hours for there employees. The in-stocks team were great co-workers. The most enjoyable part of this job was communicating with the customers."
good,great job with stable hours. I worked over nights for 2 years I just couldn't continue with that type of schedule. Managers really do support their staff
good,A typical day at work is not at all typical. Working with the public is very unpredictable.
good,"Upper Management allowed team member to grow and delevelop into great wrokers some managers,"
good,"A Tuesday night, the store was closing and I was about to be on the clock. I clocked in a went to my station unloading the trucks, once I got to the unloading dock I could tell it was gonna be a long day because there were boxes everywhere. One of the managers looked upset so I tried to stay out of the way but some how I manage to get drag into his eye sight and he immediately put me to work, I guess I wasn't moving fast enough with the unload cause he started to get even more upset and told me to get off the truck and go push the aisle's, he'll do it himself, I guess you can call that poor management. Meanwhile, I'm pushing aisle's, I see one of the co-workers who was on the truck wit me, and I had asked if the truck was done? he told me it was far from done, so I asked why is he out here then and he told me he got kicked off the truck and sent out to push aisle's. So me and the co-worker pushed the aisle's together and the hardest part was we had to do it alone but the most enjoyable part was we didn't have to do that long truck."
good,"I was hired as a contractor but I loved working there. This is probably my first job after college that i actually work somewhat close to what i have studied. It was very laid back environment, the managements were very cool just loved everything. I loved my schedule in at 6:30 leave at 2:30 it was perfect since i am a morning person."
good,Target has a very detailed training program. For the most part most of Target career was a great experience. But there was a management change at a high level. And the value of hard was not recoginized.
good,"Assisting customers to the best of my abilities and making sure they had the best shopping experience. The co workers were amazing very friendly and welcoming, the hardest part of the job was around the holiday time where it was really busy and you had to really pick up the past you work in. i enjoyed the interaction with all the people i meet."
good,very fast pace always on the go type of job and you will never be bored working here
good,"I worked part-time at Target. I was flexible and worked in many different areas of the store. My co-workers were a great group of people. Even though I was part-time, I was eligible for some benefits. There were so many things that I did, that I did not have time to get bored."
good,"Target was a great team enviornment. They focus highly on development and like to see their top performing executive advance within the company. As with most retailers, the 50 hour+ a week committment for a salaried postition is not great for people with families."
good,"As I worked in the deli at Target, I spent a lot of time multitasking. Every day consisted of moving back and forth between our assigned tasks and helping customers, washing our hands and changing gloves with each transition. While having a variable amount of interruptions made it difficult to have any certainty about when I could complete my tasks, I found that I had the most fun on days when we were busiest. On these days I could see just how efficiently my coworkers and I could work at our best, and often found myself getting more done on these days than on the more mundane slow days."
good,"The job was enjoyable with the right amount of challenge, however some of the management tended to be a bit short when there was a problem or if I did not understand what it was I was being asked to do."
good,"The hardest part about working with Target was the standing for long periods of time however, I loved working with public and learning different things about other cultures."
good,Another day with more pressure trying to finish tasks from another shift.
good,"I absolutely loved working here. The atmosphere was excellent, employees were wonderful and there was always a helping hand available when needed."
good,This is your typical retail work environment. You interact with customers and many other things. I will not speak for or against because I want others to make their own assessment.
good,My first job fun place to work. Mangers were younger and didn't give employees a hard time.Hardest part of the job was pulling pallets from the loading dock to the aisles.
good,"You stay busy. Most of the job is independent, meaning you don't have a boss looking over your shoulder, hardly ever. Learned how deal with customers in all situations. Target is a very team oriented company and working as a team very important."
good,Great job for a first time worker. Gives great benefits after being employed with their company for a period of time.
good,"management was very nice, coworkers were easy to get along with, loved the days that food was provided for us nd the fun games we played during the holidays."
good,"My duties mainly include stocking, culling, production, and guest service. The production includes preparing fruits according to a specific recipe for bowls, trays, and cups. All duties require certain tests to be passed which include organic certification, biohazard, and heavy equipment certification among others. I also take part in every quarterly inventory which includes weighing, counting, and scanning all product and following up with and audits that need to be taken care of. On a weekly basis I typically do one or two of three orders. I order product according to quantity and quality on the sales floor while keeping track of sales patterns, local events, holidays, and weekly advertisements. When the need arises I am also in charge of training new team members."
good,My job is working in the backroom to do inventory control and keep a constant flow of replenishment to the sales floor throughout the day. Most of my day is pulling out inventory from the backroom using a PDA handheld device to know what items need to be replenished.
good,"Although my overall experience working for the Target Corporation was pleasant, the company needs to ensure proper coverage of shifts and require at lease some form of raise after 90 days. If an employee is consistently on time, picks up shifts, covers call-outs, and performs well above expectancy; then a raise needs to be given at their review."
good,"Target is a great place to work. They are very flexible with your schedule, provide free lunches every now and then, and the pay rate is pretty decent for a typical high school and college student. However, there are some drawbacks. There is way too much management going on in each store. First, you have a team leader who oversees the operations of their department. Next, you have executives who oversee that their team leaders are having their team members complete each task. And finally, you have the store team leader who oversees the operation of the entire store. This makes it very confusing as to whos boss is who and it also makes for poor communication and organization. Everything used to be in an organized fashion when I first started there, but now it has all fallen apart. Nobody knows anything about what is going on in the store and projects tend to get very messy because nobody wants to be organized. Overall, I feel that the pros outweigh the cons and that Target is still a good company to work for."
good,"I'd start my day at various hours, replenishing store merchandise/ stock. Target taught me responsibility and work ethic. My managers were understanding and my coworkers were friendly. The hardest part of my job was getting the batches pulled and pushed out to the sales floor in a timely manner. Knowing that all my headwork was appreciated was the most enjoyable part of my day."
good,Great company if retail is your thing. The company values highly on leadership and the growth of thier current employee. It is easy to move up if you are willing to put the work in it.
good,"The culture is quite pleasant, the break room is nice with television, kitchen, microwaves etc... I never experienced gossip among workers. Everyone seemed very respectful. Seasonal workers don't get health or dental and target tend to hire winter and spring season help to prevent benefit pay. I enjoyed working there. I enjoyed most of the supervisors but there was a couple who seemed to be angry alot and frustrated when asked to help and the supervisors avoid small talk with cashiers or people they manage at all costs.The team leaders also tend to deliver different instructions on accepting coupons, price comparisons and handling situations. I am not sure if it is from lack of communication on training or intentional sabotage but it was a common experience."
good,I worked as a Flow team member we would be out on the floor putting product in locations helping customers is a great feeling
good,"Working there was okay, it was some rainy and cold nights but thats okay if you compare getting robbed trying to get a cart from the side of the building.."
good,The company is about decent but nothing great. I would not get to close to team members because Target can turn into a rumor mill real fast.
good,A place where u can meet good people. Very clean place nice co-workers
good,"Great place to start in the working field, Build up strong customer service skills, sales and fun people to work with."
good,Great place to start working when you are looking for people experience
good,"Target as a corporation is great. Their level of customer service and their work standards are something to be admired. It trickles off at a store level. Expectation levels are set too high. What they ask of their employees is unrealistic and ever changing. When you think you have your routines in place and you're on the right track they change the policies and expect the knowledge level of new policies to the immediate. The hiring standards and opportunities for advancement are skewed. Allowing inexperienced college graduates to be assistant managers in lieu of talented leaders in the building because of a degree is degrading and embarrassing. Most of the new executives in the buildings have never had a job before. Hiring them to oversee a multimillion dollar building and over see associates who have more knowledge, better routines and work ethics is laughable."
good,Target offered a great team atmosphere in which I was able to learn a variety of jobs in different areas of the store
good,I recommend applying for a job with Target. Positive experience over there. I would return if given the chance.
good,"Loved this job. If I could go back to working for this company I would. Like any job you might not like all the people that you work with but hey thats life. I loved this job. I learned to work the customer service desk, see how the cash office was ran, I got GREAT hours, my customers always came back to me. I controlled fitting rooms, helped supervise other cashiers, anything you could imagine that needed to be done in the store i was crossed trained in. I even learned how to work at the pizza hut and Starbucks we had."
good,I loved making friendships with co-workers which can make the time pass. Have to stay focus on all your tasks and to not spend time lollygagging but make the most of your timed shift being productive.
good,Atypical day at target would be me clocking in walking around say hi to all the other employees then going to get my cart and this mobile phone we called it a gun and i would walk around and find online orders for people and scan it to my cart then take it to the back when I found all the items and just start packing them and put them in the shipping carts.
good,Things are easy to catch on to and most of the time other employees are willing to help out if need be. The work load isn't an impossible standard and almost everyday my tasks get done.
good,"Great work environment, I worked as a sales floor team member and then changed to Starbucks barista. Working in the target environment is very comfortable, the guests are nice and working here is fun which makes the time fly."
good,I loved working for this company. The only downside is they do not have a point system so you basically cant miss work or you may get fired.There are also different rules for different people and they seem to change everyday.
good,I enjoyed my experience with Target.  Staff very friendly and helpful to newbie.  Store management was very organized.  Could have been better explanation of how to handle price match and coupon situations.  Training on the new Target App to better assist the customers could have been a definite plus.  All and all it was a great experience and I would definitely work for Target again.
good,It is an easy job for the most part. Cashiering at target is very simple. The workplace is fine. It just really depends on the location you work at and in which department you work.
good,"Organized the backroom with team members to create a sufficient foundation for daily store opening. Processed all goods that are overstocked in a timely manner to create a productive workflow. Communicated efficiently with team members, helping the backroom run more effectively. Overall, great experience with Target."
good,I worked for Target multiple times in my life. Overall I enjoyed working there. Some of the team leads could be lazy and/ or rude. Asking you to do their work for them and then getting the praise. Most of the managers were cool. I hated doing huddles. They made Plano team go everyday even though it was the same information. It made you get behind. I left because I got burned out on retail. Also because my team lead was rude and would start arguments with people.
good,"Working at target, there are different customers an different employee’s to work with an experience new personalities while also working in a safe an friendly work space."
good,"Target is a great place to work at. Lots of fun and super easy. Coworkers are loving. Hours are great and so is the pay. Easy to do work, and lots of positions to choose from"
good,Tasks are not to difficult although work loads can be heavy at times. Hours get very low towards the end of the holidays and after. Try to be positive and respectful to team members and guests at all times.
good,Most of the management is capable and competent. The workload is below most of societies standards. Benefits are exceptional for the level of employment.
good,"I love working for Target Distribution Center. They are very keyed in on personal safety, as well as business advancement. As long as you come to work to do a great job, you will be treated like more than just a number. The benefits are wonderful and I suggest signing up for a 401K as soon as you are able to because the company just keeps growing and it is very fruitful."
good,"mostly friendly people, always eager to assist whenever you need help. Good human resource and managerial people. happy place to work at and learn new things about retail"
good,I worked in the beauty department at target and I liked it a lot. I loved working as a team with the other beauty workers and people from other departments.
good,"Laid back job,  typically worked with other people in your department. Sometimes you work alone, just depends how busy the store is and what other people are working at the time."
good,"I enjoyed most of my time working at Target. The leaders generally did a pretty good job of ensuring my success as an employee. I learned a good deal about working with the public and that having an inclusive workplace is good for all parties. I gained skills in dealing with money, customer service, stocking, cleaning, and teamwork. Overall the workplace culture is pretty cooperative and most employees are helpful to new workers getting on their feet. The increase in pay to $13-15/hr is great as well; however the benefits for part time employees seem to suffer as a result. The hardest part of the job was definitely working with constantly shifting schedules or fellow employee's who did not put as much effort into their time at work. As with working anywhere, a great array of diversity in workers means that there will inevitably be a person or two who do not value the job as much as others which is definitely frustrating to work with sometimes. This is true at any diverse workplace and is rather minor when compared to all of the great employees working along side you. Being a college student struggling with mental health was rough as well because depending on the time of year, the hours and flexibility differ greatly. The inconsistency in this aspect comes with all retail jobs though, so if that is not a huge concern for you then the scheduling should be no issue.The most enjoyable part of the job for me was getting to meet so many great people, customers and fellow employees alike. Being able to help folks through a bad day, even if your interactions were sometimes brief with"
good,"Great place for my high school years but need to take others hours if u want to even start to make a living. Hours are very inconsistent, but the workplace is friendly."
good,"Target is modernizing and making operational changes in anticipation of increasing base pay to $15 an hour for all team members.  I'm not certain if this will benefit or hinder thing on the store level.  Like most things, it will likely depend on the people running each store."
good,The usual day at work is good you know what you need to do but management or your team lead can pull you to help another department which can set you behind sadly. I feel this could be fixed by hiring more people for certain jobs even if its outside of seasonal times.
good,"While my time there was short, it was a great experience. The team environment was good, management was 50/50 most of the time, but all around as a team we were a great unit and that’s what I like about the job the most."
good,Target cares about their employees and provide flexible work hours and good work rate by the hour and opportunity for overtime. Good and considerate management.
good,"Just some managers were really disrespectful and just were only interested about them self but on there then that hours,co-works and location are  great"
good,"I genuinely like working at target most of the time, my coworkers are amazing and so are most of my team leads. It’s a very good first job to have and you are treated with respect. They are very inclusive, and understanding."
good,"Target is great starter job, however it does offer opportunities for growth. The location that I worked in didn't really promote opportunity within, which I didn't agree."
good,Target is a great place to work until you don't fit in with the cliques and management notices. Friends are more important than the quality of work you put out. Best of luck!
good,"A typical day at target started with me getting the company phone and walkie so that way we are in constant comunication. Next i would have to find who ever was in charge of flex thatday and check in on what i am suppose to do that day wheater its stocking, aduiting, online orders, or (OPU'S) which is on the way pick ups."
good,"Overall a very good company to work for. Competitive pay and benefits. Everyday is different and possesses a unique challenge which is nice, it’s never boring."
good,Ive worked for target twice but it was only seasonal for the holidays. I would go and start off unloading the trucks and move the pallet with a pallet jack. I would help other ppl out in their work.
good,"Working at target was very fun, usually started in the early morning and organizing the aisles from the night before. Afterwards received freight delivered from truck, organized by department onto pallets and pushed outward onto sales floor to stock department. Management was encouraging and very positive around the workplace. The hardest part of the job would be understanding effectual communication is very lacking between you and your lead. Many problems will be laid upon you or a finger of blame. Remember to stand up for yourself and encourage yourself to name off reasons why you aren't the cause for blame. The most enjoyable part of the job is that since there is always something to do you will be flying through your shifts."
good,"I have been working for Target a little over 2 years now and I have very little complaints. The management is very easygoing and they really do work with you to have a flexible schedule that would meet your needs. My only issue with the company is the hours, other than that Target is a fun, flexible working environment."
good,"I really enjoy working here but I do not think it is fair that they have the woman on the closing shift. If they want to keep a place safe they should make more men close. Also, they don't offer full-time positions only if you are in management."
good,"I love working at Target. The associates are very welcoming and caring. The job can be stressful at times, like around the holidays or even after when hours are being cut, but other than that, it's great!"
good,"I absolutely love Target. The coworkers are amazing, and the pay is good. Unfortunately, while I love the job experience, I am looking to work more hours than they are willing to give me."
good,"I enjoyed my coworkers. My schedule was never consistent, which was hard, and it was hard to get hours. The customers could be rude. Management always took customer side over any complaint. The basic job is boring. The store I worked at had a lot of crime in the neighborhood and I never felt safe leaving late at night alone."
good,"This is a good first retail job. The pay is great, and the hours are only good during the season. After seasonal it dies down a lot, so do hours. I would recommend this job to be for seasonal then find a new place to work after."
good,"I enjoyed working at Target.  I enjoyed my job.  I liked that I got to move around during my shift and interact with team members.  I got to learn new skills, and enjoyed what I got to do everyday."
good,Apply directly to the company they are always hiring.  This is a physically demanding job if you are very out of shape this is not for you. Starting pay is 16.66 then you get a .50 cent raise every 6 months for 2 yrs.  If you are late 3x within your 90 days you will be fired and 1 minute past the time is considered late. They use a punch/swipe clock.
good,Not too bad of a place to work. Long hours but plenty of breaks. Take advantage of overtime during peak season because it does get slow. Employees come and go giving plenty of opportunities to move to different departments. One Con is Warehouse worker is as high as you can go because they hire Supervisors outside the company.
good,I really appreciated my time ar target as a seasonal guest advocate. The management and other staff members were all really nice. I did wish for was more hours. Hope to apply again soon.
good,easy job as drivers mate an people real nice job is delivering furniture an doing pubs an hotels paperwork is easy an job get more pay then most companies
good,Good company had hard time with the mangment over all not to bad for first job not to much room to move up in the company not many opportunity presented
good,Good atmosphere and funloving coworkers. Hours are up and down depending on the department and what season it is. If you are looking for 40 hours on a consistent week in and week out I would not recommend working here. If you are looking for a parttime job then Target is not a bad place to work.
good,I mostly kept to myself but everyone was very nice and I only encountered one rude guest in my time at Target. They worked with my school schedule and I always got the time off that I asked for
good,Having a seasonal job at Target was a great experience at Target. I got to work with a lot of great coworkers and got to meet a lot of nice guests. The hardest part about the job was being organized because it can get very busy around the holidays and it was a challenge to keep everything in order.
good,"At my store things were pretty straightforward, but trying to transfer to another store is impossible. My leaders had lost my transfer paper twice. Also sometimes you don’t get the recognition that you deserve."
good,"The environment at Target is fun and diverse. Interacting with the guests that shop inside the store is always a thrilling experience to be apart of.  In a typical workday there are at least a minimum of three tasks that all employees are required to accomplish. In those tasks two of the main priority ones are most important. Our leaders, are understanding and help when they can to ensure that the guests have the best experience in service and that the task are being completed."
good,In this company they took their guidelines very seriously. You had to follow the rules and not disobey then in any way. The hardest part of the job was engaging with guest even though you can tell they did want to to carry on a conversation with you. Best part of the job was how easy and enjoyable it was.
good,I love my job most days. It’s not a very hard job although somedays there is obviously more workload than others and I guess I just haven’t always been prepared. I wish they would train people better. Other than that it’s a great paying job but not something I will keep forever.
good,"It is a lot to handle, but the work itself was simple. If you know about makeup and skincare for different skin types then you would be a great consultant."
good,The people who worked on the same level as me made it a fun place to work. Management could have used some work but there were some good managers. For the most part it seemed like we needed someone who knew about our positions in order to properly manage us.
good,New process has added extra work for some that is hard to get done in time allowed.  Managers not responsive to concerns.  Hours for non business owners are very limited.
good,"At Target, you can start out as a seasonal employee and end up being kept as a regular employee. During the holidays, they do a massive hiring and give you lots of hours. After the holidays, there is a drastic cut in hours for everybody. "
good,"They really do value their workers at Target but I started to have some issues with my scheduling. The number of hours i was scheduled for were far to insufficient, there was a period where I was only scheduled for 8 hours a work week."
good,The hours were give or take and my manager replied on me WAY too much but I did get to practice my social interactions and self management. The job will suck and you'll definitely hate management and whomever manages hours but the people you'll meet there will help you grow.
good,"A typical day at work was usually a relaxed environment other than holiday hours. I learned that retail requires patience. My managers were nice while you do as told. Workplace culture is a happy place everyone usually greets you with a smile. The hardest part of the job trying to work with a hostile guest as said before retail requires a lot of patience, and the most enjoyable part of the job is having coworkers willing to help you if in need."
good,We always have games and occasional activities for the employees to have fun at work. We always have shout out to all employees for the job well done. They let us consume products that are expiring on the same day or almost expiring. Provide food for employees working too early in the morning or extending. there's always training for advancement
good,"Walking into a workplace where you feel empowered to be your own decision maker is a great feeling. Target provides the opportunity to develop, grow and excel at a fast pace in an constant evolving environment."
good,"It's been years since I have worked at Target. I did overnight logistics so the pay was not worth the amount of work, and there were issues with the management at the time but I hear it's better and things have changed as of today."
good,The job itself is hard but in overall it’s a nice place to work. They just expect you to finish everything with barely any associates plus the associates don’t even want to work which makes the job harder.
good,The manager I had was great but as far as favoritism within the company it was bad. The outcome of your opportunities to succeed are slim to nun because of it.
good,"Work is enjoyable. Active, not sitting at a desk all day looking at a computer. Interactions with other employees and customers are pleasant.  Scheduling posted two weeks prior."
good,"Target was and is a great place to work, for me. Most positions are part time and they're flexible with scheduling. Working for Target is great for students and people just starting out for their first job."
good,"Everyday was different.  Checking out customers at registers, stocking shelves and retrieving carts.  Working service desk.  Management was great and caring.  And working at Target felt like a team."
good,I had a great experience at target but the only issues I had was that there wasn't really much room for advancement in the job. When you start as a cashier you must stay for awhile before you can change departments.
good,I started as a Seasonal worker. They have awesome benefits and great pay. The management is very clear on the do's and don'ts. I received excellent training and was very respected amongst my coworkers.
good,"It was a very good job to work overall, just for me it just didn't work as I did not like doing the same thing 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, you don't really get to know management as you would at a smaller company."
good,"Target has improved their IT culture over the past 15 years. Managers are typically good at helping their teams succeed. Communication is typically good among teams. Responsibility is taken seriously. Innovation and new tools are the normal thing, so you need to be adaptable."
good,Working during busy hours makes me feel energized and more of an active listener I can work on my own . Finish my task when needed . I do different task throughout the day in different areas of the store and they assign
good,"It was nice to provide service to customers and work with young, energetic staff.  Management was supportive of creative work suggestions.  The most difficult part of the job was the volume of service demanded during peak shopping hours."
good,"It is a great place to start a career with a beginner level position."
good,"Management was very kind and honest in the hiring process. Training schedule seemed a bit rushed, but the store was very busy due to the holiday season."
good,"When working at Target, you're expected to make the job easy on the team members and the guests that come through the store. When you follow the procedures of your workstation, it'll help make the work load light and team work is a must at the job. There's no I in Team. Breaks are fair to all employees with 15 mins and 30 min breaks depending on how many hours you're working there. The hardest part of the job is that it'll take patience when dealing with the guests since we want to help them as much as we can. The joy you'll get out of it is that they're willing to be flexible with your busy life whether it's school or another job employment."
good,"I had a lot of fun working at Target and definitely learned a lot about good and bad management and support. In general it was a very positive experience that encouraged my growth and let me advance in position several times. The pay for my position then could have been better, but I know that they've improved on that point since then. I would absolutely work there again."
good,"I loved the pay, the management and coworkers were rude and discouraging. The hours were amazing for a highschooler but the management was degrading and is the reason I quit."
good,With innovation and sustainability at the forefront of Target's priorities the job functions within all positions in the company have changed exponentially over the past 7 years. Everyday something new is implemented to either add change or remove obstacles within the workplace.
good,"Target was a wonderful experience in my career development, as it was a very fast-paced environment  but the people you worked with really made the job incredible."
good,"coworkers are fun, and hardworking, day is never boring, there's always work to be done. "
good,"The job was pretty chill, up until the holidays. I worked in electronics and I mostly just restocked shelves and got things from the back for customers."
good,"Would click in, in the beginning of my shift and get my tools I need for the day weather it was a box cutter, the walkie. Would receive 2, 15 min breaks and a 30 min break on a full day and a 15 and 30 min break on a half day always was Paid on time."
good,They keep cutting hours in my department leaving me with fewer hours than I need. You would have to keep track of who drops shifts in order to make the amount needed.
good,Everyone is nice and able to help if you have questions. They walk you through it slowly so that you dont miss anything and on the job training to help you get into the flow of things
good,Working as a guest advocate for Target was a fun and enjoyable work experience as compared to other jobs I have had previously. Although Hands-on training was lacking in some areas most areas to be proficient in were easy to pick-up and I was extremely saddened to have to leave Target.
good,"Target is a great place to work.  They are flexible with schedule, and always help if you need hours. I wish the pay was more, but besides that it is great."
good,"A good place to work at and works well with people's schedules. I enjoyed working there over the past two years, but now its time to find something in my career field."
good,"Once you clock in, get ready to perform many tasks. Since it is fast paced, you are only as successful as your team is. Be prepared to follow direction from management and to stay on top of tasks."
good,I was fired for not non stop working at a fast pace. it was to inconsistent for the at the time store manager. But over all I would enjoy going back if i can.
good,"While the company itself is great to work for and has plenty of room for advancement, punishments can seem harsh at times and favoritism does exist. One mistake may be overlooked for one employee while the same mistake gets another fired instantly. Work is very strenuous and doesn't allow for much free time depending on position."
good,"They love and appreciate hard working, loyal employees. They like you to have open availability. While they encourage you to apply internally for promotions, they usually hire externally for them, and it seems they prefer young twenty - somethings for their leadership team. They do offer absolutely amazing benefits, starting at 20 hours a week."
good,"typical retail job. help/interract with customers, stock shelves, do transactions, keep managers up to date on sales. Need to know whats hot and what will sell/what to sell. Knowledge of products allows you to sell the best item to the cutomer - they often have no idea what theyre looking for. Overall a great job, that is fun but also kicks your butt and teaches you alot on relating and talking to people."
good,Its a rather fun and easy job. The semi hard part is promoting red card (not for me) but for the people who aren't sellers or promoters. but the benefits and chance of growth in the company is a plus.
good,"Only worked temp job enjoyed for most part met great people. Learned need to be quick and efficient,  management was typical some great leaders and not so great. Everyone has their own styles, Hours were hardest part if unloading trucks and stocking, in a little time before store opened. Just enjoyed staying busy and be able to accomplish my job each day."
good,"It’s a fun work environment for most of the time until they smack like, the maximum amount of hours possible you can possibly work and it can be bad at some times unless you like to work long hours every day"
good,"I loved my job and the department i worked in , i would've still loved to work there,but i was busy with programs and sports.Overall i loved the environment there."
good,"A casual, yet fast paced environment with friendly co-workers and management team. Breaks are guaranteed and discounts begin immediately. If you want to work, Target is a good place to start."
good,"A typical day is to check your VMGs to see what needs to be updated as far as mannequins and floor plans.Teaching team members about Target visual standards and working along side the Style Team Leaders. "
good,I really liked target i wish i couldve cooperated with them more cause i did enjoy working there but with everyone not feeling the same way people would drag me down and eventually i couldnt do it anymore
good,Good Company and management depending on role. Shifts are not ideal but great job to get your foot in the door. Friendly environment and great benefits
good,"Every store varies. It really depends on the team you work with. My first store was terrible but after I transferred, I fell in love with my job. It really matters. If you can find a good team and steady management then you are set. If not, there is a Team Member hotline specifically to report those issues. "
good,"This is by far the best Target in the DC area. The size is easily double or maybe even triple the size of the usual small Target stores you see in DC. It has a grocery section, Starbucks, and CVS! Highly recommend."
good,Target is a quick and fast place job. They pay very well and have really good benefits. They will also work around your everyday life schedule so h can have a life outside of target.
good,"A competitive workplace. Things can get very chaotic very easily. Enjoyed working here though, bonded well with co-workers. Was a seasonal job so expected the stress. Would recommend but not without a little experience."
good,"A typical day at target is fast paced and friendly, no two days are the same. There is a variety of positions and constant opportunities for growth in all areas."
good,"Working from 6am to 6pm picking merchandise at 200 per hour, also I have worked for security for almost 11 years at target. I am able to install cameras maintained a safe and secure environment for the store and also the distribution center."
good,Target is exactly as you would think. They treag there employees very well. Near impossible to be fired. But the job is simple and if you put in effort you can go far.
good,target was a decent place to work at and made sure you received all the training needed. Although management could have been better. Overall pretty nice environment to work at.
good,Honestly i had a lot of fun working there. I was a cashier and i was allowed to go and help restock among other things. The staff for the most part was very friendly there.
good,I qas market team member mostly in dry some days there was a lot we could not get done with 3 people in dry. Its was a decent job hours were cut since we had a bunch of new seasonal employees come in
good,Target is a nice place to work. Most of the people you work with are amazing.You also get to meet new people everyday and the work experience is great
good,Working at target was a blast for me. All the guests were very polite and I always got to make people laugh. The longer I worked the more I got to know our guests . I would definitely recommend working at target!
good,Target is a really nice place to work at. You have your ups and downs at every place you work. Love the team that I was working with. They work in teams to make sure that no-one is feeling the slack
good,Its okay. Its retail. The overall work is okay. Hours are okay. Not much room for advancement because peoplepl tend to stay in their positions for a while.
good,It had its ups and downs like any job. The pay was not high enough to survive off of with the amount of hours standing on hard floors and short breaks. But not a bad company. Just couldnt survive off $8.25 hr
good,A typical day keeps you busy enough so you always have something to do. Great employees and an enjoyable place to work. Good for someone looking for a part-time job.
good,Wants all employees to interact with customers as if you were shopping at macy's . only bad thing was all employees are part time workers you will never make 40 hours.
good,"Developed organizational skills, people skills and learned great guest service skills. I enjoyed my coworkers and it was a pleasant atmosphere. Growth is available and encouraged."
good,"I worked in a regional distribution center for many years. In my time with this organization, I witnessed many philosophical shifts in how distribution drives the customer experience. The work was at times physically challenging, but management did an outstanding job educating the warehouse team about changes in processes. They strive to have a fast, fun, and friendly workplace. The pace can be brisk, but it is also possible to have fun in this friendly environment."
good,"Im time at target was great, everyone was friendly and helpful Despite the fast pace environment. Just to some up your words for target it is a thumbs up."
good,"it was great job until we where taken over by a different company and it was ok at first but it did not last , and close the door here in great falls and we had find new work"
good,"Target is a great place to work if you like to be in a fast-paced, ever-evolving, multitasking place to work. You get to work alongside great team members and leaders, they are there to support you and help you provide the best service possible. You are expected to step into news roles at the drop of a hat in order to benefit your team."
good,"Target was my favorite job, i loved meeting new people everyday and working with my team the energy in the store was so positive majority of the days ."
good,A typical day at work consisted of standing at a register ringing things up for customers or finding things for customers that they were unable to find. I would also help customers that were shopping around the store by getting things from the back that were no longer on the shelves. The most enjoyable part was when local restaurants would cater to us on our lunch breaks.
good,"Stocking shelves, pricing, setting endcaps, revisions and sales plans. Working independently. Fast paced and learning different things. Easy to work with people."
good,"Every store is different, my store is pretty nice and has been a good place to work for nearly 5 years. Management changes regularly and sometimes new management isn't the best."
good,"I learned how to be a team player, also my coworkers all cared about each other and wasn’t selfish. There was only one problem it was only a temporary job."
good,Really good vibes from my store. I’ve enjoyed working with a lot of the people over the couple years that I have. You learn a good bit and meet a lot of people. Social interaction is a must and it’s nice honestly. This is great place to work if you wanna move up or just to have as a side job. They definitely look for open availability. You’ll have to a bit flexible for scheduling and there’s always shifts to pick up for extra hours.
good,I would recommend working here if you love retail and have excellent working history. If you don’t have experience in retail don’t bother applying Target does not hire with no experience.
good,All employees typically come into work ready to start the day off and go to work until they find out who the ETL ( Targets managers) were working that day. Team members would dread dealing with certain managers.
good,every target is different so each location will have their own ups and downs. overall its a fun job with good pay. management can be cool at times but rude at others.
good,Great place to work if u like interacting with other people. Team members are very welcoming and have good energy. Managers are kind of stuck up and want everything done there way kind of difficult to change work schedule so I suggest the days and hours u need off to be on your application. But overall good experience
good,Overall a typical workday at Target was coming into either some candy placed in the breakroom are some type of snacks and letters f gratitude on the walls. Clocking in getting an RF scanner and a walkie and hitting the floor. Making my way to the backroom to get a cart and start collecting orders I worked in flexible fulfillment so we had a little team and we were like work-family always looking out for one another. Our lead name was Al and he works just as hard if not harder than anybody else to make sure production flowed. We also encouraged each other along the day to keep positive spirits going. although the downfall is they were a bit unorganized with the manager and often not prepared and rushed a lot of the projects. The hardest part of the job is when some of the managers who don't know how we run our department just come and try to take over and end up messing the whole department up or when you have managers who don't want to work and just hide out in our department. The most enjoyable part of the job is by far the atmosphere its literally like working with family and you now that the people you work with care about you.
good,You will be asked to do a lot but the longer you work there the better you will become at meeting goals. Also be ready for the changes that will come up from store policy changes.
good,It will make a great Part Time for someone that is in school Living at home don't have a lot of Bill and For a Two party Income with no kids and no car note no house note Etc. It a awesome job in that situation.
good,"Considering the fact that it’s such an easy and laid back job it pays pretty well, but with hours being rather sporadic, it’s not going to pay the bills every month."
good,"It was fast paced through out the day. As far as retail goes it was easy. Management was relaxed and always encouraged you to move up. It was very easy to move up from cashier to GSA. "
good,"Very good starter job for high school and college students. It's almost impossible to get fired. Management is pretty unorganized but, they tend to schedule well and flexibly for students and allow student workers to prioritize school. Pay is pretty competitive for retail. I worked there for almost 2 years and got 3+ pay bumps."
good,"Working at Target is a love hate relationship. I personally loved working there, I worked at 4 different stores during my time with the company. There is room to advance if you work for it."
good,"Good people and safe environment  management could be better but good first warehouse job to have"
good,"Early mornings, easy job but definitely hands on type of work. Just stocking before the store opens, and sometimes overnight as well. You work with other team members and also help out in other areas."
good,"Most days i was apart of the closing team straightening up shelves and putting merchandise away while also helping all guests that i could along the way. Would often cover cash registers, electronics, and the customer service area during shifts. Every once in a while would get scheduled to unload truck, cashier, and train a new team member. Really enjoyed working with my peers but as store policies changed it made things a bit more difficult but learned to make it work."
good,"the job is good, the coworkers are amazing, but get ready to work hard every shift you get. if you're not planning on going anywhere for a while, it's a good job for someone who is gonna stick around for a while."
good,"Overall it’s a solid workplace. They expect an efficient worker, someone who really knows what they’re doing, and someone who can get their tasks done."
good,I had a good time working during the holiday season because u see all different types of people especially the fact that it’s everyones family grocery/retail store.
good,No full time possible for my position however management was acceptable. Pay was low except picking up seasonal hours. Fun working atmosphere and caring for employees.
good,Target isn't really a bad company to work for just the hours are not really there well and it depends on which store you work at. The team members you work with are a big part of your job.
good,"•Plan ahead of time to take off "
good,"Awesome awesome awesome awesome "
good,"I have worked at Target for almost 2 years now, and I have to say that it is an ok company to work for. If your a student or a person thats just looking for part-time work, or is looking for a flexible schedule then target is the place for you."
good,it was very enjoyable to work there. i had great management and co workers and the pay is amazing. i really felt welcomed and like it was a safe space to work as it was a very accepting and inviting business.
good,"Flexible hours, nice employees, feels like a family. Good pay. Great food during holidays for employees. Always work as a team. No competition ever and don’t be afraid to ask for help from others we are a TEAM"
good,Work friendly environment that encourages positivity and team work. Team works together to create a guest service positive atmosphere keeping guest and team members a top priority
good,"We alywas have thinks to do you never stop . if finish you work you have help you coworkers."
good,New way of doing things makes no sense . They have changed those whole stores routine.Not enough training. The new hours  made alot of people seek other employment.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Target. I went through many bosses in close to my 12 years there, which made the environment challenging and always changing. A few bosses I had did not have management experience and that was challenging. The environment when it came to advancement was very political and bosses and their bosses had their favorites. Most of my time at Target was positive. My last role as a Vendor Security Analyst was challenging, but I learned a lot. My last boss I had was very difficult to work for as he never had management experience, did not want to hear feedback and his communication style and approachability was not good."
good,"As a Starbucks Barista, my shift at Target consisted of taking orders, ringing customers up, preparing food and drinks, and making sure all customers were pleased. This job consisted of a lot of customer service, and we were required to unpack and put away large supply orders, clean the workplace, and make sure the dining area looked appropriate for guests. This was probably the most stressful job I've ever had because there were times I was yelled at by customers, I was rushed because of time constraints, and there were a few times I had a drink thrown in my face. Because of this experience, I think I learned to have more patience when dealing with customer service and food service, and though it was a stressful environment to work in, I would always love to go back. I met some of my best friends within the two years of working there."
good,"Was fast paced, had to keep on the ball lest you fall behind. Always had to make sure every ones on the same page otherwise everything descends into a clusterfuck. It had its fair share of issues some that never got completly fixed if at all but then again when a company can afford to get rid of you at the drop of a hat you dont complain all to much. Not that that really ever stopped me form doing so but I digress. Most of the employees where fun to be around. So where some of the bosses. Other than that not much else to say about it."
good,"I would have to bet at work by 6 am."
good,Target is a great place to work. If you like costumer service and interacting this is the place for you to be. Managers appreciate your hard work and reward you with gift cards.
good,I like the culture at target. I feel team members are treated fairly and with respect. The work/ life balance could be improved but being it’s retail it’s not the worst.
good,It’s a good place to work for. They are friendly there and treat you like a family. The pay is going up to so thats a plus for there. If you get hired there you will like it
good,I worked there for about a year and got promoted to a team lead. I had to work hard though! I was the team leader at Starbucks then I was moved up to the front lanes
good,"The work may not be difficult, but the amount of time allocated to a worker is far less than what's required. Workers are busy working instead of interacting with guest. It's a shame that Target has become this way. They have been guest oriented before, but now, you're lucky to find an employee available to help you."
good,"A normal day on the job would always consist of showing up, clocking in, and heading out on the floor to start serving our guests with any questions they need answered. I am tasked with making sure my area is nice and organized, as well as stocking the shelves everyday with new product the truck has delivered."
good,"The overall experience working at Targetwas great "
good,"I have mixed feelings often about this place. I mean they liberated me from an absolutely terrible job that I worked at for nearly 20 years. At the same time I feel like its a side grade. I don't like the 'suck it up' when it comes to handling people with mental illnesses, but at the same time they also take it very seriously. I think its person dependent unfortunately."
good,Come with a positive attitude  that will help with the interview  process. Have bubbly  personality also another  availability  is also another awesome  thing to have.
good,"Target is always trying to modernize to stay at the forefront of the retail industry. They constantly strive to make their processes more efficient. Target relies heavily on competent, part-time team members and a sophisticated digital location system for inventory. It is a fun place to work, but long hours and team member issues can be challenging."
good,"Not bad warehouse environment.  10 hour shifts on your feet. Non stop packing. Not bad job, but psychically demanding. Good pay. Some gossip but you can just keep to yourself really."
good,"On a positive, they have an amazing culture with great leaders throughout. On a negative, there is little work/life balance, with most leaders working well over 53 hours each week. Ever increasing work load for OM's, including many tedious administrative tasks that take away from your ability to run the business. Great company to work for, but the job itself isn't for everybody."
good,"Working at Target was good, very relaxed and met a lot of great people. I learned a lot of new skills and they worked with my schedule. However, I believe I was a bit underpaid."
good,"Target is a very fast paced work environment. Yes, it can be very stressful at times, but they do reward you with food and recognition. In general your co-workers are going to be very nice. It helps a lot if you're a quick learner. They're not as flexible with ones availability as one might think. I would not work a second job if you want to work at Target. Overall, it is a positive environment."
good,Overall the day to day responsibilities are fairly straightforward and most of the time help is there for when you need an extra hand. Interacting with customers can range from good to bad but you'll see more of the good than the bad.
good,Supportive management and staff. Good working conditions. Work schedule sometimes demanding. Enjoyed what I did and felt that I was recognized for being a good employee.
good,"For a first job or high school job it's pretty good. They let you move around to different positions which is nice, you weren't stuck just running the cash register. They had incentives for the employees when trying to get customers to sign up for credit cards, and there was nothing difficult about the job."
good,"Overall it was a good job, management wasnt the best, but pay is good. I wish they were more organized with their hours and distributing it out to people. Especially when theyre full time."
good,Target was great! I loved all of my coworkers! The management really started going downhill and it started becoming a lot of stress on all of the employees and that’s why I chose to leave.
good,standing on your feet you have to be in good shape. the staff is friendly and eager to help when needed. love the discount than you receive by being a employee.
good,Enjoyable place to work and Fun Environment Full of Smiles. Low wages and Benefits for Part-Time Employees. Not Much Pay but Great Platform to Start Off at.
good,"My overall experience from working at target was great. I met new people, it wasn’t extremely difficult to get things done and everyone was always helpful."
good,"As a Consumables expert, the experience has been different than most other floor associates. While trained for cashiering, consumables would almost never be called over which may be what people would like. However, be prepared to always have something on the docket as consumables has some of the highest turnover in the store which can lead to not enough time to complete all tasks."
good,Great pay flexible schedules great people to work with really understanding when it comes to events in your outside life very friendly place to work great for grocery shopping after work
good,"I’m a hard worker not afraid of challenge work, willing to learn any job. I’m easy going. I get along with other wokers, Management get along with me has well"
good,Company is very established and profitable. Compensation is above average but expectations are becoming more unrealistic as wages increase. Store teams are being asked to complete much more work with significantly lower amounts of payroll to offset higher starting wages.
good,"My one major complaint, there was allot of senseless competition among stores and or departments.  People competed personally from stores and forgot at times we all worked for Target as a whole."
good,Management is the one that they need to improved on. Like improving hours and distributing fairly hours to all employees. The people you work with had impacted on you for working their for so long...
good,Day to day work at target was always interesting due to the managers and different type of customers that came in and need assistance. I learned how to communicate with different people and work fast and hard throughout my shift.
good,Target is an overall good work environment. Management is fair and employees are respectful. Very flexible with scheduling hours. Target has a variety of benefits that apply after you have been employed for over a year.
good,"Great culture and benefits.  It's hard to move up but not impossible.  You have to be patient and work super hard.  It's a very competitive company."
good,Each day was different you certainly need to be willing to adapt. There was a lot of change in management style. Having simple communication skills is vital when working in customer serivce
good,"Spent majority of time gathering carts from parking lot to fill up both sides"
good,"Target had been one of the companies I have personally always loved. Though I didn’t get to stay with them long, everyone was professional and hard working."
good,"Very basic job, customer service based and strict when it came to talking about anything other than work, even when it was slow. Pay was very low but it was stable employment"
good,Working freight and stocking helping guest.Greet guest at all times. Making sure they feel welcome. Smile at all times assist them guide them into the right direction of the store.
good,If they say full time on the application it really means 20-30 hrs which isn’t enough to live off of. There are generally nice customers. The team leaders are great. It’s good for a temporary position if you’re a student but it’s not a living wage unless you work in office. They are always hiring for a reason...
good,Was  good for the most part but management the past 2 years been horrible seems like the store I was at didn’t care about the important stuff it was more like high school drama luckily most of my coworkers were great
good,This job was not hard by any means. It was simple you had a task and it needed to be done by the end of your shift. sometimes those said tasks where a little much especially around the holidays. The team leaders are okay and they are understandable a-lot of them though.
good,"Glad this place kept me employed during rough time in my life, but didn’t want to stay there forever. Just wasn’t the plan I had for myself. A lot of the staff genuinely care about your wellbeing which can AME up for those who don’t."
good,"Communication between your ETL's and STL (Executive and Store Team Leads) can be rough here, the manager is hands on but can talk a lot. He micromanages but at the same time he is doing his job decently well, Target is trying their best to compete with Walmart and Amazon, so they keep changing the way the store works, that can get stressful for everyone, hours are consistent, you start part time and if you show you are putting in effort, they will move you to full time. (37.75 hours) They do try to help you learn if you show you want too. Work is fast paste and sometimes it feels like they ask you to do to much but in the end, they will still say you did a good job. (In the end, this is retail)"
good,"Once you are taught something and seem to get the hang of it, you're on your own which can be really exciting and challenging or be very difficult. Wages weren't great, hours weren't either."
good,"worked graveyard so always very tired but my team was great and everyone was friendly. Great work experience, managers very professional and helpful. The store was very organized and meeting new people was enjoyable. I shop at this store now because it is still my favorite in Santa Cruz County."
good,"Hands on fast pace work place "
good,"I really liked working here.had to move .transfer was not available for me.moved 60 miles away the crew was organized.everyone knew their job.teamwork and communication was key.management sort of seems lost at times.deployment was a issue.but it always worked out .it was like we as a crew had a routine.everyone knew what they were to do.didnt really ask manager,we just got to it.i really liked the jib,but I had to move. I applied to Macomb county target.waiting......"
good,"It used to be better. For a long time everyone helped each other, but currently the ""Team"" has been divided into little corners by themselves and told not to do anyone else's work. On the other hand, given my experience and ability to work quickly, I’m often asked to do other's work instead of my own anyway."
good,"It’s a great job for hose who enjoy a fast pace and consistency. The hours are not always the best however, you can ask for more hours if need be. Good work environment."
good,"Low stress, yet fast pace work environment.  The other team members are friendly and helpful.  The job training was well explained and easy to get the hang of."
good,working at target helped me develop better organizational skills and the leadership at target was very good. a typical day would be to just resupply our shelves and to keep a neat work environment.
good,"There is always something to do. On your feet the whole day and moving around. Helping out with guests whether it's helping find an item or just asking about their day. Fast, fun, and friendly."
good,Target is a friendly environment. Each day is filled with new challenges. Team supports feedback  and the company is willing to give the extra mile for the comfort of their employees.
good,"If you looking for a part time position without "
good,"Active place for sure. Constant work was there, there was always something to do. work did get repetitive and eventually boring. If dealing with customers, patience is a necessity"
good,"I loved this job so much. I had a lot of fun and I loved all of my coworkers. My only issue with this place is how some of the managers would treat us. For example, I had an 8 hour shift one day and I was really sick (stomach flu that started that day). I kept buying medicine during my breaks but nothing helped. So by my 6th hour, I couldn't anymore so I asked one of my managers if I could go home because I was getting a fever, etc. She threatened me by saying that there is a possibility of me getting fired if I go home. I'm sorry but I am not a robot so I do not understand what Target expects from us. Besides that, and the manager yelling at me for leaning towards the counter for 3 seconds due to my leg hurting when there were NO customers in the store at all, I loved this job. The only annoying thing I must admit about this job too is that if you're a cashier, they pressure you to get a RED card. If one of your customers do not get a card during your shift, then they have a ""talk"" with you. They put so much pressure on you just because no customer wanted a RED card as if it is your fault."
good,"Fast  Friendly And fun "
good,Sometimes the workload is so heavy there are unreasonably high expectations for the amount of time in which that work is expected to be done. They work well with your schedule even though they tell you they want you to be available Friday through Sunday.
good,"Target is a great place to work if you need solid hours, the pay is good, and there’s lots of room for growth and development. Lots of different departments to work in and very enjoyable environment"
good,"Great company to gain some retail experience. The hours were had for me since the shifts were from 4am to 12pm (noon). The opportunity for advancement was presented to those who showed stability, initiative, and ability with a positive attitude."
good,"Target is a very fast yet non-stressful work place. I enjoy going to work. A typical day at target would be going and getting my device and walker talkie. Than meeting up with the team lead of my shift and figuring out what my goals are. After that I get to working until my shift is over. Hardest part of the job would probably be memorizing where everything is at in the store, because every once in a while things get moves around for a new and improved look. The most enjoyable part is working with a team who is fun to be around and happy most of the time."
good,The expectations are constantly changing and the things you know how to do will change and adjust with the rest of the company. You must go in with an open mind and be prepared to be flexible with your job and tasks.
good,"I love working for target!  From the employees to the guests, but they recently promoted me then took away the kind of manager I was without letting anyone know."
good,very casual yet fast paced. little if ever a boring atmosphere. always something to do. low stress. good working environment. immediate supervisors friendly and very fair. some political correct work ideas and policies wayyyyyy out of context with a general ethical feeling of the average person however. enough is enough. pay compensation was reviewed and fairly assessed in the most part. attempts to provide enough working hours was at first fair but the increase in hourly wages was offset by the reduced hours allowed to work so your overall income remained te same even though the hourly wages increased.
good,"Target is a good part time job where you can make friends very easily. It does lack some professionalism, but besides that it is a good place to work at."
good,"Target is a delightful company to work for.  Most stores have a fun filled environment that pushes you to be the best and helps you become a better leader.  There are no other retailers that can offer a workplace culture as nurturing as Targets.  The most challenging obstacle is the lack of overall executive leadership in lower-management salaried positions as most positions are filled from recent college graduates without real proper workplace experience.  Target knows that this is an issue and is doing a great job by replacing a lot of the positions with retail veterans from other large format brick & mortar stores that are slowly closing down.   Target will absolutely be around in 20 years because they make the appropriate operational changes to stay competitive in the constantly evolving retail world.  I highly recommend Target but you'll want to start in a salaried position, moving up from hourly management positions can be difficult due to Target's new modernization model and expectations from team members with the increase in their base hourly pay."
good,"I love Target, it's a wonderful environment with a very friendly staff. As a work environment, Target provides a wide range of training and a very flexible schedule that can be catered to the life and needs of the Team Member"
good,"They care about the employees, but not enough hours and no real benefits without working there for years and years. Not a lot of job advancement either within the company"
good,"If you keep your nose clean, do your work, do not goof around, do not make friends, just come in and do your work, you will do just fine. Because if someone says you're doing something, and you're not, you could be fired."
good,Clock in get comfortable chill for a few minutes then go work for a few hours until the major push is done then its pretty much organizing and customer service and cleaning the work space.
good,Friendly work environment. Worked in csodtlibes department around the  holiday season so could get very hectic at times but overall management kept focused and well organized
good,I enjoyed my time working for this company because it taught me stocking skill and scanning skills. I learned to go by labels and put up displays I did this for almost two years.
good,"From starting as a seasonal team member and moving up over ten years to an executive I have experience all levels there. They work with you and help you get promoted, if you are willing to put in the work. Fun people, Fun place."
good,"It was a very nice environment to work in, the people were friendly, discounted for employees was definitely a plus. It was an over all good experience"
good,"The work environment was great, and the management structure promotes a lot more teamwork than other retail environments I've worked in. The pay isn't anything to write home about, but they make a point of paying more than minimum wage. Cross-training was available, so it was easy to keep things fresh."
good,"I didn't hate working there for the most part, I just ended up wanting to  do something different. The work was hard, but I went in expecting that. As for the pay, I thought it was fair to start. As my time with the company extended I expected more. But overall I didn't have a bad experience working for the company. My former manager became an issue at one point but I wouldn't say he made work unbearable. I just didn't like him."
good,"Target is the place to be if you feel like you aren’t sure where you’re headed with a career and you’re looking for a place to belong for a little while. Target made it easy to seem like I was part of the family of employees, and was forgiving and encouraging even among a slew of mistakes made during my employment. Looking for hours though? Yeah, nope. The only way you’re getting hours is if they stick you somewhere they know you shouldn’t be, or if you beg beg beg beg beg them to train you in a different area. Other than that, it’s a very friendly place to work and the management knows how to operate the stores. I am thankful for my short lived employment with them."
good,"Target's a great place work. Good pay, decent hours, and the other employees are great. The management is great. You are expected to work hard, but not overworked either."
good,"It's a basic job.  Show up, do the work, smile at the guests and everyone will love you.  If you're hoping to come in and advance your way up, Target is not for you.  Many of the employees have been there for decades and they'd have to leave before you'd have a chance.  There's very little turnover at the top (which is good, that means that company is worth working for) but lots and lots at the bottom, so be prepared for that.  If you just need money in your pocket, this is a great job.  If you're looking for more...a part time job at Target offers tons of great benefits, so grab one of the cashier gigs and keep applying for your ""dream job."""
good,It's a fast paced environment that offers plenty of training. I really enjoyed overcoming each challenge. Management will be flexible with you on your schedule if need be.
good,"Management and HR very chill and helpful. HR is kind of tough to get in touch with so its easier to drop by in person. Orientation is a full work day with a lunch, you do get paid for it."
good,"My time at Target was great. I loved my coworkers and management was always approachable. I had a lot of fun but was also challenged and felt good and accomplished with the work I was doing."
good,This job is and can be very demanding and will always be fast paced because of the brand and availability of the store and location. Good job and can be very fun but you have to be willing to work hard.
good,Target had its days where it was okay and had some bad days but the good out weighed the bad and I learned a lot from my managers and made good friends as well but we worked pretty hard.
good,">kind of long at first but once you know what you're doing time flies"
good,"I have worked in well known  big box stores and Target was the best.  Good working atmosphere, understanding team leaders, great merchandise.   No where is perfect."
good,"When I worked at target, I was 16 and I just turned 17 and I was the only minor on the work force which made my expectations for some reason higher than everyone else's. In the end, they fired me because i was doing an ""inadequate"" job when in all actuality, many other people there thought I was one of the hardest workers and did everything I needed to do in order to keep my job."
good,"Typical Retail job,"
good,"Walk into work and look at the area you will be working in that day. Then I would grab a pallet from the back and start stocking shelves until my shift was over. Guests would often come up to you and ask questions, I did my best to answer them in a kind and helpful manner. Once I was called in and placed onto a job I did not know everything about, that was a bit stressful."
good,"Work at Target is very fast paced.   I learned all the customer service roles at the front lanes.  My manager was good,  The hardest part of the job is getting enough hours.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working with people."
good,"When I was working at Target decades ago, it was a simple enough job. They would constantly understaff their departments. I was working while going to school and while friends / relatives had similar jobs at other department stores, they would be able to leave within a half of an hour after the store closed while we were still at work, sometimes HOURS after store closing, to satisfy the needs of the day, whether it was a sale starting the next day or big shots coming in from Minnesota. It could have been a much better job except for the leaving late all the time, I don't know what it is like there today."
good,"Working as a Security Specialist was fun, but there was really no room for growth. Your job was really boring and had to stand by the door like a gate guard."
good,it is a clean quiet job. you would unload the trucks and split into assigned areas and deliver to that part of the store. you would go to your assigned area and stock your are with new products
good,"Everyone's Target experience is different, but I really enjoyed my time there. I got laid off after seasonal, but that doesn't mean I have any ill feelings towards the company. "
good,"Overall working for Target, the experience is phenomenal. Different culture, and different requirements training or adaptability skills. If i had to recommend to any college student a job, it would be Target."
good,It was a job that I really enjoyed and it was nice meeting new people as well as learning how to make the different drinks. The atmosphere was fun and joyful. The other employees were always laughing or making jokes.
good,"Target is a good place to work, however every store and team are different. If you have good leaders and a positive culture, everyone will work as a team."
good,"Long hours and constant challenges, but work can be as fun and as rewarding as you want to make it.  Turnover is high, and holidays are hectic, but a good company to work for."
good,"I love working here, but the hours are not consistent. I won't complain about them, because 1) I know I'm getting paid more than some positions and 2) they are giving hours. I love that they upped the pay but it evens out with hours to what I'd be making with less pay and more hours. I love my co workers, they are absolutely the best and probably some of the best people to work with."
good,"I really did enjoy my time at Target, just wish it paid a bit more and offered a little more flexibility in hours. Overally very good company that I feel tries to take care of it's people."
good,"Go in to work Around 4AM help with unloading to the Trucks in inbound. "
good,"As far as retail Jobs ago, Target is pretty decent. Management can be hit or miss, however workflow, environment, and the team are all very good. Hours are flexible, I can’t speak as far as benefits as I wasn’t there very long, but the HR at my  Store, and additional resources were available. Pay was above average"
good,"Great development plans. Clear goals and direction. If you want to promote, you must be great at interviewing and selling yourself. There is not a position that does not work nights/weekends."
good,"Working in logistics you don't often interact with guests, albeit it will happen from time to time. Most often you work with one or two other logistics team members and just get the job done. Sometimes there is heavy lifting involved but overall it is not a physically demanding position. You do need to be able to keep up with the changing technology but most of the managers, at my store at least, are very good about keeping everyone up to date on changes."
good,We had very good customer service. We would put the guest first. We had very good benefits for the customers. We received employment discounts. We worked as a team.
good,"A typical day at work is you come into a mess most often and then you look the tools you need to begin working usually 10-15 minutes after you start your shift. The company doesn't give you enough time to train people so a lot of times newcomers don't ask enough questions and then when their training weak is over you'll hear a lot of you should know this why don't you know this. When I train you I try to include everything I know and I'm at the point of my career where I know more than most management and even show my supervisors if they don't know how to do something. My mottos are (If I can teach someone how to do something I will) also, it's best for more than one person to know how to fix that problem because you won't always be there to do it."
good,"hard working, very stressful, repetitive."
good,"Unload the truck(s) in first thing in the morning, then stock everything throughout the store. Send excess stock into the backroom to be backstocked. Help with backstock or audit when you have downtime."
good,"Target is a wonderful place to work, especially if you do well in a customer service oriented position. The only downside is that you get scheduled with only 2 weeks notice and its very difficult to rearrange your scheduling around other plans."
good,"great team everyone is very nice there"
good,We had a great team when I worked there. The biggest issue I had was struggling to get enough hours and make enough money. I had to work another job just to bring home enough money.
good,"A day on the front end at Target was pretty pleasant as far as retail went- I enjoyed the variety of tasks, the friendly co-workers, and the opportunities to cross-train. Would definitely recommend it as a first or extra job."
good,"There isn't really a typical a day. Yes, you do have tasks that you are expected to complete everyday like keeping up with customer returns and the fitting room, keeping the floor picked up, and organizing the racks/shelves every night. And some days there is more tasks like on truck days or assisting with cashiering or getting carts from outside."
good,"This job was great when I first started working here. I was excited and ready for a new work experience. They really push RedCards on us and hold it against us when we don't get any but you cant force someone to open up a credit card and that's what corporate doesn't get but they do not care. Our RedCard goal for the week for our store is ridiculous. Our RedCard goal for each day is 15. How are we supposed to open 15 RedCards every day? Other than that non sense, the management is ok. It just depends on who works at your store, I really believe its a person by person basis. I would still recommend people to apply for this job because its not entirely horrible. It has definitely helped me grow as a person, but has also made me hate retail."
good,"I've been working as a Cashier at my local Target for four years now, and it has had highs and lows. I've been offered to work in other positions, of which I had accepted and enjoyed. Others I've denied only from personal preference."
good,Management did struggle a bit when regarding team members schedule. They would try to be flexible with schedules but had moments where people were losing hours and not receiving a full shift.
good,"I love working at target, great pay, and a lot of hours.they worked around your schedule and you can change your availability a much as you pleased.They do not like people just standing around, so find something to do, even if that mean just fixing the isle shelves.I would like to actually go back, but to a different location."
good,Poor management because they don't communicate well with employees in departments. Great positions in the departments but didn't communicate about schedule.
good,"working for Target was an overall great experience, met a lot of great people,sometimes it was a struggle to get hours to work, My team leaders we're really good they pushed us to do the best job we could."
good,"A typical day at work is clearing a 2,000 item truck by a certain timeframe. The workplace culture is semi-relaxed. The hardest part of the job is finding U-boats/flats to replace those that have been taken. The most enjoyable part is joking with the people on the line. Management can be okay unless corporate comes and half the management staff is not trying to be kiss-ups."
good,"The shifts varied because of my school schedule. Target was willing to give me hours based on the schedule. The hardest part of the job was working during the holidays, but it is retail so that is expected."
good,Some days were so fast paced that it was tiresome but I've always made a production numbers.  On slower days they would have me help out other team members catch up.  Management was supportive and would send help when necessary.
good,"Stocking af Target was a job I’d been excited to do, especially since I was ready to make decent money doing something that didn’t involve food. It might have been typical for my department but the turnover was brutal, and most of my issues with the job came from being short-staffed. Coulda been better, coulda been worse."
good,"I really loved working at Target, I loved the guest interaction and working in the community that I lived.  Target is always changing the way that they operate and I no longer fit into their vision."
good,"when working in target, the work was great, hours were great, it was just the co workers and managers that were the problem. the managers discriminate and chose their favorites."
good,A typical day now is very strict. The company rushes employees to finish the work so they can send them home as early as possible 
good,It was a great seasonal employee training was good and they are patient when it comes toworking with new staff. The work atmwagesosphere was calm and accepting. great place to work
good,"I have worked for Target just under two years now and I have to say, despite all the backlash from previous workers, I believe Target is a great first job in the city. There is a competitive nature that arises when there are certain goals set for a quarter, and I live for it. However, there isn't much management throughout the large store due to what seems like overstimulation of tasks to fulfill. By the end of the day, there always seems like there could have been more done, but it just never seems possible to do with the number of people working. It's not the fact that we are short-staffed, it's just that the store seems to always be in a constant flow of development that there isn't any real time to work on developing customer relations. All in all, the store is sustainable and reasonable."
good,"Target is very overwhelming some days, only because once you've shown that you can handle multiple task they start to expect you to do more and more than your job title i feel."
good,"It was a good company to work for, up until I left the company. Target began to hire managers out of college, without any work experience. None the less, management experience. And while I was a department leader (manager). I always had to train people, who were hired to be my boss. And in the end, after cutting back managers. I was running three separate teams, of almost 80 plus people. It was time to move on."
good,"At the end of the seasonal term I was glad to be done working retail, but it was a fine seasonal job. If you are comfortable with retail then it should work out for you."
good,"The job was full time for the holiday season and was a fairly easy and good job. The store was a little disorganized due to the holidays, but management was good and I was offered to stay full time but I had to return to school. Overall a good experience!"
good,"Target isn’t the top best job to have. But it’s definitely not the worst. Management will do everything they possibly can. But they’re just as busy running around the store helping guests. As a cashier, unless it’s holiday season or even back to school, it gets pretty boring. If you aren’t into retail and cash handling then I wouldn’t suggest it. I don’t like that I can’t use my Team Member discount if I pay with my debit card. You have to use cash or the Red card. That’s just my opinion though.  I do like helping guests. I get along with almost everyone I’ve ever helped. They are very pleasant. I wish I can learn new skills though."
good,Speed is essentially all they care about. If you frankly dgaf about life and working then I would not suggest working there. If you're a loner or not a team lover don't work there.
good,"So red and beige is the worst. But this place has some good attributes.... like when you work not cashiering you get to walk around and hang shirts which isn't too bad. So there's anonymity in that. Also management are people, but its still a corporate environment."
good,"Good place to work, i gained a lot of growth and customer service experience.  I learn how to adjust to a fast pace work area and getting tasks done on time."
good,Target was a great place to work. The guests were all very nice except for a couple here and there which is expected. The management was excellent and very open minded.
good,Not a great company to work for long term. The goals and direction can vary from shift to shift and it is difficult to communicate with the team. The management also for the most part has no realistic expectations of how departments run so there is no consistency
good,I have not worked at Target since the late 90's. It was great being able to work with a team and be supported by my management. They were always willing to work with me on my days off since I had little kids at that time.
good,"My location was a ""pilot"" store meaning we tested new process to unload/stock product and run sub departments. Some processes were more efficient than others. Regardless of how well any given process work we were constantly changing. It is tiring and some what discouraging when a process works and they change it. Again, not all locations are like this. Other locations I've had the oppertunity to work at are more relaxed and stable."
good,I liked target it was a good place to work.I juss couldn’t build a career there.They didn’t give any over time and the pay wasn’t that good.The only part that was good was that my manager was a good understanding manager
good,"I work as a baker so my average day starts at 4 am. I set up my station and am able to play music for the first couple hour before the customers arrive. Generally, I follow a bake and prep cycle. I bake off the previous days prepared items and then prep for the next day. This, in general, is a low stress job however depending on your location they may or may not require you to make a little over what is possible in a day therefore making inventory and time management a priority."
good,I love working there just moving unexpectedly really messed it up for me. Company was great to be around. Helping people when they couldnt find things was always a plus.
good,Get the opportunity to work with smart people of different backgrounds on a daily basis.  The hours are the toughest part of the job.  They also struggle with keeping Operations Managers long-term.
good,"I love the people who i work with but I do not get sufficient enough hours to pay my bills. Good place to work for people who go to school, they have flexible hours."
good,"Target is highly competitive when it comes to pay. They pay more than a lot of other jobs starting out. It is a fast paced job center. Focused on customer service and filling floors quickly and safely. It is a great job for people who want to constantly be on the move, not so much for people who move or work at a slower pace."
good,"Target has the nicest group of people, both customers and team members, that I have ever worked with. My main job there is being a cashier, although the most enjoyable part of the job is organizing stock and adding new stock to the shelves."
good,"The job is great and fun but they haven’t been giving lots of hours and some of management could really be improved. Great co workers and helpful as well. Everybody works as a team but like I said, management is mostly the issue there."
good,"The Job was enjoyable. My experience there was to make sure every customer out on the floor was finding everything they needed. It was also my role to make sure that the floor and aisle were clean. I had to make sure that every shipment that needed to go out on the floor was also put out. The enjoyable part about working at this job was you have chance to talk to people, let it be co-worker or customer. The hardest part was trying to maintain school and work. The work place let alone is not a bad place to work at."
good,"Great early leadership job to expose you to challenges and growth that can be applied daily."
good,Target was a very fun place to work. If their pay was better I would love to work there again. Working at Target taught me a lot about building relationships with the people you work with.
good,Target is a workplace with plenty for opportunities for advancement and development. Different departments have their own challenges and benefits but overall is a good company.
good,Good pay compared to other stores. Team member were always ready to help and so were managers. Fells more like family than just co workers. Would recommend anyone to work here
good,If you enjoy giving great customer service and being a part of a team this is a great choice. You also have to be a fast pace worker and willing to help out whenever you are needed.
good,"Current changes in operating model are difficult to manage and rolled out without enough information or payroll."
good,"It's a great place to work and the benefits, pay and the people there really do make it enjoyable. Of course every workplace has their cons and of course during the dead season, you're competing for hours. Management were usually pretty understanding and flexible, and very helpful. But on the occasion there were times where they expected work to be your number one priority and that isn't fair for everyone."
good,"You never know what your day will consist of at Target. You will have your primary work station which you were hired on to do, but it is important to become cross trained in multiple areas in order to maximize the number of hours per week you work by picking up shifts in other areas. You must remember that you're a part of a team, so if you see a fellow team member in need of assistance, it is always wise to lend a hand so the store may deliver its best customer service as tasks will be completed faster, allowing the team member to be able to be more available to the guests. The hardest part of the job may be being approached by a guest regarding a product you know nothing about. your best bet would be to read the packaging or redirect your guest to a team member that can readily assist them. The most enjoyable part of the job may be getting to meet so many new people both guests and fellow team members. You'd be surprised at what YOU can learn from a Target shopper and for those little moments I am grateful."
good,I very much enjoyed my job at Target. The company as a whole is a wonder to work for. I only had issue with my manager who used other as scape goats for her own inadequacies.
good,"Working in team work, work in a fast enviroment and quietly. Help guest witj merchandise requested . Stock merchandise in the correct location . Making sure to finish the most before my shift."
good,"As an exempt employee in retail, it was as expected. the expectation was you work 50 hours a week, give or take. If your workcenter was red, you needed to have a goal and a strategy to get it back to green. Long hours expected to meet goals and expectations.What you put in is what you got out."
good,A typical work day you will get with the LOD and ask them where they want you to start. They will start you on a task then keep you on them until it is time for you to clock out. The skills learned at target were all the retail skills I have now. Management here is great and pretty understanding for the most part. You meet great people and form even better friends.
good,It was okay only thing why I couldn’t stay was hours didn’t line up with my daycare provider and targets understanding so I was forced to quit with being a single parent. Other than that I liked working at target and the atmosphere.
good,"Everyday usually around the evening is when its the most busiest everyday. Work place can be sometimes relaxed, but also depends on the department that you are in."
good,"Overall, I enjoy working at Target. It's not too hard to finish my daily tasks and stay on top of my zone. Helping out customers is fun and often times rewarding. My biggest issue is that the current management for the Target I work at won't respect the hours I requested to work and thus make it harder for me to enjoy work when I have undesirable shifts. There are also some days where I am asked to take on other team members responsibilities and it becomes overwhelming. My coworkers are fun and friendly and the benefits are amazing. If my hours were respected I would say it's the ideal job for students."
good,Good place to work. Lots of  new skills learned on the job. Ability to change work areas. Great managers and lots of long term employees work there. Most enjoyable part of the job is working with team members to complete our work.
good,"I enjoyed my job very much but I feel like they didn't focus enough on training and just threw you into things. However, sometimes they had catered food for the workers so that's nice. And everyone I worked with was very nice!"
good,"Target is a great place to get a part time job while in school or working another full time job,  Compensation could be better considering it is not competitive, but overall the work is simple."
good,"Target was a fun job. I only worked here seasonally part time. They have flexible hours and the pay is typical as a cashier. Since I was only part time seasonal, I did not receive any benefits."
good,This is a very physical job and fast paced. This job felt understaffed and overwhelming.  As with most jobs there is more work than there is time to do it.
good,Target was an excellent job as a college student because it provided me with a flexible schedule. The job was fairly easy overall. I enjoyed my coworkers. Fair wage for the job.
good,"While Target does have some missteps in Q1 and Q2 of the year, Q3 and Q4 give you all the hours you may need.  While the job itself is ideal for a student, as I could not see myself working here my whole life, I can see a student making a good paycheck here even during the slow times of the year.  We sometimes get free lunch during busy weeks (like around Black Friday or Christmas)."
good,Sales were consistent. Everyone got along. Co-workers managed to make sure guests had a great shopping experience. Quiet environment and relaxed setting.
good,"What I learned at target was that it may seem easy to put away clothes and await customers at the dressing  rooms. Putting away the clothes took so much effort and i felt like I needed more of a break when it was finally time.  My most enjoyed time was spending all day in  Target, I mean who doesn't like target :)"
good,"an evening store"
good,"Work was fast-paced and changed frequently, with various tasks to complete that included answering and transferring phone calls, managing the fitting room, working freight, helping guests, zoning the floor, and cashiering."
good,"3/4 12 hour days in a row. Hard on you physically, but pay is amazing. Weekly pay. I had an awful manager that ended up being the reason I left. Could use another break throughout the 12 hr shift"
good,On top of management an workers we had an excellent team to unload an stock as fast as we could an made every aisle look brand new with rotation an letting backroom know what we needed if we didn't see it in the floor.
good,Target provided me with job security and a sense of belonging. The work was fun and there was always work to be done. I really enjoyed my coworkers and my bosses. My only complaint would be that sometimes I felt we were understaffed.
good,"I liked working here, it was a fast paced enviroment and you got paid on how much work you did. The more work you got done the more money you make. The people I worked with were very friendly and helpful to teach me how to get the work done."
good,"Target Offers great benefits However, worklife balance is non existent. You will work nights, weekends, and holidays this is often non negotiable. Its the retail life."
good,"I love the environment. Everyone is very friendly! I love coming into work and not only liking where I work, but  being with coworkers that have become friends."
good,"I absolutely love my job. I come into work in the morning, and I am welcomed with smiles and friendly attitudes. I am giving a specific job and task to do in the 6-8 hours I am there, and I take pride in getting it done. My managers are always so appreciative and make sure to let me know when I am doing a great job. I always feel like I am wanted there, and that means a lot to me. I would recommend to anyone to work there."
good,"I loved working for Target. However, my specific management and human resources team was not receptive towards my concerns while employed. Despite this complaint, the company itself is wonderful."
good,Very well structured company and processes.  Allowed for more straight forward work objectives.  Good overall work experience for first job in high school.
good,"The people who work at Target with me are a good group of people to work with. That goes with management and fellow team members. The only issue I have had is the amount of hours I get. When it was holiday time they got cut for the seasonal workers. And when the seasonal workers were let go the amount of hours I received never went back up, if anything they've been lowered."
good,"Target Pays pretty well.  It pays based on experience.  promotion from within is a focus and if you have a good store manager, it can be a pretty good place to work"
good,depending on what you wanted to due train in could help in other departments to pick up more hours. Was hard to try to  move  up into the company. was a retail job
good,Working at Target while being a full time student was great. Target was very considerate of my schooling and worked around it. Besides that the pay was fair but definitely not enough to live alone in Miami. Hours tend to fluctuate way too often but it was a good place to work.
good,Target is a good place to work to build skills in the retail or logistics world. I feel they pay about level with other retail places of employment. Unfortunately no retail facility pays well. The hours fluctuate daily making it tough to have regular sleep. All in all it's a good place to work.
good,It was laid back as a cart attendant I took care of the bathroom returns and put the hangers up. Mainly I like taking the carts in and putting them in rows it was fast and east self paced no stress or arguements
good,I was happy at first when I first started to work at Target. I was there for about 7 years. We had raises every year and the raises weren't even 3%. It wasn't enough to live off of the way the taxes keep going up and the cost of living rising up as well.
good,Target is a great place to work; they are very organized and structured.  I loved working and interacting with my team as well as the leadership staff.
good,"Was just Ok, no advancement unless upper MGMT but must work unlimited hours "
good,"Really good hours, nice staff and management that helped whenever and wherever needed. Management forgot to tell me when my seasonal position would end, however, leading to me showing up for a day at work only to find out I wasn't needed that day and my job was over."
good,The pay is decent considering the amount of work you do. I worked cashier so I didn't do much. It was a low maintenance job. I wouldn't want to work there again because the pay is definitely not enough for me now but it's a decent place to work.
good,"A typical day at work comprises of just roaming around the store stocking various shelves with different product. Hours are early in the morning, so a large portion of the job is before the store opens. Later halves of shifts comprise of storing and product in the back room or helping customers out on the sales floor. The management and team leaders are very kind. Workers are welcoming, and the overall feeling of the job is relaxed. It can get tedious, but it keeps you busy and constantly moving."
good,This is a great job working at Target! Thanks. Working with my peers is enjoyable. During the time I have worked for them I have learned many new projects.
good,A typical day as a target backroom employee can be stressful with the fast pace that you are expected to be able to provide. Overall the people at target make the job. Knowing you have a place to work where the people there all work together is comforting and keeps everyone level headed.
good,when working at target you are welcomed and treated with care as if it's one big happy family. They have wonderful benefits and great overtime pay. Snackbar built into break rooms with electronic self-checkout smoking area in main break room.
good,"Target was a great work experience, they have a lot to offer but they lack in bringing back great benefits to their employees. there is still a lot of organization that needs to be done within the company."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Target, it was a good company to work for and had a positive culture. The work life balance was really the only issue, as it often is with retail."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of consistently interacting with guests and seeking out opportunities to provide excellent customer service. I primarily learned how to balance providing excellent service with still performing duties such as stocking, processing online orders, cleaning, and cash handling."
good,"i had a seasonal job it was fun, i would work here again. I had more hours before christmas because it was fast paced, 20- 30 hours. After the holidays it was like 5 hours a week, which i cant live off of."
good,"It’s was a fun experience especially for my first job. If ur looking for a good first job, target is. It teaches u a lot of patients with customers and long days"
good,"This was a great place to work. This was my first job, a great one at that! I recommend anyone looking for somewhere flexible and having a great managemy team to work here. Great job for all ages."
good,Very good it paid well. I was only seasonal so after the holidays they laid me off. The job is fun while you get to meet new people and have new experiences.
good,Target is a good place to work at. the environment in general is fun to be around. The co-workers are amazing and hardworking . The guests are very respectful and nice.
good,"Target is willing to work with your scheduled even if you can only work 1 day a week for the minimum shift time of 4 hours. They promote people all the time and you can try different jobs. They don't allow overtime unless you are a lead. They can be slow with accepting a schedule change or a transfer. You also can't use your employee discount unless you have cash, a gift card or a target red card. You cannot use your regular debit card to use your employee discount."
good,I worked there for two years and for the most part I really enjoyed my positions that I was able to get. I did many things during my two year which I believe was phenomenal however tirwards the end of my job we did have issues with hours which ultimately left me to leave.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Target. It provided me many skills and opportunities. the workers were very friendly, and I spent most of my day folding clothes, restocking the floor, and helping guests."
good,I do not think their compensation is competitive.  The human resource department is mostly computerized and not very good an answering specific questions.  Although they seem to want to advance careers in actuality no one really promotes internally.
good,enjoy working there during a busy season.  The pace was just right with there always something to do.  Managers (Mostly) were highly professional and respectful.  A good place to learn about retail done right.
good,Working at target well showed you how a sales industry is you see different types of customers loud crazy rude all types. Working cashier for target help me learn how to deal with stuff like that
good,"Target is a great company. I have enjoyed the passing years being there. There are a lot of benefits and they work really well with your scheduling. If the hours were better and management was better, the rating would be higher."
good,Working with target is great.  Meeting people of different ethnicity widens your experience of dealing with them.  We do appreciate our supervisors who are always there to boost our confidence in every way they can.
good,"Friendly, family friendly work environment. Staff was understanding of health needs for family members that needed to be tended to. Very encouraging work environment."
good,Working with people here is really great. Over the course of the time that i was here i was able to meet people that i knew but never talk to which help me communicate better
good,My direct manager was easy to work with and was always fair when problems arose. The next level of management wasn't always so understanding. They were sometimes quick to rule without knowing the full story
good,"Enjoyed my experience with the company, after my daughter I had a hard time with reliability but overall, I enjoyed the job and pay. One of the best jobs I have had so far"
good,Great environment for development. Fast pace and hands on workplace. Great advancement for customer service skills and perfect if you love consistent work as well as working with people.
good,I was hired as a seasonal position but I enjoyed my time working there. Good pay and flexible hours I was able to be a full time college student and work hours that fit my schedule. Only complaint is that they don’t really train new employees you just learn as you go along.
good,"Paid a good amount, wasn’t much hours after the holiday season. Hard to get hired unless you know someone or have worked at a target previously. Some nice managers some iffy ones. It is worth the pay"
good,Enjoyable job with friendly interesting people and a lot of multi tasking and learning to get things done quickly. Make sure to help customers find what they need.
good,"Let your work ethic speak for itself. You will be recognized for doing right. I've worked for the bullseye over 10 years. My coworkers became family, and I enjoyed working in that environment."
good,"Target is a mostly fast-paced work environment with a variety of jobs with many different focuses. However, the main focus is always on the guests and making sure the store is operating and looking it's best. They have very flexible work hours and often offer food on weekends and holidays. Every year the employees are asked if they want to contribute money from their paychecks to chairity. The managers, leaders, and co-workers make the job what it is."
good,Target cares about people and their differences. They encourage thier team members to be thier own unique selves and to celebrate differences. They encourage giving and volunteering.
good,I have been employe about clsoe to 4 years here. It  first was on full time which then changed to part time basis. You get to get familiarized and more confident with retail environment.
good,I found Target to be a great fit as I had flexible hours. Management was great. Loved being a cashier and being face to face with Customers. Employees were plesant to work with. Store was always clean
good,"Target is a place to have fun, but also have fun & very good expierence. Management is very fun to engage with. They understand when something is an emergency."
good,"great work place, friendly co-workers, positive work environment and  great managers. my time at target has been amazing and i will miss all of my coworkers."
good,"Working retail is always a pain, but working alongside a great team makes it worth it. I loved my Softlines team at Target. It really did feel like family, the hours were okay for a part time job. The duties weren't hard to accomplish. Management was good, as well. HR truly cared for their team"
good,I worked as security for Target it was fun the team I worked with was amazing my only complaint is that you don’t get paid enough to put up with the people you apprehended they will kick punch and spit and your not aloud to even say anything back with out getting in trouble.
good,Target was  good experience with the right amount of training. Hours could improve more and listening to their employees when something went wrong. I did not like how sometimes we had to close and open again the next day. Made great friends and learn alot in the areas
good,"Not a good place to stay, opportunities are available if you are looking for a career in retail. But it will take a long time to get to management...."
good,"A typical day was working here included opening the registers, stocking the check-out lanes and starting up the computers for the day. At the begining of the day it the work was very slow paced but it picked up after a few hours. The management was very helpful and understanding towards the questions you might have and they also gave you positive feedback towards youe work performance. The only negative part of the job was the hours after the holiday season. I went form averaging 30-40 hrs to 14-20 though April."
good,"i have learned in this job how to be nice to people, work in a past pace environtment, the hardest part if only few employees are around, it meansi have to cover every departmen. its a fun place to work also."
good,I learned a lot about retail while working at Target. I also got a promotion within the first month of working there and another promotion a few months later. Overall great community
good,"It was a challenging and rewarding job. I learned more about brand and my own strengths and opps than at any other place I've worked. It is challenging and can be stressful at times, but is a great building block to a successful retail management career. I haven't worked there in about 5 years though."
good,"I worked as a cashier and as a hard lines associate. I liked working here, and my coworkers were a blast to work with. The hardest part was trying to explain to the customers about certain sales."
good,"This establishment was great to work at, there were certain people who worked there that weren't the best, but that is common."
good,Worked in back room and performed stocking and picking of merchandise. Organizational skills are required to perform this job. Also did some sales floor in the beginning.
good,"Target compensated it's employees very well.  However the hours were very long.  The culture was very unprofessional and combative.  Although there were some great people employeed, there were more who didn't pull their weight."
good,great experience working at target. you start to bump heads after awhile with certain leads or managers which you receive in any work source. 10% discount and all employees should be able to receive the REDCard just for working with the company. Benefits took a minute to kick in and weren't worth it sometimes.
good,"I enjoyed helping customers and meeting new people. Had fun with the team I was working with. Job wasn't hard or stressful at all, in fact it was easy and laid back."
good,"It was ok working at target . It was not a hard job at all great co workers also the regular customers but the pay was not to good,  I wished I could of got my hours . The hours were always cut short so made it tough to live of that check"
good,10 hour work days.Work most holidays.Got to roam around warehouse freely as jobs persist.Enviromentally safe and recycle accordingly.Takes a toll on your body after many years of working in this facility.
good,"We pretty much help one another and work as a team. Workload at Target is easy to handle. Floor Team members and Managers are friendly, nice and comfortable to talk with."
good,"Working at Target isn't for everyone, but it worked for me. My coworkers are amazing, the environment was quite inviting and understanding most of the time. The only real issues I had was sometimes the workloads for one person were too large to get done in a single shift, but you couldn't work over 40 hours in a week, and it would bother me when I wasn't able to get all my work done because I was only able to be allowed to work so much in a week. The managers can be hit or miss, but even then they are usually understanding and helpful. Target is definitely stress-inducing, but if you can handle that, you'll be fine working there."
good,"When I worked for Target I did the Customer Service desk,food court, cashiering, and sales floor/fitting room. The only bad part about the job was the hours and not set schedule"
good,Have found Target to be a very flexible place to work.  They have worked with me when life has gotten in the way of work.  I feel like they do appreciate me as an employee most of the time.
good,"I stopped working there because not enough hours were given , I wanted at least 25-30 hours per week to work and I was only getting like 10-12 max time working there."
good,"Target Store in Titusville, FL - is HEAVEN. Excellent management, great opportunities."
good,"Everyone I work with at Target has been very helpful, kind, and patient. Even when things get a little crazy, we all stay calm and work together to get through it. I really appreciate everyone there."
good,Was a good place to work but the constant shift of Manangment was hard for anyone to build any kind of chemistry as a leadership team. Because of that there was a lot of headbutting and miscommunication.
good,Excellent job in the retail sphere. Management deal with a lot of work but the company culture was very excellent. Not ideal if you aren't in for the swinging hours of retail and the service industry
good,Its not a terrible place to work. It has its stressful days but i do enjoy working with the people there. The selection of items they have in the store is vast and intersting. The prices may sometimes seem a little steep but the product ive bought from target have always been reliable.
good,"Overall, working at Target was a positive experience. Of course like any job, it had its flaws but I'm a ""just go with the flow"" sort of person and adapted to requests and responsibilities. Unfortunately I had hoped for a higher salary that I think was the largest downfall. I did however enjoy interacting with the customers and putting a smile on their faces!"
good,"Working here at times was stressful, but in some cases was very rewarding while interacting with customers. If you work here you need to quickly be able to problem solve, need to be able to constantly be on your feet, and need to be able to handle difficult customers."
good,"Working at Target is a Lot of Fun. I have learned a whole lot not only about myself but about the company as well. The atmosphere is a very well rounded Team Environment. There is always a Team Member there to help with whatever questions, comments, or concerns that we may have or come up."
good,"A lot of focus on leadership development and team success. Target is a great way to learn to work as a team as well as develop your skills in project management, leadership, communication, and collaboration."
good,I interned here for about 3 months. staff was amazing and helpful. learned much to get me started for real work. no benefits or discounts when you intern but staff said benefits and pay are above average.
good,"Wonderful experience in retail. Cross trained in all processes to fulfill company needs to make sales and make company thrive. Company focus to be guest centric to service guests at all times of the day and evening.  To assist guests in other ways not just in store, by doing online orders and pick ups at store and drive through to facilitate shopping experience"
good,It was fun to work with people my age who enjoyed their time at work and getting along with others. I was always encouraged to do my best each day and felt important.
good,"The front end roles do require you to be very present. It can be tricky simply due to the fact that you must handle each guest, no matter what their issue might be. Certain days can be frustrating, but it is very fun to engage with coworkers and consistent guests over time."
good,i came in just worked . manager told me what i needed to do. within the appropriate time frame and i had plenty of brakes . Was a very relaxed environment.
good,Cool work place until they dont wont certain people to work there so they short your days then tell you are fired. LODs didnt really know what they was doing but the employees under them try they best to do they work
good,"I worked early morning shift 4 am-12 pm. Target is the best place to work but seems that pay is not as good, They start with $9.00. Environment is pleasant and management is good."
good,"Target is a place you can learn a lot and apply those skills to project work and/or with teams.  It's a highly collaborate environment, almost to a fault at times that can stall decision making.  Building strong relationships and learning how to navigate those relationships with your work is a key to getting work done."
good,They mostly only hire seasonal people but if you manage to get a permanent position it’s a good job. It has good benefits and they promote from the inside so you have growth opportunities.
good,"As a sales floor associate I was tasked with organizing and cleaning shelves as well as occasional stocking of items, pulling items from the back room storage, working at the cash registers and providing general assistance to our guests. "
good,"Target has one of the highest minimum wages  among retail stores, which is, as of this review, $12 per hour. For someone that was in high school and is now in college, this was more than most other jobs offered that would fit in my schedule. "
good,The company does work with your schedule if you have a second job and they are all about customer service so we do our best to make everyone smile and make sure everyone at least finds what they are looking for.
good,"It was a very nice job, with friendly people overall. I learned how to deal with people better and what to do in certain situations. "
good,"its aight. even your best doesnt mean its enough. go to work daily knowing you'll be chewed into for speed issues. if youre any sort of handicap, tough luck, you'll be gone soon enough."
good,"I worked in the backroom and then assisted with the reset of the store at Towson. I changed over to price change at the Towson store and was given a significant decrease in hours so I had to look for a position elsewhere. "
good,I enjoyed my time with Target. Management was focused on team building. Employee recognition program. Great training program. Full time positions were plentiful.
good,"Heavy workday, many clients to attend. Be always alert to help customers with the products they are looking for. Teamwork. Human Resources was very concerned about the fatigue of the employees."
good,Great co-workers and management. Each job has its worth but there are certain jobs that are messier than others. I learn how to be fast and efficient.
good,I enjoyed working at Target! Great pay and flexible schedules. I really wished they focused more on training people. That's how I lost my job. They failed to tell me my responsibilities and what I was not allowed to do. One of the HRs failed to even fire me in person and let somebody else fire me instead.
good,"The team to work with was good, but the management was starting to not communicate with us leadership. Pay was ok with all that I had to do, could of been a little better."
good,"I loved to work with the employees amd the supervisors. They pushed and encouraged you to move up in the company I moved up 2 times in this company I was a cashier, I was a level3 of the children then moved to head cashier. ."
good,"Promotes growth within the company"
good,Over all Target is a great company to work for. They do reward the team by catering lunch and do special treats throughout the month for team members. The earget I worked for was often under staffed in the pricing department though.
good,Target Warehouse is a fr ate place to work with a safe working environment good hours 12 hrs per day 3 days a week only thing is $12 per hour is pretty low for the work you do there
good,It was hard at times but u got use to it. It was also fun at times seeing how fast I could work. I just wish the schedule was more flexible because I am a very busy person
good,"El trabajo es demandante, pero relativamente fácil de comprender"
good,My typical day at target i come in morning to set up the line so we can unload the truck. After the line is setup i unload the truck super sorting by aisles. Finally after the truck is empty and everything is sorted i make sure the line is clean.
good,A typical day at work consisted on unloading trailers and stocking the whole trailer by the end of our shift. The hardest part was the time period. The most enjoyable was free snacks and food.
good,Good way to learn customer service skills and other working skills for future jobs. Management and fellow employees are very kind and understanding. Hardest part of the job would be getting the hours you desire.
good,"It's a fine company, just looking for more. A typical day can be monotonous but they have good training and management allows for many exceptions. The hardest part of the job is working with people who aren't on the same level."
good,"Target is a great place to work with decent benefits and opportunities to grow. They are committed to raising the minimum wage to take care of their employees, but expectations of job performance have increased, which is understandable with pay bump. Culture can differ from store to store, with some stores genuinely encouraging growth and development, and others can be a dead end. If you're willing to cross train in other areas of the store and work with a sense of urgency, you can do more. Sometimes there is not enough recognition and too much coaching, and other times management can be too relaxed in conversations with team members."
good,Great place to work learned  Started as A cashier ended working as a pharmacy technician always had extra hours to work in the customer service was great
good,"As a Team Leader at Target, an average day is mainly going to consist of delegating task amongst your team and maintaining the stores brand. I have learned a lot about different leadership styles and effective ways to manage time for such a high-volume store. "
good,I really enjoyed the short time i worked at target during seasonal employment. All my co-workers and management staff were very personable and helpful.
good,Target is a great place to work. They take care of their employees as far as benefits. Pay rate will be going up to 15hr by 2020 so apply apply apply.
good,"Target was a great learning experience in team-work and time management.  I felt valued as a team member and although it was often hard work, I enjoyed my time there."
good,"Learn many different aspects of retail from stock control to presentation to pricing."
good,"Fast-Paced job, no time to sit around because there was always something to do. A lot is expected of you after you have been there for a few weeks. Projects pile up and if something is not done the previous day, it just adds on to the next day which means working even more hard."
good,"Target is a good company to work for, they are constantly changing to adapt to the world. There are always new things to learn and do, and opportunity to do anything in the store."
good,"Start by making sure your aisles are neat, continue the day with assisting guests making sure their needs are reached and also advising them if they'd like, also making shopping feel as easy as it possibly can be."
good,Target is moving. In a new direction. Total reinvention of itself.  It is very fast paced. Time management is essential. It is a good. Reputable company to work for.
good,"The one I worked at the job was excellent it’s just the manager of the store sucked . He’s very uptight and the whole store was starting to change when I was leaving .. with this company you dont get hours if you’re not in a good Department for example truck day people already know that they’re usually out of there in little less than 4 hours target has this thing where they want the truck unloaded as fast as possible so for hardlines they’re not there that long which results in a low paycheck , now other positions like cashiers , instocks , pricing etc you can have more hours but you can’t make over 40 hours a week they’re really strict on overtime .. they’re honestly getting to the point where they’ll write you up for anything ."
good,"It was a good first job for me"
good,"The culture was fun because of the people, the hours were long and the communication could've been better from top-down. The hardest part of the job was the expectations from HQ to stores."
good,"fun, young culture and vibebrant downtown location"
good,"Job duties were cross functional sometimes which made it interesting. Meetings were meaningful as team members were allowed to discuss issues they have come across as well as solutions. Everyone had a role, but there was an effort placed on everyone understanding what that role meant to the bigger goal. Overall a great experience."
good,"•	Unloaded truck and checked-in merchandise using automated inventory system hand held scanner"
good,Balanced culture that allows you to have a life outside of the office. Strong focus on customer service and finding ways to make the shopping experience more engaging.
good,"I loved working at target while I was there , however if I were to go back I’d like to do something new like stock or fix the clothes. It’s a very relaxed environment!"
good,Target is always trying to improve on they way things are done within their stores. This gives plenty of opportunities to learn new skills and find new ways around new challenges.For a person that is a fast dedicated worker it is an easy place to move up and succeed. Plus you get a team member discount and they supply free food for special occasions busy working times.
good,"It was somewhat fun. You didn't get bothered too much by management about fraternizing, so long as you were making good progress on your tasks. I'd work there again if I had to."
good,Nice place to work but it would be a better place to work if everyone was on the same page as to what is expected. Communication between management and employees could be better. Time really goes by fast. Your ideas are taken into consideration. Withe the management I work with I have learned a lot they are always willing to assist if needed.
good,Can be very stressful and demanding but overall the people are good. There is a high demand for efficiency that can be over shadowed by the necessity for guest satisfaction.
good,"tough work if you can handle it"
good,Target was a good place to work and I gained valuable customer service experience. The management team was willing to work with me and understanding of my needs as an individual.
good,"Your experience is largely derived from the group you are in.  The VP, Directors and Managers run their fiefdoms.  If you have good leaders, the experience is great.  If you have bad leaders, the experience can be miserable.  "
good,I found that working at Target was pretty easy as my coworkers were very respectful and willing to help me when I was confused. The managers were willing to be flexible with my work schedule and asked on multiple occasions how I was doing and how I was finding the work.
good,"A typical day at Target consists of zoning, promoting Target's RedCard restocking shelves and taking cash, credit cards, and checks in exchange for products. I learned how to recruit credit card users by explaining the perks of Target's credit card. Management was always understanding and fair in decision making. The hardest part of the job was convincing people to apply for the RedCard. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to all of the different guests I came across."
good,Target is a great place to work if you’re able to multitask. Some days can be pretty tough because the guests can be cruel. But overall it’s a fun job
good,Working at Target Distribution Center was a great way to gain warehouse experience. I learned a lot about safety and quality. Management changed a lot. I had  eight managers with in two years of working at target.
good,"it was good, i had tons of fun, just tons. I like grapes, peanut butter, and, chips. And their discounts helped me obtain these three things. They are flexible on hours, and good pay."
good,Nice starting job to work at. The workers are nice and the management is there to help when needed. The work is not too bad and you'll be able to move up if they see you have the motivation to stay at Target.
good,"Target is a very fun place to work at. You meet amazing new people. it is a very fast-paced environment, but they offer a lot of help. Management when I was there it was okay, just like any other job they do have favorites. if they don't like you they'll make it really hard to work there."
good,My personal experience in working with Target was a good one. On a regular basis we had managers helping and instructing how to improve. As well as proper help to further promote team productivity on top of overall improvement of the team.
good,"I enjoyed working at target for the time I was there. It was seasonal so it was very fast paced, especially around the hoidays. The downside of working there was the pay, and when it came to a rise it wasn't very much."
good,"It’s a fast-paced environment where we quickly and efficiently scan all items whilst interacting their our guests with a positive attitude. During slow intercessions, we maintain clean and organize our work area to maintain a tidy environment."
good,"Because I have 8 different department, my day is very busy.  At some point each day I try to work with and check in on all my departments.  Sometimes that went well, other days not so well."
good,Was only able to get part time hours unloading trucks and stocking. Managers were very understanding of my needs. Only moved on because I was offered a full time job elsewhere.
good,I liked that I could work weekends and have days off during the week. Being busy was never an issue. One thing I didn't like is that you had to work at least 32 hrs. every week throughout the year in order to get benefits and a lot of people don't qualify which makes it hard to go to the doctor or dentist when you need to.
good,"Pretty good company to work for. Flexible scheduling and all the cross training in various departments you can ask for, which helps you to get hours. The benefits program can be a bit confusing as it is tied to your average weekly hours, which itself gets recalculated quarterly unless yoi change something like get married or have a baby, etc. Then it gets recalculated at that moment and again on the quarter, so sometimes your weekly hours average changes dramatically over a matter of weeks and affects your insurance and pto."
good,i enjoyed working at target but got a bit stressful because they had me switching departments all the time  and got overwhelming. great place to work and the people are extremely friendly.
good,Target is an organization that seeks individuals who are self-expressive and can bring new ideas to the culture of retail. They encourage team work over a competitive work environment. Leadership is often moving at a fast pace which can often lead to stressful work environments.
good,Your feet will hurt but it is a good place to work and most employees are nice. Managers are willing to help you improve. Best warehouse I have worked at.
good,I loved working at Target. Retail is a hard thing to learn and be good at. Takes some dedication to make it. But overall I truly enjoyed my time working with some pretty good people.
good,I would work there again. Nice cool environment with a/c. Also had a nice schedule. Friendly co workers and managers. Plus getting a percentage off of anything is nice.
good,I work the Weekend shift and have yet to work a full 12hr shift.My paychecks are small but they say its because of lack of buisness. management really doesnt bother you
good,"If you life a fast pace job with frequent breaks and your not constantly working this is the job for you. The work is not at all hard once you get used to it. Also they have food and drinks when there is a major football game, they treat their employees well."
good,"Working at Target has proved to be surprisingly nice in the time that I have worked there. Job tasks are easy to learn once some tine has been given to learn the small details of the department in which you work. Busy times at work (weekends, holidays, etc.) are not necessarily stressful but do require quick thinking and fast-paced work ethic. Other employees have proven to be the best part of Target, as co-workers are very nice and assist you when needed. Management is good, but fall short of great or amazing due to a constant lack of communication between each other leading to frequent confusion/mix-ups, such as failing to report a team member calling out of a shift. Overall, working at Target is a great way to accumulate job experience for future jobs, but some may find it lacking, specifically those looking to advance up through management."
good,There was always something to do and new things to learn if you wanted to learn them. Very team oriented. Lots of opportunity to move around and learn all the parts of the store.
good,I enjoyed working for Target but it can differ widely depending on which store you work for and what type of management team you have. It is easy to learn every area of the store and have opportunities for promotion.
good,"Clean and straighten all areas in your department and responding to calls of needing cashiers to the front "
good,It was a fun place to work. I made a couple friends. I would still be working there if I didn't have to move. I really like to break system they have. It really helped break up a slow day.
good,"Compared to my other retail jobs, I would rank Target pretty high. They treat employees pretty well and provide a pretty nice work environment. I thought it was weird you can only get the employee discount if you pay cash, gift card, or Red Card."
good,MY experience at Target was enjoyable. I actually loved waking up and going to work most days. many of the team members were friendly and apart of a team environment. volunteer work was optional. Managers listened and assisted in problem situations. hardest part was the pay at times and dealing with unruly customers. easiest part was greeting and assisting customers. going out your way for someone to show them that they have your undivided attention and team members were always required to be knowledgeable if not knew where to look.
good,"I've worked at two Targets in two different states. Each Target is managed by a STL. One Target was amazing to work at. I generally had free reign to be independent and the hours were decent. The other one however was poorly managed ( found out later the STL and most people were fired) and good luck having hours, I had as little as 13 hours before I left."
good,This is a good place to work if you are just starting out. You have the possibility of advancement if you stay there long enough. Management could use some work and not be so mean.
good,"Even though my time there was short, I have learned a lot from my co-workers and management even when I was sick and out most of the time because of my medical situation."
good,"If you are looking for a role outside of your current pyramid, it is very difficult to get management to take a chance on someone they may not know personally.  Recommendations do not get far unless you are going to continue to advance within pyramid."
good,Target is an excellent place to work part time. I would easily recommend it to anyone looking for a friendly work space and flexible schedule. Small issues with management and co-worker accountibility are easily overlooked.
good,"Working for Target is cool. Everyone is friendly and generous. I enjoy working with my co-workers; we talk, listen to music and work at a nice pace. I would say unloading the truck is the hardest part of the job but also it builds for a good workout as well. Depending on how the boxes and pallets are stacked in the truck determines if your going to have a cool day or a bad one because sometimes the trucks are stacked badly with boxes falling everywhere and having some of the pallets too high to even come off the truck so it takes more work to get them out making the unloading the truck a hassle."
good,"typical day at work- easy going and stressful"
good,Not too much carrier advancement. You have to really kiss butt if you want to. Retail means no weekends/ holidays off. Although Target is closed Christmas and Easter!!!
good,Target was a great place to work the environment was great the people was great good breaks clean bathroom's and lunch rooms you was one big family and everyone got along
good,My work hours schedule make it difficult for me to maintain good family/work life balance and a healthy sleep schedule. Also the commute was long and there was no openings for my position at a Target closer to my home.
good,"Productive and fun workplace environment.A typical day at work would include running back and forth doing different departments such as hard-lines, soft lines, guest service etc. The hardest part of the job was telling a guest no. The most enjoyable part was helping guests get in and out in a timely manner.  Some of the leadership skills I've obtained was watching over a team of 20 plus team members, helping them with any questions or guests needing assistance. Also i would handle petty cash counting drawers at the end of the night. I've also leaned the shipping and receiving part by unloading 2,000 plus piece truck onto palates and flats. Also leaned how to sort threw products and stock them onto the floor. Also leaned how to set new products coming into the store.All the staff there are really nice and welcoming. I've also learned p fresh which is working with frozen food. P-fresh also consists of labeling the products and getting the expired products off the shelf. I've also dealth with clothes which is called soft lines. Soft lines consists of folding and marketing clothes. Target does pride themselves on customer service which is why we call our customers guests. Target teaches to go above and beyond for our guest. Also leaned to increase sales by placing product in better obtainable places. I've also learned how to bring up our red card sales up every week. I've also leaned how to do returns and order pick ups. I've also learned how to sale our beauty products to our guests."
good,Very fast paced and labor intensive. Normally a fairly young work force. Company does try its best to make sure all employees are safe and taken care while on the job.
good,Target is a fun and fast-paced work environment. I was paid more than fairly. The only problem that I had was that it seemed like I wasn't trained very much and then felt bad about having to ask a lot of questions.
good,I suggest this work ethic was good to keep if you can seat yet my job was standing for some period of time while my arms was lifting bags at the same time I have red card with supervisor allowed to give credits.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know the other employees."
good,I started out as a Guest Service Team Leader than became a Starbucks Team Leader. I had a great leader and mentor in my Store Team Leader (Store Manager). After growing in my position I transferred out of state and became an Asset Protection Team Leader. I loved the culture and work/life balance that Target provided.
good,"Logistics Backroom maintains product invetory and product orginazation not displayed on the sales floor. The Backroom team is responsible for keeping product organized in the system and backroom for ease of location and accessibility. The work consists of picking, pulling, stocking and auditing of product in or from allocated areas."
good,"Target was challenging and fast passed, and the company was constantly changing and adapting to the industry. I only left because I wanted to seek new opportunities in business."
good,"I liked working there. The work was fair and most of the employees were fine, but you are usually let go at the end of the season. There were high hopes but they only kept maybe one of the 50 or so people that were hired."
good,"I loved working at target, just sadly it was only seasonal. It was a fast paced environment. I worked in the starbucks most the time so I made drinks for customers"
good,"Left job due to the lack of stable hours. Also accepted a PT time elsewhere and Human resources was unable to work with reduced avalibility. Also unless a doctor's note was received you would be standing for your shift. I also had trouble receiving pay for a berevement day, it took four paychecks and a call to coporate for me to receive the pay I was entitled to by company standreds. The up and down of hours avalible to work made bugeting really hard. A zero tolerance policy for attendance during Holiday Rush (November- January) Hours available were often based on sales for the previous year and how many customers you were able to sign up for their credit card. Your raise and call outs highly effect pay raises that were given in April, but did not take effect until June. In order to advance you had to give up a workable job- family balance."
good,"Working at Target gives you as an employee opportunities since every position is specific, but if you express to the management your desire to be cross-trained it can be easily done and grants employees more hours. You should be comfortable and open to talking to customers and willing to work for long periods on your feet. entry level pay wage per hour for all positions starts at $12."
good,"I worked at Target while I was  in high school. It was a great job for me, since I was an athlete and was able to schedule around practices and games."
good,"I was hired as a cashier but was simultaneously trained at the Guest Service Desk and Self-Checkout. Then we were frequently short staffed in the food area so I was put in as backup with little to no training in the Cafe and Starbucks. While I appreciated the confidence in my skills, I was a bit overwhelmed and under-appreciated for my resilience. I also was supposed to work a cashier shift one day and was thrown into hardlines instead and was not trained in that area. Overall, most of managers were wonderful and my team members were great. My hours and availability were hard to change for my school schedule each semester, given I needed weeks in advance and I didn't get my schedule that far ahead and had some conflicts and issues that were out of my control, even when I would discuss my issue with a manager beforehand. That soon led to my resignation because my managers, my hours, and my school schedule would not get on the same page and it became too much for me."
good,"Always good for teens who need to get a head start in the work place. Co workers get along, guests a always happy and the pay is really good for the work."
good,"Good paying job, but does expect a lot, great place for advancement, if you help them they will help you, Flexbile scheduling, good values, somedays it does expect a lot from each team member"
good,I showed interest in learning many different areas and the management was supportive in my growth in the company. It is easy to excel by doing a good job and being a valuable employee.
good,"My Target has a fantastic team, but we’re quite short handed, which makes completing my tasks overwhelming. HR and management are very present and care. They’re the best."
good,"The management takes some time to get used to. Their jobs are very demanding and can come off distant and rude, and while some might be that way personally, the management still does a great job taking care of you. Very reachable, yet high standards are set for every employee, and customer service is always top priority. You won't get reprimanded if you don't finish your tasks, as long as guests are coming first. I've made life long friendships with my old coworkers. Target sure hires very amazing individuals."
good,"Typical day is busy and can sometimes be very stressful. I learned how to balance the crazy to do list and accept that we can't do everything on the list, everyday. Management was great! Hardest part is trying to find the time to do everything and keeping up with reports as you are a very stationary team leader and abandoning your department for even one minute impacts the business. Having a great team."
good,I advanced fast in this job and learned a lot of departments. the early morning shift became my family away from my family and we succeeded and failed together. management was working with us and always supported as the hole time. pay increases were nice and they paid extra during night store shifts as well as during holidays.
good,"Always new projects, learning new development, coaching team members on performance, Helping guest first before anything, fast service in the registers"
good,"It was a pretty average job. I worked at a Super Target and it was EXTREMELY UNDERSTAFFED. which caused a lot of daily extra stress, It was clear that there was something wrong with the management. Other than that it was a good paying job, with breaks, and the work wasn't that bad."
good,"Great place to work and shop. I enjoyed my time working for this company. They had excellent benefits all around health, vision, 401k match. I planned great community events."
good,"Your team is the lifeblood and heartbeat of your store, with that said you are responsible for all of them.  The strongest and the weakest links with whatever process you are in charge of so it is imperative to alway make sure you are developing and training your teams to be the best that they can personally be in whatever form that may look like."
good,The hardest part of this job are the long and tough hours. For the first month the work is mostly manual labor until you are certified to use the heavy machinery. The pay is very good and makes the tough work days worthwhile.
good,Target is a good company to work for. There is a lot of fun days HR plans for the employees. For example forget your lunch day. they provide you lunch.
good,"typically early work, un loading product and cleaning."
good,"An excellent place to work should you be interested in the retail industry. The culture is great among team members and a diverse work place. While quick paced, there are plenty of options to choose different positions to train in after a probation period, so you will never be stuck solely in one position."
good,The company itself is a great place to work. for but the management at this store was awful and many other employees complained about it too. Other than that the best job I've had yet.
good,"Great management and excellent pay. The only thing that could change is the work load. They over work the people there to do too many doors at one time, expecting to do a good job while under a lot of stress"
good,"Target is a place where you can succeed if you are willing to work very hard, be open to cross-training and willing to learn new things.  The base salary is good with plans to be even better by 2020.  The management is fair and inclusive, but their help is limited to the constraints of the company's initiatives which right now are major.  There is a lot of change happening in order for them to stay competitive and ""in business"" so one must be ready and have an open mind and willingness to move around."
good,"I worked at Target seasonally; it was very fast paced and sometimes chaotic. The hours were crazy and the customers were demanding and distrustful. However, this was to be expected from a big retail chain, especially during the holiday season."
good,"Customer service rep"
good,I enjoyed working at Target.  People were nice and helpful.  There was possibilities for advancement if desired.  Target was a fun  place to work. I would definitely recommend it to anyone for employment.
good,"hardest part of job is trying to keep up with production when working several different functions. Several outside event such as Senior Holiday shopping, volunteer work for United Way and Special Olympics. Many company celebrations throughout year such as 4th of July."
good,our role was to pull merchandise from stock room and stage it in the designated areas throughout the store. After pulling merchandise what was left over from the days pulls had to be scanned back into the system and put back on the shelves in the stockroom.
good,"Management was really fair to employees, they expected good work, but wasn't too harsh on anyone who might not have done as well. Everyone worked together to get big jobs done, so everyone knew a little bit about the whole store, as well as their own department. I always felt comfortable asking for help, because that was a big part of being a Team Member there. One drawback, however, was that because I had said I was available at any time when I applied, my schedule was incredibly inconsistent, almost every day was at a different time and my hours per week fluctuated, which made it difficult to plan for things in advance of that week's schedule."
good,"Working here was stressful for me as an individual with social anxiety. Working with that volume of people was difficult. The other workers were nice, supportive and helpful. The people above me (like HR) were extremely supportive and helpful. That made working there worth the stress, for the most part."
good,Morning meeting to discuss what happened with the the shift before us and how they did. Then we go over what is expected for us. They let us know what needs to be done and what is expected to get done.
good,"This was my first job and I enjoyed it. I worked good hours, and was still able to go to school without being swamped. At teams, it could be slow and not a lot would happen, which kind of sucked, but usually it went by fast and you get multiple breaks for long shifts."
good,"fast paced and fun. a typical day at work - review business metrics for opportunities. plan to remove gaps, recognize team on successes and mentor/ coach leaders reporting to me."
good,never really had anything bad to say about Target just found a better opportunity for me and my family elsewhere. Hours were good and management was very open and honest about the direction our store was going
good,great for getting experience. mangement is not the best. most of the team members are pretty friendly.the pay for part time is okay. a person would have to work full time to make ins meat
good,"I went to work everyday motivated.."
good,Target is a good place to start out for a job. They offer you options of day or night shifts. Overnight shifts as well. They will work with you with your school schedule if they have the open job placements to do so.
good,It's a good company to work for. You can move up just takes sometime and hard work. The hardest part of the job is there are a lot of supervisors pulling you in different directions it can cause confusion. Assisting the guest that come into the store and helping them to find the thing they need and want is very rewarding.
good,"I like the other team members I work with as well as most of the managers. A few of the managers are more difficult to get along with sometimes, but never too bad. Most of the jobs there are relatively easy to pick up on and understand."
good,This is obviously an entry level job. It's got its issues but it is a fairly easy job once you know the ropes. From flow you are able and given the option to branch out into other departments if you show the right working characteristics.
good,"A typical day at work was filled with surprises. You never know what type of guest you were going to have to assist. You had the opportunity to work different areas in one day. I could be a cashier, phone operator, guest service representative, and price accuracy team all in a days work."
good,"It's a fun workplace, honestly. Everyone is treated with respect and everyone is more than willing to teach us how to work at our jobs better. The managers are always willing to help, and everyone is talking and coordinating with one another. My job is to just come in and help unload the truck, and help with other stuff if I have some time on hand. The hardest part of the job has to be some of the products we get, some are covered with so much plastic and whatnot, that it takes a while to get to it, but the most enjoyable part: the employees, as in everyone is helpful."
good,"This was my first job and it was fun. Great work environment, easy going, and you get to meet a lot of people. I just did't like how crazy around the holidays."
good,"On a day to day basis, you have work to do at this job. They is always something to do when you come into work. Whether that be working in your assigned area or helping in another area. Its usually always busy and there is always team work happening to help each and every guest find what they need. The hardest part about the job is working a area by yourself on a busy day and being called for multiple things. But for the most part, its a good job to have."
good,"Target is a nice place to have a summer job. Hours can be a little hard to come by and overtime is not allowed, but it is not extremely difficult to get 40 hours in. There is a strong healthy work community that makes working there better than most other organizations I have worked for. If you are interested in becoming part of the management team it is not overly hard to do. However, eventually if that is the route you want to take you will likely have to relocate for both training and future positions."
good,Work life Balance is the reason I left. The work itself was not bad. You will work hard and you will work a lot. They pay well and promote within for people with a degree.
good,"This job was a stepping stone job for me, I was a logistics team member, manuel labor was heavily included into the job. Collaborated with other employees to achieve goal, and to finish dead lines"
good,"Was great for a temporary job, worked with some very sweet long term employees who were very helpful whenever I had questions.  Management was ready when you had any problems."
good,"I am highly customer-oriented. This position enabled me the opportunity to leverage that."
good,The job itself was very easy if you followed the training you received. Most of the job is making sure the store stays cleaned up and pushing up-sales when possible.
good,"Fun staff of managers that didn't mind you completing your work without micromanaging."
good,"Good training program for new leaders to the company. Well thought out trainers and mentors. Fun working environment unique to each store. "
good,Well structured with assigned duties. The management was very east to work with. The most difficult part of the job was keeping up with the pace of the work.
good,Great place to work and feel great about it at the end of the day.  It might get stressful during the holiday season but you’ll not regret it too long.
good,"Loved the job but had to go for medical reason would go back if they gave me another chance, employees are like family and some of the GL's listen some dont.  Pay is good and benefits are excellent."
good,"Target is retail. It has all the pro's and con's of that field. They encourage teamwork and a positive attitude toward co-workers as well as customers. The stores can become very stressful during peak seasons with the workers stretched too thin and in off season hours can become scarce, but again, this is retail in general. The one thing that sets Target apart as a retail business is the pyramid structure extending all the way to the CEO. Info can get lost in the layers of the pyramid as it is not uncommon for a single store to need to go through executives as high as the state level just to make a tiny change in the store's personal work structure. The top of the pyramid even controls the individual stores temperatures."
good,"My advice for Packers: "
good,"Relaxed, answering any questions guests have about products. Management will teach you whatever they would like you to do. Hardest part is dealing with rude guests."
good,I enjoy working there. You learn a lot about being a team player. The manager is good to work for. I really enjoy the interaction with the guests. It can get hectic in the busy months.
good,"Was a fun fast paced job, that kept me on my feet and always doing something. Overseeing employees and making sure that everything is entered and rang up properly."
good,"Working at target is nice, the pacing of the job isn't too fast nor to slow. The workers are very friendly and nice to one another and work well with each other"
good,Working with sales is always a challenge. You need to be flexible in your schedule because it changes daily. You have to be adaptable to any and all situations.
good,"Target is very competitive in retail and customer service.  It is a fast, fun and friendly place to work."
good,"I have nothing negative to say honestly! For the job function, the pay is reasonable. Everyone there was really perky and generally sweet. The discount was another sweet perk. It's a good place to get started or work while in college. It's laid back, and it's easy work. I can't emphasize enough how happy the environment was. I miss it every day!"
good,Target is a very fun place to work with an opportunity to meet a lot of great people. The work isn’t very stressful and easy to learn. They only downside really is if you want more than a few hours a day.
good,"great place to work if you enjoy meeting new people every day. all team members have great friendly attitudes, and are great at training you when you're new."
good,I enjoyed working under the management assigned to me and the employees. It was a great working environment and I thought that I was treated fairly. It was an overall great experience.
good,The job was very easy but at times can be a work full to handle. The shifts are random there not as good because they will call you anytime to work. Night shifts are hard because the store closes late. Overall its a good part time but they have low hours.
good,If I didn't work at Starbucks I'm sure I would have stayed with Target. The people are easy to work with and there always seems to be some sort of food in the break room.
good,They expect you to work. This is not the job for a lazy person. Team work is a must. Clean work environment. Open door policy so you can talk to the management.  Must walk a lot and also provide customer care.
good,"I enjoyed my job at target, it was a friendly place to work. I ended up leaving for medical reasons but they will not rehire me because I quit suddenly due to my illness."
good,I liked the customer service part of the work.  It was enjoyable to learn the beverages. The coworkers were mostly good. Some of the management didn't communicate effectively.
good,"Fair treatment of all levels of employees, very understanding management, great managers, no one breathes down your neck, no impossible tasks ever given. At least one day a week, they provide meals or snacks in the employee break room. Very low stress."
good,"•	Keep area  safe, clean, and organized "
good,It was alright. It was kind of stressful on my body. You stand on your feet for 11 hours. You work a total of 12 hours but get 2 paid thirty minute breaks. When its peak season its very stressful.
good,"Highly efficient, good culture, healthy environment,good benefits. Target has a lot of potential, there are a lot of positives about this company. Its a good place to work, can be very stressful at times."
good,Good co-workers. Not stressful. Opportunity to cultivate family. Understanding on the part of co-workers and supervisors. Accessible management to discuss HR issues and requests for time off.
good,Everyone at the Watsonville Target is friendly and helpful and I enjoyed working with them. All the team leads I worked under were super helpful and really good about explaining things they wanted you to do.
good,It was a fun and fast paced job. I had really cool co-workers and my supervisors were just as cool. Typical day would be practically non-stop customers and enjoyable conversations as I would ring them up.
good,"great   place   to   work   for   a   first   job   if your just starting out or as a second job,management   has a great understanding of work/ life balance"
good,"Target is a great company to work for, they really care about their employees and also try to help with things that go in ones personal life. I would recommend to work at target."
good,"I worked in Store Management. The company is exciting and forward thinking. However the in store work is demanding and requires a lot of hours, weekends and holidays."
good,"Good company to work for. Everyone is friendly and willing to help. You must like problem solving and a lot of customer engagement, as the company is very into helping out guests to the fullest potential. It is a good environment, but as in all retail hours fluctuate based on season."
good,Overall I.T was a great experience. The graveyard shift will test your mental toughness slightly at first but once your body gets used to being up during the night work is a breeze and everybody just gets work done no games no childish behavior or disrespect. Great company
good,It was nice to be able to work so close to my High school and it was very convenient in that I was able to work with friends and they were very flexible with my hours.
good,I love retail and Target made me love it more but the management in my location was very bias. They play favorites and don't give vacation after it was promised.
good,"US retailer, turning around after years of profit slump. Recently started doing well in sales, visionary management, working hard to make Target #1."
good,"Guest interaction was a highlight of my experience at target. The workload I was given was easy, I felt I could do more for the company if allotted the responsibility"
good,"Target is very flexible with allowing you time off for appointments, family situations. Staff is great to work with, as well as upper management/ district management, However you don't have many chances of moving up or into another department."
good,"I am a trainer and I love to train new people that come in. One thing I don’t like is that you need to back up cashier and I can’t get my work done. I have many requirements of stuff I need to do everyday when I work, I get called u or back up cashier and I usually am up there for quite some time. The management is half okay and half not good."
good,"Typical day for me usually involved coming in and checking emails and paperwork and creating a plan for what I wanted the building to achieve during the day. Spend the morning checking in with the teams throughout the building while I was LOD that day. If I was not LOD I usually focused on logistics activities like helping run the trucks, run the backrooms, or help set and push planogramed areas."
good,"I love my coworkers and most of the managers even though I have outlived most of them. The discounts are not good, we get 10% but only if we use cash or our red card."
good,"Target is a great place to work at. The atmosphere is that of they care, both for the guests but also for those of you that work there. The only real issues were the scheduling or lack there of. Upper Management would hire more seasonal workers than they had the need for causing everyone's hours to be cut."
good,Management was very supportive and offered many levels of training if you have the desire to learn. You are required to keep busy at all times and work at a fast pace.
good,I was good working at target but the hours there was to little and coach did not like me but i worker very hard and did not miss work only when i was sick but i want to work that again.
good,Good job alot of different duties I handled. From cashier to janitorial services to collecting carts. Fun lively atmosphere. With really no complaints about management.
good,Great leadership and work environment. Plenty of opportunity for hours. Not much in terms of advancement opportunities. Overall the culture and experience was positive.
good,"Target was an accommodating place to work all around. Long as you didn't get on the management's bad side, they treated you with human dignity and respect. Even if you got on their bad side as what happened to some of my coworkers, they still were extremely tactful and considerate. "
good,Works as a team. Have meetings every month on how we can improve. Makes sure everyone is trained on different tasks. The locations for the items can be more organized.
good,"I went in to interview for cashier position which is what i applied for, the manager who interviewed me was impressed by the answers to the interview questions and offered me the reverse logistics position which said more money"
good,"The hardest part was the customers. Be prepared to be yelled at and accused of ridiculous things."
good,I enjoyed working in a different aspect of customer service at Target. I did enjoy that the job was actually challenging and management actually managed. However it is very procedural and that can get tedious at times.
good,"logistics, unload trucks and push product to the floor, in a timely manner. work environment was very safe and efficient. the hard part of the job was sometimes meeting the time, deadline. The best part was feeling you accomplished something."
good,"Fun Friendnly coworkers, fun working cashier and on the sales floor being able to see the new clothes and shoes and accessories that came out and being able to work with customers on the Sales foor"
good,"The workplace was fun because I enjoyed the people I was around."
good,"Work load was bit more than fair, I enjoyed every day I was there. Management was a bit lacking on informing me about daily duties. Not much training on first few days."
good,"target was a good place to work for and to get your foot into the working world. a typical day working as a cashier would be ringing up guests items, bagging them, and correctly handle the money or checks."
good,"My backroom position at target was very eventful, and satisfactory. I was often left alone for most of my shifts in the backroom as more team members were generally not needed. I would spend my day backstocking product. I would also prepare product for going out onto the sales floor as well as fulfill online orders. I was constantly moving and had something to do, and it was a very satisfying position."
good,"Great work environment, good communication between employees, repetitive but simple work days. I learned to always find ways to stay busy and productive."
good,"Some can get away with not doing their job, while you have to pick up all the slack. I love Target, but my hours have been drastically cut and workers who don't have work ethic just don't work well together, period."
good,Always busy. Good training. Management is ensures there is enough coverage to service the public. Great place to work as a student or part time employee.
good,Target is a nice place to work and they are very flexible with scheduling if you are in school or have family. There are many chances to learn different areas and become a well rounded team member.
good,Stocked floor with merchandise. Processed damage merchandise. Assisted customers and other team members. Assisted in maintaining the look of the shelves on the floor.
good,My work Days were easy and went by quickly since there was always something to do. The managers were sure to let you know when you were doing a good job and I didn't find anything about my experience difficult. If I had any questions they were sure to clue me in and show how things were done if needed.
good,"At I was working as a customer service and sales agent and the experience was good. I was also doing merchandising in the store"
good,The managers are very supportive to their team members but often give more work than is possible to get done in a shift. Upbeat and friendly people to work with and the job is easy.
good,Very Good Part Time job with decent pay. It seems that lots of people that want to work have to continually remind those in charge because there is a little bit of a senority syndrome.
good,"*Unload boxes from truck, organize merchandise by department and place on sales floor."
good,I loved working there because everyone one is professional and everyone is willing to be a hard worker and it's all about the guest there at target which is an amazing thing. Target is a good place to work at because they work with your schedule and it is a peaceful job and they really do care about their employees.
good,The Job included going out and getting carts while following instructions. Such as when you should return to the front lanes to be a cashier and assist the customers in their exiting experience at the company.
good,"The team is open-minded-cooperative, and friendly. The atmosphere is light and team members have creative freedom with a lot of the work. Managers are friendly and supportive."
good,"Its a very fast paced work place, very productive in the processing of the truck. I learned theres a lot that goes into a big retail store. I think the hardest part about the job was learning the way there daily operations work. The break times and lunches were the most enjoyable. We got to recolaborate what needed done that day."
good,I love working here I just need more hours to actually survive. There doesn't seem to be that much of advancement for everyone so if you hit the plateau your just there. its a great beginning job.
good,"On a typical day at work I was responsible for zoning and restocking aisles that my manager wanted me to do. I would use a smart device called a Zebra when helping find products for customers and when zoning. Employees will use a walkie to ask for location, to ask for extra help, and etc. The only bad part of the job is that there aren't a lot of hours so you will have to pick up shifts."
good,Every job has its flaws but for the most part I really enjoyed my time at target. the pay is fair and you have the chance to do a lot of different jobs and things
good,During the off season the workload is not that difficult but it will all hit you once fourth quarter hits. The work environment is nice but can be difficult at time to understand exactly what upper management is trying to do. Been with target for four years now and while the store changes a lot the workload has the same pattern every year.
good,It is a good first job that got me ready for real work life. I would recommend this to people who just graduated high school or for people in college.
good,The job is pretty easy and can be learned really fast but doesnt have that many benefits depending on your position. It's fun as the team you are with are usually easy to communicate with and are typically fun to be with. Target being retail does fluctuate in how busy it is as it depends on what time of year it is.
good,"Working in the Target warehouse, one must expect a hard fast paced environment. You must meet deadlines every shift. The position was overnight which was very hard. There was not a steady work place culture as majority of the overnight employees chose to focus on working and leaving rather than any sort of co worker bonding."
good,"A steady pace and quick thinking environment.  Your on your feet at all times, everyone is friendly and helpful.  Communication with management is key."
good,Target sets you up with the skills needed for great Guest service. They refer to customers as GUESTS and the guests are always first. Working with target you will learn new things and meet a lot new people from different ethnicities.
good,It has always been fun to work there but i need more hours and at this Target i can not get the hours i need to make my bills. So I am looking for a job that i can enjoy working at
good,"At target the day was mostly the same the hardest part of the job was remembering produce barcodes."
good,I would recommend Target. As a seasonal employee I experienced a positive work environment. I learned that Target values their guests by maintaining a orderly store order and safe guest shopping experience.
good,It was a great job to have during college. I do wish they would have kept me on after my seasonal employment ended. The work environment is fast paced and productive. The leadership is very supportive.
good,A decent job with decent pay. It can be a bit repetitive but you make great friends and have customers that come in regularly know you by name. Its a great place to start up.
good,"what i learned at super target was how to do a lot of things at once i learned about retailing shipping stocking a typical day was working in the candy section, helping people, ordering items in the store the hardest part was getting to work at 3 and 4 in the morning the most enjoyable part was helping people find things they need espically on holidays"
good,multi-task is a big part of that job .most of management are very helpful and want you to do better and advance yourself in that company the hardest part of this job was trying to stay  because they cut hours bad  sometimes during the year like after christmas
good,It was a fun place to work. Management was friendly. Although the lack of advancement opportunity was poor. Difficult to gain knowledge in othr departments.
good,Job was cool for me at the time when I was relocating but the pay did not fit my needs but it would be perfect for a high school or college student that needs a little extra money.
good,"I appreciate the employees and management I am surrounded by as they create a fun, friendly and safe environment in the workplace. I have learnt many skills and also built on the skills I previously had.  When the store begins to become busy, it can be hard to complete the current task given by management. Most enjoyable part of the job is being able to have fun with colleague whilst still getting the set task complete. Target is a great first job to have."
good,I loved this company and working for the leadership however the distance for the jobs available make it difficult. I prefer closer to home and more involved in sales.
good,My typical day at work consisted of once I arrived I would clock in. Then I would locate my supervisor to see if there are any tasks that would need to complete. Once I completed those then I would do the daily tasks that consisted of straightening and putting away merchandise. I would also greet and answer any questions that were asked of by the guests in the store. I would continually do this until my shift was complete then I would check in with my supervisor to see if anything else if asked of me before I would leave.
good,Unloading trucks and organizing product by type and section of the store. Team work was great and management was hands on and motivating as the team stocked.
good,"Target is a very satisfying place to work.There is opportunity for cross training and learning new skills.if the position were more supervisory and the job full time,I would retire from Target."
good,It's a fun place to work but in my store there is no display of job culture.  I never know what's going on as far as benefits enrollment or if the management team is doing anything fun for the employees until it's already done.
good,Target protects their employees and advocates for them to get fair and equal rights. The environment is quick paced as the goals that were set by corporate do not allow for any types of delays. The customers' needs come first.
good,"This job taught me a lot of things within 3 months. I met amazing coworkers and customer. I was really sad that my seasonal time had been cut and was laid off because I really loved this job. It would be stressful sometimes because they expect you do cart loads of work in a short matter of time and they discounts weren't great but, everything else was great."
good,"Hard work, can be fun but can be stressful. Schedules are flexible to the individuals personal life.Ability to cross train and learn different areas of the store."
good,"I enjoy working at Target, the people are great. At times it can be stressful especially during the holiday season, but overall it is a lot of fun. The discounts are nice too!"
good,"Friendly environment, simple work, fast paced and busy. Would recommend to someone who enjoys helping customers with their needs. Management to mostly fair."
good,"The co-worker is very friendli"
good,"The ratings I gave is only based on the store at which i’ve worked. It could be different at another store. Target is cool, but the discount sucks. The environment customer wise was great."
good,Constant work. Managers iffy at times they usually change often. The breaks are long. The culture is good target preaches their mission a lot but Randstad was more relaxed. BUT don't get it confused you are a temp not TARGET employee and target will make sure you know this. Pay is good depending on what stage at life your in. I was 20 with a 2 bed apartment in an okay neighborhood in Suffolk.
good,"Working at target had to be one of the funnest jobs. It was enjoyable to interact with guests. Work was smooth but it sucked during the holidays."
good,"If you are looking for full time do not waste your time getting hired in a seasonal position, I recommend you wait for them to hire for a regular position because at seasonal they kept the few who was related to someone."
good,"It a good working environment for both employees and employers, getting to meet people everyday is a good experience in working with communication and customer service."
good,Always kept you moving. There is never a dull moment. The hardest part of the job is waking up early. The most enjoyable are the benefits given. For example the employee discount.
good,"Target is team based, very comfortable work environment, management was great at my location but they were very red card driven. As a cashier we'd have a weekly goal of how many red cards we would have to get for each week and a personal goal of how many we needed to get each shift based on the hours you were working that day. If they eased up on stress of the number of red cards and didn't threaten your job because you didn't meet the goal a couple of times, I'd would've worked there longer."
good,Worked evening shift until closing. The store is always packed with guest. The coworkers have a great and strict way of communications. The pay is acceptable there. Depending on how long you work there you may qualify to be promoted
good,In all working for target is great . I love the people I work with and I love my managers and all that . I just have a different passion in life . Target will always be one of my favorite places that I’ve worked at . They for the most part kept every team member in mind . Most days are extremely fun but of course being retail there are some bad days .
good,"This job is fun but the coworkers come and go. The best position is team lead and up, I feel like just as a team lead there aren’t as many benefits and it’s more of a temporary job."
good,It was a good job for a student i only worked 3 days a week just mornings so i had time for school. we got 15 minute breaks every 3 hours or so. The pay is good for retail. overall good experience.
good,"Its Target! Great place to work. Flexible schedules, lots of advancement, possibilities are endless on what you can achieve from working part time, to exceeding to management. Great place to work and go to school."
good,"Target 🎯 is  A very fun laid-back and productive work environment, I enjoy working at target it is helped me gain a lot of different new skills that can help me in future job positions. The management is great they are good people with amazing personalities that are always willing to help you and work with you. Working hours are good around holiday times but they do get cut short after the holiday season is over so that is a negative but overall  it’s a great store to work at and I would recommend it to many of my friends and other people."
good,"I worked here when I was in college. Great place to work for people who are in school. Flexible hours to balance work/school. Gave me leave of absence so I could finish out my college degree. "
good,"I started as a team member at Target, but was a very hard worker who engaged in the company and as soon as a position opened up, I was promoted."
good,"Target is a great fast-paced ,friendly environment. ""One team,one dream"" is their motto and we all live up to it. We treat each other as family on the clock and off the clock."
good,Target is a fun place to work part-time.  The employees and managers are all very nice.  I think the pay and expectations are fair.  It is difficult to work late nights since I have another job in the early mornings.
good,"Honestly, they make you do way too much for the amount they pay you. I did backroom, hardlines, softlines, cashier, guest service, sometimes market, and it took them 7 months for them to make me a trainer, even though I was training since I was there for 2 months. They fired me for ""stealing"" when I still payed for the items, and they knew it was not on purpose. However, the management was fantastic and truly made the store a better place, some team leads abused their power and were completely obnoxious, however, the others who did their job made working there a blast and made the place over all 100% better. Target will always hold a very special place in my heart, and I made such amazing friends, and made a better life for myself there, even though it ended poorly, I'm so glad I had the chance to call Target my home."
good,"As a sales associate at target, i very much so enjoyed the employee's i worked with, as well as the family friendly atmosphere, and the quick paced work day."
good,The store worked with my then classes. They were willing to help you on learning new things or new set ups. The customers were always some of the best people.
good,"I really enjoyed my time here. I was part of an excellent team who worked very well together, as well as having a wonderful work life balance that kept going to work pleasant."
good,"Working at Target was a great place to work, I learned a lot about retail and customer service. I was grateful to learn how to be a store telephone operator.  I made a lot of friends and learned to work together with co workers. I learned a lot about the business."
good,"I like working at target it’s a great place to work the pay is awesome but unless the odds are stacked in your favor there is really no advancement unless you nag your supervisors. They hire fresh out of high school adults to do management roles and no one respects them because they do childish things.  But overall each target is different so my experience can be different for another.  I personally like working at target, I like working short days and they accommodate me and give me pretty good hours."
good,Being a formal employee at Target has shown me how hard Target works to be the best and presentable as a workplace. As well as being a place for our guests to feel comfortable and make Target their home store. The pay was acceptable and the team was great. Wouldn’t regret Target in a lifetime but the managers could use some work that’s all.
good,The work itself (backroom team member) starts incredibly early and you need to be able to keep up with the fast pace that it demands. It wasn't a good fit for me in particular but the people who worked there were absolutely wonderful. They never made me feel excluded and offered to help if I ever needed it. The management was on top of everything they needed to and problem solved very quickly. If I were better suited for it I would've enjoyed working there.
good,Give decent work environment and pay. The only problem I have is with their employee discount.  You can only use cash or their Target Red Card to get it.
good,"One of the better retail employers out there. Worked around my availability. Paid more than minimum. Sometimes hours got cut when times were slow, but that is typical of retail."
good,There's never a moment that I won't stopped working which is what I'm used to. I stand for long periods of times as well as performing sales floor walks. I write reports for recovered and lost merchandise. I try to the best of my abilities to maintain my team's safety and well-being.
good,"Working at Target made me improve my skills as a Sales Associate, helping others made my job a little more interesting. Overall the Work enviroment was clean, it had a nice themed building that stood out quite lot. My skills in Money handling grew extremely. The hardest part of my job was having to items where they belonged due to the buliding being soo large. The most enjoyable part of the job was recommending our guests to some products and the interest they had for them."
good,The time goes by quickly even though it is a 12 hour shift due to the extremely fast pace and mental concentration require. The work week leaves you exhausted but gives you four days to recover. The job has a strong seasonal basis so cuts and made frequently. You only have to deal with your fellow worker and absolutely no customers! The people who work there are generally very easy going and fun to joke around with.
good,"Target is a fast-paced work environment especially around the holidays. The pay is OK, and they worked well with me going back to school. Advancement opportunities are pretty wide, as long as you have a degree and are willing to travel. One of my bosses moved up from cart attendant to STL throughout his Target journey but had to relocate to different Targets to make that happen."
good,"Target is a great place to work for many reasons but, my favorite is how much they appreciate their employees and how much they give back to the community."
good,"greet and assist customers with needs, learned to acknowledge each and every guest with a wonderful shopping experience, management was a little off I felt the courage to actually want a management position, the job I worked was pretty simple, getting to experience different guest was the most enjoyable"
good,"While it may not be the career you've always wanter, working at Target is a good job to hold while you search for something better. It's fulfilling and the company treats its team members very well."
good,"They train you very quickly and for the most part its good but sometimes its like they just leave you to figure it out on your own. I was hired as a softlines (clothing) assistant, but a lot of times I was pulled elsewhere. I was doing clothing departments just fine, but the trouble came when i was pulled away to assist another department. I liked learning new areas but they didnt fully explain how to read a skew number which made stocking shelves hard sometimes. I was often slow doing work in other departments but I felt left on my own at times. I am easily intimidated if someone is very stern, so I felt like I was a bother to some supervisors when I asked for clarification on how to read locations listed on box lables, ect."
good,I liked working at Target because the benefits were nice and the management was relatively kind for the most part. However when cashiering it got very boring and painful after standing in one spot for an 8 hour shift.
good,"Staff is very friendly, and helpful. Certain responsibilities are required, but others are appreciated and praised. Clientele is very fast-paced but understanding of the process and atmosphere."
good,"The work place is filled with good people, however for the type of physical labor I was doing daily I would've liked more money hourly. Also working nights can be a challenge because you're cleaning up after the morning/day crew every night, adding to your workload."
good,"The crew I worked with was amazing.  The pay was good for retail. If wanted more hours,  we could cover other shifts. The hardest part was Black Friday for me."
good,Always enjoyed working with my team members at Target.  The people I worked with were knowledgeable as well displayed hard work ethic while incorporating fun at the work place.  I will cherish the friendships I created there.  Management was decent until my last days there.  Some of the people they brought in would not have good work ethic and just display authoritative action as well did not listen to the employees who had longer experience in the job.  It was a good job to have while in my earlier college years as they were flexible with my schedule due to school.
good,"Great learning opportunity for retail professionals.  A lot of what you get out of this depends on your leader and their temperament, however. They truly dictate your development and what you get out of this."
good,"Target is a good corporation to work for, They do promote from within however. it takes time for you to be placed in your role. I enjoyed working with the team members/peers."
good,The best part of the job is being able to talk to guests and to help them solved problems.  It was interesting to see different clientele when floating to different locations. Travelling around allowed me to pick up new ideas of doing things.  The hardest part is not being able to follow up with certain guests since I am constantly moving around.
good,"Poor communication between team and TLs and understanding of unavailable days. However, some of the TLs try their best to take care you and hear out your needs/ offer you hours if you need them."
good,"Normally weekends and holidays are the busiest times, but the work-experience is exciting. Most enjoyable part is being able to help customers. not too strict on the dress code."
good,"A typical day at work consists of unloading trucks, stocking, and backroom organization.  I learned how to back stock merchandise with state of the art equipment. Management trained and mentored associates. The hardest part of the job was maintaining a full staff on a daily basis. The most enjoyable part of the job was being recognized for completing all tasks."
good,"Never a dull moment, always something to work on, keep you busy.  I ran multiple depts with almost no employee help, as was designed by the executive team.  Do more with less."
good,Target was a nice place to work. Very professional ran company. The hardest part of my job was not getting enough hours. They only piled us with hours around the holidays.
good,The hours are flexible and the lunch breaks are longer than other retail stores around my area. It was my first job at 16 and I learned how to work in the real world and deal with irate guests.
good,"A typical work day at Target was dependent upon what time ot the day your shift started; morning shifts had the employees restocking the merchandise, and evening shifts was replacing merchandise to the correct department (cleaning up your department.)  The workplace culture was very faced paced which always kept me busy.  The job itself wasn't difficult, and the most enjoyable aspect was helping others."
good,"My manager was sweet but the GSTL's on the floor (3 out of 5) were frustrating to work with and knit picky about things such as wearing a black cardagin over red T-shirt and kaki pants. The scheduling sucks then again it's retail, and conveniently we were low on staff when we needed people the most. The main GSTL was too focused on perfecting ""legendary service"" which doesn't exist by the way unless you work at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. Most of the cashiers/coworkers I worked with were fun and kind."
good,Target is a fun place to work with a large number of employees and great benefits. The worst part of the job is the long hours in the evenings and on the weekends. The best part of the job was the exercise I got when I ran around that store all the time!
good,I find target dc to be a great place to work I just think that the productivity measures are a bit extreme but your well compensated for it so it’s an equal balance ...personally it was a great place to work and your recognized for your efforts which is the first job I ever felt that way and the benefits were really good aswell
good,Target is a relaxed positive energy giving work place but unfortunately do not give enough of a  compensation to take care of things in everyday life such as daycare and other bills.
good,"Amazing job experience - you learn very well how to be an effective leader. Not stuck behind a desk all day - get to be out and about thoroughout the store. Demanding job, but time goes by quickly as you're very busy all day."
good,It was an incredibly enjoyable job but there wasn't a lot of communication from management when it came to what they thought I was doing right or wrong.
good,Typical work day consists of team member packing products in the module for target guest. I have learned how to be fast. Management is okay. Workplace culture is good. Hardest part would be not being able to hit productivity due to bad freight. Enjoyable part is the team.
good,"had a good time while working there, upset i was let go due to miscommunication. Had lots of different things to do as a security guard there however i was asked to do things that the regular employees would have to do, which was not apart of my job description."
good,"target is a good place to work for a first job. i learned a lot about customer service, sales and working with management but i was ready to advance in my personal career life."
good,"Caring managers, flexible schedule, fun environment, easy to move up in company, understanding HR reps, fast, fun, and friendly service mottos used for guests"
good,great place to work very friendly environment managers are hard workers. You are always rewarded if you do a great job. the only hard part is asking every guest to apply for red cards.
good,"A typical day at work would be fast pace. I gain customer service skills by working at Target. The management team was great and the team members were also easy to work with. The hardest part of the job was pulling the pallets, due not being stacked correctly. The enjoyable part of the job was helping customers."
good,"A typical day at the office. Long hours, friendly staff, the most enjoyable part of my job would be the interesting customers i would deal with within my role. Clean and tidy work environment."
good,"This had to be the only job so far I had that had a really friendly environment and high expectations that were not impossible. This was a job that expanded my knowledge of every department such as clothing, electronics,sales,stock...etc. I never felt afraid to talk to my LOD's whenever I had any question and I felt lucky to have such managers."
good,"Target provides an open and honest culture that focuses on individuality and team work. As an executive team leader, you are expected to work weekends and holidays. An average work day is 10 hours."
good,"The company itself seems to be headed in the right direction. Compensation for ETLs is for the most part competitive and based on prior work experience. One's experience as an ETL will likely be based on the character of their other peers. If the team is communicative and supportive of each other, this is a fun work environment to be a part of. If there are peers that are self serving, this can fall apart very quickly."
good,"Great environment, fast paced and managers were very helpful. Normal day was grabbing pallets from back freezers and stocking the food on the shelves."
good,Target is an excellent place to work with good benefits. Management within the store is by far the best I have ever had. Opportunity to advance are not where I would like it to be.
good,Worked for target many years in many departments.  Four day a week schedule was good.  Good benefits and salary.  Fast paced work environment with high expectations from management.
good,Working at the South Minneapolis Target was pretty fun. I was a GSA and managed the front end cashiers. never had a problem with any of them. Most of the employees there followed company rules but some were pretty out of control.
good,"It was okay; there would be days where there would be long lines of guest and only two cashiers working which was stressful. The managers were fun to work with, and They're accommodating with any problems you may have."
good,Awesome productive environment. Associates are really hard working and ojtfoing especially around chrosas time when it gets  busy. Target  overall all maim goal in my opinion was team work. Awesome
good,everyday was planned out and everyone had s task to do.  there was never confusion on what projects need to be done.  only downside we had at our store was payroll
good,"Target is great. I love almost everything about the job. I am paid fairly for my position, I love my coworkers and managers, I like the guests. I don't like the inconsistent hours. I can't pay my bills when hours drop to 5 hours a week. It seems that there's favoritism when it comes to scheduling. Only Team Leaders and above are guaranteed 40 hours a week, as those are full time positions, but there are several non-team lead employees that seem to get all the available hours, regardless of my own availability. I work hard, am rarely late, never call in, usually accept being called in when need be, but still am not getting scheduled fairly. Also, I'd like health insurance. Other than that, Target is a wonderful job that works amazingly with other jobs or school in your schedule."
good,"My original job at Target was the best, I was good at it and I loved the people I worked with. I did get the chance for a promotion and although I do love my job, there are days that I hate what I do. The store and the people I work with are like family though. I couldn't ask for a better work family."
good,The management is okay. Depending on which department you are in. They do like when you ask questions and do their best to answer. Very competitive and into getting good reviews. Clean work environment for the most part.
good,I like target because of the experience I have gotten and working with my fellow co workers and getting to know the guest is good.Team work is not always there but I still do my part.The hours is okay but not great.
good,Truly enjoy the merchandising and visual aspect of my position. We have some really great merchandise to offer guest. The hardest part of the job is keeping the store clean from items on the floor. For the most part it is a good store to work at.
good,Lack of growth with company. Would like better opportunities. Great Management. Not enough Hours. Great coworkers. Work as as team. Not great pay. Cut hours.
good,"A typical day at work is okay. Although I'm getting tired of the Target routine, it isn't a terrible job to have. Most employees are nice and most of the time the managers really take you into consideration."
good,"I was a cashier, so there wasn't really anything interesting about the job.  It was pretty self-explanatory, and there was not really any opportunity for advancement."
good,"I started out as a team member and after my ""probationary period"" I was promoted to a Team Leader. I was responsible for the overall overnight logistics process.  It was very fast paced."
good,"Some of management weren't as helpful or kind, expected a 2 week employee to have experience of a 5 year employee... Great co-workers though, permanent and seasonal"
good,Great job for someone looking to get into the security field. Target is one of the largest corporations in the US and they take great care of their employees.
good,I enjoyed working for Target. It opened several doors for me during my management career. I would recommend working for this company rather quickly. This is a very detailed company to work for being based out of Minnesota
good,"Target is a great place to work if you are a working parent and need a second income very flexible with benefits. The store is always busy. Target is more like a one stop and shop store. From health and beauty, groceries, small appliances, housewares items, clothing for adults,children, toys and electronics."
good,I loved working at Target the only downside would be some of the management is difficult to deal with. your job and pay is based off your ability to due your job. The better you do the more hours you receive and the bigger the pay raise. It's the true meaning of you get out what you put in. The environment is great and coworkers are normally long lasting friends. Very organized and well ran company.
good,"A typical day at target is exciting, productive and busy.  The staff is extremely fun to be around and the work enviroment is a breathe of fresh air. Customers can be difficult at times but there are some diamonds in the pack. The management is amazing and always concerned for the well being of the staff and making sure customers is pleased with the overall service. The hardest part of the job is dealing with angry customers. But the most important part of the job is making the customer happy and seeing them leave with a smile smile on their faces."
good,A typical day at work was going in and couting inventory and then going out to get people to sign up for a phone contract and selling them our new phone that just had came in and explaning all the plans.
good,this was a great company to work for the only thing is that full time hours are not given to the employee and having to support a family is not possible on part time hours.
good,Good job with opportunity for advancement.  If you do your job you are treated as a valued member of the team.  Excellent benefits and a good working enviornment
good,"A typical day at TARGET is being fast, fun, and friendly to all the guest. I have learned how to work in several departments in the store (cashier, customer service, cafe, hard lines etc.) There is nothing hard about working at TARGET. The most enjoyable part of the job is dealing with the guest and making sure that they are satisfied with their visit to TARGET."
good,Target is a good company to work for when you are working with the right OM's I have been there a year and I have enjoyed working but I don't think its room to grow
good,My managers had opposite opinions of how they wanted things done which caused me some stress. One wanted everything super fast paced and the other enjoyed my getting the job done right and at my pace.
good,Typical day at work is working with the public everyday. Learned how each individual customer needs are different. Variety of culture and the hardest is the upsell for targets cards. the most joyable part is I enjoy working with people good customer service is the up most of any job
good,"Over the 5 months I worked at Target, I was pleased to have worked there. It was definitely a great experience for my second job and a good step in the right direction for young workers like myself. Despite rare uneasy guests and sometimes quick paced afternoons this job was pretty great and I'd love to work for the organization again."
good,"it was pretty far as well, really fun tho,"
good,For a seasonal part-time job Target was great. The staff was fun and the environment relaxed if you stayed on task. Time went by quickly and management was very encouraging.
good,"Success focused, wanting to drive strong business results.  Fun, friendly environment but wanting to get things done.  Working with the team I had was the best part!"
good,target is a great place to work if your in school or looking for part time job on the side but the managers (not in all targets but a few ive been in and worked at.) need to respect employees and there life styles. they want you to look busy all day and half or 70% of the time theres nothing to do and the managers come down on employees for not having work done that they didnt  know about.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of stocking shelves, greeting and helping guests and neatening zones of the store. I learned how to work a cash register, how to take care of an area of a store and about handling angry or frustrated costumers. The management were great and  very understanding of personal interests or needs. The holiday season seems to be the only time business is very fast-paced or overwhelming. Other than that, the store is usually relatively slow-paced and quiet."
good,"Great people, clean store, fast and efficient workers, helpful and encouraging management. Friendly atmosphere. Competitive seasonal work, the best for kept on permanently."
good,"Worked cafe for three years - left after getting fed up with management not allowing me to cross train or work elsewhere in store, despite repeated requests. Overall, I'd say the job was pretty good in and of itself - co-workers were awesome. That said, it's good for a part-time job if you need to make ends meet, but don't expect much room for advancement."
good,i have worked at target for nearly 2 years and i really do like the environment but it just depends so much on favoritism there sometime is a lot of attitude problems coming from a higher authority.
good,"target is one of the best jobs ive had, but it is still a retail job. the hours are not consistent but the money is good. management is handling differently here than other places most of them dont have that need to feel disconnected from their employees so it has a close knit family vibe.youre definitely rewarded for your hardwork."
good,It was a good place to work. It was customer focused and customer oriented. Safety was important and a clean work place was important as well.  Team work was also important.
good,Target was a great place to work with lots of opportunity to grow and learn as a professional.  Every day was something new due to the nature of retail you never knew what your work day would bring which was always exciting. Being such a large company there is lots of room to grow with upward mobility depending on your strengths as a leader. Overall I would recommend Target to any one looking to start out their management experience and see where it goes!
good,Very fast paced place to work specially during holiday season. They do not take into consideration of peoples home life or situation. They force you to work over time and nights when for single parents that's not an option.
good,I had an amazing experience working with Target.  The team and the culture can't be beat. The leadership development I received has helped me grow. I highly recommend!
good,"Target was a unique company, they were very understanding, was easy to work with. Everyone was involved, they were team. They were more independent, I loved working with the customers I actually felt like I made a difference there."
good,"Lot of transformations are happening, Management level lot of changes, Uncertainty, Migrating all the legacy systems to open source technologies. Flexible, Work life balance, lot of sea change since 3 years. Poaching the managers from good retail companies"
good,great place of employment hours were great management was ok but needed more professionalism they paid employees very well with great benefits co workers were the best team players
good,"Fast paced environment, flexible hours, great staff to work with. Great job experience for those going into customer service. Very busy around holiday season."
good,Having been in a few locations I will say that in general the company standards are upheld and management is fair. There is always work to be done and customers to be helped. The hardest part of the job I feel is trying to get the work done without the distractions of having to lead guests to items not in your dept. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping guests find what they want and completing a task before the day is done.
good,"I enjoy the job I do working for Target because of the guests and some great coworkers, but having a bachelor's degree does not seem to get you far very quickly here. As a team member, you have to become a team lead in multiple departments throughout your time working there, before you can become an ""executive team lead"" and then store managing takes even longer to get up to. I would say if you enjoy the store you work for and don't mind waiting a while to get promoted, this might be the job for you. But if you are trying to get into management sooner, or get a consistent schedule with close to 40 hours each week, you may want to look elsewhere."
good,It's cool laid  back and fun environment I had a fun experience working  there customers are nice and helpful when tryna help them find what they need
good,"Good place to work overall. The shifts are flexible and hours vary from week to week, but there is usually always an opportunity to pick up extra shifts. It can be stressful, but fun as well."
good,Toman en cuenta tus opiniones y depende de tu trabajo te suben de puesto
good,"I could see how someone would love working at target, its a real community. Moving up is doable if you have if you have open availability. hours if you want them."
good,"It is difficult to find many jobs that will pay more than $12 an hour. This is a good job with solid pay."
good,"its fast paced but steady and the staff and managers become family i had some of the best times there, they had some bake sales for staff and the pride parade. they show alot of love for they're saff and community."
good,"The job that i had was not by target but a company that owned a kiosk in target and i was there to sell cellphones and such for verizon,at&t,and sprint it was weird at first seeing how there wasnt a lot of communication"
good,"Working for Target was a great opportunity for me to learn. I have learned many skills from target, but it was difficult to move further up in the company. Those who go the extra mile everyday that they work, are over looked by managers and taken advantage of."
good,"Target is a great company to work for. There is room for advancement but only if you're willing to devote your LIFE to the company for a lesser pay than any other company would give you. Yes I feel under valued but at the same time it's such an inclusive work environment it's hard to leave, you'll love working for Target but the pay leaves you hurting at the end of every two weeks."
good,"Management was friendly, tons of hours to take from others, lots of call ins too, overall wasn't too bad in my opinion. "
good,"I worked at Target for one year (2016-2017) and my time there was fairly positive. I was an overnight employee and my main responsibilities included: Unloading trucks, organizing palettes, stocking shelves and customer service when the store was open. I enjoyed my time at Target and the pay was good; however in my later months at Target the management changed frequently and this caused my team (truck unload team) to be under constant stress due to being heavily understaffed. We as a team had been telling upper management that we were understaffed for some time which was causing our work load to be more than excessive and overwhelming in the amount of time that was given daily. We were under constant stress from the higher ups for around 4 months before they realized our pleas for more staff was reasonable. Overall the job experience was good with the downside of management sometimes putting pressure on us for tasks that we as a team could not fix."
good,"working here is good, fast pace and great employee culture. the pay is okay, the job stability is not good I was hired for only seasonal but stayed late when asked but wasn't offered position"
good,"A typical day, depending upon your position, is task and guest driven.  Your productivity is tracked, your performance is tracked and you need to be willing to be flexible to ensure, daily, the job gets done."
good,"Target is a great place to work, however there is not too much communication between team leaders and associates. Equipment is always scarce and takes time out of your day to go searching for a team member who has the required equipment for you to get your task completed. Target allows self-control of breaks and lunches. There is not a great discount for employees (10%) but you are able to add an extra 5% off with the use of a RedCard. "
good,Good company. Fair pay.Needs a different management style.Target has an extensive distribution system along with thousands of store's.Corporate is trying diligently to to get their Dot Com off the ground. The Company is trying to be competitive in the market place.
good,"typical work nights, clock in, unload the truck, stock the floor, take all merchandise to the back that's extra. What I've learned was that time is a huge factor, wasting it wasn't an option but sometimes that was the case here. The management team was alright. Sometimes seemed bothered by workers going up to them and asking for equipment or for another person to help in their section, also a lot a favoritism was obviously shown while working .Targets workplace culture was ok ..some people were quiet, some were loud and disruptive and some employees just did not work. Which all the undone work fell on the fast hard working people. At times team leads would have the employees who finished their work on time stay later than scheduled because the team lead was talking to the employee in that section for way to long that they weren't able to finish the task or who ever wasn't working didn't finish the job. The hardest part of the job to me was to be put in an area where they never place you in before or having to deal with heavy merchandise you can not even pick up. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the work get done and everyone doing their part."
good,"Target is a wonderful place to work. I have been with the company for over 5 years and have learned a large variety of different positions and skill sets. My store preferred to cross train team members instead of promote or change work centers. Management would also change rather quickly making it hard to keep a steady pace and direction. "
good,I worked softlines overnight. If you do your job then you wont have any problems. Managers were respectful to employees. I enjoyed working over night.
good,Great company to work for with lot of good opportunities and new technologies. Constant change in management and job cut is an area of concern. Good Package
good,I enjoyed working their. Unfortunately I was not permanent at the time and got in a bad car accident. So I had to leave but I would love to go back. They are very friendly and respectful.
good,"I enjoyed going to work everyday. Diversity and different cultures were a large part of the work environment. A lot of turnover in management as opportunities were available to transfer to other states. Various volunteering that was fun. Outside areas with heat lamps and picnic tables provided. The hardest part was terming team members and the most enjoyable was making job offers.  People were so excited, it made me feel as though I personally changed their lives."
good,I for the most part thought it was a good place to work especially if its your first job. Only thing I didn't enjoy about my job were a few people that worked there were a bit much to work with but as for the scheduling it worked well for me beiv that I do have a family to come home to so I was able to do things with them and at the end of the day go and work.
good,"Greet, serve and thank guests in fast paced setting, tell about and help guests with new REDcards, learn about building a culture with "
good,"Target is a fun, fast paced place to work.  If you like staying busy, then apply!  There are many new rollouts, so if you like change and development, and working for a company that is constantly changing to remain at the top, then Target is for you."
good,All of my favorite coworkers are here at this location. I was here for 5 years before moving on and let me tell you I've never met a work family like this one. Every shift I always enjoyed working. The environment was a second home to me. We had a few manager changes from time to time but we always had someone look out for the best of our store. I miss everyone so much!
good,"The typical workday was enjoyable and the other employees were pleasant to be around during the shift. Working in the front, either on a register or at self-checkout, provided to opportunity to interact with customers. The hardest part of the job is standing on the tile floor for long periods of the day several days a week because it causes my joints to become irritated."
good,"Keeps you busy and a good starter job. Learned some well used skills from cashiering to customer service. Management varies but the workplace in general is nice and upbeat. the hardest part of the job would be dealing with aggressive consumers however what i find enjoyable is the work. There is always something to do, so you are never bored."
good,"This is a great job for anyone who is looking to gain valuable work and leadership experience. However, sometime the job can lead to some long hours and odd hours if you work in the Logistics position. This may fit some peoples lifestyle, but can be tough on others."
good,"Logistics work at target is straight forward. It requires learning and developing new skills regularly. There is also a pay premium for logistics, which helps justify the odd hours required."
good,"Target is a great place to work and the HR staff really supports the team if you have any questions. Of course you must work hard and keep up a good pace but that is to be expected in a work environment."
good,"Target is a great place to work if you are a energetic and enthusiastic person that has no problem moving quickly and working under pressure. The experience an ETL role can bring is phenomenal. You have the responsibility of presenting your business to upper management during visits, building your own team, driving sales daily and providing great guest experience. The sales floor is your playground to design and put together according to guest's needs. The role brings great experience whether you're new to retail or have been in the field for a decade."
good,"Target is a good place to work if you need a part time job. It's a great place for teenagers to work due to their school schedules. Depending on the store and management, you can advance up the ladder."
good,"Target is an awesome place to work although it has it's downfalls, it sometimes gets really slow and there isn't too much to do on the front end. The most enjoyable part of the job is that it's a positive environment."
good,"I have a criminal justice background, and I was able to join the assets protection department immediately. It was a good place to begin to sharp investigatory skills however after being passed up on several promotions I decided to go in another direction"
good,its okay some guest is nice some give you a hard time. the managers are really all different some helps and actually make you feel like you like working there and some make you feel like you hate your job
good,"Had some great team members and good supervisors. They hire up from withinthe store. Train for all different areas, which is helpful. They ask your opinion about different situations."
good,Got to meet different type of people everyday and gained a good customer service skill from there. staff were supportive and had a flexible schedule .
good,"Come on every schedule shift, come on time and come with a smile(good attitude). They don't like anyone being negative. Also come ready to work, sometimes they will have you work in areas that you didn't apply for."
good,I learned a lot of skills from target unloading trucks scanning products stocking shelves useing power equipment good customer service skills moving in a fast fun work environment
good,Assisted  customers with their purchases. Balanced drawers daily and conducted monthly inventory of products..  Returned merchandise that customers did not want.
good,I've been there 6 years and I feel it is Top Retail experience there is. I was able to work and be developed by the managers as the assisted with me reaching personal goals for myself.
good,Fun Fast and Friendly Service is the company motto. Great place to start working in retail. Lots of different products from electronics to groceries. Great seasonal or first job.
good,"Great to work seasonal, jobs. Great jours and good pay.  It was a pleasant experience with seasonal work during the holidays.  Good money at the best time for extra cash."
good,I like working for target. I love retail so working here was a great pressure. although I work seven days in a roll and still got less then 40 hours. it was hard to get a weekend off.
good,"Working at target was nothing short of tight deadlines, fast paced work, not a lot of room for movement within the company, and insufficient raises.  Workplace culture was enjoyable and friendly.  The group of coworkers really made the work environment easy."
good,I enjoyed working here for the time I was there. The work was good and the people I worked along side were good people. The management was good for the time I was there.
good,"Great to work for."
good,"A day at target can be fun, or it can be quite difficult, depending. With the automated scheduling system, getting hours can be difficult depending on your location in the store, such as cashiering getting 3-5.5 hours a work day, 2-5 days a week depending on if they can afford the man power. Constant shift change requests can help with that, as with any job, to provide opportunities of getting longer shifts, so long as you are trained and willing to do them. The people I work with are nice, some lazy and some hard working. Hardest part of the job might be the people, but retail is retail. People can be good or downright terrible. The people you work with make it all the better though."
good,I loved working here. It was my first real job and i loved every minute of it because it allowed me to get to know the people around me. As well as giving me great work experience.
good,Organized files and items for review purposes from Suppliers. Sent out correspondence from review process by e-mail to Suppliers. Worked on special projects as requested by Supervisor.
good,"Overall, Target is fun to work at.  I love my coworkers, the customers aren't as over the top, as, say those at a fast food restaurant, and the work, while not incredibly mentally stimulating, isn't particularly difficult.  You don't get paid enough or get enough hours to make a career out of it, unless you become an ETL or higher, but it works well as a side job in conjunction with studies or another job.  I'd recommend it if you're looking for some part-time work to supplement your income!"
good,Put bags and clothes away in locker. Punch in and head to the floor. Team Lead gives me my section for the day and i start to pack it out. Make sure my section was clean and all areas.
good,"Job is very basic, doesn't ask for too much from it's employees, the physical labor can be tiring but simple. I learned shipment processing, how to operate a baler, and pallet jacks."
good,"There is a lot to do and will keep you busy, get to work with a lot of people and your in a team. There are a lot of guest to talk to so people skills will help."
good,"Typical day a work would just be customers coming, and me being a cashier would provide them to customer service. Helping the guest check out was a very good experience to have, to interact with different people."
good,"I personally loved my job, and loved working at Target. That being said, the majority of the management were bullies, and the pay was not worth the job."
good,"good experience in investments and lending"
good,"Great for people who want to have a part time job or advance in retail for a career. The people are nice, management tries to accommodate with availability. It is hard to move to different areas from where you are hired for, but for the most part the positions aren't bad."
good,Target works hard to maintain a strong culture focused on good relationships between leaders and their teams and developing talent. Retail is a tough business and results are expected so the work-life balance is average at best but the company hires genuinely good people and rewards those who are accountable and willing to learn. I would highly recommend Target to others as a great place to work.
good,"Target is a great place to work for those interested in the retail industry.  The clientele is great, the employee environment as well.  I was honored to have the opportunity to work for a great company, but I'm exploring what my options are in the Information Technology field in Southeast Virginia."
good,A day for me is usually busy from beginning to end. I have a role in which I am a team of one. I sometimes have a challenge with the store management understanding my role. I think they would have more of an appreciation for my work if they took the time to work with me. I love that the job doesn't allow me to be complacent. I am constantly pushed to be a better leader and I appreciate it.
good,"We had 3 breaks each 8 hours worked.  I loved the employee discount. It was a huge store and had great prices.  Starbucks was located inside. "
good,Good pay and not too hard of a job however drama is high and there are many employees. Its nearly impossible for them to focus on the needs of them all.
good,Target is great for those new to the industry and even those older in the industry who do not have a ton of experience being a true Leader.  Target gives direct feedback and a level of job security that is second to none.
good,"I enjoyed my time with Target. It was overall a very good company to work for and I recommend them. Pay and benefits were at or above industry standard. Limited room for advancement, particularly without a 4 year degree."
good,"For the most part, this was a fun and friendly place to work.  my co-workers were nice, and we worked as a team as much as possible, helping each other out. the over night stocking team was responsible for receiving/unloading new shipments, sorting merchandise by department and store location, and stocking the sales floor as well as storing overflow in the backroom.  Most of the time management was pleasant.  However, there was obvious favoritism shown to some of the employees from the management."
good,"I usually worked closing shifts, which means I was responsible for putting product out onto the floor, keeping the area clean, and assisting guests. While sometimes this was great, there were other times that the managers disagreed on what was the priority. This was a challenge, because I had to figure out how to best satisfy everyone in the limited amount of time that I had. At the same time, this was the best job I've ever had. It was enough of a challenge that I never felt bored and most of the time what was asked of me was pretty much doable."
good,"In the past it was a great place to work, over the years the expectations had changed from fast, fun, and friendly and took focus away from a strong team culture and excellent customer service."
good,The store like any retail store had its busy season slow season busy hours and slow hours . The issue was the click of supervisors that would disappeared and smoke or socialize ignoring calls passing the their responsibility on to regular team members and retaliate against that team memeber if they did not do the team lead job correctly
good,It's a fun fast friendly place to work. I've learned a lot about how the company works. And how important us packers are to this company and their guest. We move product fast everyday.
good,"Each store will have vastly different cultures. The store I worked at was generally cohesive and almost family. Everyone helps everyone for the most part. Biggest frustrations are inexperienced leaders  being offered positions over experienced current employees. Many of the newer leaders are too concerned with day-to-day so that they can hand-off a successful day without looking at the bigger weekly/monthly outcomes. "
good,"Target was a great place to work with great management, just didn't have many hours offered until you move up in the company. I really enjoyed the team mentality working there"
good,a typical day was fast paced but in a an environment that was safe and comfortable. The management was fair and did not talk down to people and they would help you if you needed it
good,I worked part time at target. It was fun and different. But being part time you worked every Friday Saturday and Sunday. I loved meeting new people and customers. I had to turn in my notice due to the fact I had a mother that was dying of cancer and I wanted to be with her every moment I could.
good,"Fast paced retail working environment, with understanding management and team members. They offer personal training for the department you're in and can advance within the company."
good,"This was a great company to work for. Fair pay, and ideal hours.. Early morning-mid afternoon. Management was always willing to sit down and listen to concerns with employees and work out what they could. Store manager was always happy, and energetic. Always made for a good morning."
good,Good place to work at. Met many great people. The Management is like any retail corporation. You have to know someone... Other then that I like working there.
good,"Target is fun and fast paced.  Great for teenagers and college kids for sure.  Great place to interact with the public and you have the opportunity to deal with all kinds of people on a daily basis.  Customer service skills are a must!  Overall, it's a great learning experience and they provide benefits and a discount."
good,Target was a great experience for my first job.  Managers were very motivational.  The company is great. Staying focused is all it takes and the day just goes by.
good,"Loved the people I worked with. Biggest problem was never seeing any compensation for hard work. They would give you recognition but that's about it. Overall, fun place to work but never saw room for growth."
good,"Target it great for finding a 20-35 hour per week job that is normally good with accommodating time off or people who just really want to work part time and that's all. For those looking to move up and build a career, it can be a very long process that is not really worth the effort that it takes for the benefits that are available at many other places."
good,"You will always bee on your feet"
good,"An easy, slow-paced job. The company is so large that if you are part-time you do not know many of your coworkers. The work is organized but the workplace is not. They pay extremely well and really value their employees and there is plenty of room for you to move up the ladder and pick up as many hours as you would like."
good,"arketing exists to educate consumers about available products and services. A target market simply defines the consumers or groups most likely to purchase a particular product or service. Narrowly defined target markets help marketers craft compelling marketing materials that speak directly to the target buyer. Various consumer characteristics are used to define a target market, including demographics and psychographics, type and frequency of use, product benefits and geographic location."
good,great workplace with teamwork and communication. Benefits are not good for non salary/higher up. Decent hours as long as you are not cashier. Takes awhile to advance but it is possible.
good,"This is very much a tale split in two. I worked 3 years in Hilo, Hi and that, for the most part, was amazing. I averaged over 30 hours, made good money, had a good management staff and it was a very welcoming lifestyle. The only downside was they were incredibly particular in their management training. I also worked 6 months in Glenville, NY. What a horrible experience. My previous 3 years were put to nothing as I was forced into different areas. The management was horrendous."
good,I was hired on as seasonal employee during the holidays.  Enjoyed working there and was told that I would be kept because I was an excellent employee.  They even told me what position I would have after the holidays were over so I didn't look for another job.  But low and behold they let me go with everyone else.  I would love to work there on a full time basis but they said it was to slow to keep me on.
good,As a member on the Target Consumables team there is always work to be done. Completing multiple tasks while still fulfilling objectives is expected on a daily basis.
good,It has a great 1.5 years at target as Security architect and specific to Cyber threat Intel where I have learned a lot about new Threats in network and Web technology . the most challenging part of Job is the infrastructure being to complex and Technology too advanced that keep you busy and learning
good,"Target has a pretty good culture, but the culture in Hawaii is always different then the mainland. Culture in Hawaii is a little laid back and we like to help customers with a less aggressive approach. The business mentality from the mainland doesn't always work in Hawaii, but sometimes the same idea and different approach could work. The employees are good to work with, but not everyone understands their jobs or job titles. People who are fully trained turn out to understand and provide the best atmosphere to fellow employees and customers. Logistics is a hard department and moving up in the company can be difficult. Promotions don't come easy and it seemed that management only promoted people they liked, even though they didn't fully understand the position or barely do their current position."
good,I think Target was one of the most laid back job I've had. I worked in the front of the store as a cashier. I was part-time averaging maybe 20hrs a week. The time and days off varied.
good,"A typical day at Target starts with rushing out onto the floor so that the next person can get their break on time. Then it is all about guest satisfaction, so you need to have great social skills. Talking up red cards and cartwheel is a must. Management is great when they are all communicating with each other. The hardest part of the job is definitely keeping up with demands. I enjoyed the hectic environment and talking to guests!"
good,"I loved the team aspect of my job. Lots of ways for advancement. I have learned management skill's, Guest service, and problem solving under stress full environments."
good,"Managers work a minimum of 50 hours and up to 60/70 hours a week during peak season. Overall good company, behind competitors when it comes to infrastructure technology. Company is going through a lot of changes and has a good vision for the future but lacks clarity on how they want the operations to take place day to day. Also pays very well."
good,My experience with Target Pharmacy was not an extremely positive one. I felt the work environment didn't properly arm managers to be ready or have enough time to get their job done. The company has now gone under.
good,such a great job surrounded with great vibes . customers were awesome and nice. workplace was very organized and well kept up with very clean . the hardest part of the job was softlines
good,"Working at Target was overall a pleasant place to work at. My job required me to have excellent customer service and be quick to help guest or other team members. My job consisted of me bringing out palettes of the merchandise and restocking the shelves. While doing that I would also help cover the electronics boat and when needed, I would help out at the cash registers. But the most important thing was to make sure the guest is able to find what they need. Sometimes the guests would become upset, so I was able to learn how to deal with them the best way possible. The managers always did their best to make sure we were working in a comfortable and fun environment. They also always did their best to make sure I had a schedule that worked for me. I would have to say the only hard part about my job was the heavy lifting."
good,"A typical day was not bad I mainly did cashiering but i learned to do a lot of other things there it was nice to work half a shift at the register and then do guest service or work the fitting room counter. The managers where great they would give you incentives an buy you lunch or small things you need, which helps out a lot."
good,There isn't much to say. It was the service industry. A typical minimum wage job that paid the bills during school and having an little bit extra when i needed it. Management was pretty good and environment was friendly.
good,"I loved working at Target. The pay and advancements were the only problems. Adults should be making more than they are, especially the ones with families. It is hard to support a family on Target's income at the lower level without a degree. However if you are trained to do a job without a degree. you should be evaluated based on your performance and paid accordingly and not annually to give  pennies on a dollar."
good,I was working with Target for years good company to work for.exelent pay great benefits awesome schedules . They have great friendly Group Leaders they have a great retirement plan.
good,I worked at Target for over 3 years. I enjoyed most of my time working there. I felt like the higher management really cares about their employees. Just like with any job there was some drama. Some of the newer managers towards the end played a big role in me leaving the company.
good,"Target truly is a great company that is fast, fun, and friendly. The culture is diverse and accepting, but there is a lot of pressure from management on employees to sell RedCards and to move with a sense of urgency. This is a place to observe and learn positive examples of work ethic, guest service, and efficiency. If you have the right attitude and outlook, you will go far at Target. The management at each store varies and executives are rotated frequently, so the culture of the company can potential vary from store to store."
good,I worked at Target for 3 months as a cashier. The team was very energetic and made sure to focus on the satisfaction of customers. A lot of team member so there wasn't a lot of one on one with team leaders.
good,"As a sales associate, I interact with numerous guest on a daily basis. Every day is different, so this is not a boring job. Fun people to work with and the manager try to keep you motivated."
good,"decent place to work, my day is filled with coming into contact with many different types of people, the hardest part of my job is fulfilling my red card quota, the enjoyable part of my day is being able to interact with the public, management works with you as far as your schedule, being understanding if you have another part time job, if you need more hours they have a board by the time clock where other team members will post their shift if they cannot work it, so you can pick up extra hours with this"
good,This is a great place to learn about the different aspects within a business and to grow professionally. The company is currently going through several changes to logistics processes which can be difficult but they have a solid plan in place to help both team members and team leaders become acclimated.
good,"I love the the job, but only when I'm able to do it. Lack of equipment and proper guidelines makes everything a guessing game. Management has high turn around so if you ever get a good one don't get use to it."
good,"Typical department store with a great company positive atmosphere. The quality of this may vary from location to location, however they do like to recognize good work."
good,"Very professional work place."
good,"Mostly good, but all the management hiccups you'd expect from your favorite TV show - job security was arguable, compensation was barely above minimum and most of the supervisory staff were focused only on looking out for themselves."
good,Good for young college kids to work flexible schedule. Good people and fun. Products are wonderful. Very neat and clean departments. Easy to find items.
good,"I work here in Target from 3 years, its an great place to work and has awesome work life balance and great work culture. They provide free lunch and lot of benefits to Employees. totally employee friendly environment"
good,Great place to work. Plenty of room to grow. Target was able to help me learn more about who I am and what I would like to do for the long run. Target is very competitive with pay and benefits.
good,"When working at Target one must be very quick and attentive to detail. Team members are close and enjoy helping each other. The break room was always stocked with food items for team members. Though management was often caught up in drama, they were good at directing a team."
good,It was a great place for a first job. I only left because I found the a jobs close to home so I didn't have to drive very far. The job  taught me a lot and gave me very good work experience
good,"Fun place to work. The company does a lot of things for charities and local schools, which I thought was great. The only complaint I had was that they did not offer good pay raises. I was offered a management position, but it only came with a $0.20 raise, which I thought was a little ridiculous."
good,"Job was sold to us as a 3 days a week pay your dues and go 12 hour shift. Then madatory ""Flex up"" time showed up and it turned into 5. I dont need to tell you how we felt about that, especially when the conditions inside were kinda rough. They did what they could to help with the heat though. Overall, not a bad place and the pay was pretty good."
good,"A results driven company with long hours, working hard each and everyday to drive results with in your store and company. Team work is key to everyday results,"
good,you will definitely be worked. I worked the swing shift so it was a pretty chill shift but exhausting towards the end of the shift. You will need to drink lots of coffee
good,"Fun place to work! I started out pushing carts in the parking lot, and worked every position in the store, from Starbucks, cashier, stalker, and finally loss prevention."
good,"People you meet is great the experience you gain is the work is fun and educational, management isn't the greatest but it isnt the worst. Job culture is great ."
good,It was a great place to work with great people. The management and other staff were some of the best I have been around. I would definitely recommend target to anyone.
good,"Excellent place to work with several opportunities for advancement, great team environment, upper management often conflicted in direction due to lack of communication."
good,Good place to work. People are friendly and so is most of the management team. Work pace is fast however there are periods of down time in between tasks. Working culture is positive.
good,"Target is a great place to work. They are extremely flexible with their scheduling and hours, have a really friendly management team for the most part, plus there is always food in the break room."
good,This job was good for the most part.  I liked being able to write my own schedule.  Most days were very busy.  I enjoyed the people I worked with.  I learned a lot about being a manager.
good,"Clock in. Push Products. Stock Shelves. That was my day to day. "
good,"restocking sales floor while providing excellent customer service."
good,"Working at Target was a good introduction to retail, as I had no prior experience going into it. Although I was only working overnight during their remodel, I still learned a lot about retail."
good,"Great team atmosphere, everyone did their part to make working there a great experience. The managers want to help you learn and succeed. Time management is occasionally an issue with the management."
good,Management is very respectful. They worked with me on some  personal issues any or most other jobs wouldn't have. They care very much about their employees.
good,a typical day at target is stocking the stores what I learn is howto make end caps and to set up demstartions the management was awesome I love how they care about there employees and do parties and stuff to show appreciation the hardest part was trying to beat the clock the most enjoyable part is the team meetings
good,Good work place but their HR isn't great and they take too long to process documents.  The workers are fun and enjoyable.  The environment is fast paced but easy to adapt to.
good,"You lean that people can be terrible,but it is  agreat working environment,"
good,"I work as a Barista, and I love Target. They are very encouraging and supportive and gave me excellent training. I would love to work full time there, but they rarely offer 40 hours for hourly employees."
good,A typical day is fast paced.  Everyday can be completely different from the next. You'll never find yourself without anything to do. Best part is working with the people around you!
good,"Typical day as a softlines sales associate included running items from the dressing room out onto the floor, reorganizing the floor, backup cashiering, folding clothes, and hanging clothes. Mangement was efficient, and workplace culture was fast-paced, busy, and you always had a task to be doing. Rarely was there downtime."
good,can't really say i didn't work there long enough to get a good read on everything but if you love general sales or backroom jobs then this is the job for you.
good,"Target was a great place to work. When I first started it was fast paced, friendly, fun , and caring place to work. The management made it fun and Target used to care about the work/life balance. That all changed a couple of years ago and has downgraded ever since. I would still be there if they seemed to care about this balance."
good,Good job as far as work environment. Mostly nice people and the job was fun and interesting. Not a lot of hours per week scheduled so it is up to the individual to try and get shifts that they can cover to make ends meet.
good,"Target is a fast and fun company to work for with lots of room for moving up and many options for that as well, it was fun and the pay if decent for the job"
good,"My work day was usually going about the same routine of working back stray items, helping customers, organizing the aisles, building endcaps, or working the meat and dairy department where I'd put out fresh product, order new product and clean the backrooms. As my first job I learned how to run a register, clean back stockrooms, build displays and tie items to locations in their system. Management for the most part was okay some were very nice while a couple others could be a little rude, but nothing you couldn't handle. Culture was also pretty good at least as far as my team went as everybody in the food areas got along fine. The hardest part was probably very busy days where you'd get called up to backup cashier when you still had tasks in your area. The most enjoyable part was just how well I knew how to do my job at a certain point."
good,"A typical day in my position was very hectic. Unfortunately nobody was really cross trained in my department so when we needed back up nobody could, which left us short handed. Although very stressful. I could always count on my executive team leaders to jump in whenever they could"
good,Target has always been a fun location to shop for many people through the country. The items are fresh and fun. The management don't really focus on the needs of the team or things that will benefit the productivity.
good,"While working at Target I had a great time. First job, and it was friendly but still filled with responsibilities. Learned a lot from it, however management could use a bit of work."
good,"Management wasn't the greatest, but the rest of the job was awesome. We had free food and events. The job was workable, with hours being easily negotiated."
good,Hardest part of the job is the balance of getting everything done in one day plus making it all run smooth. I have to make sure everyone takes there breaks.
good,Might be hired as full time but hours become reduced to part time after a couple of months. Management is understanding and attempts to work with you. Never a dull moment.
good,My job was early in the morning and I would unload truck and stock items according to what was available at the time. Teamwork was always important at the job.
good,"I liked Target corporation it was a awesome company to work for and had excellent customer service. I learned to deal with different types of customers on a daily basis, and enjoy to interacted with the customers. The hardest part of job was unloading delivery trucks on daily basis because of products and merchandise. I enjoyed the staff and coworkers that was hardworking and dedicated  team members in the company."
good,"I liked the job.It was my second job ever. That being said having so much retail experience caused friction. Several LODs in the store at once would lead to some confusion with many team members. A lack of accountability. I came from background where the store director was always involved. To many times instinct would take over with no manager insight. It did teach me to be more business heavy mindset. Culture was quality. Hardest part for me was knowing I took it more serious then most employees. Most enjoyable the team meetings, team lunches, & involvement with charity."
good,Target was a decent place to work for the most part they do try to look out for their employees. If you ever get to work at the target in Canton Nick is the best Manager there.
good,"Target has a great environment. The workers are all wonderful people. Just don't get chummy with the management. They would rather be friends, then work associates"
good,The management at target is great. I worked seasonal during christmas and they always tried to do special things for their employees that were missing time with family.
good,"Target is a great company.  Great team moral and offers an inclusive environment.  I enjoyed working there.  Pharmacy business was sold, so I had to move on."
good,If you plan on being at Target for more than a year then you really need to express interest in moving up. Target seems to be good at not recognizing ones abilities. You have to try really hard to move up. Good company overall to work with.
good,"I enjoy working at Target mainly because of the people I work with, they are fun and and willing to help out when there is a scheduling issue.I feel like I can be myself at Target. I have learned how to be social and strike up conversations with people that I do not know. I think the hardest part of the job is having guests angry at me, but I try and do my best to resolve the situation."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Target but needed a job closer to home, great job for college students because Target is flexible with your schedule. I would've stayed at Target had it been closer to home."
good,"The Flow Team unloads the delivery truck early in the morning. Then they stock shelves until their shift is up, usually not completing all of the freight. Management does not take responsibility of mistakes, usually blames flow team. Hardest part of the job was dealing with management who were clueless. Most enjoyable was the team aspect and making great friends."
good,"nice place to work, staff is a positive and helpful. always wiling to work with you if needed in any area. i was only a seasonal employee but ended up staying on after the season."
good,more positives than negatives. more organized working conditions than similar retail places. most management are professional and fair. the work day goes by quickly on most days
good,You get trained in many different areas from stocking to cashiering. You gain plenty of experience in most departments. Hard to move up in store and there is plenty of pressure of meeting goal times.
good,"Target is a good place to work due to smart, dedicated team members.  However, it still seems to be struggling to define company strategy due to changing retail environment."
good,"Target was pretty basic, nothing that I wasnt familiar with....blended in well with the system. Great learning experience as well as working with good people."
good,"You have a place to go to work and you will get compensated fairly for doing your job. My biggest complaint is that people don't take a lot of pride in their work, so sometimes you disagree with people's work ethic but there's not a lot you can do about it, which can make going to work a little frustrating."
good,Good company and culture.  Pharmacy was within the store so retail aspect could be an issue with work flow in the pharmancy.  Started out with a very good core team.
good,"in target is the absolutely best thing about the job. That you lose weight being on your feet all day!"
good,"Job is very fast pace, you are always on the move. I walk about 10 miles a shift. Scheduling can be suspect from time to time (close to open shifts). Coworkers are fun and overall its a fun environment."
good,"Clean store, good employees, good management.  Average pay. Room for advancement,  possibly management.  Management takes care of their employees. I enjoyed working there."
good,"I worked for under a agency, but working at target is a good entry job, the only thing I dislike is the breaks. There are two break of 20 min. each, for starters I don't see it fair because the break room from the work area is a 4 minute walk, then there isn't enough microwaves to heat up the food so you wait to get to one then wait for your food to get warm. That takes up another 5-10 min and you only get to sit down and eat for 5 mins"
good,They have lack of concern for medical issues. Management doesnt seem to want to listen. Co workers were nice and willing to help in anyway. Loved the customers.
good,Was a good place to work but not enough concern for what was happening in your personal lives. Coworkers would have an illness or death in there family and nothing would be said or done by management
good,Being on the sales floor my job was mostly to keep things organized which is something I am really good at. On the sales floor we also help out the cashiers when they get busy I liked going up there to help and interact with the customers.
good,"Great pay and benefits, very poor management and very rude human resource employees along with team member on the warehouse floor, discrimination problems"
good,"Target is a fast paced, fun place to work.  There is always something going on.  Associates bring in pot luck and birthday cakes to share with team members.  Good team support!"
good,"Working at Target was a wonderful opportunity, as it gave me a chance to interact with people from all walks of life. A typical day included clocking in, assisting customers from my work space, and being kind and courteous to those who came through my line. The management was decent, while my direct supervisor and I didn't see eye to eye, they were respectful and treated me with dignity."
good,"Less hours, lack communication  skills from the top management  to to other."
good,I lead a team to stock the backrooom. I have learned a lot of leadership traits. i have learned a lot of other things in different departments. The hardest part of the job is finding people who take pride in there work and aren't just there for a paycheck.
good,"The job itself isn't super fun, but the coworkers are all awesome people who make the days easier. Management is super helpful and understanding when something happens. The hardest part of the job is probably knowing that whatever you fix is going to end up messed up really soon again. It can be frustrating. But it can be nice to push out new merchandise and see an area nice and tidy for a while."
good,"Great company to work for, cart attendant didnt offer room for advancement bt other positions do. Management was very good, enjoyed my time working there."
good,"While doing Loss Prevention I found myself incurring a lot of down time which was probably the worst part of everything. The apprehension process was very riveting but the few hours after were usually very drab and sometimes sad. Compensation for new hires is minimum wage but after a few years, a few promotions, and a few pay raises wasn't horrible for the labor."
good,It was a fun place to work. Great benefits and you were given time off when you needed it and were paid for it as well. The management does ask alot at times but that's expected.
good,"Fast, Fun and Friendly!!"
good,"The day always started with a goal or work task that I always looked forward to starting and finishing by the end of the day or week if it was a large task that took more than a day."
good,"Target is a place where you can have fun and at the same learn and grow and become a great leader."
good,"Target is a fun environment with the right employees.  When I began I absolutely loved my job, my guests and it was a fun place to work.  They changed out Store Managers every 18 months, a practice they have now stopped, and new managers were introduced to the store.  It was no longer a fun environment but a numbers game.  Employees were asked to work later to help out and cut the overtime later, there was little appreciation from the management directly and you were often told what you were doing wrong and rarely what you were doing correct.  This caused a high turn over and a temporary environment which made it less of fun work environment."
good,"Made many friends of co-workers and supervision.  Time passed quickly.  Enjoyed greeting people on the checkout lanes, answering questions and sometimes solving problems.  The hardest part of the job was asking the guests if they had a Target red card (charge card) and having to badger them with reasons to apply for one. I had no problem with the initial asking, but we were told not to take no for an answer, and that bothered me a great deal."
good,"Decent place to work. Good management, good pay, strong belief in teamwork. As long as you did the work and met your required times there was no problems."
good,"working as cashier ringing out customer, check in/out patient after visit with ARNP, verifying insurances, cleaning and stocking exams rooms."
good,Enjoyed my time at Target and worked perfectly with my schedule outside of work. Was able to work and spend time with family. The people I worked with were fantastic as well and we all worked as a team.
good,"As my first job I just found that retail wasn't for me, but I do appreciate them for getting me out of my comfort zone. They push red cards super hard and decide to have a chat with you about them everyday. The hours given to the cashiers very. You may work 15 hours or you may work 30 its a gamble."
good,"A good company to gain experience. The culture is ""fast, fun and friendly."" The people are positive and work well together."
good,Target has great benefits.  But does not pay well unless you are in management and is very hard to get into management.  But it is a fun place to work.
good,"I was a Sales Associate. I worked 15-24 hours a week because I was a minor."
good,It was a decent place to work for seasonal work. Had to stock shelves interact with customers and make sure the store was presentable. Kept busy most days with little time to sit around.
good,I worked there through the holidays and it was a fun job. The management  treated us like equals. The management at other places usually act like you are working for them not alongside them as a team. You work as a team. I loved working there.
good,"Overall, this was an entry level job. The experiences I had there were memorable, and the people quite friendly. My only gripe with the atmosphere was the consistent push towards selling Red Cards, going as far as to being told to annoy guests if I had to. That being said, this type of required action is expected with a cooperation so expansive, and even with the included questionable practices, the people I worked with were bright, warm, and brilliant."
good,"I learned multiple positions and tasks. "
good,Target located in Northfield shopping center is growing at a fast pace amd the money comes in from their food departments but yet they seem to not care as they don't hire enough people to get the job done.
good,This is an amazing job to have. The atmosphere is amazing between the guests and the people who work there it makes for a great place to work. The hardest part of the job would have to be how busy the store is. It is a very high volume store.
good,"Not many bad things I can say about the place other than everyone expects more than the backroom people can dish out. Fast moving job, decent hours, just the Team Leads could use more training."
good,A typical day at work is usually quick and sometimes hectic.  I learned quickly how to work in a team setting. Management is fair and most times let workers alone.  The hardest part of the job was being pulled into many directions at once.  The most enjoyable part of the job are the people I get to work with.
good,"Bright, energetic management team. The scale of the national operation required close compliance to documented best practices. That's a great thing unless there is a better way to operate, in which case, change was difficult to implement."
good,It's a nice job to have while in school but not as a career. It was not a very hard job but you are challenged every day with new experiences. The pay is good and if you are full time there are good benefits.
good,"Target is a more professional establishment as far as retail goes. I spent 15 years working for the company. Retail is retail, although they aren't created equal."
good,"it can be busy and slow depending on the day. Friendly staff, i made a lot of friends here. Benefits are decent. Its minimum wage of course. You can work all different areas if your willing to learn."
good,Its an ok place to work. The work gets tiresome and redundant after a while but its self explanatory work. you put your head down and finish the task.
good,"This was my fist job. It allowed me to ease my way into the bigger picture of life but ultimately, the leadership didn't promote well."
good,"Everyday work was simple and manageable, I learned tons of useful skills, such as dealing with irritated guests. The management could be better, but I believe it was a single store incident. The most enjoyable part of the job were most definitely my fellow team members. The hardest part of the job was how late we stayed open because we often didn't get out till 11:40. Workplace culture was really good."
good,Target has a great workplace culture which I find to be the most enjoyable part of the job. The management team strives to create a friendly but professional work environment that benefits each team member as well as the guests.
good,"early 8 am shifts in the warehouse bringing out products to the floor. nice pay, several breaks, good discounts, great people. simple easy light work. set hours, always opportunities to get more hours."
good,"Target is a good place to work because it a great fun, friendly environment. the company make you feel at home and most people they hired usually have good attitudes and what to achieve the goals set out for there team."
good,"Stock rotation"
good,"I quit my job at the station to work here because I was offered more hours, benefits and better pay. I don't mind working here but of course it's a not a lucrative job. It's a good job if you want to make a little bit of money especially for high schoolers. The work-life balance varies depending on how many hours you request and it's not always guaranteed hours unless you're full time. For me because I had to fend for myself for bills, I have to work 30-35 hours a week and it definitely screwed with my social life to the point of depression. Not saying it's a bad job but, I would only work this place if you're not paying bills and want to maintain a work-life balance."
good,"Enjoyed working at target, great culture, sometimes poor management decisions.  Poor compensation and benefits.  Team member discount always a plus"
good,Some department are very physical.the job training is slow for the first 30 days because the turnover rate of new hired. The Equipment certification start usually after 30 days of  employment.
good,Be prepared to make new friends and a family that will stick with you for a long time. There is almost nothing bad about working at target. The customers are super friendly and easy to help. Work is actually fun as long as you talk and interact with people. It's a job definitely worth applying.
good,Despite Target being a retail job which has the stigma of being an annoying job that has to deal with tough customers. I was always welcome and felt like I was home. Fun environment and management was very nice.
good,I worked for Target during Christmas time. It was very busy and I liked the people I worked with. I have a new respect for retail workers. This job was only seasonal.
good,"No opportunity to move up in company but the pay and benefits are good, and the people are nice to work with."
good,Word hard to consistently ensure a positive shopping experience for each and every guest. Always and enjoyable day of work
good,Worked hard and performed all of the duties they asked me to do and above.Hardest part of the job was trying not to stand around to do nothing. Co-workers wre the greatest part of my job there.
good,Decent job. Fun sometimes when you are given something to do. If you're applying seasonal dont expect a lot of hours. Be prepared to be let go at the end of your seasonal work as well.
good,It was a good place to work when i first came to the united states.  I got to communicate and work with all different kinds of people.  The hours were never consistent which was the hard part of the job
good,"The Job is fast paced and quick, some days are simple and easy going and the others are hard and long. They are good about working around your schedule."
good,"Target taught you a mix of everything you need to know for the retail environment. Co-workers are very friendly. I learned stocking, how to work a cash register, customer service skills. The hardest part is dealing with stressed or angry customers, and how to handle the situation. The most enjoyable aspect is when you make a customer feel happy"
good,"Overall Target has been a great stepping stone in terms of work after high school for me. The managers and the fellow team members are understanding and kind. The compensation is good for what the work is. There are intense moments in the job which is quite alright. However, the scheduling can become very grueling. Sometimes working up to 9 days in a row and then having only one day off and having completely inconsistent hours. Although it is retail and odd scheduling is expected, I feel it sometimes goes to extremities. This is an example of management sometimes not looking closely at individuals week to week or day to day schedule but rather if the amount of hours checks out."
good,Target does a great job training and exposing its leaders to many different aspects of supply chain and constantly pushes its leaders to drive their development.
good,"Working for the target backroom is certainly good if you desire to take a step into a more stressful work environment, especially during the holidays. Along with everyday tasks expected of you, you're also needed to pull items and put them into holds for customers, and pull items to pack and ship to other locations. The quantity of orders is enough to force a sense of urgency in team members."
good,When we first get to work we have a safety meeting each morning and then get our duties for the day. We have a quota we need to meet each day to make sure our customers are satisfied.
good,"typical day 12pm-7am "
good,"-Work was pretty fun, typically busy but fun."
good,"My typical day of work starts with walking in and clocking in using my team member. I then grab the necessary equipment which consists of a walkie talkie, myDevice and/or PDA. I head to my assigned position and start completing my work assigned for the day."
good,"Target is a good company to work for, depending on the store.  The first store I worked at, prior to being promoted, was the best. The managers really do what is necessary to assist guests and team members.  However, the second store I went to, team members' well being was not a priority to the managers.  It operated more like a Wal-Mart.  If you get lucky enough to work at a store that really operates according to Target Brand standards in its entirety, you will never want to leave."
good,"I was a cashier for a year and a half and it wasn't bad. The minimum wage was $8 an hr when I was hired but it had been raised to $10 before I quit earlier this year.The hardest part of the job was selling the Target RedCard to customers and it was pretty much the only way to get recognized as a cashier. Benefits are good, and they include holiday pay and (I think) insurance. The reason I quit was because there weren't any opportunities for me to change positions the entire time I worked there and it felt like everyone else was moving up except me. Management was okay but not the absolute best. The best part was working with the customers. If I went beyond their expectations, they voiced it and it would make me feel great."
good,Loved working there when it first opened in moore. After about 8 months all the managers started to transfer or leave for other jobs/ positions. They brought in rude managers who didnt respect the employees.
good,Fun place to work and managers were super nice. Benefits were surprisingly great but the pay is really awful for the amount of work. I was able to move around in many different positions while I was there.
good,"I always was happy with the enviornment at target, eveyone was always happy and I never felt like I was working more than was necessary."
good,"Enjoyed my time greatly with the company, the work environment is fun and fast. Growth opportunities are few and far between, growth stops at how you are viewed by other departments"
good,"I enjoyed working for this company. Even though theres always room for improvement within the company overall it was a fun friendly workplace. Management was sometimes challenging to talk to, but for the most part when you were able to talk to them your voice was heard."
good,"A great place to work for if you are looking for a first job or want to be a higher up. Pretty hard to move up with this company. Not many manager positions open up. Been working for Target for 5 years now. A typical day at work is to help the ""guests"" find what they are looking for. Stock shelves. Also make the aisle presentable. Main priority for this company is to make the ""Guests"" happy and make them return to the store."
good,"Typical stocking job, unload the truck and stock the products. Decent pay compared to a lot of stocking jobs. no overtime allowed though."
good,"Working at Target has given me friendships that I will have a lifetime. I truly enjoyed the work I did. The company offers benefits to full time employees. The hours are flexible. The 'uniform' red and Khaki. Any shades will do. That is nice. If you hear people complain about working there, it is because of a personality conflict they have had. No ones fault, just personality conflicts. "
good,"Target is a great company to start working for , or if you need something between jobs. I learned how to manage my time to complete my workload on a timely and correct manner as well as how to manage customers effectively."
good,"Target was a great company to work with as a starter job, some Executives are great and some are not. Work load was sometimes very large but a great team helped out."
good,As my first retail job it opened my eyes to different career opportunities. I was able to cross train and mov into different departments rather quickly.
good,I absolutely loved working for Target in my earlier years. It gave me great skills with customer service. I made so many great friends that I still have relationships with to this day and now call my family. My only problem was it was not full time and the pay was not enough to  live on but a great beginner job for someone who is going to school. I would have loved to continue career growth with this company but they wouldn't work you up without a college degree regardless on  your time and experience with them.
good,loved working here and loved the team members that worked there. always fast and motivated to get goals reached on a fast time line. and i also loved the smell of the candies/chocolates..mmm...
good,With the right people on board the job was always fun. Work was fast and you had to be upbeat. I would say all in all this was a great place to work.
good,"my workday would start 4:30 p.m it was about a three minute walk to clock in to an out of the workplace the break rooms were very awesome with plenty of vendors as well as back patio as for the work environment it was overall awesome ,management could be somewhat unorganized at times"
good,I am a very hard worker. I am always busy. My co-workers are kind. I am dealing with customers all day and their service. It is very hard standing in one spot all hours and lifting heavy things. I enjoy working with cash handling.
good,"A typical day at work would be checking in vendors and communicating with them, shipping out mail and recyclables. Also checking in inventory that's comes through via ups, fed ex, fed ex express, etc."
good,"great company and great pay for hard work, hands on experience with equipment and a great idea of how the company works, understanding of day to day operations and set schedule for whats to be done each day"
good,"-first I would follow up with each front end individual, check/fix break schedule to fit opening/closing needs"
good,"good compensation/benefits"
good,Seems to be headed in the wrong direction with less focus on customers and more focus on shareholder profits. Employee hours are the collateral damage for this new direction.
good,I enjoyed my two years at target but you were worked very hard and trained very little. There were very few benefits till you've been there for over a year.
good,"Loved the people I worked with and the work in my field that I was doing, however you are required to work every other weekend and late nights sometimes.  You're also required to manage the store multiple times a week."
good,"I met some great people by working at Target. The management does not always seem to know what they are doing including the corporate supervisors. Often, the idea of growth in the financial department overshadows the employee care."
good,"In this job, I've learned the inner workings of a big department store like Target. A typical day at work consists of helping customers with what they need, stocking up the shelves, answering questions about Electronics and more. The management was great and was always there to help us. My co-workers were very friendly and always made the job so much easier for me. The most enjoyable part of this job is the people around me. They made work really fun to do and productive at the same time."
good,"Target has been one of the best places I've worked. I've worked hard to get where I am at today with the company, but there are many downsides. I see people around me who aren't happy, a low hours for a majority of the people. I love what I currently do, which is setting planograms and pulling product from the back room then stocking the aisles I set, but I'd like to look for other opportunities."
good,My co-workers were all very friendly and willing to lend a hand. Supervisors and managers made me feel like family with their friendliness and guidance.
good,"My career at target started out fantastic, I was given support from all of my coworkers and the management, but the longer I was there the support fell, they put a lot of pressure on two people, and I am in college so when I put in the days that I could not work my hours were dropped way below what i was expecting, they only put me on with minimum shifts. Almost trying to get me to leave. Well they won that battle I am actively looking for a new job. I would not recommend working for target unless you are willing to devote your life to target."
good,I love the people who worked with me but sometime they dont communicate with me about the next plan or if there is emergency. I normally work in the backroom and I gather all the stocks stuff and be ready for another team member to stock every at the front. Communicate was always the problem. My management always get upset with me about something that I didn't know and no one told me.
good,My average work day would start with me going upstairs and putting my things in my locker. Then i would punch in 5 minutes before the start of my shift. I walk downstairs to the store and go straight to my supervisor to see which register they need me on. I turn on my light and begin my shift.  There is regular interactions between co-workers and supervisors. A major part of the job was to promote and sell the Target Red Card program which was a debit card linked to the customers' checking account. The card gave customers five percent off of most items in the store including Starbucks.My co-workers were very reasonable and easy to work with and gave you incentives to put forth your best effort. The most difficult part of the job was dealing with the card machines and chip readers. They seemed to give customers nothing but problems and it was hard to identify and fix each one without help from my supervisor.
good,"Overall a fun place to work. Good People, Good management. The corporate figures were unfriendly and set expectations for sales floor team members too high. They could practice what they preach and say hello to their employees and guests."
good,Work environment was normally well managed and management effectively engendered a team spirit. The amount of work expected could be intense but the processes involved were very straightforward.
good,"Working at Target can be an amazing experience; and on most days it is. It's the only retail job I looked forward to working. The location at which I worked had unfortunately (as is the case in most corporate retail locations) been underemployed and expect too much out of too little. The management system is a wonderful system (though only when followed correctly), and works well when fully staffed."
good,"Target is my favorite place to be, also most  of my dresser, home goods, gifts and more are the first place I choose."
good,"Worked for several years there, In the beginning things were a little frustrating and very fast paced but once I got the routine down, I began to really enjoy serving people in the customer service setting."
good,"Lorsque j'arrivais à mon emploi j'aimais l'ambiance qui s'en dégagée , c'était ma deuxieme famille , je quittais mon domicile pour rejoindre mon lieu de travail où je me sentais très alaise avec mes collègues qui sont vite devenus des amis. Ils m'ont ''coaché'' d'une manière qui m'a permis d'avancer dans le domaine du travail et sur le plan personel."
good,"As an ETL you are expected to work 5 10-hour days every other weekend. As with any company, you get in what you put out and there are plenty of opportunities for growth and advancement, primarily if you are relocatable."
good,I loved the opportunity to work here for the benefits but half of the managers are unprofessional and talk about their employees all day long. Along with some of the rudest customers to go along with it.
good,There was a lot of change in management.  There was not a strong sense of unity or group goals for the store.  I wish there was better communication.  Training was good.
good,"The best shift of my typical work week were closing shifts. However, the most convenient experience was guiding guests on store information."
good,When you first start working there its a bit confusing but just like any other job you get used to it. Remember to be organized and use time management skills to stay on top of your duties. Management is touch and go you'll have good and bad managers and from time to time you'll have amazing managers and horrible ones as well. Show initiative and you will get noticed. Over all its a good work environment with really good people.
good,"A typical day at target was checking out the guest and being reminded to tell all the guest about the 5% off debit/credit card. In target I learned how to perform better communication skill and how to become a little more persuasive. My co workers were amazing and so were management. They always told me they can sit me in a room full of strangers and I'll become best friends with them. The most enjoyable part about the job was feeling the excitement of getting red cards back to back, its like you accomplished something."
good,Target is a place with a good opportunity to see what your skill set is weather it is cashiering to sales floor and also to try and do a manager spot weather it be for a short time or a full time spot. The days at target can sometimes go nice and quick to some very long days. must be able to socialize with people on a regular basis.
good,Work day is pretty much the same from day to day. Each department has their job tasks to complete on a daily basis. The management is thoughtful and do their best to provide a good work environment. The co-workers all get along and make the work day go by quickly.
good,"Target was a great place to work, however the managers would threaten my job because my friend did not show up. They trained you very well for you job. If you do not like a fast pace then this job would be difficult for you because they constantly have you on your toes. The people who work there are really nice and friendly, The hardest part of the job is trying to get everything done in time before your shift is done."
good,"Target, like most retail store's, has its up and downs, but I find that if you have a positive attitude then the guests will too.  "
good,"Target was a wonderful opportunity for me to branch out in a multitude of different work-centers for me to find what best suited my working style."
good,"Day to day work is easy and fun. Hard to find challenges and continue to be challenged. I most enjoy the team that I oversee as they all are very fun, work hard to be able to get our guests out quickly. I really enjoy the diversity within the company."
good,there is no typical day in target everything changes day by day. one thing you can always expect at work is fast pace working system.
good,"Target is a great place to work. You get to have interactions with all kinds of different people. My co-workers are the best part. Management is okay, some are wonderful. The greatest thing about Target is the Fast Fun and Friendly events. Basically, we have food in the break room all the time. They feed you when you work overnights, the day before Easter, Christmas Eve, and Black Friday."
good,"the work day of the job was great. come into work clock in an head to the back of the store to start unloading the truck."
good,I worked overnight to restock shelves. Used pallet jack to bring merchandise to shelf location and broke down boxes afterwards. Had many good co-workers
good,I was unloading tucks and stocking shelves at Target.  The work environment was productive and we got many things done in the allotted time.  The co-workers were great with helping make the day go smoothly and also getting the goals for the night reached.
good,"Before becoming CVS pharmacy, Target was a company that believed in team work. Target valued their employees, provided family-work life balanced, recognized a team member's accomplishments, and built strong teams."
good,Target is a great and fun environment to work in. Everyone is supportive and really takes the time to get to know you. Target understands that it is not a forever job for everyone and are extremely helpful when a team member is looking for new employment. Management is a little screwy. You have so many different Leader on Duty's that you can get confused as to who to talk to when you have a problem. Overall Target is a great place to start out.
good,Great APS very knowledgeable and experienced.They do a very good job training you and show you lots of tactics.Pay could be better but good company to gain experience with.
good,"I worked as sales at the athletic center of Target. Where daily activities would include helping out customers find the items they need."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help others when they come in the store. I learned that it is important that the customer enjoys their visit and return to the store.
good,Lots of activities for the employees. Great culture. Many opportunities to lean from all the different departments. Great company overall.
good,"You go in clock out go inside the warehouse stretch then wait for your position. Work for 12 hours, then clock out. "
good,"Target is an amazing place to start off your retail experience.  They love hiring people without much experience so they can mold you into their brand.  Which is a really good thing.  You have to learn a lot in a very short amount of time so it isn't for everyone."
good,"When I worked at Target, I enjoyed the challenges as well as the culture that was there.  On an average day I would support the DC as well as the staff and the equipment that helped to run the DC.  Worst part of working for Target was the day they terminated all the on site technology support and outsourced it all."
good,"Work is just fun and no pressure "
good,"well, This is a nice workplace and nice people. This job has some difficulties. It is really physical exhausting and we have to work 8 hours."
good,"very happy place to work. Great people and stay very busy."
good,"My personal experience there was overall ok. I didn't have any problem with the work load or my fellow team members. The only problem I had was the executives of the company. They often wouldn't schedule or showed favoritism to the employees that, they preferred."
good,"A typical day at Target included bringing shopping carts back into the store, helping my co-workers bring appliances up to the registers and helping customers with their groceries.  I learned how to control the carts as I was pushing them through the parking lot, so that I could avoid hitting other vehicles and to manage the carts through harsh conditions in  the weather.  The management at  Target treated me very well and I enjoyed working with them and valued their opinions of my work at Target.  My co-workers at Target were very nice and I enjoyed working with them and helping them out whenever they needed it, as well as them helping me out whenever I needed it.  The hardest part of working at Target were some of the customers that came into the store, because no matter how nice I had treated them, they did not want my help at any time, so I said have a good day and moved on.  The most enjoyable part of working at Target were the friendships I had with my co-workers and working as hard as I could to get the carts into the store."
good,"The team members were nice, but the leads were a bit pushy. Or rather, a bit pushier than they should be. relatively easy tasks, but the work load given was extremely unrealistic. Even though it was widely understood that""goals"" had to be met at the end of the work day, some of the higher ups weren't very understanding that there is but so much the human body can do in 5, 6, or 8 hour shifts."
good,"Repetitive"
good,"Target is good, I learned a lot over the past year I've been working for them, management although has changed, lost a lot of great managers that brought the business up. Some of hard parts of the job such as pleasing all of the guests. The most enjoyable part is when someone tells you how great you are doing, me on the other hand take the most pride of the compliments"
good,"i loved target , benefits and working with a bunch of other people in a big store. i learned how to multitask very well, i loved serving the clients there they were all friendly."
good,"-Great place to work, will work with your school schedule etc."
good,Target was a great place to work until the CEO who was in place during the credit card breach took over.  He systematically forced experienced leaders out of the company to trim payroll.  This started from upper management then worked its way down to the department managers at stores.  This resulted in a dearth of leadership that the company is just now starting to recover from.
good,"I really loved working for Target. Everyone there was extremely competent at their job, pleasant to work with, and listened to the problems of others. Management was always fair and attentive. Scheduling was accommodating to personal needs, and I always felt like I could talk to someone if I needed help or a problem solved."
good,Fun and nice place to work at. I have great team members that keep work at a enjoyable level. Not to mention the team leaders are great and very understanding people. I would say one of my favorite teams to work with!
good,At Target you have the opportunity to become a great leader using your skills and abilities to lead talent and drive results. Hard work pays off and recognition is given to those who not only excel in there work center but help others excel in theirs as well. The culture is great and it is a fun environment to work in.
good,"i loved working at target. the only things i didn't like was the hours. I was not able to get a whole shift, i would get 4-5 hr shifts. last i didn't like how there was a supervisor that would make fun of african-american people. I loved all the other mangers/supervisors. They really cared if something was wrong. they also had a woman who would come in 2 times a week to help employees find housing or any other problems in their life."
good,I loved working for Target. But i wish there was more room to advance in the company. Management is great and they really know how to treat there employees.
good,"Do your work and you'll be fine.  Don't do your work and you'll hear about it.  No one will cover your butt, you need to do that yourself.  It's fun work and guests shopping here are almost always in a good mood."
good,Arriving and going straight into customer satisfaction mode always occurred here. Learning to interact with guest and bagging skills. Management was very strict here. Co-workers were all nice and friendly. Hardest part of job was bouncing between every lane when not enough baggers. Most enjoyable part was seeing everyone I know around the town.
good,Great work environment with fun employees. I worked in Guest Services for eight years and there was only plenty to do.  The most enjoyable part of the job was to interact with our guests and help them with what they needed.  The worst part was not having enough training hours to teach others how to do my job effectively.
good,"·	Verifier les produits etiquettes"
good,"I truly enjoyed working at Target under my Team Lead. He was very helpful, understanding, and enjoyable to be around. If I had the chance I would absolutely work for him again."
good,"Target is a fast, fun and friendly place to work. The pay wasn't superb  but when times were busy, such as holiday season, many hours and overtime was issued. Overall decent place to work, typical retail job."
good,It's a fun place to work and friendly people to work with. The hardest part of the job was the start trying to wake up and get going so fast have to be ready to go once you are there. Most enjoyable part would be knowing the store and being able to help customers right away.
good,I had no issues with this job. The only reason I left is my husband changed colleges and we moved. The only issue I had was there was little room for advancement because the same manager had been there for years and planned on retiring from that location. This is not a bad thing because it shows that she loved her job.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working for Target. I got to meet and greet new people each day as a cashier. "
good,I enjoy the positive environment and making personal moments with guest. I also enjoy the positive feedback and leadership from team members and leaders.
good,"Loved working in the bakery and learning new things everyday"
good,"Target was a fun and friendly place to work. It was fast pace so the day went be quickly. Co-workers were friendly, most of the team leaders were friendly and helpful. The pay wasn't great, but i was making enough to get by. The only reason I left is because they cut the hours for my team."
good,"it was a great place to work to bad it did not stay longer. Thunder Bay was the top 10 stores in Canada, and I am glad I got to be a part of such a wonderful experience."
good,"It's a good in between job. Some days you management makes you feel like you might actually be promoted someday then other days, your hours get cut."
good,"immediate boss is easy to work with, can be a stressful job when its busy, everybody is nice, willing to work with your school schedule"
good,"Start my work day with our daily meeting of events along with our small workout to stretch ourselves to minimize work injury. my daily routine followed self made carts of the consumer's order in which i had to fill by finding the products throughout my designated area. along with that replenish was my second duty when finished, where shipment from other target stores would come in. i'am to open, scan the products LPN and place where it belongs."
good,"good job! "
good,I was only seasonal at target so cant really tell you much about this company; however I was in the overnight flow team in which is filled with hard working people I cant really say anything about the management because I never really saw them doing anything that involved hard labor. They have no exceptions with pregnant women I was 6 months pregnant when I got hired seasonal for this company and I was still required to unload the trucks and care heavy boxes to there designated areas never once did the management help nor transferred me to any other department. Over all they give you good hours pay isn't so bad
good,"A typical day at work would consist of me getting there before my scheduled time, I would clock in, grab my equipment and head to the floor. I had to grab a cart full of things that had to be stocked on shelves, when doing so I usually would get stopped by a guest that was looking for help, after a few hours of working I'd go on a short break then get back to work depending on how long I worked it would determine if I had a lunch break as well. When it was my time to head out I would clock out and say my goodbyes for the night and head home."
good,"I enjoyed my term at Target."
good,"Unload truck within a tight time windows. "
good,Working for target is ok. Not really different than any other large retail store. I enjoy the management team. They are awesome!
good,I like working for target the management and team members are easy to get along with and they work with you if you are attending school classes or need a day off. Overall a good place to work for.
good,"Good for seasonal, enjoyed it while I worked there. Well managed and picked up plenty of hours. Was seasonal and helped added a few more bits to my experience."
good,"This is a good job to have as a first timer, or secondary job, or for those who would like to advance to the top. The Team leaders are great and the team are fun to work with."
good,"I would work at the register all day, sometimes there would be candy to put away. I learned that I cannot stand in one spot for a whole 8 hours, I need to move around. Some of the managers were good but some would not listen to me when I told them that I could not stand in one spot for the whole 8 hours anymore. The coworkers were good people and were willing to help everyone out. The hardest part was standing in one spot all day and not aloud to help other departments. The most enjoyable part was the people I worked with"
good,This job really made me feel welcomed and liked. I had to work hard to gain the respect of my managers but I enjoyed every minute of it. The managers were very caring and helped you out when you needed it.
good,"My job there was simple and I felt i could work comfortably once i got the hang of everything, It wasn't dependent mainly on customers, it depended on how hard you worked which i enjoyed."
good,"Pleasant management . Strong team . Theyre always showing employee appreciation , they work with your schedule and are always helpful when it comes to questions or assistance at work . Positive environment."
good,"Each day always starts with a smile, learned that I am stronger and more capable then I thought, the hardest part of the job is that I have to have a smartphone with me at all times( 24/7 )and the missed family time. reaping the rewards of hard work and dedication is the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Overnights at Target are tough, but fun.  Speed is definitely your friend as you fly through the fast paced truck unload.  After you move the full pallets to the floor, you begin the rapid push process.  Management usually jumps in to help.  The hardest part of the job is definitely the schedule itself, as humans are not meant to be nocturnal, but in the end, the paycheck makes you smile."
good,Target was a good starting position right out of college. I was able to carry my leadership roles from playing sports my whole life to the work environment.
good,"Having worked here so long, I have seen many people come and go, but each of them have always been fun to work with. a typical day  is kind of hard if we are short staffed, but we manage to get it done."
good,"A typical day at work would be me organizing or creating an aisle, printing out labels, pinpointing locations for items,and then constant stocking. I learned the layout of the store and how to use the company computer for making labels, sales, and locations for product. Management was ordinary, five or six people wander the store at different intervals asking questions, assisting, or disciplining the employees. My coworkers hit the perfect balance between a worker and a friend to others. The hardest part of the job were the shift times, often starting at 4:00 AM and ending towards 12:30 PM. The most enjoyable part was the continuous work that was presented, often resulting in no dull moments."
good,"Working at Target in their technical support call center, defied any traditional wisdom on helpdesk jobs. While the culture is corporate, individuality is encouraged and respected. While the work is repetitive the training isn't limited, and there is always new skillsets to learn, new projects to undertake, and new ways to benefit your team and you. As an example while you might be assigned to handle only calls regarding printers, you may very well end up learning about the server and networking infrastructure of the company, which will lead to you having real world applicable knowledge in IT, as well as hands on experience with the actual equipment. Maybe you just worked on a new initiative? Congratulations! You may even be asked to assist with the project team in documenting, the actual technical specs and work, as well as best practices and policies and procedures. Also, now you've just made invaluable contacts within the company and industry. "
good,"A typical work day consist on me cashiering, working in guest service, or working in the Starbucks area preparing drinks and food items. The most enjoyable part of my jobs is the connection I make with my customers and also my co-workers make my job more enjoyable."
good,"If you don't work ""Fast, fun and friendly"" (FFF) all the time, it will usually result in having a difficult day. If you can complete your work with the ""FFF"" attitude, then usually you wont have any problems. Workloads depend on the size of the trucks and how efficient your co-workers are."
good,"A leading retail company with a pulse on current trends and a strong focus on guest experience. Management offers a challenging but mostly satisfying opportunity for those who are self motivated and globally minded. Culture is diverse across all levels of employment, and the company presents itself as a fun place to work. The greatest fulfillment comes to those who genuinely engage with guests, which turns just another retail job into one where you can feel as if you make a difference to those you help."
good,Co-workers were the people who made the environment the best place to be in. From the jokes to the advice they could give to one and another really made it feel like home.
good,"It was a fast-paced work environment with encouraging co-workers and peers. It was definitely very challenging, because there were a lot of days where you weren't able to complete all of the tasks by closing while also doing backup cashier. However, City Target at Chicago was very good about creating a culture of encouragement among the workers."
good,Fun place to work but limited growth in the company. New management really didn't have an understanding of how retail really works outside of what they learned in college and therefore there was high turnover with management.
good,"I was hired for Chargeback Processing. I dealt with returns and Exchanges and had to either destroy or send off to companies that would repair and send back for us to put back on the floor. Someone else ended up taking that job and I was put on the floor during the week doing cashiering, Hanging up signs, Stocking Shelves/Zoning,  and on weekends I would do Chargeback Processing. I think if I left the music off I would have done a better job. It distracted me from doing my job properly."
good,Good part time work. Can be stressful during the holiday season. Variety of pace and tasks. Flexible hours and understanding managers.
good,"Target is a fantastic corporation for a young professional to start with. They compensate incredibly well and allow you to expand your skill sets daily. You will be able to have fun while working hard, which I personally feel is a great asset for companies to have."
good,It really enjoyed working for a place where the management was very friendly and treated people with respect. I would definitely recommend it for someone looking for a good company to work for.
good,Great open working areas allowing employees to be mobile within the building-creative working spaces. People very supportive and available for questions and training.
good,"I love working here and i really like the staff. The new Executive Team Leader Human Resources has cut my hours with out reason, explanation or for warning. I need at least 40 hours a week."
good,It's a good atmosphere to work in with plenty of people to help and answer any questions you may have. My day starts at 6:00 am. I have learned how to pack and am constantly working on improving my speed. My co workers are great individuals who are more than happy to help. The hardest part of my job is constantly moving at a fast past all day long. The enjoyable part of my day is when I am getting my numbers and the day is going good.
good,"Target is a very collaborative environment with the best people I've ever worked with.  It's culture has changed in recent years to become much more about 'Getting Stuff Done', and accountability as opposed to the 'Fast, Fun, and Friendly model that tended to focus more on attitude than results.  In 2015 the working model is changing towards a Dev/Ops Model, both in development and Infrastructure, which led to a series of layoffs while the organization changed to fit the model.  I expect that most of the major changes are over and Target will again begin to attract the best talent in retail."
good,Nice work/life balance and opportunity to grow.  Enjoyed the opportunity to work in a collaborative environment allowing for productivity.
good,"I enjoyed my stay at Target Corporation a lot.  I love the people, co-workers, and management.  I got along well with everyone, felt accepted and belonged to a team.  The cash register was easy to learn and very helpful.  Guests were mostly pleasant and friendly.  I have done my best to my knowledge with out grumble.  Except when they lowered my hours and yet hired new people.  Made me question the politics of company.  I have learned a whole lot."
good,when i was there it was going in to new management and it was going well but the fitting room was not together at all people just take what they wont then they say its nothing we can to about it not cool
good,Great place to work if you can put up with bad management. Cross training was very good and easy to learn. Didn't really like pushing the red card but ehh.
good,"A typical Cashier day was ringing up sales for customers and cleaning Bathrooms.  I loved that job, but they had to let me go due to insufficient funds from the Black Friday Sale."
good,Target is a great company to work for. Everyone is friendly and outgoing. The hardest part of the job was the hours and the most enjoyable part was the people I worked with.
good,working at target i became more independent and a lot more social. that job helped me break out of my shell and get to know a lot of people on the daily basis. that was one of my favorite jobs and the only reason i left was due to the lack or pay and benefits.
good,Early morning shift was the best part. management across different stores need more balance. easy job to go to school full time too.
good,I love the company overall but they seem to not want to let me grow within so it's time to grow without. After over many years it is now time to move on.
good,"Target is a very friendly and professional work environment. A typical day in my experience was a busy one.The location I worked at on an average day I would work at least 3 different departments. Which I loved it kept things interesting. I learned that Target walks the extra mile for their consumer. In they're words ""guest"". The guest always comes first no matter how long it takes. Target does not believe in making guest feel like they have to wait or stress with their shopping experience. Target believes in employees having freedom of expression piercing, different hair colors etc.. I really enjoyed my coworkers. Target's philosophy is to encourage and empower each other at work. We would have daily meetings and co-workers would each take turns acknowledging different positive acts that took place to make everyone work experience a good one. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was getting a head start on buying clearance items and free food a lot of times. The hardest part of the job was the salary. The salary doesn't match the quality of work and service employees provide. Overall I really enjoyed my time working for Target and have kept in contact with a lot of my co-workers."
good,"Work three, twelve hour , night shifts packing and sorting for target. During this time you get 2 breaks in between the whole shift."
good,"Fast paced"
good,"a typical day at work was always interesting, the customers were always bringing something new. There were crazy people and fairly nice people. The break room always had a different theme, which was amazing."
good,I learned so much about recruiting and how to sell the company/benefits.  I got the opportunity to travel extensively and bring great talent on board.
good,"That is what Target is attempting to do but most of the time falling short. Right now, everyone in the store works in order to be successful. While Target has figured out most geographical locations, it still has not figured out the Northeast guest. Specifically lower New York. Alot of turnover, politics determines advancement in some situations. It is extremely difficult to manager employees with very liberal HR teams but conversely, as a salary manager, it is easier to be termed. It is much like any other retailer in workload and expectations."
good,"Most days are fast, and simple. Good leadership is needed for the unloading of the trucks in the morning. Without proficient management the job becomes stressful, and highly unorganized. Though their may be downsides, I enjoy my co-workers, and appreciate our efforts to make the company successful."
good,"Typically I would work under-pressure as a presenter, but I liked it sometimes because it was a challenge. I do feel though that the POG team was under compensated for the amount of work required. This may be my only complaint."
good,"A day at target for me is waking up at 4 o'clock in the morning to unload the deliver truck that normally have a load of 1500 minimal, but when there is a special event/holiday we get a high number of 2300 are more. After the heavy lifting is done we divide are share of boxes to key location of the story to place the items in the giving area before the story opens."
good,I worked with the most talented and gifted team in retail.  I would have gladly worked my entire career with one company if layoffs had not occurred for Target Canada.
good,"good place to work, worked as a flow team member, stocking shelves and unloading/loadinvhgnctyctyufbv hjguyf ccxhgcgcgcgcghgoijhknn gbjug fdtrailers"
good,"I wasn't there for very long. I acquired the job during my winter break and the left back for school. So my first job was during the holiday season which I would say is the equivalent of working several months."
good,"Going in to Target I know my job, and I am able to get the job done with no problems. It is a great place to work,and they are very flexible with the  schedules."
good,"Target is a great company trying to find its way within the ever changing world of retail. Target will be successful, but it may take some time to get there."
good,"A typical day at work was pretty laid back. Work was easy and the environment of target was a good one. "
good,"Employees were usually all friendly and great to work with! Supervisors were hard to get in contact with if you needed them, but overall great place to work!"
good,"I really liked this job, I did flow & stock.  Had to move back home and trying really hard to get into a location near home, has been very difficult."
good,"A typical day at Target would be starting our day off with a team huddle, followed by hellos to each team member. Upon saying hello to each team member, whoever's hosting the huddle, usually a LOD, would then call for recognition of a reason why a team member went above and beyond. We would then get our duties for the day and immediately jump into the work load followed by fast paced movement and aiding our guest with specific answers to their questions, concerns and whereabouts."
good,There is not a company out there that gives more back to its team members and community then this one. Many company's could learn from their great culture.
good,"Great company to start your career.  "
good,"Fun, fast and friendly.."
good,"Professional and fun work place. All about work and play, fill in the open positions by the timeline. Open door concept. team huddles when required."
good,"I worked in the bulk section of the backroom. I would pick and put away bulk items in the backroom. I learned how to us walk- behind forklift and how to maintain bulk inventory. The management was friendly, for the most part, and very involved. my co-workers were generally good to work with."
good,"My coworkers and direct supervisors are very friendly. There are plenty opportunities of advancement, just not in the career field I am interested in."
good,"Some days team members will have their good days and some have their bad days, and you can definitely tell. Would have liked it if they would say hi, or ask how i am doing when they walk by, but have seen changes"
good,Working in a fast paced environment and using my job knowledge to help train employees and supervisors has been rewarding but i feel i have not been able to advance in the company as i would have liked.
good,Target is a diverse company and a fun place to work. The company puts a lot of effort into making sure all employees feel comfortable in their work environment.
good,"Typical day at work involves interacting with fun, new, and different people everyday. Management's great, i enjoyed my employment there!"
good,"The day started early and was busy from the start.  Working freight or helping guests.  I learned how to be patient and to work in a stressful environment.  I also learned how to relax and enjoy the conversation of others.  I believed middle management was helpful to each other and their employees.  However some of the upper management was more worried about numbers instead of the people they worked with or helped."
good,"Unloading the truck, usually at 6 AM, there till around 12:30 or one. Stocking the floor with merchandise from the truck and then doing abandons and things sent from other stores. Management is always on the ball on making sure we are doing well and reminding us of the time and telling us how good or poor we are doing that day. My co-workers were very helpful when I first started and we all seem to get along so well there. Hardest part is waking up and then the stocking of shelves gets repetitive. I love working there though, the predictable hours is very nice"
good,"Stocking shelves, making sure there was nothing on the floor. Kept the store clean and tidy. A lot of walking. The management wasnt as expected. Weren't friendly. The hard part came when the holidays came. The people I was employed with became long time friends."
good,Coming into the store and being greeted with a smile by everyone who works in the building is a great feeling. Not being micro managed is such an awesome feeling that management trust and believes in you to handle the task at hand. Stocking or setting up new displays can be a tiring process however with the co-workers that at are on hand make things go by faster. Clean environment and positive attitudes its easy to have a nice and fun day.
good,"the team I worked with had a great upbeat management. Although, the work day can get pretty long when other employees don't do their jobs. Hardest part of the job were those days, other than that, it has a great atmosphere that keeps work days stress free."
good,"City Target is a great store overall, but I don't see myself working there for the rest of my life. A typical day at work for me is simply stocking the floor by putting out items that has been shipped to the store or putting back items that customer no longer wanted to purchase. When the store becomes really busy, I get called to back up at the register as a cashier. I learned that customers can either be really rude or really nice. Sometimes they say or do things that make your day or ruin your day. I get along with some of my co-workers. There are some who are always willing to chat and some who never smile. The hardest part of the job is not being able to locate where things go in the store, especially when a customer asks you for it. The most enjoyable part of the job holding great conversations with the customers."
good,Great company to work for the work culture cultivated a very friendly environment. However the pay isn't all that great and the hours get cut every couple of months.
good,"Target is undergoing significant change.  The culture, which either resonates with you or it doesn't, suited me well.  I wish them future success."
good,"It was very good, I learned how to work with costumers . the management was great, the co-workers were pretty good, the hardest par of that job was in seasonal. it was very fun meeting new people."
good,"Hopefully most targets aren't the same as mine. Management at the Corbin store in horrible."
good,"Has been a long time employee of the company. Have seen a lot of changes: corporate culture, business models, top management, software development/deliver methods, merchandise mixtures.... changes are good."
good,"Usually part time positions available in different areas of the store, which gives the employee flexibility in their scheduling."
good,Fast pace work environment with constant interaction with customers. Definitely an experience that allowed me to learn and perfect my managerial skills.
good,They always focused on safety and quality. They made sure the workers were treated properly and with respect. They always had consistent breaks and also were always open to suggestion to better the work environment.
good,"Target has a very fun, enjoyable work environment when it comes to interaction with team members. The job is well rounded for the most part except when it comes to only making 30 cents more than an electronics team member and you are security, trying to protect all assets within the store. Also lacks the fact that they will not certify myself and select others to apprehend subjects stealing merchandise, but expect me to not let it all be stolen."
good,Very fun environment and very guest service oriented. The culture can be a little bit tough for certain people but overall very enjoyable.
good,"I used to work in the fitting room, on the sales floor, the phones were in the fitting room, I was the store operator, worked as customer service rep, gave information to the customers.  Trained new softline staff. Made all the announcements. I enjoyed doing all that."
good,"Great entry level job that does not require previous experience."
good,"Its a great place to get management experience out of college. Learning and development are important to company, advancement available to those who try, just need to be open to moving around."
good,Target has been a great company to work for over the past 10 years.  Co-workers and pharmacy team are wonderful.  Retail environment is stressful at times.  Pharmacy employees are great- best part of the job!  Just a shame that they decided to merge with CVS.
good,target a great place to work on most days but somedays your ready to leave you can advance very quickly there or if your happy were you are you can stay in one place.
good,Not a bad place to work. Cool and fun atmosphere. Working there is like shopping there at times and can be a bit hectic depending upon the situation.
good,"A typical day would just be me restocking shelves, helping customers, helping on the register as well as replacing items from the return bin. "
good,My day was full of calling and billing insurance for the many scripts that came into our pharmacy. I did every station in that department. It always kept me on my toes.
good,"Target is  a fun place to work team members are Fast,Fun and Friendly which is targets culture,and the customers are  enjoyable,hardest part about my job is not having everybody on the same accord."
good,As soon as I walk into work there's a lot to be done. I help put away all the clothing racks that are by the fitting room section. Also I help customers find what they're looking for.
good,"The employees  strives to learn new skills, but now enough resource  to grow or get the skills they needed"
good,"Target has been a very good career step for my development as a leader.  They are very focused on developing talent within the stores and promoting talent when someone is doing well.  Feedback, both positive and negative is a part of daily life at Target.  This kind of environment can be difficult to manage for some, but if you take it for what it is, the feedback culture can help you grow.  "
good,"There hardly any room for advancement in this job because when you move departments you also take pay cuts. I been at this job for 3 years and i have learned just about every department except the backroom and stocking. I have learned softlines, food service, starbucks, cashier, guest service, fitting room, sales associate, signing and pricing, and some upfront team lead work."
good,"A fun, fast paced environment that is geared toward progress and customer satisfaction. The staff and management at Target in Collierville make this an easy place to work and feel as if I was part of a team."
good,"It was a fun job and had good workers but it had its moments when the hours just wasn't enough, even workers that weren't seasonal, and I had to work twice as hard for a few more hours. They tell you when you can go on break but most of the times they wouldn't tell you so you would get in trouble. But overall I enjoyed it and learned from it."
good,Good Place to work and grow. You are given a free hand to make independent decisions. Overall a nice company to work with.
good,"Target was by far one of the best companies I have worked for, the team culture was amazing we were all one big family its just a shame that we closed down."
good,I have many years as a manager and leader.I pick up things quick and follow rules to a tee.I have been sales most of my life.
good,Good job but very poor work/life balance. Their hiring model is typically hiring kids right out of college who don't know anything different and are more than willing to work the odd hours.
good,would deliver product most of the day and help out in shipping and receiving and help with material handling when needed.
good,I was very busy given anytime of the day. Set captions and headed the electronic department. Target made our jobs fun and exciting offering games and prizes on a regular bases.
good,Learned how to run a logistics team through other leaders.  The day started with unloading truck stocking shelves and at the end making sure the store looked great for the guests.  Writing reviews and coaching's were the hardest for me to do but the most enjoyable was working with all the different team members.
good,"The culture is great! This is a very team oriented company. If you work hard, you will be awarded, but you do have to remember to toot your own horn for your managers to recognize your achievements."
good,insured that all backroom and warehouse operations are correctly maintained and all staff trained to do job functions efficiently...
good,It was a good job oriented place to work. Most of the managers were friendly and easy to talk to. Other workers are friendly and helpful if you are new. A typical day at work would be putting mercchandise on the shelves and help cashier from time to time. The hardest part of the job is closing especially when you have an area with a lot of merchandise to straighten. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was seeing a customer smile after you helped them with something.
good,"Plenty of benefits but my small group and their efforts would constantly go unnoticed. We would have to pick up the slack of the rest of the team but wouldn't get the credit we deserved. It was always brought up in team meetings, but was never resolved. The overnight team, in general, was treated differently. But, i digress, the morning team was very friendly, as well as the store manager.  I only wish we had a team lead like him on our team."
good,Very productive and easy going place to work where management works together wit the employees to push out the inventory throughout the day so all the work is done and the customer is satisfied
good,I was only hired as seasonal help but in my short time there I had good times with both coworkers and management.  We were a solid team that help guest with their shopping.  Even in the slow periods we always could find something to do as a team to make the place better.  We all helped each other so if you were ahead you could help those behind and they could help you in turn when you were behind.  The hardest part of the job was when the higher priced brand name stuff was tried to being push and the market just didn't work for that so it flopped.  That resulted in no seasonal people taken on to stay.
good,"Target was a relaxed, fun place to work at.  You have opportunity to move up and grow with company.  The benefits are excellent.You can advance over time and they will help you with school, as long as the degree pertains to your work."
good,Very passionate workforce with a lot of well performing team members. The average day was very fast paced and exciting.
good,Work was fast and fun. Employee culture gets negative during the holidays. The people are great and if you can get past the long closing shifts it can be an enjoyable place to work.
good,"found good people there, had fun and worked hard for the winter season, it was an overnight job so started at 11 and ended at 7."
good,"Target Canada exemplified the fast, fun, and friendly culture that the parent company is known for. No two days were the same as the work environment was ever-changing."
good,"-A typical day at work was entertaining."
good,"rarely a dull moment if you are looking to get more training,it teaches you to engage with clients and team members on a personal level,the management is decent but at times feels like they choose their favorites, the team members are all friendly, the hardest part of the job is making sure ever client leaves happy no matter what, the most enjoyable part of the job is it can feel like a family."
good,Learned that working as a team gets the job done. Be patient and curtious to your customers. Positive attitudes make a good work environment.
good,"Work filled with helpful management, great team members who taught me versatility in many many areas. When things got tough, even the store manager hopped in and helped work things out."
good,"Cela a été une belle aventure j'y ai rencontré des personnes formidables et appris beaucoup de choses. Même si cela n'a pas abouti, j y ai appris énormément"
good,"Target is a nice place to work, the staff is fun, and friendly. I love the people I work with. The management can feel kind of pressuring, but they are usually great to work with and around schedules."
good,I have enjoyed working there. It has taught me a lot as far as customer service. I did not like having to work holidays because it can get tiring after a while.
good,Target was a great experiance. I loved interacting with the employees as well as the customers. Management was very professional also. This was a great experiance for my first job.
good,"Company was great when I first started.  Then slid downhill under the last CEO.  Some improvements have been made.  Flexible scheduling, but pay is low.  After 6 years of ""Excellent"" and ""Outstanding"" employee reviews, I received a pay raise averaging 30 cents a year."
good,"Target was a great experience. The employees are always there for each other and the managers are always willing to assist.The most enjoyable part of the job is the way the company recognizes their employees often. This recognition builds appreciation,"
good,"Target is a great first job out of college. I have been able to learn so much in such a short amount of time. Target has very high expectations and the retail environment is ever changing. This has aloud me to become a leader that is resilient and adaptable, drive for results, and manage talent."
good,"I began as a cashier. Not a difficult job, and Target was very professional with training and ensuring great customer service. Afterwards, I moved to the food service area. This area requires a lot of multi-tasking, and it seems they never had enough people to work so I was left closing alone for many nights over the holidays. Closing tasks included cleaning all machines and sterilizing all equipment, preparing food for the next day, throwing out expired or expiring foods, logging in anything thrown away for the day, timing foods just right, and having the oven back up because so many food items there had to be baked. The hardest part of the job was how much work you have to do by yourself, and the best part of the job was helping customers have a great experience."
good,"J'ai pu profiter de cette brève période pour en apprendre encore plus sur le travail d'équipe. Commencer une tâche qui sera ensuite terminé par un autre groupe de travail, m'a permis d'améliorer ma communication à tous les niveaux de l'entreprise."
good,A typical day at Target Canada is very quiet except for the weekend although you may work in a certain department you are often told by management to go to other departments(team work). The hourly wage is horrible and there are never any hours for the staff. The co-workers were fun and very helpful.
good,Working at target was a great first job I learned valuable skills that I can carry on with the rest of my life I can talk to people with confidence and learned how to organize and execute plans for the day. I think the biggest cons were how poor the management was and how they were never all on the same page so taking orders from them was very frustrating. Still was a good first job however.
good,"Very good company with very helpful and supportive peers."
good,"Target is a great place to work if you have passion and energy.  If you are willing to give your all on a daily basis, then Target could be a good fit for you.  The culture is very team oriented and can be quite fun (especially if you have a good manager or team leader).  The company also understands the need for a good work/life balance.  However, there are some in leadership positions that don't quite ""get it"" yet.  The compensation is actually pretty good for a retailer.  The wages are comparable to pretty much all other retailers, but where Target earns big points is in their benefits.  Target has a great 401k plan and they are competitive with their health and life insurance (even offering a supplemental life plan worth up to 6X your annual pay).  Many of the managers that Target is hiring recently are barely out of college and do not have any ""real world"" experience.  This sometimes translates to them not understanding or caring about their employees, as they have to focus on the bottom line.  Another downside is that there is little room for any type of real advancement if you don't have a degree.  Overall, Target is a good place to work."
good,"I worked at Target for 7 years. I truly enjoyed the culture and career opportunities. With a recent change in leadership in 2014, there are many uncertainties at the company."
good,"target has a fast fun and friendly environment. co workers are great. management could be better, but overall great place to work."
good,Target as a company is great to work for. Most days I am left to my own devices to do what needs to be done to keep the store and my department running. On the days where I am given projects that need to be completed the leadership of my store is always ready to help when needed. Being in electronics I have learned about many different electronic products and am able to explain the uses of each. When it comes to my management team and my co-workers there are some I enjoy working with and others I do not. The most difficult part about my job is also the most enjoyable and that is the explaining of products. At times it can be really simple and others it seems almost impossible to explain what something does to someone because they either do not want to listen or cannot comprehend what I am saying to them.
good,"As a project manager in the Technology team, my job is to render my expertise in Project Management to leverage technology for enabling business teams meet their goals."
good,If you enjoy hard fast paced work than Target is the place for you!..It is a lot of work and you meet all kinds of people..It makes the day go by fast. At Target there is always something to do and you will never get bored.
good,"I enjoyed working for Target, as it had it ups and downs. "
good,"Overall, great team members, but too much attention is placed on how well you network versus how well you perform your job. Work/life balance is great, pay and benefits are ok. Culture has changed significantly since the new CEO took over."
good,"a typical day at work is stocking shelves and putting price labels on items, chatting with coworkers, the hardest  part of the job was lifting heavy items and the hours were graveyard shift, most enjoyable part was interacting with the other coworkers."
good,"A typical day at Target was started by getting on my cashier and then cashiering until break, then i usually would continue to cashier unless i needed to clean something up or help with anything. My favorite part was generally the co-workers."
good,"As a Target Protection Specialist I learned how to monitor CCTV and what to look for as far as catching a possible thief. Good company to work for, job advancement is high as there are many opportunities to move especially if you have a bachelors degree."
good,"This is a basic customer service job that's ideal for a college student."
good,"Awesome place to work, good management awesome team members non stress environment management actually listens to your needs."
good,I enjoyed the time I have spent working for Target. The only thing about this company is that I would have preferred more advancement opportunity so that I could show the skills I picked up during my time with the company. I believe this company has taught me what it takes to be a manager.
good,"I like this job and duties , but due to me being pregnant and having restrictions at that time I could not preform all the proper duties that was asked of me"
good,Target distribution center was an easy place to work. Most of the co-workers were very friendly and the management always answered questions.
good,"Target was a GREAT place to work! I recently left Target, where I was a key-carrying Logistics Team Leader, due to my hours being detrimental to my family. I had to be the first one at Target six of the seven days in a week, which required me to wake up at 2am everyday. Being that my fiancee's sleep schedule and work were on the demise because of my schedule, we both made the decision for me to leave. In my last month, I trained my replacement to ensure a smooth transition!"
good,Target is a great place to work. I really enjoyed it! The only thing is that they should pay their team members better and make sure they have enough people specially working in the food area. I still go visit at times and do some shopping. I only left due to my pregnancy and becoming a stay at home mom.
good,"It is a fun place to work, get to meet new people and create relationships with the vendors that come. Sometimes it can get a little stressful, but nothing you cant handle. Management is good, they do give you the most stress because sometimes they have unrealistic expectations for you to meet and there is no way you can do it, but you just have to work through it as best as you can. Overall I still enjoy working there."
good,"A great job with amazing people. From management down, every employee was great, hard-working, and easy to get a long with. My only complaints are that pay is very low for anyone not in management (which could be expected) and although they stress internal hiring for management is how they operate, it often is not true. I consistently finished near the top during employee reviews, was wanted by each manager to work on their team, and always had management positions mentioned to me - but every time I applied, it went out of store. It is very hard to work your way up within this company. If you're looking for a part time job and don't mind staying at the entry level - this is a great place to be."
good,"I only working with the customers and my co-workers, Management are great to work for but not enough opportunity to grow."
good,"A typical day for a sales associate involves stocking picks from the backroom along with returns while helping customers in their respective departments. I learned a lot of backroom coding since my primary job was in assembly. Management at Target is much better than most retail stores, they have a reasonable number that inspire their team to complete tasks. Co-workers at my location was very friendly, however due to high turnover during holiday season they came and went quickly. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with returns after big sales, without losing time from your main tasks. The most enjoyable part of the job is the friendly customers that visit the store."
good,Very strictly run corporate structure. Job doesn't change much at all from a day to day operations standpoint. Hours are pretty standard.
good,I enjoyed working here as I learned many new skills I can further use in my future. I was trained by a great staff who always had positive attitudes and smiles. This making the workplace atmosphere a positive one. I learned my skills as a cashier and as well a guest services attendant through them. I can honestly say this has been one of the best working experiences I have had.
good,"Target is an amazing company to work for. However, I believe that each store is different. The productivity of the day depended heavily on who was managing the team members and how compliant team members were. If you have good management, Working at target as a hardlines team member is very enjoyable."
good,"Target Canada started off by recruiting numerous numbers of experienced managers from different fields with much more salary than what it seemed necessary. Scouting talents was a success, yet  the company lacked in planning and executing daily operations. Canadian employees were stuck between the most unorganized distribution centre imaginable/ American managements clueless on Canadian Market, vs ignorant consumers not yet ready to take on what Target had to offer."
good,"I learned alot working for this company. I've learned many skills concerning customer service, working as a team and getting the job done. There was alway a fun vibe in the work environment"
good,"A typical day of work at Target would because basically the same thing. You would typically come in and see which section you would be at for the day, and usually I would either be considered as a cashier, or at the customer Service desk, and proceed throughout my day. "
good,"Learned a great deal during my tenure at Target,  how to build and maintain a positive and productive team."
good,"Target was a fun place to work, I enjoyed my co-workers. I loved the focus on customer service. It was hard to keep hours, gain hours. Shifts were always changing and not consistent."
good,"At store level the job was great, awesome people and fun events daily. However the company was unorganized and that led to their closure... sad"
good,"I will unload the truck, stock the merchandise. Teaches you great customer service skills. management are very friendly. Co-workers work well together. The job is easy to do."
good,"A typical day at work was to assign team members their duties and the stores expectations for the day and any communication that needed to be shared with the team. Check emails and status with my leader. Assist the team as necessary. Continuous follow up throughout the day with the team to ensure expectations are understood and deadlines will be met."
good,i have worked at 3 targets in 3 years. I worked at the one in manassas woodbridge and culpeper. My first 2 stores were one of the best times while working for this company. The store that i am at now(culpeper) management is very strict and wants everything done their way. Some of my co-workers are great and i love to work with them. Helping guest is targets most focused goal as a company and there are always good days and bad days.
good,"My main role within Target was to reduce shortage, caused internally and externally. I Focused on prevention by ensuring store leadership is trained on assets protection best practices. I believe the best way I achieved this was by Developing successful relationships with all leadership and staff. My daily routines were Documenting  safety/security incidents ,Developing successful partnerships with local law enforcement, as well as providing Leadership to my Security Team Members. The Most enjoyable part of the Job was getting to meet and learn from so many experienced leaders whether it was Asset Protection or Logistics. I had the pleasure of working in two different provinces and supporting many different stores and working with other Asset Protection Leaders."
good,"I've worked here for 4.5 years and for the most part enjoyed my experience. Currently I work on the plano team, generally early mornings setting salesfloor displays or apparel and accessories adjacencies."
good,"Target was a great place to work.  I learned a great deal about leadership and myself.  Management was always concerned about me as a person first, and how that would help me be a better leader and achieve the results needed."
good,"Focus on high performance, friendly environment, and an enjoyable work day."
good,The culture at Target was unmatched in the industry and is what kept employees going through uncertain times. Target did a great job in selecting the right people to build and maintain their culture.
good,Every day is different.  Need to be resilient and adaptable and have the ability to manage through change - retail is fast paced and constantly changing.  Great people and excellent learning environment with a focus on personal development.
good,"recevoir toute les fournisseurs"
good,"A typical day included tidying up the store before closing, and backing up at the checkout lanes and guest service counter during busier times. I learned to be flexible and juggle regular tasks with helping out other areas to support the whole team. Management understandably found it difficult to help out each individual team member, but I found that co-workers were willing to help when management couldn't. The most difficult part of my job would have been balancing schoolwork and shifts during the week, but the most enjoyable part of my job was getting to know my co-workers and generally helping people every time I came into work."
good,I loved coming to work to my nice coworkers and looking forward to lunches where we could watch games or play ping pong. Work was never to much work. Main con was lack of respect towards cart attendants and the intense pressure for a cashier to get RedCards.
good,"Easy work, i learned to be passionate with people and everyone thing that i do or say, say it with a smile. Loved my management they taught me so much about the business itself. i started to learn about other areas in the store. If they where new they always came to me for help and if they needed advance I was the to go girl."
good,"Great company to work for and to gain experience for future use. Two amazing pharmacist to work with, I got nothing but respect for them. They're always there to help when I'm dealing with a complicated task. It's a challenging work environment when you're the only technician there helping the pharmacist and balancing through many difficult but doable task."
good,Most days I woke a lone in the cafe at closing. I make pizza and pasta when requested and help cashiers when main store becomes busy.
good,"It is a great place to work if you like working against time. The faster and more efficient you are at your job, the better off you will be. Brand management often has their own agenda which tends to pull some employee's away for there work area, but still expecting the work to be finished promptly. Overall a great company to work for if you are the right fit for their program."
good,Even though I was a seasonal employee I loved working for that company. Great co-workers!
good,"Typical day was turning on the security monitors greeting customers as they entered the store, assisted them if asked, I worked in music/movies in which I held down that department as well. I learned that the customer's always right. Management was very strong and put together. Co-workers were very helpful and very nice to work with. The hardest part of the job was dealing with a customer telling untrue statements about you to management. The most enjoyable part is that you accomplish the things that was set before you."
good,Come in mostly enjoy work unless there were issues then leave.
good,"Overwhelmingly positive environment to work in, helpful supervisors, friendly customers and coworkers, and overall a great place to work."
good,"I had a great time working at Target and I'm really sad to go."
good,"Fast, friendly, and fun!"
good,"I like working for Target because the company gives me many opportunities to explore different areas of the store.  Before I became a Certified Pharmacy Technician, I worked in almost every area of the store with a very diverse group of people."
good,I have really enjoyed my time at Target. It is an ideal place to start your career.
good,I worked at Target in Kingston.Management was very nice and the store is very clean.
good,"Target isn't by any means a bad place to work. The job I do offers a good deal of individual freedom and autonomy to perform your duties, and the management is generally friendly and supportive. The hours and pay are where the job leaves something to be desired, but all in all there's not a lot to complain about. Since I began working there, I've mastered the art of the pallet-jack, learned some interesting things about the hidden workings of a big department store, and I've even lost 20 lbs!"
good,"the day is usually busy. I learned how to multi-task, communicate and be a leader to my team. My co-workers made work so much easier. They were fun for me to work with. The hardest part of my job was trying to be  in multiple places at one time. The most enjoyable part was being available to help my team in their time of need."
good,"Work environment is great, there are great people that I get to work with there."
good,A great place to work for a first job. They occasionally buy food for the workers. They are extremely pushy about their credit cards
good,"fun, fast paced company. good people and good managers. goo pay and benefits."
good,It was a nice place to work worker was nice to work with over all it was a nice company.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of doing daily inventory logs, excel spreadsheets, surveillance of customers, apprehending customers for theft, and writing reports on theft subjects.  I learned a variety of things while working target security.  I went through apprehensions training, surveillance training, and handcuffing training.  My managers at Target were all great.  Very fun people to work with.  My co-workers were also great and still friends today.  The hardest part of the job was apprehending people for theft because I never knew who they were, if they were going to fight or run, or if they had any weapons on them.  The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting my recovery and apprehension goals from month to month."
good,A fun and nice place to work. Do everything the same on a daily basis so gets a little boring but over all a good place to work.
good,"Unload Delivery Trucks, Organize and stock Various areas inside of the Target store, Making store ready for guests."
good,"Performing duties as a cashier or in guest services.  How to accurately use credit and debit cards, open cards.  I handled refunds or returns.  We had a fast, fun and friendly environment.  Management was very helpful and supportive.  I got along with everyone.  The hardest part of the job was working weekends and holidays.  Meeting and helping so many nice people."
good,Hard to deal with competing managers and clicks within the team.  Good place to earn a bit o money
good,"Target is a highly collaborative environment that offers endless opportunities that are unique, challenging, rewarding and leading.  The co-workers are talented, world-class in their fields and strive for excellence."
good,"Target has awesome opportunities within the company that you can participate in. Games, reward programs, all of which get you to know more about your fellow co-workers."
good,"Target is a great company to work for. I started as a seasonal Team Member and have worked my way up to Executive Team Leader. I love working as a team to meet company goals. We are a fast paced company that challenges our team on a daily basis all while having fun. I have learned how to lead, motivate, and work with a very diverse team. 10 years and going strong!"
good,"FLOW TEAM MEMBER"
good,"During a typical day, I stand at the register and work for about two or three hours, then go to my fifteen minute break. After another two hours, I go to lunch, and then home after my shift is over. Cashiers do not leave their register, which makes the feet hurt a bit, but time passes quickly when you remain busy. Management is great and friendly, and my co-workers are very nice and helpful. The hardest part of my job is being speedy. Target is graded on speed at the registers, so there is some pressure. The most enjoyable part of my job is my coworkers and the break room. The break room has a TV."
good,"Depending on i have the opening shift, mid-day, or closing shift.  I commonly start my day meeting my usually my team leader to update me on meals, target red cards, whose here, who called out and so forth.  After that i just usually take over whether i'm in charge upfront or at guest services. I treat my job and coworkers like family because they are the ones' who help me succeed and have fun at work.  Even though I'm a Supervisor try to get my coworkers to smile, talk, give advice and relate to them.  Work has ups and downs, I'm the youngest supervisor in the store, and im still learning a few things, my managers are hard on me but i'm learning how they run things and their habits and use them with my own to be more efficient in helping my store.  The hardest part of my job is not being to help a guest, i really go above and beyond to listen and understand this or that but if a customer has a problem and I'm unable to resolve it, saying no or being unable to help is the hardest part of my job.  The most enjoyable part of my job is my co-workers, you got to build that trust and work through ups and downs because they are the people you regularly got to interact with.  I always talk to my coworkers and just try to make friends."
good,"A typical day usually consist of a steady passe where team members help each other when possible to complete their task."
good,"When you have a great team, anything is possible. Fast paced, always on the move. Always creating new things to make life better for our guests."
good,This is a great company to work for.  Depending on the management of the individual store however it could be better.  In a typical day I was asked to perform multiple job duties.  As assets protection team leader I drove a safe and secure culture in the store.  I also partnered with the police to apprehend shoplifters.  The team I worked with was great.  The hardest part of the job was the varying and sometimes unpredictable schedule.  The most enjoyable part of the job was when I would see my contribution to the store pay off.
good,Interacting with customers to assist them and make their visit as time efficient and enjoyable as possible.
good,"Scanning groceries and offering customers to apply for Red cards."
good,"Days were always busy reviewing footage, paperwork, getting together with team members and management as well as apprehensions.  I learned how to teach others to be aware of their surroundings and engaging in guest service.  I team members were all great to work with.  They were always reaching out to me.The position was always demanding but never tiring."
good,"A typical day of work consists of coming in and unloading freight from the trailer and sending it down the receiving line. After all freight has been worked from the trailer, stacked on pallets, and distributed throughout the store in their respective areas, it is then ready to be ""bowled out"" and stocked. Management is very thorough and often make workers feel very appreciated. Personally, I love all of my co-workers and many of us have become good friends over the course of my time their. I would say the most difficult part of the job is the physical toll it takes on your body if you are new, due to the fact that you have to learn the correct way in lifting, stocking, and the amount of cardio that is actually being done during a work shift. The most enjoyable part of my job by far is my co-workers, we are honestly one big family and watch out for each other."
good,"Good job, management position, just not much opportunity to advance past that."
good,"I was able to work with some amazing people! I spent many years at the same store, which you don't see very often. People seem leave the company a lot quicker."
good,nic easy work fun nice regular days easy work day almost everyday anyone can enjoy …………………………………...
good,"Everyone is very nice and helpful, the company is ""guest oriented"" and all employees are required to adjust to the customers needs. The Pharmacy is fast paced and friendly, you are expected to go above and beyond for not only the customers but for each other. Management is great, open door policy and they treat their employees well. You are always recognized no matter how small or big your accomplishments."
good,It isn't a long term job for a person seeking higher salary. good people. very friendly and cooperative. Management has their days.
good,"i like working here, its easy to get along with everyone. I am able to cross-train to get more hours."
good,"f you expect to be treated fairly, or have the same level of opportunities as the other people with your exact same title, prepare to be disappointed. The way it works there is that they decide who they like, and they set those people up for success, and they decide who they don't like and set those people up for failure. How they decide who they do and do not like is a mystery, and it certainly doesn't have to do with sales ability. So some people do no real work and get great paychecks, and some people bust their butts and have nothing to show for it."
good,great work environment mediocre benefits annually raises every year
good,You start work with a meeting to give you an idea of what has to be done each night. The management throughout the night is virtually non-existent.
good,"I work in Target for 4 years, love what I do. I work for Price Accuracy im a team member and learn a lot of what Im doing, I learn a lot in this team and continue learning different things everyday. My co workers are very respect and we learn together something different. we are like a little family when we work together help each other out in everything that has to be job related. The hardest part of the job is when there suppose be six of us and only two show up for work but we def managed to do the work and finish before our day is over. The most enjoyable dauy of the job is when we helping guests be satisfied finding what they need at the store and appreciate what we do to put a smile on there face, and saying they thankful for making there day fantastic. Love working with people and making there day better and putting a smile as well."
good,"At Target my responsibilities were to take care of the guests needs, direct phone calls to the correct departments, and take care of sorting all merchandise for the clothing department."
good,Great place to work and learn if you are willing to put the effort and make the commitment in gaining the experience taught to you when working there.
good,"Great place for a first job. Fun team members, they are young, and interactive."
good,"I learned always be three steps ahead"
good,"I would come in an unload a truck, from unloading a truck i would then begin to stock aisles until the shift is over."
good,"I have appreciated the opportunity to focus on strategy and build strong skills in this area. "
good,"A very positive, encouraging environment that is full of job opportunities. Professionally, you will grow immensely and learn invaluable skills that are applicable to any field. Great management program!"
good,"Target has developed a very positive management team, who guides the team in a very energetic/positive manner.  I really enjoy working with the upbeat team."
good,Very friendly co workers and almost every day you have something new to do and learn.
good,"There are instances where depending on the management staff, the job you are working that day, and a few other variables that will determine your experiences."
good,"A typical day at my job includes clocking in around 8 o'clock and setting up my work area. I occasionally have to gather carts and racks so that I am able to separate the new shipment that comes into the store. After everything is separated and broken out (clothing, shoes, accessories, under garments, baby products, etc.) all of these items to their appropriate destination. I also help customers out if they have any questions or concerns about where a product is and where it can be located. My co-workers are a joy to work with and we work as a team to get everything done. The hardest part of my job would probably have to be trying to find locations for the new shipment because we get so much in and sometimes have limited space. The most enjoyable part about my job is being able to help customers, as well as working with my co-workers."
good,I made friends and enjoyed the work environment did not enjoy that the managers kept getting switched out and with that the way things were done changed with them.
good,"I have been working at target for a year now. I started as a cashier then I ended up being trained in the Sales Floor, Market, and Food Avenue, Starbucks, Cart Attendant, Price Accuracy and in-stocks. Then, I was promoted to GSA/GSTL. It is part of leadership at target and managing the front end check lanes. Schedules changing every day. Sometimes I would close at 10:45 and I would open the next day at 6:45"
good,"Working as a Flow Team Member is a fast paced position. We unloaded the merchandise from the receiving truck and put it on the line to be organize onto pallets. Then, we stocked the merchandise onto the shelves and put back stock into the warehouse. Management, there, are a strong minded group of people who know what they are doing. The hardest part of the position was to get everything on time, but the best part was the fast paced enviornment"
good,Stock shelves. Pull out items. Maintain a clean work environment.
good,"Easily the best team i've worked for. Amazing culture, atmosphere, team, and overall environment; everyone is there to help you, not against you like you may have felt at other positions. Biggest downfall is lack of hours, empty promises, and overall lack of consistency in scheduling and hours. Can't exactly blame them, the company doesn't make enough money to support such a large staff. I strictly left due to lack of hours to pursue something with more consistency, (if part-time expect under 10-15 hours) if more hours were present I would most likely still be there."
good,Good company and allowed me to gain experience in a different aspect of retail. Enjoyed the free lunches and flexible management.
good,"The people and work environment are great, as well as the chance to work and learn different skills. Balancing work and customer service can be hard at times yet very rewarding."
good,"- Unload trucks and place merchandise "
good,"Target paid well, had great management and work life balance but I was laid off.  Job security wasn't there."
good,.i started by going thought the cash drawer to see how much money was there so i would know what my sales were. then i had to open my accounts. handle money.
good,"I have learned so much about customer services and retail as a whole through working with Target. Target offers cross training in all departments so an employee is never limited to one job position. With my time at Target I have learned the positions and processes of fulfillment, cashiering, pricing, planogramming, signing, and more. Management is great at my store location. They are always willing to help one learn what is needed to advance and they are flexible with their employee's needs. The hardest part of the job is adjusting one's schedule to the inconsistent work schedule. The most enjoyable part of my job is that we work as a team to achieve large goals. While we are separated into our own tasks, we are all contributing to the success of the business."
good,"The thing I like most about working for Target is working with people.  Target is very team focused and wants to develop everyone and every level to be able to realize their full potential.  Just like everything you get out what you put in."
good,"awesome place to work for, not much job security, decent pay, great co-workers and job culture. lots of high school drama"
good,"I learned a lot about the general public while working at Target. The development of a thick skin is essential, especially when working in the food/service industry. I spent most of my time on the front end working in the cafe or as a cashier. I formed a strong bond with my coworkers. I love when I can interact with little kids and make them smile. The hardest part is definitely when a difficult guest  came up to my counter. I would always try my hardest to make things right. Target is actually a lovely place to work at."
good,"Pulling product to be filled on the floor."
good,I enjoyed working at Target and was able to learn people skills that I use to this day. Target was my first job and I was able to go back to Target after being laid off.
good,Working on the flow team is fun and always keeps me moving. Being apart of the team that contributes to keeping the store stocked and up to point is exciting.
good,"Fun job with friendly employees, and management.  Ability for advancement."
good,Target is a good company to work for. Great working environment. Team culture is the best acknowledging the teams hard work and effort. Respect and value each other!. Most enjoyable part of the job is being able to provide great guest service towards each guest as they enter the store. Also the partnership with my co-managers to complete the job!!!
good,"Enjoy working with my team members, learning about retail and greeting and talking to guests."
good,I love my team members. Everyone is really nice and respectful. I feel like I can go talk to my boos as a friend if I ever had an issue. But I am expected to do entirely TOO MUCH for what I am paid. I often leave work very sore and with swollen feet. I for the most part work 35-39 hours a week but have never seen a Bi-weekly check over $550. So for 78 hours I cant even get $600 and that's after I have received two raises. I was told they won't schedule more help when sales are down. But that is NOT fair to the team members who have to work twice as hard to do multiple jobs because there weren't enough people scheduled. I do not mind working hard but I should at least be compensated for my hard work. Its a good starter job for young people though.
good,Each day at work began in the brake room with a friendly meeting with the different employees. I learned the basic skills needed in the retail business. The low level managers struggled to provide the needed direction for the employees under them. The middle and upper managers were skilled and capable where competent and helpful. A high percentage of the clientele were Hispanic which presented a problem as I do not speak Spanish.  I enjoyed helping customers.
good,a typical day at target was I was to get updates form the gsa or gstl that ran shift before me and to set up my shift for success. then I would for the rest of my shift have to make sure things that need to get done gets done while making sure that customers are taken care of and are happy
good,I enjoy the atmosphere and the people.Not really a fast pace job but it has it's perks. I get to sell TV's all day
good,I started working at target as an after school job and continued for I felt apart of a family. They supported me and developed me to deal with many opportunities.
good,"Good place to work, co-workers very friendly and management as well."
good,"Great atmosphere, love working there but there is a shortage of hours at the current moment which making hard for any part timer"
good,"Target is known for their fast, and friendly service, and I got to be apart of their team, which I greatly enjoyed. The managers, and co-workers made you feel like you belonged, they celebrated birthdays, they just made you feel comfortable. However there was one manager that I along with other co-workers did not get along with, because instead of listening she always yelled. So of course I could have done without it, but Target was a fun place to work. Ironically my days at Target went my pretty fast, because it is located by UCLA it was always crowded, and I was always on the register none stop."
good,"Always kept busy, which I like.  Everyone I have meet are friendly and always ready to help."
good,"A typical work day at target was helping guest locate items in store, putting carts and baskets away, and backing up cashiering when needed."
good,Restock sales floor with products and give great guest service.
good,"Target was a fast paced job there was never any down time, but the work was not hard. The hardest part was working overnights. My team was amazing though, I was lucky to have them. All and all Target is a great company to work for."
good,"Fast,fun,friendly workplace"
good,This job is a fun and exciting. You meet wonderful people that want to help you out.
good,Great place to work but unfortunately i out grew my position there.
good,"A typical day at work would be talking and socializing wit customers, explaining the electronics and what every thing does."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the day is helping guests throughout the store and being able to make someone's day a little better by helping. The team members all get along in a friendly manner and help each other out when necessary. The hardest part of the job is having to try and calm down angry guests, but we have to do what is best and what makes the guest happy. Sometimes management doesn't communicate as well as I would like/"
good,"I help guest and make the sales floor look nice for all guest coming in and out of our store all shift long, i have areas I'm assigned to and I'm responsible for helping guest, making my areas look nice, make sure every things in the right location for our guest so there no confusion. Love this job because i love helping people and this job gives me lots of chances to better myself and earn other skills in the work place. My managers and L.O.D,s are all great, then teach you and correct you on your mistakes and go the distance to make sure you have all the right skills you need to complete your job each and everyday! The only thing i real don't like about this job is that my hours aren't consistent, ill have 35 hours one week and the next ill get 17. I really want something thats promised, or at least consistent."
good,"Most of the day at Target involves assisting guests while maintaining job duties at a high performance.  There are goal times to be met and speed scores to maintain.  At Target, I have learned to work as part of a team, both with my peers and superiors.  I also have experience leading new hires and introducing them to our store.  My co-workers are most friendly and always willing to lend a helping hand.  "
good,"I was in charge of keeping the front end of the store clean, back up cashier when the lines started getting long, I also had to make sure carts were always in the store for customers to use while shopping.  I also worked in the customer service/return department when needed and helped out on the sales foor at times."
good,"Good place to start working to earn money, really have to show yourself to advance or push for it. Nothing I can say about the company is bad, at least at the time for me."
good,"It's a good business to learn and extend the ability of learning the ropes of Retail and Sales. This is a business to learn production. I had worked with a lot of great people within this business. Quality Customer Service is highly expected within this business. To learn pricing and merchandises might be difficult, but when assisting a customer and providing the information they are searching for is priceless. It feels good to assist and make sure you are providing the quality customer service that is expected."
good,Best Retailer to work for hands down... 50 hour work week at most. Lots of training. Great Team Culture. Positive brand and great diversity...
good,"Target is fast pace company, your co-workers are willing to help you. You will make interesting people everyday."
good,"would start day by visually inspecting and filling out equipment check list,would pick orders from vocollect headset ,"
good,"Great work environment, great opportunities to grow and career progression."
good,"Co-Workers are fun to be around. Alway cracking jokes with each other. Easy going job, listening to music is a plus while you work"
good,"Very good place & company to work with."
good,"Days typically feel long, but that's retail for you."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Target, it was a lot of fun and I learned a lot."
good,I did not work for target very long but my experience was very good. the managers were really nice. it was a very fun work experience.
good,A great place to work while going through college.  I would stay if they could hire me for what my degree is in.
good,"Enjoyed working closely with team members and cross-functional partners. Used numerous proprietary systems every day to get the job done. Many meetings, ongoing deadlines and frequent changes to processes. Added new initiatives — sometimes moved too fast and had to backtrack."
good,"Fast paced company that has a family atmosphere and home town feeling. Days go by fast with the work I do and I am grateful for that, such as being busy and productive. Have learned that I enjoy working with others and am not a sit down or stand still person. Hardest part of the job is when there are certain managers that do not know how to address employees as a person. No opportunity for overtime for those willing to give their best to the company. Enjoy going to work everyday in being at work way before scheduled time and seeing co-workers that are very helpful and willing to assist each other."
good,Hours were very difficult with a family. difficult to advance at my store.
good,This division of Wells Fargo no longer exist. No need to say more.
good,"Target has given me a lot of opportunities and experiences that I will be able to take with me into my career. "
good,"I would start at 10pm. Go downstairs in the basement where the truck would come in and start my day with the truck offload process. The truck would come in pieces of 15 hundred or more. We would have two people throwing the truck, one person ouching the boxes down the line and one person scanning every last box. Downstairs we would have employees taking the boxes and putting them on a pallet. After that process is done and the whole truck is finish, we would go up stairs, By, then the boxes are already on the floor on their location on what they call bowling out. We as employees open the boxes and make sure the boxes are thrown away the right way."
good,"Gaining the knowledge of prescription inputing and dispensing of RX's, and premium customer service. Maintaining and efficiently preparing each patients prescriptions in a timely manner."
good,"I have enjoyed working with Target for the past ten years. "
good,"Great place to work. Very guest oriented. Target has taught me lessons that I will never forget. Target's focus on guest service has instilled in me an exceptional culture. Dealing with difficult guests comes with the job but it gets easier. Many times you are able to diffuse situations in the guests favor, insuring guest loyalty and future visits."
good,Its a good job to work at when u just starting into the work world
good,From the minute I clock in I am on the move to keep product flying off the shelves and into the customers shopping cart. Helping customers find what they need and always recommending sales items or alternatives when a current product is out-of-stock. Supporting many other departments when needed is part of the culture that keeps our store team members collectively close as a great team should be. I have learned what it takes and means to to fully give 110% of pure dedication to a company. From having a sense of urgency and getting many tasks done in an hour to listening to a customer and giving them my full undivided attention. Management is what keeps this company moving in the right direction by listening to what every team member has for ideas and useful input while keeping close attention to what can be done to achieve more sales.
good,I worked in this company for 1 1/2. Well established and respected company
good,"Through this employment I learned many hard and fast facts about management. You are encouraged to assume leadership roles quickly. I learned what it takes to motivate people and the variety of techniques that must be employed based on the individual. Management was knowledgeable and helpful. Hours could become an issue during the holiday season. Spending time with family during this time is nearly impossible. Regardless, I valued the respect I was given as a fellow manager and was allowed an impressive amount of leadership freedoms."
good,This Company have all the latest technologies to learn about.
good,"In the customer service area maintaining a clean an organized workspace was essential. If you put something down and do not fix it in that moment other factors begin to pile in. Learning how far you can go, what your limits are, self empowerment, knowing the policies. Co-workers were a blast to work with. They became a second family aside the ones by blood. There were no real hard parts aside being able to multi-task. Answering phones, calling other stores, working in the photo lab while talking to other team members on walkie-talkies. What was the most enjoyable part was meeting new people (co-workers) that eventually became friends."
good,"It was a good place to work. There was a lot of needed intervention form experienced leadership that genuinely cared, it is just very difficult to stay with in the time frame that they want you to work within and get things done."
good,"Target is fun, they try and make work more fun than actual work. I like that we interact with customers and help them find what they're looking for. They taught me how to operate some big machinery and the co-workers and management are fun and friendly."
good,i learned how to communicate better.  the teamwork was exceptional.
good,"I loved the people I worked with, the job was fun and the people I dealt with on a daily basis were a pleasure.  The managers were always there to help with anything and as were the employees."
good,"The company philosophies have changed a lot over the years and it is becoming increasingly difficult to advance to management from within the company. 70% of management positions are required to be filled by campus recruitment, 20% by outside hires with experience, and only 10% are internal promotion."
good,My typical day at work includes assisting guests with returns and answering any questions that they may have. I am also able to multi-task with helping guests in the photo lab while keeping the Guest Service desk clean and organized. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to provide great customer service.
good,"Red and khaki is the work attire.  Fast, Fun, and Friendly.  Co-workers are generally very pleasant.  Most enjoyable department was Starbucks.  Really enjoyed working with the public and making people smile."
good,"Although I enjoyed where I worked and the people I worked with, several of Target's company policies did not sit well with me."
good,I worked in many departments and learned a lot. I helped with customers and trained employees.
good,"Target's management is very supportive and understanding of work - life balance. The environment was work focused, but had plenty of room for levity."
good,Great opportunities for growth and development. Excellent leadership teams and talent staff focused around Guest. Rotating schedule to include nights and weekends.
good,"Working for Target was an excellent starting point in a retail atmosphere. Many workers, myself included, had opportunities to be cross-trained in more than one area of the store, and as a result broadened our spectrum in work experience. I personally was trained as a pharmacy cashier, a Starbucks barista, and was later promoted to Barista Trainer, providing me a greater deal of public experience and store management. Working retail, I had an eclectic group of co-workers, and those who were willing to work were always a joy to be around. Unfortunately, my store's management was not the most effective, and many of our store leaders quit or stopped caring about their job, leaving those next in their position constantly stressed and overwhelmed. The hardest part of my job, in turn, was often the most enjoyable. As a barista, making our guests day was the ultimate task, and providing them with outstanding service is what we, as a team, would strive for. What I learned from my experience at Target was how to provide the highest service for our customers, making sure that they left with everything they needed, and having an enjoyable experience doing so."
good,My day consist of coming to work at 2:30am unloading trucks putting the supplies on the shelves. Straightening up the floor. Then heading home around 7:30-8am
good,"I was only seasonal, Otherwise I wouldnt mind working here. Managers and supervisors were great! Always in a good mood. Everyone seemed friendly. However pay was only $9... Not that great."
good,Great people to work with; great place to start an after school job; flexible hours
good,"I learned nearly everything about leadership within this company. The days begin with interacting with your team discussing the goals, task and achievements. Management teams building partnerships to train and development team members, with a high focus on member service, and product sales."
good,while working for target you can promote to management very easy but they don't pay you enough for experience
good,"Although i had trouble with my direct supervisor and received no help from upper management, my co-workers made it worth it. Theres always that one guy you don't get along with so i don't want him to sway my review. The pay wasn't what i felt it should be for the job that i did so i went looking else where and the room for advancement was only there is your direct supervisor approves, which in my case meant there wasn't any room. I liked my job though and i was sad to leave it behind."
good,A great company to work for. I worked with a great and knowledgeable team across the pyramid. I learned a lot from my peers.
good,Team Members at target are a good set of people in each department  to management
good,"Target is a fun place to work. The team members at my store always maintain a positive attitude, and teamwork is a priority. With our store being both smaller and differently formatted than the larger stores, we sometimes do not have all the equipment needed to do our job. Instead of allowing this to stop us, however, we think of creative solutions to our problems. In my time at Target, I learned all about giving good customer service, how to work together in a team, and how to think creatively to find solutions to problems, rather than give up."
good,Management was friendly and understanding of any situation. The other employees were welcoming and accepting. The job was never more difficult than what any one person could  handle. Overall theexperience of working with target was a good one
good,Target is a great company to work for.  They teach you new skills and offer advancements throughout the company.  They are however a retail store and you must take that into account.  You will work holidays and weekends and the schedules are never consistent but they are flexible for going to school.
good,"I started out at the 27th street Target as a cashier.  I later moved up to service desk, which I loved even more.  I was asked to help out on the price accuracy team a few times a month.  In 2004 I heard that  the store in oak creek had an opening for a full time Price Accuracy team member, so I applied and was hired.         What I have learned from all of my customer service jobs is patience, tolerance and how to get along with people."
good,"Employees come in and go right to work, we work hard and got everything done before the store opened. With the store open things went at a slower pace but just as much work still had to be done. Hardest part of the job is waking up at 2 in the morning but it pays off when you have the rest of the day to relax and enjoy life."
good,"Learned something new on a daily basis"
good,A typical day at work would be active and full of surprises. It was always something new. A great work place to gain experience in customer service and retail skills. Management was fun and friendly but often micro-managed when it was not needed. Co-workers where normally hard working and dedicated to serving the guest when needed. The hardest thing about working was the communication from co-worker to co-worker and making sure everyone was on task. The most enjoyable part of the job was the knowing that most guest left the store happy and that I helped them have a great experience.
good,"a typical day at work was preparing the loading bay for the arrival of corporate truck with merchandise, unloading merchandise and stocking the store front. after that was complete i would head the the back of the house to stock the back stock of merchandise that was not needed on the floor. i had learned the proper way to inventory all items within a PDA and the use of a cherry picker and electric pallet jack. the entire team was very friendly with each one working hard to ensure the store was ready for the store opening. the hardest part and longest task of the job was the unloading of the truck it could be become very time consuming without the proper team effort for unloading. the most enjoyable part of the job was the felling of accomplishment after the store had been properly stocked."
good,A typical day at Target went on very fast because I was constantly moving around.  My co-workers were helpful and easy to get along with.  The hardest part about my job was finishing my tasks on time.
good,Some what fun place to work at. Good pay for management. Communication between staff can be improved so everyone in the management level positions can be on the same page at all times. Company is very high in feedback to all staff.
good,my co-workers are one of the reasons i love my job. they all work as a team to get any and everything done in a timely manner.instead of talking down on each other we uplift each other.
good,a typically day working at target would be just organizing and making sure all the re shops go back to there department . asking any guest if they need any help finding things. also helping guests get in and out so they don't have to wait in line long. Management at target is very unpredictable sometimes they talk to you and sometimes they ignore you. My coworkers are awesome very helpful friendly and reliable .
good,It was typically pretty fun to work there and had incentives to sell and up sale things as well
good,"Had a good interview, letting them know where I would like to go in the company.  I moved into a training position with in my first year because of great review form management, even as much as to get me in to roundtable meeting on things to better the work place."
good,"I enjoy working here. Pretty much everyone is friendly, understanding, and will to do their part. Target's #1 priority is their guest, so you have to make sure you have strong talents in guest service and be ready to help them out and do it with a smile, no matter how difficult the guest may be."
good,"A typical day consisted of providing the optimal customer service to the customers. My position was a cashier so my duty was to ring the customers as quick and efficient as possible. I was also a part of the customer service department that consisted of returns and exchanges that took place on a daily basis, as well as internet purchases and gift registries. The staff worked as a team to make sure that the customers received the best shopping experience, whether it was on the sales floor, once they reached the cash register or if they had to go to the customer service desk."
good,Would help customers with the sale of items that they would like to have. Providing information that would help customers find what they were looking for.
good,"Work in cash office, schedule, refunds, markdowns, credits, inventory, customer service, clean, maintain machines, training, charts, follow company policy."
good,Be a target Team member they say team but it was hard to identify the the traits of a team the line was either moving to slow or to fast on the conveyors.the management made it clear who the people who were going to stay as permanent because of their race.not the best experience in retail I've had.
good,"The people were nice. The work was rather laborous. Too much exercise for 2, 3, or 4AM. Management was supportive. It was fun learning how to operate forlifts and pallet jacks."
good,"vendeur pret a porter en interim."
good,It is a retail job. Expect early mornings shifts. During the holiday season you will be expected to work about 35 hours per week at 12am or 2am. The Team Leads as far as I know are really great people to work under. They motivate the team to be successful. There is a lot to learn and the environment is very fast paced. We lost a lot of people because they just could not deal with the difficult scheduling.
good,"had a lot of fun. met new people. learned a lot of new things about product safety, and durability. the management was ok very friendly but some would stick their noses up at you. co-workers were the same."
good,Not bad place to work. THe hours are early (for logistics that is) but is a great company. Need to pay more attention to training as I learned a lot of things on the job.
good,"Through the week day, its kinda slow. But on the weekends its very busy, sometimes its hard to stay focus because so many task can be handed to you at one time."
good,A typical day at work should consist of processing returns or exchanges for guest. I've learned how to identify false checks and other methods of payments. Co-workers are fun to work with.
good,This was my very first job and i was very excited bout that. I liked this company for the most part. I was a seasonal so I worked here at the craziest part of the year. I loved the challenge. I struggled just a tiny bit because I was pregnant but overall I enjoyed this job.
good,"a typical day at work involves unloading truck, and distributing product to appropriate locations to shelves."
good,"Target is definitely a workplace that promotes a ""fast, fun and friendly"" environment. I am a logistics team member therefore everyday I enter my work environment I have to meticulously plan my day or else I will leave with things undone. Its hectic at times but I enjoy the chaos. My fellow team members are really fun to work with.  I think the hardest part of my job is when residual products are left behind to put back in stock. sometimes its a challenge getting through it all, but I have dedicated team members that work hard to get the job done. Management for the most part is ok, They try their best to work along with the team. They also try to understand our needs and meet them. Of course there are some people who make your job a bit difficult but overall Target is an ok company"
good,This is where i got the most of my manager experience and warehouse experience. I started as customer service member then got promoted to Warehouse team Lead.
good,I was given an opportunity to work with some amazing people as CSR. the days job can very from time to time but usually comprises of handling orders and making sells.
good,"Working at Target was always fun but busy as well. As soon as one arrives there is plenty to be done, hectic would be the right word. The management would be all over the place but I always knew exactly where to go and what needed to be done. First thing would be to get together with all my co-workers and manager where as a team we would create a game plan for the night as the closing team. The hardest thing for me was joggling my school life with my work, I am capable of multitasking but getting out at 2 am from work and getting up at 6 am for school did tend to have a toll on me and sometimes was too much. I did however enjoy helping guest and creating friendships with my coworkers."
good,"i enjoyed working there. i made many friends which i still talk to 10 years later. i was trained in every department so i was moved around a lot which is something i enjoyed. the only reason i left was i was told i could not be advanced becuase it would requier them to hire 3 extra employees to replace me due to my flexibility,"
good,a topical day at target was i would check in with the supervisor on duty and i would put away the shipment that we just got in that night .  I would help  any customers come to the counter.  the mangenment was very helpful.   Co-worker were always to there to help.  the hardest part of the job was working a that fast paced of customer demading their med right now and if the back end was backed up customer just more mad.  The most enjoyable was knoing i was making a differance.
good,"I got to meet a lot of different people, work with a lot of characters, got along well with all managers, and had usual customers."
good,usually good.. sometimes lacking communication with management and employees..
good,"Print off list of cashiers for the day, schedule break/lunch times, load cash into registers before store opens.  Work with team lead to fill store needs if team member calls in ill.  Make sure the cashiers have supplies needed to do the job correctly.  Oversee the cashiers to make sure they are handling their job correctly.  Answer questions from cashiers or customers and handle problems as they arise.  "
good,"Great place to work for students or those interested in part-time positions, unless you have management experience."
good,Currently conduct interviews on potential new hires on a weekly basis and the lead the day to day grocery operations of the store and provide leadership and direction for the Executive team leaders. Rotate opening up or closing down the store as a leader to oversee the company as well as meeting sales goals and high customer satisfaction.
good,Average workday included truck unload process and distribution of freight throughout the store. Stocking shelves as well as setting up display models and décor around store. Helping guests with any items and price concerns.
good,"Target has been the best place I worked at. The Team Leaders were friendly but responsible, serious but always had fun. I have nothing bad to say either than the lack of hours assigned per person. It's not a job if you are wanting full time."
good,I worked night stock so I would arrive at the store just before closing and each night we had a team meeting where we were told what was required of us that night and told what area we would be working in. First we would unload the truck then we would use the pos system to see what pulls we needed to do and what items needed to be back stocked. After finishing pulls we would go onto the floor to stock the shelves with the items we had pulled. At the end of the night we would back stock any items that were left over.
good,"My experience working as Guest Services Team Lead for Target has given me excellent customer service and communication skills, as well as strong organization skills. I am a multi-tasker and work well in a fast paced environment. I am experienced working independently, as well as in a team environment, and have extensive knowledge of office equipment and software. I enjoyed working with my co-workers who were all extremely nice and willing to help when needed. The hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult guests. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping every guest and making them happy."
good,"It was a very enjoyable place to go to work everyday. With time and effort you could advance to the top in this organization, but the downfall would be the pay."
good,"A typical day at work would be, grabbing the equipment I need, for example PDA's, printers, and above all the walkie-talkie. Having worked at TARGET I learned to be patient and it is all about the guests. I usually go and get the go-backs from guest service while doing so I am guest servicing each guest. Go to the department I am assigned to and start picking up anything off the floor and start putting go-backs away while zoning. Throughout the day/night, there will be calls for back-up at the front lanes, so I will go cashier for as long as they need me to also if any of our team members needs their break to be covered we will have t o cover it. I usually learn something new everyday because of the guests, I take their considerations and make a note for the next work day. I  answer any guests questions or I keep guest serving them. The managers usually walk throughout the store asking if any team members need help or if they are doing okay, as for my co workers they are doing what I am doing just in different department. The motto in our store is fast fun and friendly so everyone is friendly and it is a comforting place to work. What is the hardest part of my job would be trying to a department but having to ensure we're meeting the guest needs through guest servicing and representing Targets expectations. Overall the most enjoyable part of my job would be making our guests experience a great one and knowing that I had something to do with it."
good,"Great place to work"
good,"The success of the day would depend on accurate planing. I work well with others and I am always willing to help where needed in other areas. I have the ability to engage and inspire others to work hard and get the job done. The hardest part of job is  reacting quickly to adjust plans to get the job done. I  enjoy most, working with a group of diverse people."
good,I had a great manger nina she worked with me and made what I did fun store manager he made it hard for me to keep my job hurt  my back at work and forgot to report it and I had to quit couldn't do lifts or stand for long times
good,"Trained all New Inbound Employees"
good,"Besides taking care of all the HR functions of the store I am also the leader on duty which includes handling any team member or guest concerns. Have to ensure that all team members are working their schedule shifts and completing all tasks. Being able to prioritize and ensure the store tasks are completed using the proper resources, and continuing to balance your particular work center tasks."
good,"I worked on a small team that walked every aisle of the store everyday scanning product to ensure up-to-date counts were correct and to replenish anything that needed it. We also helped Assets Protection with solving problems of incorrect counts. Once done with this task, we spent the rest of the day helped other departments, typically pushing stock to the sales floor of helping the logistics team in the back room."
good,dealing with guest with helping them locate items sold in store
good,Typical day at work is busy and fast paced.  Lots of very skilled people that are willing to share their experience.  Management can be a bit into the details which causes some swirl but over all a good place to work.  Hardest part of the job is prioritizing when you have a number of things on your list.  Funnest thing is the people
good,"I have very set hours, work with up to 8 different companies (outside vendors) on any given week. I am responsible for everything within the property lines of my store structurally, not merchandise. "
good,"I got the opportunity to work with many different people and do many different things. I was trained for many different things. I enjoyed working with my superiors because they were friendly and professional at the same time. The hardest part of my job was having to do my job plus others' at times when things fell through the cracks in my department, it was stressful doing things that I was unsure of. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting all types of people throughout my work day and learning many different things within various departments."
good,"typical high school environment, most staff is young but they listen. management understand there staff."
good,"Target is not start yet , But I have some experience from my past work, as when I was working in Dollorama they put me on Saturday shift with only one girl and it was like long weekend  it was a tough day , I learned that day ""patient"" with customer. Co workers are always good when we take care and respect.  "
good,Target as an overall company strives to have a diverse and inclusive culture.  It's a fast fun and friendly work environment.  My personal experience was a pleasant one. I gained some valuable knowledge and experience
good,"Target is a fast-paced work environment at all levels of the company structure. Guest service is a huge focus. I have learned a lot of management skills here, as well as a few different positions. This is a great company to learn and grow in. If you want to move up on this company there are a lot of promotional opportunities. You must be willing to work hard at it, and own your development. The team morale is good for the most part, which makes it a fun environment to work in. The hardest part of the job is time management. There are always a million things to do, and so little time. The most enjoyable part of working here is the team. We all become like family and everyone is willing to help you out when needed."
good,"work on unloading truck then work on softline.. have to saparte clothes and pants then go ahead work different mens, woman, girls, boys, and infant.. but too much to push push goal and must done by time. sometimes not done bc of too much."

good,I am thankful as Target helps me to maximizing one's potential.
good,at start of shift I punch in and find out where I`m at . what I`ve learned at target? I learned to be patient with all quests and coworker`s . my management there was very different. the people all work hard with us to keep quests and my coworkers happy and productive. my coworkers work hard to get the job done. the hardest part of my job was keeping quests and other`s happy so that they will shop a our store again. the most enjoyable part of my job is a job well done and a quest that leaves the store happy

good,"A typical day involves trying to get as much work in the store accomplished in a timely manner. The most important things I have learned is how to manage myself and to take the initiative to handle tasks and solve problems on my own. The co-workers are all pretty friendly, interactions a limited due to working in the backroom, but none the less still friendly."
good,"I learned how to type multiple invoices for HR, handling the switchboard, multi-tasking, payroll, and all while assisting ladies in the fitting room"
good,"I was at work everyday at 2:30 a.m. to unload and process all our deliveries and push out all the product on the flow before the start of business."
good,"I worked night shift, which was great till I got married. I'd go in and get my assigned doors ready, then keep the trucks loaded. It wasn't a hard job except for the hours. I had to run a fork lift to load heavy stuff into the trucks, and sometimes that was a bit of a pain due to the fact that they don't like many pallets in trucks. Near the end of the time I was there, all of the managers and supervisors above me were reassigned and there was a big shuffle in that regard, afterward a few real hardliners came in and their attitude was work only, no home life. So I found a day job."
good,"Greet Customers and sell a wide variety of products through product knowledge. Youll work with alot of good people and maybe some not so great but its great to meet alot of people and develop relationships with them.

good,"The team is young and energetic. It is always fun to come to work. Learned a lot about the retail industry, trends and about inventory management."
good,Generally great place to work for but very rarely do they hire from within and upper in-store management tends to generally be exceptionally lazy.
good,"Target is one of the largest retail companies in the US, and is a good place to start your work career. They are flexible with schedules and always look for the best for their employees. I learned throughout 3 years of working for them how to handle the customer needs and improved my English skills. The best part of working for them, is that it allowed me to meet great people, not only as co workers, but the customers also. only bad thing i found over the 3 years i worked for them, was somewhat the management that did not did well for some time."
good,Really depends on the store manager you have but the expectation can be over 60 hours a week. Great place to work and really love the people.
good,"Stress on providing guests with an easy and fun place to shop. The guests are the most important thing to  management, and guest service is a high priority. "
good,"Stocking shelves, answering questions and providing back up to cashiers"

good,"A typical day at Target consist of helping plenty of costumers , restocking shelves, returning merchandise to its proper place , and cleaning each level to proper order before the day is over. I learned how to multitask efficiently, staying level headed, and to clean and move at an extremely rapid pace. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with mess and making sure the store stayed organized in between the high levels of traffic Target regularly has. The most enjoyable moment for me was creating amazing moments for costumers and satisfying their needs."
good,"In the 3 years I spent with Target, the highlights to me was the great relationships I built with my team and managers.  It was fun place to work and I loved doing my job.  What was hard was balancing my work life with my personal life.  The hours, and workload often left me exhausted after work everyday.  And during the Holidays I very rarely saw my family or friends.  Management was fair, "
good,"I work part time as a cashier. I learned customer service and how to interact with people. Good experience with my manager. Hours were varied so I learned to be flexible. Hours allowed me to attend Polaris to further my education. The hardest part of my job is the variation of the schedule. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting bonuses for selling a ""red card"" to the customers."
good,"This job consisted of 10 hour 4 day work week.  It was non stop once we clocked in.  Hand load 50 foot trailers, 3 to 5 at a time. It was a 10 hour work out.  It gets you in shape.  The downside was that as an employee, you were not trained fully to what was expected.  You would be marked down if you did not complete a task as they wanted it completed. "
good,"So it's been a few years since I worked at Target, but when I worked there, the pay was low. Nothing wrong with that since the jobs aren't difficult and don't require any special skill. Everyone is pretty friendly. When I was there, there wasn't much in the benefits department. It was really easy to get a flexible schedule or get time off for any sort of emergency or issues that would come up. "
good,Pretty cool place to work  for the most part .  some  management didnt need  2 be in there  position and it seemed alot like  the advancement was  based alot on who you knoew..they  didnt always  give what u needed to complete the task at hand ...
good,"Amazing Vibe, Great Managers, great team members, fun and fast paced"
good,Very good opportunity to learn new technologies and good growth opportunities.
good,"Target was typically a busy department store. Organizing clothes and putting items back to where they belong was mainly my job at night. I would cashier during the day as well as when my Team Members would need help. One thing I learned most is team work. Team Members are put into areas of the store to organize, stock or cashier. If there was an issue an any department you were called away from your area to assist someone, whether it be a Customer or Co-worker. If you did not get enough time to get the assigned area done in time, other Co-workers would be able to help. My Managers were really laid back and very helpful with everything. I was always treated respectfully. That goes along with my Co-workers as well. I never had any issues with my former employees or employers. The hardest part of the job was having to tell people that the item they were looking for was out of stock. I did enjoy helping the customer out by finding a store that did have their item in stock and getting a thank you and a smile in return."
good,"I loved working for target they and an equal employment job and they work with you as far as family issues, schooling or anything within ones personal life. They strive to make sure that their employees have the best while working for them."
good,Great place to work. learned how to work with a team. Was promoted to team lead and enjoyed woring with others.
good,The job was very productive there was always something that needed to be done in the store. I learned a lot while working there such as how to become a better sale
good,Positions can be narrowly focused but the company is stable and very easy to navigate within
good,target is a great company but hours are never secure enough.
good,"a typical day at target for me was split between being a cashier and being a toy's sales associate. start at the register and by lunch i was on the floor helping people locate toys, stocking the shelves, and answering phone call questions about toys. "
good,"Great first time job that will hone individuals to adapt to certain situations, how to handle customers and give customer service, team leaders for the most part were very helpful in helping those individuals willing and wanting to learn more to advance their skills and move up within the company, management can be good as long as they were all on the same page with one another, the only hard thing I have encountered while working for Target Corp. was bad communication between management resulting in double work for me for example; working on or just completing a task given by one manager only to have another tell me to undo or stop what I am doing until that particular manager figures out why I am doing what I am doing, resulting in wasted time for me in completing my task or having to do ""double work"". Team members were great to work with as everyone had their own individual personalities to bring to the team. Overall I had a fun time working there and am grateful to have had the opportunity to experience and memories to carry with me as I continue my working career."
good,"I worked for Target from the time I was 16.  I advanced into a store executive position throughout 15 years.  I was able to advance due to my skills and ability to move throughout the mid-west.  "
good,"I was working in softlines which is the clothing department at Target. I was in charge of the fitting room, assisting customers with any questions they had as well as keeping the floor neat and free of debris."
good,"Worked  lot of hours, flexible availability and able to work around school. Worked with a lot of wonderful fun people but management was always changing and never consist. "
good,"Easy company to fall in love with. Everything is spelled out for you. Hold people accountable, stay organized and communicate with everyone frequently and you can be very successful."
good,"Working for Target Corporation is something completely different to what i expected. It is a rather fast, fun, and friendly enviornment to be in. A typical night at work is very enjoyable. you can feel the vibe and excitement thats in the store. The most amazing co-workers anyone can ever have are at my store, 2776 Downtown L.A City Target. One of the hardest parts of this job is that you have to be all over the place at once. Very fast pace, extremely good multi-tasker. There are various things that I learn, luckily i have gotten the chance to be cross trained which gives me the opportunity to expand my knowledge. Overall i love my job and take pride in my work."
good,I think Target is a great place to work and I have enjoyed every second of the last 7 years with the company.  I have taken away several things from Target and it has greatly improved me as a leader.  They are very big on collaboration and team work and keeping everyone within the communication loop.  
good,"Fun"
good,I enjoyed working with individuals that helped each other to strive and make the company look and be good.
good,Target Was a great company with great management. Co-workers were great to talk in work with. customer satisfaction was always first and a pleasure.
good,Work as a team to keep the floor clean and stocked. Assist guests and help them with their purchase. Co-workers were great and I loved the job. The most enjoyable part was that it was fun and easy. The hard part was that the hours were not good.
good,"A typical day at work is organizing the stock on the shelves throughout the day and of course try to push sales to guests.  Setting salesplanners and planograms were may favorite things to do.  Management was always tough on you when it came to things not selling like it should.  Co-workers were always easy to work with and friendly.  The hardest part of the job was writing up other team members for unsatisfactory work, but it was part of the job and I had to do it."
good,Good Experience with phone lines. There was really no hard part in this job. I answered calls and counted clothes.
good,I enjoy working at Target because of the cohesiveness that exists between team members and management. I have learned how to take pride and leadership in my position with plenty of guidance from management. 
good,"I loved working for target for the almost 10 years that I was there. It was a very positive environment (for the most part) with a lot of happy team members. The company pays pretty well considering it is retail. If you like to be busy then this place is great. I always had a list of tasks to complete, and usually could get help from anybody if I ever needed it. I started as a truck unloader and was promoted several times throughout the years until I was a Senior Team Lead. At that point, I could not advance any further because I did not have my four year degree. Normally, this would not be upsetting to me, but this rule was implemented a few years into my career at Target, so my plans to advance changed. Overall, it's a great place to work and they strive to be fair and consistent to all team members. I'm proud to say I worked here for 10 years."
good,Did overnight stocking and inventory....Work as a team to get the job done....Wouldn't mind going back to work there.
good,"Add all info to Company Computer, Eligibility time and days for 160 Employees, Classes on Benefits, Moderate between Employee and Managers. Schedule for all employees insuring all vacation time was input weekly. "
good,"Overall Target I have enjoyed working at Target. I landed this position right out of college and I could not have asked for a better company to start my career. Their focus on my personal leadership growth and development is truly amazing. Although I appreciate Target's values and culture, I'm pursuing other career options that align with my personal career objectives. "
good,"Its a great place to work, lots of flexibility with your work schedule."
good,Target has helped me with my independent work as well as my customer service skills. Patience is key in dealing with the customers. I get compliments and surveys daily from guests because I made their day that much better in just a few minutes.
good,"Target, for the most part is a great place to work. Never a dull moment."
good,"I worked in the women's department, electronic departments, and other departments as needed. I assisted guest with their purchases or sold jewelry and electronics to guests. I trained new team member, so they were able to perform their job duties, and I tried to be a mentor to the newly hired individuals. I also stocked shelves, and straighten the shelves, and did merchandise presentation. "
good,"  Big box retail store with several fast paced departments. My routines included opening store surveillance systems, branding the entrance (presence), surveillance (CCTV), report writing on previous incidents or amendments to previous incidents. "
good,"exercize in morning pick up order selector begin picking orders ,very good team leaders friendly co workers "
good,This job was a true testament of learning how to motivate as well as provide great leadership to your employees. For with out them your career will be short lived
good,everyone there is kind energetic and very motivating that make for a fun place to work
good,"I loved working here.  I started going to school and when asked for a different schedule, my direct manager never complied.  I believe I was fired injustly but loved the time I spent there."
good," I help oversee the seasonal section of the store by maintaining stocks, signing and pricing, consolidating active/discontinued merchandise and re-merchandising during seasonal transitions."
good,Every day is a different experience. I have learned how to drive and manage a team to work ard and complete goals. My coworkers are great. 
good,I really like the job. It allowed me to work on my people skills and help someone other then myself. I had to do re-shop which you had to put all unwanted items back on the sells floor. The environment was work friendly.
good,I really liked working here. The people I worked with were great.
good,"A typical day at work was generally fun. Helping out the guests, most were return customers, so it was easy to converse and help them out with what they needed. Working at Target has taught me how to deal with all different kinds of personalities and people. The management team was always willing to help out with any issues or questions that one might have or incur during the business hours. My co-workers were great, with some of them I have created and maintained lasting friendships. The hardest part about the job was the difficult guest who thought that they should get everything done their way and then would proceed to yell and scream in your face when the policy would not allow for that to happen. The most enjoyable part of the job was the returning guests, simply because some of them I became to know and would enjoy helping them out and hearing some of their stories. Overall Target was a great company to work for and I have learned a lot of valuable things from them."
good,Look out for one another
good,fast pace day friendly team members and communication is key throughout the day in order to maintain the store in a safe and secure manner overall great place to work best in guest services and safely working. most difficult part of the job was to mangage guest traffic during holidays mainly. Enojoyed working with a team day in and day out
good,"it was a little disappointing, i was doing a lot of management projects but got paid as a cashier."
good,"We would have team meetings to go over that days focus. After those, we would break into our groups. Because I was a part of the Hard Lines Team, I was mainly responsible for pushing products onto the sales floor, and maintaining the appearance of the sales floor. At times I would fill in for cashiers, and towards the end of my time there, I became a regular Electronics team member, specializing in tech products. Of course, customer service was a huge part of everyday as well. I learned the process of a retail store, as far as moving products on and off sales floors, how the back rooms and orders work, cashier skills, and customer service techniques. Management worked as their own team and would be responsible for different sub-teams for each shift. Managers were often helpful and kept things running as smoothly as possible. My co-workers were cheery and generally fun to be around. Helping myself with tasks I needed help with when applicable. The hardest part of the job was tending to spills and clean ups, as those were generally random in how they occurred and should be handled. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with different people, and in the electronics department. It was there I was able to interact most with customers, and zero in on my personal interest to help them make shopping decisions."
good,Overnight hours
good,"Target was a great company to work for it had a great group of employees . Target was a fast pace enviorment which I enjoyed . My management were great people I knew that they worked as hard as we did and they showed us that they apperciated every us as employees. The hardest part of my job was when we through a remodel and things weren't getting done in the time that should've been done, but it was a remodel and not everything goes as planned, but we did get through it as a team and did manage to finish the whole remodel in time. I've learned so much at Target about retail , from the front to the back of the store , and i enjoyed my whole experience there."
good,Fold clothes in each section in the store
good,"A great company with capable, fun managers and a good culture. However, the job routinely requires 12 hour days and a challenging schedule (work every other weekend and shifts that range from 4AM-6PM to 3PM- 12PM on a day to day basis)."
good,Every other month Management would hide various color coded cards throughout the store.Depending on color you could win a prize.
good,"A typical day at work doesn't sound too exciting to the blind eye, but working at Target my vision was changed. From the moment you walk into Target Wilson Yard, there is a sense of ""home"". I work my hardest everyday because I know it's the right thing to do. My job as a sales floor team member is to make sure that we are in full stock on our floor. I also set up sales planners to represent the various new items we have in our store. Everyday is filled with vibrant customers who are not afraid to open up. We get new people each day and even weekly customers. Everyone shares a sense of urgency to help our guests and still have time for ""small talk"". However, the hardest part of my day would be dealing with a rude customer. Sometimes, no matter how hard you try, people just want to get in and get out, and you need to learn to accept that. Its okay with just pointing them in the direction to where they need to be."
good,"Great place to start. I had many opportunities with this company. I was just about to complete 10 years of employment, however, I did not like the fact that the store was going to open on Thanksgiving evening, and it would be mandatory for everyone to work. That is where I draw the line. I want my family time too. I didn't mind working ""Black Friday"", but to take away Thanksgiving dinner too..... That was the last straw. Time to move on to another career."
good,"A shift consists of running the register, and helping out with other duties such as zoning (cleaning up the merchandise areas), and stocking the front lanes when not busy. Management and co-workers are all very willing to help out when it is needed, and are open to suggestions."
good,"First day at any job for any worker is very hard. As i continue to work hard, i began to understand the procedures to successfully get the work done .I learned how to communicate with co-workers and give co-workers the motivation to get the work done. Management at target was very great. They helped me with full training, working pace, and gave me more confidence.Co-workers were very helpful especially on the first day on the job . They showed me all the materials, different parts of the warehouse, and gave me feedback . The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the experienced co-workers because they knew more about the job than i did. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know the employees.We all became good friends and got along with each other very well."
good,"This is a fun and easy place to work as a backroom team member. My duties include pulling merchandise and staging them to be pushed out by other team members, smashing cardboard, and pulling out items for guests on request. The work is moderately challenging and your fellow workers are kind and easy to get along with."
good,Its a friendly environment. I think they can do better on the hours. The management needs improving. My co-workers are ok. There's not anything really hard at my job. The most thing I like about target is friendly faces.
good,Great Management.
good,Target is by far the best corporation I have ever worked for.
good,"Great crew, loved the fast paced work and early hour shifts. Manager (no longer with Target) was problematic."
good,"Typically when I went to work, after I clocked in, I would report to the sales floor manager and she would give me the section I would be working on that day. Some days I would get the women's clothes section, or the men's. Those days I would fold clothes and generally make sure the area is clean, and answer any questions that our guests would have. Some days I worked on the seasonal section, which consisted of shelfing items, searching for items in the back for guests and again, keeping the area clean."
good,"It's exactly what you expect. You work in the fast food industry and that's pretty much all you get out of it. If you're good and dedicated to your job and don't mind the pay, then this is an ok job. Advancements come rarely, but to those who really want it and ean it."
good,"I thoroughly loved this company and the job I did for them. I worked at the guest service desk, and although most people avoided working there like the plaqued, I loved being able to help the customers resolve their issues. It gave me an overwhelming satisfaction for an unhappy guest to leave with a smile. For the most part, the management team was very nice and understanding, and the store manager was one of the best that I have ever worked for. I truely believe in leadership by example, and it made me smile and want to work harder when I saw him ""down in the trenchs"" with his normal employees."
good,"Fast paced, long hours. Learned leadership skills and managing large teams. Great Teams. The hardest part of the job was managing the turnover. Employee turnover was very high. Just all and all a great place to start off your career."
good,I stock items and products back in to their shelves. I clean after people's messes and direct guests to the related item they are searching for.
good,"Working at Target as an Assets Protection Specialist, I was tasked with maintaining a safe and secure environment for our guests and team members through managing my team and spreading the Assets Protection culture throughout the store. I was primarily involved with the prevention of theft and fraud by leveraging camera strategies, merchandise protection, and apprehending shoplifters. Throughout my time there, I developed as a leader, and also fostered partnerships with the local police department- earning a positive reputation through our working relationship. My manager was enthusiastic about every aspect of the Assets Protection department, and helped define my leadership style as being one who integrates the entire team to drive for results and meet our goals. My team consisted of very motivated individuals who respected me as well as had my respect, our teamwork and communication proved invaluable as our cooperation led to effective prevention strategies as well as a 100% rate of safe apprehensions. Perhaps the most difficult part of the job was working with limited resources at times, and finding ways to effectively utilize those resources to their fullest potential. On the other hand, the most enjoyable part of the job was the sense camaraderie on the team, as every day there we all worked together to ensure we all saw success in our roles."
good,"My first overnight job. I got to use my OCD behavior to organize big apparel messes. It was fun and time consuming. I was put on the plannogram team where I could still use my skills and learn more about the store. Every night was something new and exciting. I had the best team, we got along, we worked together, and had a blast. After awhile, I wanted a change, and I left, but the people I worked with are still great friends."
good,Typical day is working as a cashier. Merchandising in the evening. A great place to get to know and involved with our guests. The co-workers are great and help each other as a team. Love helping our guests and building a great relationship. Hardest part of job is making our goal to sell our red card to every customer. To show the advantage of the discounts we offer.
good,Target is an excellent place to work for college students and high school students. It has been an excellent company for me to work for the past ten plus years. I have come and gone back to Target many times because the environment is very friendly and team oriented. I just would not recommend it based on how much money you make. Their raises are lousy and almost impossible at times to make a decent living.
good,Fun fast and friendly and keeping a smile on your face plus keep the store clean
good,"Promotions come to those who work hard, and have bachelors degrees."
good,Unloading the merchandise off of truck and down onto assembly line. Stocking merchandise onto shelves and construction of all seasonal and holiday displays
good,"Working at Target was a huge learning experience. I was trained to be a cashier, work guest service, and the food court. I had to check out people, do returns/exchanges, damage out items, sort through items to be returned to the sales floor, prepare food, wash dishes, and keep everything nice and organized."
good,"Target was a good place to work. It was easy to meet new people, learn new things and get to the part of store you wanted to be in if you were willing to do the work. The management was good, and the sales experience was enjoyable. The only thing that was wrong with the company was the leadership. The management staff were decent people, however some showed favoritism towards some while others were left on the side. It sometimes would seem that hard work was not enough, and it makes it difficult to want to work for a company that has that kind leadership. And this was not all management, just a select few."
good,I liked the people I worked with and the management was solid
good,"What i have learned at Target is how to develop and manage a team. In my time at Target I have worked at multiple locations and have supervised teams from the sales floor, guest service and and lost prevention. MY time at Target has helped me develop my people skills from promotion and development to crisis deescalation."
good,A typical day at work is easy going and very challenging. Working at target i learned new ways to handle and maneuver through situations easily. The management team was very helpful and they give you tools to make your job easy. The hardest part of the job is the most enjoyable part of the is to to meet deadlines. It teaches you how to utilize time management. It makes you understand stand why setting goals are important.
good,ran dept build displays stocking ordering etc good co workers awesome managers
good,"Target is a great place to work at. During college I was able to hold several different positions at Target and learn how to give fast, fun and friendly service. The only negative thing that I have to say is that the pay is exceptionally low for the amount of work done."
good,I really loved this job. I worked on the sales floor.
good,"really enjoyed working at target with my co-workers. I loved being on register and not so much on floor, especially when I didn't know where a certain item was! some customers asked for the weirdest things I've never even heard of."
good,I loved to work here. Target gave me a lot of experience and I was able to advance while still in school. There pay is decent (it's retail) and so are the hours.
good,"Typical day at work would consist of stocking items to the sales floor as well as assembling and repairing bikes to be sold on store floor. I learned great team cooperation and great customer service attributes. Management was not perfect but over all they did a great job of overseeing everyday proceedings within the store. My co workers while working ay Target were wonderful hard working people who valued their importance to the company. The hardest part of my job was the hours in wich I had to work my schedule at the time made it complicated to get to and from work on time, at times. the most enjoyable part of my job were the people I got to help on a day to day basis from answering questions, to helping customers with bulk items they may have purchased."
good,Job consisted of maintaining shelf stocking and backroom sorting as well as customer assistance. Fellow employees were agreeable and easy to work with.
good,"Target's values are what caught my attention when applying for a job with the company. Discrimination and judgement have no place at Target, and I loved that about the company. Target is a very clean, organized, and friendly place to work. I loved the atmosphere at Target. Everyone was so friendly, and encouraged employees to ask questions."
good,"A typical day working at Target is usually a fast paced day, always with something productive to do. I learned that being apart of the backroom team, it's not too different from working in a warehouse, except for sometimes having to work with the customers, which is a good experience."
good,"A typical day would consist of unload, stock, and do other various activities around the store in order to get it ready for opening. Management is good, they rely on those underneath them and the work gets done."
good,"Has an effective system (with flaws). Very fun to work day to day, but seems like it can fall behind very easily. End up leaving work knowing that you didn't get everything done in time just because their lack of payroll to allow you to finish."
good,Pull items off shelves. help each other out. go into the freezer to work. Work really hard to get the job done.
good,"Enjoyed my co-workers as well as the ""fast, fun, and friendly"" environment. I learned a great deal about customer service and the management was very structured. Enjoyed the fact that my schedule was already in place with I started my shift. The most difficult part of the job was the constant ""reshop"" while the most enjoyable part was the fellow employees who help you learn the in and outs of the store fairly quickly."
good,Being an ETL at Target is a good paying job for kids out of college that are unsure what to do with their degree. It is a salaried position and they require you to work 50 hours in the week but it usually turns into about 60 inorder to do everything asked of you. As a manger in the store you are constantly asked to weed out the bottom performers and must always have a bottom performer. At each level of management they are rating the subordinates in this fashion which can get tiresome.
good,Target was a wonderful first job for me to have. The hardest part of the job was being on my feet for long hours. The easiest part of this job were my friendly coworkers.
good,"Target is a very fast pace work enviroment. also fun place to work,the job is expected to get done and right the first time,over all i think it's a nice place to work, for younger people.its also very demanding ,"
good,Every night shift began with unloading merchandise from trailers and
good,It's a good place to work. Each department is very organized and they are cver clear on expectations. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the managers that have unreasonable work goals that need to be completed.
good,As a manager at Target I was able to get to know several amazing people and had other great leaders to work with. My co-workers were like family and we always made work fun. The hardest part of the job was not having enough time to complete all of your work. The work day goes by very fast.
good,"The best part of working for Target was the fact that employees were able to endlessly learn new ways to improve. With that improvement there was never a satisfactory pat on the back, nor a genuine thank you. If someone were to make a small mistake in any aspect there were harsher penalties. My co-workers were outstanding and work harder and harder each day. The hardest part of working at Target, or this specific location, was that it is a HIGH volume store and the management only used the bare minimum of employees to recover the store from a strenuous day; asking three people to accomplish something a minimum of a fiver person objective. Advancement was continuously promised, but never applied."
good,"A typical day at work involves steadfast routines. It is important for me to stay up on my emails for example, otherwise an individual may drown in the email communication. I typically check in with my team to talk about daily and weekly priorities and then set them free to execute my directives. I usually walk the sales floor to get a feel for the quality of our zone and simultaneously check in with team members through walking chats (ie. What is morale on the team like this week? or How was your weekend?). Then a lot of what I do is in my office: succession planning, 90 day reviews, forecasting payroll and scheduling, planning monthly objectives with the .Store Team Lead etc. I have learned a lot in my first year on the job, both personally and professionally. The biggest thing I learned is to set clear expectations and then follow up. Better yet, trust but verify. It is really important as a manager to give your team autonomy. I have discovered that people tend to rise up and meet responsibility head on. No one likes to come to work and just act as another number on the payroll. Give your team SMART goals and follow up, and if you can trust them give them the responsibility to check up with you. Management at Target is for grooming leaders. The mantra is ""Speed is Life"". You got to be on your toes at all times, and you better be prepared to work some long days. There is no such thing as a standard day at Target, let me tell you. Just when you think you have it all figured out the company changes something or something at the store level erupts, but what's different in any"
good,It was good work but the management was rarely present. It was difficult to connect with anyone at the workplace. coworkers were distant. the most difficult part of the job was the long lines. the most enjoyable part of the job was the nice people coming through the line.
good,"Target is a fun place to work, where the management is quite friendly, though well focused on goals. They do start you out at more than minimum wage, which is pretty nice."
good,"This is a great company but it is definitely a ""for profit"" company and family is not a priority."
good,target is a fun caring place the mangers could do a whole lot better at being mangers and there's always a new face
good,I got to learn about the retail industry hands on working here.
good,Fantastic organization i would highly recommend due to focus on talent development.
good,We got along majority of the times. Games and cookouts. The team made the days worth coming to work.
good,Target is a well balanced work place they are work friendly an its a good work family to have!
good,• The biggest mission statement was to always help guests (customers) first.
good,"great company to work for, great benefits, always opportunity for advancement. great co-workers"
good,it's always busy but easy to work at fun and out going i didnt learn to much there and the management was ok and i didnt really talk to much to the coworkers and the only hard part was dealing with alot of people but i did enjoy working there
good,•Answered questions regarding the store and its merchandise.
good,"Fast, fun, and friendly environment. Incorporate friendly events throughout the month to boost the morale. Great leadership examples by displaying amazing service to the guests. The team feels comfortable talking to management. Co-workers display team work on a daily basis. The hardest part of the job is during the seasonal period staffing the store. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to assist team members with issues; ie, payroll, benefits, leave of absences, etc. The end result, they are comfortable knowing that I'm there to take care of their needs."
good,"I've worked as a front end team member at Target on and off for four years while, at the same time, attending college. Overall, I would say target is a good place to work. They provide competitive pay and benefits, especially for salaried workers. However, my one major complaint is their miniscule pay raises. Additionally, they often want you to cross train in multiple areas without any added compensation. This includes becoming a team trainer. For example, I can work as a cashier, in guest service, as cart attendant, in the photo lab, on the sales floor, and I can train. Yet I get paid relatively the same amount (nickel and dime differences) as someone who works only as a cashier."
good,awsome people to work with but too many people to compete with for hours.
good,"It has a pretty good job. It sometimes feel like the store is understaffed, which puts more responsibility on you. Its in a very busy part of Dallas some there are always customers. Overall its a good place to work for a while."
good,"Upon arriving, clock in at the time clock. Ensure that a name badge is displayed on my shirt. I be sure to have a walkie in order to hear important messages from other. Head to the back of logistics and get a large tub of products. I push it to the floor and distribute the products to their various locations in the store. While doing that, I help assist various guests in the store. After a few hours, the leader of the store for the day assigns all team members a section of the store to restore from a long day of customer shopping. While restoring a section, I go to the front and grab products that customers did not purchase and return them to their appropriate areas. Doing all this requires standing and bending for long hours. The hardest part for me is staying very late, well after 1:00 am trying to restore the store to a presentable condition. The best part is getting to talk with new people everyday."
good,"A typical day at work involves setting merchandise to the front end of the shelf in what's called a zone. This task is accompanied with helping guests and promoting merchandise. If an individual is hired for electronics, sales of merchandise and ""attachments"" are included. Overall, the task is moderately challenging, mainly with time and task management. Those seeking a more intellectual challenge within Target should look at a higher position."
good,"fast pace, managers always around, zoning everything that was out of place."
good,Working for Target is good if your a student. This job taught me how to work hard. A good day came with guests not giving you a hard time and co-workers working with you. The hardest part is biting your tounge when you have an angry guest. The most enjoyable part was working with the different ethnicity's.
good,"I enjoy going into work everyday and working with a team who is helpful and sincere. I have learned wonderful customer service skills that I use everyday. The store provided unbelieveable teamwork that I admire so much. However, the management could be a lot better. They are somewhat unorganized and unfair."
good,The best retail job I ever had. Build a lot of great relationships there
good,You meet great people.
good,Target is a great place to work and to advance a career in retail. The company gives back to the local communities and promotes education in the local schools.
good,"I train people everyday. In the Deli, Produce, Bakery, and meat departments. Hardest part of job is training someone who has never had a job before.The most enjoyable is seeing team members excell at thier job."
good,"not a lot of growing opportunities. too much favoritism. Loved working thier, just to much too deal with. i learned a lot. very grateful for what i learned and went through"
good,I had a very good experience at one target and a so so experience with another. It all depends on the management.
good,6 am- 6 pm Tough manual labor. 2 30 minute breaks for 12 hour days
good,The majority of Target employees are hired part-time. It is a good company to work for but the pay scale could be improved. My typical day includes returniing items to the sales floor while maintaining the shopping areas. The management is fair and I really enjoy my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is doing the same thing every day. The most enjoyable part of the job is working beside people I consider friends and assisting shoppers.
good,"I loved working at Target. It was a fun & enjoyable work place. Very helpful place for customers/guests, the management was good but they wont understandable. The hardest part of the job was needing me for all areas of the position extremely: like worked harder on reshoping items back to its right section. However, I enjoyed everything I did & try my very best on staying focus. Never rude to guests. My co-workers were the greatest people working with, the most enjoyable part of the job was helping guests looking for things they needed and work as cashier."
good,"Cleaning sales floor, cashier, Stock team, Ad set, markdowns."
good,"truck unload, product push, backstock, pulls, garbage removal, chargeback....all in a days work."
good,"Target is a great place to work, and has good people to get along with."
good,Got called in a lot.Good company to work for. Staying late to do other peoples jobs cause they weren't done.
good,"Target has been a wonderful place for me to stretch my wings and to take on more responsibilities. The emphasis on employee development, is admirable, and has allowed me to develop such skills as basic SQL querying, advanced my Excel from intermediate and allowed me to get in and learn Access, among others."
good,Target wants to be the best company ever. How far off from that they are I do not know. A typical work day at Target is very fast paced. You are required to complete daily projects while helping guests. Co-workers are... co-workers. The hardest part of the job I would say is working during the holidays. Can not say that there is an enjoyable part of the job. Its retail.
good,"Target is a very enjoyable place to work. We look over notes from previous shifts to see if there are any concerns that need to be addressed such as shortages in staff for that shift. Target is a fast paced environment, which can at times be stressful. The management is always quick with assistance when needed. The most difficult part of the job is people that become overly irate. This was one of the turn offs for my position however it was also a learning experience. You learn that you can take any difficult situation whether it is in the customers favor or not and make it less difficult for everyone."
good,Unloading trailers was fun and exciting. Myself and a co workers often challeged ourselves to see who can keep up and go fast. Manegement was fun and great. I gained a good deal of retail experience here.
good,"Allowed for my detail oriented personality to thrive. I learned how products arrive at the store, how they are set up and organized. I enjoyed working with customers who needed assistance."
good,"Mostly had a great feel like everybody was a big family, although i wish the higher managers were working with us more one on one to see how we would work, instead of taking the word of another leader."
good,"My experience was good ,I learned a lot about customer service, and how to work in a fast pace environment . My co workers were also a good team"
good,"I would recommend working at Target. A good work environment depends much on internal management when working for a large corporation. I have seen a lot of people come and go but I believe if you give and get the right formula of people, you will have a fast, fun, and friendly team."
good,Target was a good company but there wasnt great opportunities for advancement
good,"Reading emails, fixing employees punches, reviewing applications and helping employees with any questions they had. I worked hand in hand with management fixing schedules calling in people to fill shifts. The hardest part of the job trying to do to many things at once, having to stop at a seconds notice and change what I was doing. The most enjoyable getting to know all the people I worked with."
good,"I enjoy working partime at Target. Very fast pace, great meeting the guests. As a full time job there would be the opportunity for advancement."
good,"Very fast paced and rewarding. Requires strong problem solving skills almost every day. As a salaried manager, expect 10-12 hour days."
good,My day starts of with greeting customers and welcoming them to the store. I would check customers in and out. I would also help customers with theirs to ensure they had a great experience shopping. I have to be detail orientated and research all products.
good,"A typical day at work includes coming into contact with numerous customers, speaking with doctors via phone, fax and electronically. Typing and processing between 200-350 prescriptions a day. Assuring that needed drugs are stocked on the shelves. Cleaning and stocking work areas for an efficient workflow. My co-workers are what makes my job worth going to most of the times. We really work as a team, making sure everyone gets the job done by holding each other accountable. The hardest part of my job is dealing with rude customers that treat my team like we don't know anything because we're certified technicians and not a pharmacist. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing a customer walk away happy with my service that I've provided."
good,"A typical day of working at Target consisted of making sure my work area was clean and organized for the day. I learned how to be more vocal with customers and more helpful. Management was a little on the lenient side which I did not take them as seriously as I should have. My co-workers were hard, dedicated workers with whom I enjoyed working alongside. The hardest part of the job was that there were not enough Receptionists, so I would often stay longer hours than scheduled to make sure they were staffed. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people, and helping them to the best of my ability."
good,Same thing just a different day once somebody calls out more work for you. You don't get recognized enough as the amount of work you do. They try to suck you dry and use you but the money is good at the time.
good,You get to work early. Unload the truck place merchandise on pallets and stock floor before store open. You meet fun and exciting people to work with never a dull moment. Picking up the funiture was the hardest part of this job. The people and exciting enviroment to work in.
good,"I liked the management, however, the location (in the mall) was not ideal. The store was always extremely messed up, and we had to stay really late. I liked my coworkers and they let you express your individuality; you don't have to cover tattoos or piercings."
good,Target is a great place to start a career.
good,typical day at work generally goes by without a hitch. everyone is willing to help each other for the most part. i've learned how to be more outgoing when working with customers and other employees. mangement does their job well. i have no problems with any co-worker. everyone is pretty cool as people. the cutting of hours has been the hardest part of working there. communicating and help customers is the most enjoyable part of my day.
good,Working for Target was a great opportunity. I loved it. Some things I didn't like but I was able to fix them. I left for personal reasons but I would work there again.
good,"*I started in the pharmacies and ended up in managed care HQ, where I would assist stores with processing claims, audits, and mitigating future loss on negative margin claims."
good,The 90 day new hire period can be terminated at any time simply by saying that an employee is not the right fit. Managers will frequently tell you what you are doing right but need to be asked frequently to go into what needs imporvement. There is also a tendency to over staff. I started as part of a 12 person electronics team but when I was let go that brought it down to 5 employees.The managers were always friendly and making sure there was good moral with lots of positive reinforcement.
good,"It paid well, they hired me to lead and to get things done...but their culture is often a hinderance to sound leadership/management practices. The team members have a lot of influence over the supervisors reviews. Management spends a lot of time addressing team issues and they also task their managers to always have a weakness they are trying to improve on...takes a lot of time away from productivity."
good,"fast,fun & friendly work place"
good,"I would assist guests, cashier, maintain the salesfloor and operate phones. I learned a lot of people skills while working there. The management was great there and my co-workers were the best. The only con of working there was not having a set schedule. The most enjoyable part was being around people. I love people!"
good,"A typical day at Target involves making sure the guests in the store can find everything quickly. We also keep the store looking nice for easy shopping. Managers always try to give positive feedback, occasionally pointing out where one needs improvement, but generally very friendly. We also usually have very friendly co-workers. The hardest part of the job is sometimes meeting time goals of trying to make sure a section of the store is in the best shape it can be before moving on to the next section. The most enjoyable part is when the store is closed and it is just you and the co-workers finishing up. Then everyone is more relaxed."
good,"Was responsible for all revisions in electronics ( 30+ on weekly basis). This started the work load on a weekly basis. Worked on sales floor daily and set tasks for the team members working in my department. Worked with management on normally basis because I ran two departments, also was scheduled to help run store on weekends I worked. The hardest part of the job was resetting department for new releases.The most enjoyable was when I helped run store on weekends because I was always moving and problem solving."
good,"fast paced, always busy great locations. awesome staff, very family oriented."
good,Flexible place to work at. Very friendly environment. Cross-training is enforced so it makes for an interesting day.
good,I love working at target. I love the people I work with. I am just realizing that I can't live off of a Target salary.
good,"I joined Target Corporation in November 2008 as a Store Team Leader. I have run both general merchandising stores and now the Super Target in Baton Rouge, LA. In my time with Target, I have had the opportunity to apply both my retail knowledge and personal passion for teams to create some of the best results in Target."
good,"Typical day was fast moving, fun. learned patience, teamwork, skilles in freight trasnport. Management was very professional, easy to work with. Co-workers were mostly freindly and fun to work with. Hardest part of the job was meeting their high productivity expectations. Most enjoyable part was the nice schedule/hours."
good,"- Unload shipments, sort products, stock the store and clean up remains"
good,"I enjoy the job because of all the effort put into unloading a truck and stocking the shelfs, but unfortunately because its retail there arent always a lot of hours to go around or to fill a whole day"
good,"We all all work as a team at Target, the managers are all willing to help the team members to finish their zones. We help each other with assisting our guests, to ensure they get the products their looking for. Guests call requesting if we have certain products in stock, if we do, then another team member takes the item and holds it for the guest. The most enjoyable part of my job, is the team members I work with."
good,A typical day was ensuring salesfloor was set and ready for customers. Meeting with associates in my assigned area to plan out daily tasks that need to be completed. Providing customer service was the main goal of our day. i learned that working together as a team you can accomplish more goals. Management worked well with everyone and was great with communicating what was needed. Co-workers enjoyed their job for the most part and was good at working as a team. Hardest part of the job was working all the different hours that were required at the time. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with customers daily and getting to know some of the regulars.
good,"Fun to work, but there isn't much room for growth. Raises are pretty mediocre."
good,"I'm usually more dedicated to doing my best at any given job but, the amount of dedication others displayed for this job (one LOD in particular) was annoying and almost scary. also, never really knew which department i would be in from day to day although i was clearly qualified for a specific department more than most."
good,"This was my first consistent job, which I kept for about 5 years until I got my Pharmacy Intern Permit."
good,it is a good company. There is no seniority so choosing your schedule does not exist. If you need a weekend off you are basically punished for it.
good,I liked working there but it just wasn't a career path for me.
good,"Normal retailer. Great pay, good benefits, friendly co-workers. You will be working hard so do not think this is a cake walk type of job."
good,"The customers were customers, some were rude and some really nice. I worked there for 3 years and 3 months, the 1st 2 1/2 years were good, but then new management came, who didn't know what they were doing and ruined the whole store. then they started to get cheesy with the hours. had to fight over hours. smh,"
good,It is a nice company to start.Target is a very important retail company.
good,"always had something to do. Made sure the shelf was stock, providing excellent customer service, making sur the customer was please with the service"
good,"Typical work day would include checking theft trends and market cases in the district, reviewing video for theft that may have happened in my absence and keeping an eye on theft within the store. I learned to stay patient and to vigilant. It could be dull for one moment and the next you won't be able to slow down for hours. The hardest part of the job was definitely the dull moments where it was just slow, you were there by yourself and watching for internal theft. Enjoyable parts were my coworkers and the days when there wasn't a slow time of the day."
good,I enjoyed the fast paced work and being on my feet and moving around. The co-workers and managers were very knowledgeable of all product and able to teach well.
good,This personally my favorite job. It was a great balance of fun and enjoyment at work. I only left because I moved out of the city. It was a wonderful place.
good,"Target is the elite of retail. It recruits talented people as its Executive Team Leaders (ETLs), who serve as assistant store managers. As an Executive, the pay is outstanding and the benefits are excellent too. The team members themselves are amazing and make every day fun. With this said, Target asks too much of its ETLs. Work/life balance is a struggle as upper-level manager expect stores to run perfectly."
good,"day to day changes, good place to work be prepared to work with several types of egos"
good,Worked ten and twelve hour days. Teamwork is essential. Most of the managmement were personable. The hardest part of the job is that the warehouse is not climate controlled and there is great stress on your joints.
good,Target Corporations is one of the most fun places i'vr ever worked.
good,"Working here has been a good experience. Everyone in the upper management has been very kind and helpful. I would have to say that it is one of the best working experiences that I have had for what one would consider a ""minimum wage"" job."
good,"Since I started working for Target in high school, the company as a whole was supportive and very flexible in helping me develop my leadership skills and communication skills."
good,Solid leadership and career direction for those that look for it.
good,"I did enjoy working there because of the people, their were very friendly and the working environment was great with customers."
good,"It's not a bad place to work, they just don't have enough pay roll to let everyone work as much as most of the employees want to work, And basically no one has a set schedule which at times gets confusing."
good,"This company has a benefits program, schedule flexability, and a fun work emvironment."
good,"Target is a place where it values taking care of its customers by approaching them in concern of them needing any help. In response, the entire store becomes a general team of helping one another to seeking customer satisfaction. Customers were the first and foremost highest priority in satisfying with bringing a stellar shopping experience. Working with the people there shared the same level of optimism, making it more fun to work."
good,challenging leadership developing company with advancement opportunities for those willing to put forth the work and stretch yourself as a leader.
good,"Reasonable pay, good company values and support system. Management could listen a little better, but when could they not? As far as retail positions go, you could do a lot worse. Make sure you live near the store you want to work at, as the people who set the schedules aren't good at concepts like 'travel time' and 'full night's sleep.'"
good,"I had a pleasant time working at Target. However, there was room for improvement."
good,Target is an excellent place to work. The Target co. offers numerous opportunities for advancement. The company culture of recognizing others and what they do is an excellent aspect that all companies should adopt.
good,Overall top talent in retail. High standards drive continuous improvement.
good,Target is a great place to work. This was my first job ever and it has given me the knowledge and skills that I can use other places. The management that I have dealt with was really nice and they tried to help anyway that could. The only negative is the pay.
good,"Target has great benefits and team activities. The culture in these stores is all about the team members and making sure everyone is happy with their jobs. They work with you for scheduling and workcenter preferences. They are much more organized than some companies can be, and they have meeting and activities focused on making improvements for team members and guests."
good,A wonderful retail working environment. Well organized with excellent training for all work positions within their company.
good,"Target is a company that benefits that a broad range of age groups, cultures, and backgrounds. They are rather flexible and are willing to help work around your schedule."
good,I worked overnight on the remodel crew and had a blast. Once I was transferred day side I was unable to continue the job due to schedule conflicts and lack of security. I would have stayed at Target over my other option if hours had been more secure.
good,"The company itself was successful and fun providing great customer service experience, however the specific managers at my location were rude and had hardly any personal life values. On the upside, there is many opportunities for promotion and experiencing all the different positions."
good,"Lots of friendly hardworking co-workers, lots of fun and appreciation - at least at my store in North Scottsdale. Great benefits. I was pleasantly surprised, if the pay had been better, I would have loved to stay on indefinately."
good,"Working for Target was an enriching experience. The employee's and the management were a team and they worked well together. Everything was based on the Fast, Fun and Friendly motto and they made sure that that motto was lived up to."
good,the job was fast paced and consistant. it was a good learning experiance. learnd alot about shipping and receiving and managment and coding items.
good,I don’t feel heard in my desire to move up within the company and to learn and grow within my position in order to move up. Their inability to recognize those that go above and beyond the scope of their job.
good,Not flexible at all with hours with a poor HR situation and constantly discovering issues with scheduling.  Not enough hours for any employee and favoritism.
good,The company strives to ensure guest satisfaction with little to no remorse on the team. It is a very demanding job at all times from team members up to higher management. There is little recognition for your efforts but there is consequences for slow performance. What else could you expect from one of the highest paying retail stores in the market?
good,Don’t help customers on your way into work.If you are late even min you will have problems .I loved working at target would love to work there again .People were great
good,The good would be the culture and friendliness of the team and management from my own experience. The bad would when hours are being cut and having to scavenge whatever hours are up for grabs from other team members that did not want them.
good,"It was a wonderful experience. Great strive for helping guests in every way possible. Encouragement, recognition for doing well. Great team of people."
good,Great place to work i enjoyed showing up to work. Most of the people i worked with were a joy and made it easy to want to come in for the next shift. My only gripe was my ETL (executive team leader) set me up for failure and to be terminated a day before my 90 days. My Team Leader did a great job at pushing people and getting the most of them. Almost everyone i had worked with had a good personality and was helpful to coworkers and customers.
good,"It was a fun job because I am passionate about makeup, but not nearly enough involvement in individual department from their manager. Overall, I enjoyed this position but I don't think I would work here again due to lack of communication and lack of management."
good,"It is a good place to work, but the hours are being cut and more people are being hired so I’m not getting the hours I need. They stay within your availability and schedule you to your needs."
good,Great leadership and communication in the work place. A positive environment is always provided by management and other staff members.  Frequent or regular customers are also very friendly.
good,Standing for long periods of time not moving was the hardest part. Some guests were very nice while others were grumpy. The pay made working weekends (the only shifts the gave me) worth it.
good,"You're expected to be on your toes for this job, but don't let that discourage you. The pay is good and management is well above average. You'll be expected to work with technology such as scanners and walkies talkies, and teamwork is your key to success."
good,"Target was a good starting job into the real world for me. Made me wake up early at 4:30 every morning. Introduced me into the warehouse life the right way. Everyone there was very nice and caring."
good,"So fun! loved working for this company not only for the good discount but for the supportive staff. Good environment to work in. Super busy, but also fun while you're working hard!"
good,Good company.Crew I worked with I enjoyed greatly.The hardest part of the job was early mornings and with the weather along with that made it hard sometimes.
good,"Very Busy "
good,"I really enjoy working at Target. The hours are great, I’ve made several friends just because everyone there is so nice. Management is great and is very hands on with helping customers and employees."
good,"Every one get well with each other, we all get things done as a team making sure everything was clean and well organized. we make sure the guest would feel comfortable while shopping if they found everything alright."
good,"A typical work day includes assisting guests, managing the Men's floor plan, and as a trainer for my team, I also help the new team members. I have learned how to properly train new team members, how to use technology proficiently, and how to run my own department. For the most part, my work culture is great. Target is a happy environment, where we work together to accomplish the best guest service, clean store, and quickly getting tasks done. The most enjoyable part of my job would be working with the public."
good,Target is a great company as a whole. The workers are great and management is decent. I don't have many complaints. Pay is good and being a regular team member they have great flexibility. I don't mind my job. It can get stressful when other people do not communicate with one another.
good,"You have to take your work seriously and be prepared for everything. I’m seasonal there, it’s an overall fun job. When I’m there I see and meet a lot of new people and it’s just fun to see how different people are. It also teaches me to solve different problems."
good,a typical work day is you checking in with a shift leader of your walkie and them telling you what to do. I learned how to interact and help customers to make the shopping process fun and easy.
good,This job requires hard work and organization. The most enjoyable part is organizing and analyzing products and consumers. People in charge have high expectations.
good,"The job was fun and learning to make drinks was never boring, however, we were always short staffed. This would create pressure and unecessary struggles."
good,"I like the environment at the Target distribution center. It’s straight to the point. Go in. Work hard. Go home. Management works. Helps. Is available."
good,"Front cash is easy, and they offer different positions throughout the store. You can be cross trained to work in different areas. They don't judge by appearances and pride themselves on diversity."
good,"This was a great job, from the interview to the work nothing but positive.  I would highly recommend this job to anyone who needs a good one and is willing to work."
good,"- This was a job which had day to day goals to achieve. Even though I did not work for a long time, at one point I also started to have the urge to finish these goals and by the end of the day keep the customers happy."
good,"Target is a large company with thousands of employees. I agree with a lot of the moral stances the company has taken over the years, and know first hand how the company strives to make a positive impact in their communities. For these reasons, I have stayed with the company for over a decade! The overall culture of the company is good, but can vary greatly from store to store. Target regularly promotes internally, but a willingness to relocate can greatly increase your chances of being placed in a reasonable amount of time."
good,We were trained at target to focus on your guests (customers). No matter what we were doing we would drop it to help out when a guest needed it. That was the main goal for target is to make sure the guests are happy
good,"I worked mostly on the sales floor and the stockroom. Prior experience helped me to succeed in this environment. As a general merchandiser, I either placed merchandise on the sales floor, or in back stock. It was a good job working alone and as a team."
good,"I overall enjoy working for Target."
good,A typical work day was able to know that there was someone there when working in a group .the hardest part of the job was working very long hours working twelve hours days
good,"Working at Target, even seasonal work, was a great experience. Each employee I got to work with was friendly, welcoming, and inspiring. Every person has their own story and being able to work with so many different faces and personalities left me with an awe of going to work each day that I did. The same goes for the management and how they operated the store. They made it their mission to energize and motivate each employee and customer alike."
good,"Assist in Most attentive friendly matter ,Hardwokers stand out and Knowledge In all departments are valuable. Diversity environment for team members and guest."
good,"The environment is really nice and the people are overall nice and easy to work with."
good,"I fulfilled the cart attendant and cashier positions, the former was not too difficult but was stressful on occasion due to being understaffed at the position all the time. Cashier was fine and management was responsive."
good,"Everyone was really understanding and knew where to help you, which ensured you got the grips really fast and without worry or delay. I would recommend any college student or those who might be new to retail to seek a position at Target due to their great worker communication."
good,Try to be yourself don’t try to be nervous talk clearly try to be like your with your friends and act like your professional and you know what you want
good,"We are always busy, so making sure that you stay on your feet is always a good thing. People can be rude, but management is always willing to help you solve a problem with anything."
good,"Target is a great place to work to earn a supplemental income. Most positions are part time, unless you are a Team Leader or Manager. The environment there is wonderful."
good,"I would assist customers in finding products related to electronic devices including cell phones, laptops, video games, and chargers.  It was mostly customer service."
good,"the management did their best, most were good nice people. most coworkers were friendly and helpful. always had something to do, always changing for the better, new renovations were creating a better work environment, management did daily, weekly, monthly meetings of recognition, support and helping. It was a fun place to work if the hours could have been better, a little strict on policies when it came to yourself or children being sick needing time off"
good,I got enjoyment out of my job and duties. I fully enjoyed my co-workers and customers. My hard work was rewarded with advancement. I was taught various departments and skill sets to be viable within those different departments. I appreciated the trust and consideration given by upper management.
good,"So much depends on the managers. Loved the company and feel they are focused on employee wellness just as much as efficiency. However it only takes one bad manager (untrustworthy, goes back on what they said, is difficult to work for and with) to turn a great job into a terrible job."
good,"I was hired for Seasonal work. I didn't know that when I took the job. If I had known this...I wouldn't of accepted a job there. At the end of the season, when they are finished with you they just don't put you on the schedule which kind of hurt my feelings.  I felt like I was just thrown out with the trash. The sad thing is....as they get rid of the seasonal workers, (the people who would like to continue to work there) are let go without a word. In the meantime they have a big sign on the door that they are hiring and new people are there all the time. Doesn't make sense. Other than that I really liked the job and the people I worked with. I just don't like the way they push people out the door."
good,Good for starting off but some people go on power trips by becoming LODs. The employees are what make the company great and fun. Good people working to make good times.
good,I fairly enjoyed working at Target. Most of the customers that come in are regulars and are very nice. Especially if you know what you're doing. Management is also very fair and can be flexible.
good,Great people. I enjoyed my time there doing the holidays. Wish there was more hours after the holidays to make me stay. But for the most part good job
good,The director of the department is excellent. Can't say enough about the great team he leads. Supportive group of team players.  Excellent in every phase helpful.
good,do not get stressed out when working here. It does get very busy and hectic but then the time flies much quicker. All the team members are very nice with the managers being very stubborn.
good,"Working for Target was a very fun experience. I worked seasonal from October to January and those three months flew by. I was in Fulfillment and that job is a busy one, especially during the holidays. I would recommend working here for those who are interested in it."
good,"my entire day was basically a never ending scavenger hunt. I would receive the online orders and then find whatever the random customer ordered or try to anyway. From the order comes into the system you have 1 hour to pick the entire batch. If you can't find an item or says its out of stock you have to walkie for a manager on duty and talk them about it before marking it as ""INF""(item not found). When not doing orders it would be help back stock freight. I enjoyed it a lot managers and co-workers were very helpful as a seasonal employee."
good,"I liked working there. It was fast paced at times, but when there wasn't anything to do management placed you in a different place to help out. I would suggest working there, they hire minors."
good,Management could have been better communicating with employees. Loved the people I worked with though. Once they started making all the new changes and added to everyone’s work load everyone stuck together as a team.
good,You are picking orders for online orders or ship from store orders and you have a time limit (an hour). It's pretty easy going unless you have a lot of orders and not a lot of people helping pick. The hardest part is when you have an item you can't find and it either takes up the whole hour or you have to INF (item not found) which show up on your stats and could make you look bad as a worker.
good,Be on time always stay busy be. Very friendly to customer keep the bathroom clean work safe been at your knees when lifting watch out for shop lifters
good,"trabajo muy movido por ser temporada alta, pero muy grata experiencia."
good,Target focuses on customer service. So they train the employees to focus on that as well.  Working for Target u get a chance to interact with a lot of different people.
good,A typical day of work will vary depending on what area you work in. Cashiering will be very busy and can be stressful. Stocking is easy due to the mobile scanners you use called Zebras. Good work environment overall though.
good,"the work is done productively and quickly, hardest part is an inconsistant schedule, best part is working with other positive employees as well as helping guests when they need assistance."
good,"Target is a very good job to have that comes with multiple benefits. They pay very well and if you do well they will give you a promotion at the end of a year based on your growth. I would recommend working there because it's fun, productive, and the team is very nice and caring. Also, they are very flexible especially if you go to school/college/have another job."
good,I liked working here. The fellow staff members were mostly all fantastic. The management is mostly awesome except for a few people. I felt supported by the majority of my direct supervisors. I personally enjoyed working here. I was pregnant when I began working here and they accommodated me in every way possible except for maternity leave (I hadn't been there long enough to benefit)
good,"Target is great! employees are awesome and managers aren't so bad! i did alot for the company of target. target is very appreciative.Open with salary flexible work hours"
good,"I spent a little over two months there before I quit. I was seasonal, and would have stayed an additional week before being jobless. I quit because my Team Lead was unfair, demanding, and overbearing. Most employees were great, and the management was smart, involved, and sympathetic. The benefits were great, with 10% everything in the store as well as other small rewards, like a free drink or two occasionally."
good,The Target in Waconia has great staff and many opportunities for learning. Target takes a lot of pride in inclusivity and acceptance. HR made a calendar every month and was able to have special activities or meals each day; this really helped build morale and comradarie at work.
good,"It's a fairly alright place if you're into seasonal work. Although sometimes it's not due to the short hours and days. Even with the decent pay, it's not enough to keep a living."
good,It was a nice place didn’t have to many issues. My managers were cool people except for one who kinda rude and mean but for the most I sorta enjoyed my time there.
good,"I enjoyed working for Target, but I also had a very good store manager and team  to work with. I did struggle with making the hours I needed before leaving, even after picking up extra shifts."
good,"I love working at target, I love the comapany's message and what they stand for. It isn't easy though, make sure you're on time and always giving it your best."
good,"Target is a great place to work in the retail world. They strive for quality and excellence in the guest service experience. They hire a great variety of types of people, which is fantastic."
good,"I worked at the Lady Lake Fl location back in 2013/14 and it was still the best place i workd at..the team was great they take care of their employees, it was a grate company...don't know if it has changed..."
good,I learned how to provide great customer service to each guest. Target is a big step-up compared to other retail stores. I never had any issues while working as a cashier. All my coworkers were friendly.
good,Working at target feels like working for an ethically driven company. It allows many people the opportunity to work with flexible schedules as well as the opportunity to develop and grow as a person.
good,"Great place to work where it is somewhat fast pace, where the time goes by quickly.  Environment is very comfortable atmosphere.  Able to move up if you choose to grow with the company."
good,"I came into the job from being a stay at home mom. It was kind of a hard adjustment, but the other employees and bosses that I have are (mostly) all extremely lovely to work with. There is the occasional personality conflict, but it remains in a professional and kindly spoken arena. My bosses are wonderful! They are very understanding and want to help me prioritize my family first. My immediate boss is highly encouraging and looks at mistakes as a way to learn instead of a moment to chastise. "
good,I recognized and appreciated the opportunity I had working there. I worked 3:30am to 12:30pm shifts and there was a lot of growth and development theough about two roles; On the floor stocking and then backroom stocking
good,This company strives to be competitive and values customer service.  Employees are treated with respect and are able to advance and grow within the company.
good,"Was a great place to work at, active and fast pace. The people there are great and concerned about employee satisfaction. The environment is really laid back and management always fixed a problem as fast as possible."
good,"I haven't worked at target for a few years now and they were going through a transitional period. They might be better off since then but during the off season be prepared to have hours cut, at one point i was working less than 10 hours a week."
good,"This job has helped me so much with customer interaction and friendships between associates. The job is very fun and keeps you moving around, gets very busy as well."
good,"- A typical day at work is relaxed and smooth"
good,"its a fast paced place to work, different cultures and family friendly, good pay for the work that you do, good hours and different shifts to choose from.."
good,Worked on a project as a contract worker which needed flexibility and precision.  Supervisors were wonderful and the contract was extended several times.  This was a wonderful experience and I learned many new skills.
good,"Target is doing its best to keep up with current trends, and they seem to be succeeding. Like any large cooperation there's ""the good, the bad, and the ugly. """
good,"Working at target is low stress and easy to understand. Everyone is willing to help you in anyway you need. When you need a day off, as long it is an appropriate time period, you can have that day off."
good,"This was a great group of people to work with and for. Had a lot of fun working with them. Every job has its ups and downs, by far the people I worked with felt like family."
good,Only down part to this job was being a smaller store you never got hours would only get 4 hours a day maybe 3 or 4 times a week. This eas a friendly environment to work in. The best part was the way they give back to the community through volunteer work and hearts for heros to help under privileged children.
good,A usual day of work for me is mainly taking stock from the back room and putting it out on the shelves while helping customers with questions. I will also help with cleaning.
good,"Target has helped me develop a fast paced work ethic and I appreciate the company for offering the chance to train and work in multiple places throughout the store. However, I recognize that other Targets may not have this issue. But my specific Target has a largely new management crew and I find their performance lacking compared to previous managers."
good,"I worked in many different departments, but the best was when I worked in the front here was a lot more organization and interaction to be had up there, but a lot less freedom to help the customers."
good,"Everyone's experience will be different depending on your training, work ethic, and current leadership just like any other work environment. Target can be a fun place to work but, some roles require a lot more work and skills than others even if you're in the same pay grade."
good,"Open minded crew that always had fun. I never minded having to clean a spill around the store or direct a customer in the right direction. Everyday at work was a positive experience and I always learned something new! I would recommend this job to any high school or college student, and/or any young person looking to move up into management. The experience was great and everything was meant to serve the customer appropriately. The only problems were 1. The scheduling wasn't flexible 2. The repetitive day by day duties."
good,"Hard and physical work. Hours can be a pain, unless you've been there for half a decade and have the ability to move to another shift. However, upon moving shifts, you will most likely be unable to retain your specialty functions or seniority, possibly even your main function. Meaning, you will have to move to a different department. Pay is exceptional along with benefits."
good,"It was very difficult to manage employees who were unmotivated most of the time but this was a good challenge to overcome. I believe when I was there the management was not very good, which fell on a lot of people and impacted this Target greatly. However now it seems they are doing better and things are more organized."
good,"After adjusting my sleeping schedule, the job was fairly easy. Unload tracks a,b,&c, then take items to designated area. Restock the store and assisting coworkers in need of help."
good,I had a good time at target.It was my first job i learned alot. I was basically in every department and learned everything i needed to lear from them.I attained skills that i did not have before.
good,"Working for Target company was definitely a positive experience for me. financially and personally I really enjoyed every minute of it. I would love to go back and do it again because I enjoy retail, and I enjoy working around people and families."
good,The job was not too difficult and it was enjoyable at times if the management wasn't too work up about meeting the items per hour to be unloaded from the truck.
good,"I would give it five stars in all areas, except for the way they offer ""competitive pay."" I have enjoyed the opportunities and advancement in skills and job knowledge on the retail side and distribution side. It was amazing to be able to work in multiple positions throughout my employment with Target."
good,"Work gets stressful during Black Friday and Christmas sales."
good,"As a customer service advocate you can expect to be standing for long periods of time.  You will have one 15 min paid break during a 4-5.5 hour shift.  You will be cross trained in self checkout, order pick-up and guest services also.  Your co-workers are so friendly and helpful, as is management.  Target is very good at working within your set schedule.  If you enjoy people, the customers are friendly and you are highly encouraged to interact with them."
good,"Coworkers and Managers are all relatable and friendly. Work environment is generally clean and comfortable to work in. Guests are also typically friendly, and it is an incredibly rewarding experience."
good,"a typical day at work consisted of a lot of multi-tasking. I learned so much  at target. I learned more communication skills, organizing skills, time management skills."
good,Good company to work for. Also depends at the location you work for. Some locations have great management and leaders and others don't. All in all the hours are good and flexible plus the pay is good.
good,"Collaborative working when palleting and putting stock on trolleys, but individual when putting stock on the floor, which gives a great sense of responsibility."
good,Stocking in the back room of the store once everything gets on the forklift we take it out to the floor then put the boxes where they need to go once all the boxes are what I need to go break it down less than two minutes and put it on the shelf
good,Target was an okay place to work up until early 2019 when many of the company policies/procedures changed. Management expected the impossible from workers. I prided myself on giving my job my all but I just could not keep up with the demands they heaped upon me.
good,"it was what you would expect from a retail job. Lots of turn over, and the management was always after the bottom line and not employee happiness....."
good,From day one I was on a great path to learning so much. Within a few months I was asked to learn and work in a different position. After that I interviewed and was accepted to work in a different position until Target decided to change course of employee duties. I look forward to working in the position that I am in now.
good,Working here was a good experience overall. They do teach you a lot and commend you for self achievement. There is a lot of staff involved and a lot of work.
good,"I loved the people I worked with but the expectations get out of control. With the new modernization that Target is going through its hard to keep up with all the communication that is handed out daily, weekly and monthly. You are given more & more things to handle and it begins very hard to keep up with all of it."
good,"Target is a friendly work environment that focussed on the guests that come into the store and prioritizes assisting everyone who comes in. On a typical day, I will talk to about 100-250 people. All while maintaining a good mood and demeanor."
good,"Honestly, a lot of how your experience with Target is based on luck with leads and your coworkers. I've seen some stores that have management with unrealistic expectations (though those are far and few between) and others that understand that you tried your best. It's not too hard to progress up through the ranks but you have to be willing to learn and able to ask for the ability to cross train in different departments to make you seem more valuable. Just go in, make buddies with the people you work with, and learn as much as possible and you'll be fine."
good,Overall a great place to work lots of friendly workers and guests. Guests r treated like friends and family’s fo our best so they get the best. And they appreciate it fully and are always thankful
good,Great customer service Making sure customers are happy helping them find what they need and making sure everything is stocked Correctly and the prices are correct
good,I enjoyed my time at Target and met some very nice co workers.  I had a variety of tasks and learned new skills.  It was a positive experience for me.
good,It was a very relaxed work environment . Cashier position s we're easy. Learning to run cashier was pretty simple. Your day went by quick interacting with customers.
good,"I worked there from around November, to January of 2019, only as seasonal, and only few were offered to work the rest of the way. I was bummed for some time, but was given a chance to always apply again. The environment was fast-paced, perfect for someone who is restless, or needs to be on their feet doing stuff. The positivity there was the most amazing thing I've experienced, and as it being my first job, I would say if it weren't for health concerns of my own, I would definitely work there as long as possible. The people were amazing, and the friend's I met there were beautiful. Overall, the experience was worth mentioning, and worth taking my time to tell everyone, that I want you to apply here. You won't regret it. "
good,Working at target is super fun! One of the best jobs I’ve had. It’s easy and managers treat you super good as long as you’re doing what you’re supposed to do.
good,"I recently finished the interview/orientation/training process, and that was all fine, but it was hard to get a hold of HR to figure out my schedule or to ask questions. However, overall the job isn’t too hard and doesn’t make me hate life 10x more."
good,"Target was my first ""real"" job, and that was very stressful, with it being a major name company in the world, and I didn't want to mess anything up or be fired."
good,"employees were nice to each other"
good,"a typical day at Target is you clock in, hear morning announcements and you warm up for work. Next you check the staffing board to see where you are staffed that day. then you grab your equipment and go to work."
good,"Target is a decent enough place to get a job. I started out as a seasonal cashier over the summer months, and went on to get a regular position as a ""regular"" cashier and guest services cashier. Trainers were kind, and scheduling was fairly flexible."
good,"overall, it was a good experience. i would just ask that they work better when hiring college students. our schedules change and they aren't always flexible."
good,This job is fun easy going if you have a team around you that supports you. If not then it is more stressful than the pay is worth. You do have some health benefits however.
good,"working at target is a calm, easy going place to work. every co-worker is friendly, and the customers keep the workplace happy. working there makes you pick up talking skills if you didn't already have the skill. the managers will always help in any situation and will teach you so you can handle the next situation on your own. they kind of give you leadership on situations like helping other co-workers and when customers need help. everything that you do at target is pretty much easy, witch makes is find something that hard to do at target. Being able to have some-control of my workday is the most enjoyable part."
good,Its a great place to work for starters. The location I worked at took care of its employees. The higher management does need to be more understanding of certain situations.
good,"Good place to work and my coworkers and team leaders are friendly. The leaders are efficient and always ready to help, and the company makes sure we have the equipment to help our guests. Apart from the standard issues of working retail the only thing that can be irksome is the instability of assigned hours."
good,The HR is willing to work with me on my hours I am able to work. Plus if needing time off a two week or more notice is needed. Will be working most holidays (Christmas and Easter are  the only holidays the Store is closed for)
good,"Overall good place to work. Constant changes can be stressful to keep up with but not impossible. Awesome co-workers make the stress worthwhile. However, a bad store manager can drag a store down very quickly."
good,It was very interesting and somewhat challenging at the same time due to different scenarios encountered on a daily basis. Customer involvement is highly expected.
good,The management at my location is great they are always willing to work with you whether it be scheduling or time off. The job is fast paced and a basic retail job.
good,"A typical day at work was fast paced the min you clocked in their was always something to do. Customers always needed help even on a slow day. I learned a lot, I was a cashier first, then customer service, then manager.  I learned a lot of communication skills and manners. Management will always have a high expectation to meet quotas but it is never negative it was always positive if you didn't meet the quota's you would not get in trouble for it. The hardest part of the job is always meeting customers needs a lot of the time they will get upset you don't meet their expectations. I think the most enjoyable part of the coworks and working their is a lot of fun because when people think of target it is always positive."
good,The work environment is fast paced and keeps employees busy. The customers are generally happy and friendly. My favorite part of working in Softlines was organizing the clothing and running the fitting room.
good,"Overall great place to work, however sometimes you're required too much for the time given. The people who work here are amazing and we are all one big family."
good,"You might have to fight for the hours you want."
good,Target is a excellent job after high school but the hours for employees are not so much. Target also help with a lot of things but also make their employees struggle in hours
good,Hey target is so nice and safe and it’s always a few opportunities that they come with and it’s easy to get a promotion and it’s kind really interesting and fun
good,"my position didn't have a lot of idle time with my co-workers, so it was pretty hard to connect with them. my seasonal position was kinda of mess with the store operations."
good,You learn a lot of different skills. Consistent schedule as a leader. I enjoy the people I work with. Management is fair and communication is a big part of your job.
good,a typical day start 4 a.m. We would get assigned to the section and then we would go to the backroom and bring all items to store floor. Read the stocking numbers and put the merchandise in its proper spot on the displays. Once the store opened we would be responsible for helping customers with find what they needed or work the cash register if trained to do so.
good,"mostly you do stocking and talk to guests (customers), management in my store are friendly and helpful, the hardest part of the job is to stay on your feet all day long and learn all aisles location section. the most enjoyable part of the day is when you can actually help guest (customer) to get what he need."
good,It is a good job and some team leaders are good and understanding while others are not sometimes they don't understand that you need the time off. not always are they understandable.
good,"Work the overnight shift. Very upbeat work environment though it was the middle of the night. My schedule allowed me to be home with very young children during the day. No sitter, just family at home, at night"
good,A typical day would start off with clocking in and then assessing the level of importance for different tasks. Working closely with multiple other team members to ensure the satisfaction of each guest. Goals were set at the start of each shift in order to maintain productivity throughout the whole shift.
good,"The job isn’t bad at all for what you get paid, a lot of things are repetitive but outside of that I can’t complain. You will always find ways to keep yourself busy."
good,I worked on the over-night crew in sandy for over 5 years. Within about 3 months on the job I interview for and was prompted to level 3 crew leader. I was one of over a dozen that applied so I was happy. The interview matters with target. I worked so many hours during the holidays but I think the pay was fair and I received benefits and paid time off so I was pe pretty happy there as a young man of my early 20's. To advance any higher in the company they require a college degree
good,"It's not the worst but not the best, It will do the job for a college student, If you do your job no one will question you. The work with your schedule if you ask them."
good,The actual working environment of target is supportive and friendly. Customers can be really difficult to deal with cause a lot of chaos on the floor.
good,Its Corporate so it's what the employees make it.they have good branding and generally good ideas but implement changes frequently without necessarily checking on past benchmarks.
good,"When I worked at Target, I had shifts that would have lots of people for customer service and checkout transactions. You will always be busy here to help people, welcome your guests, and to have fun during your shift. As a student, it was a struggle with transportation since I do not own a car. The management is very good if you notify them daily how the shift is, any customer complaints.. I would have customers that I see on a regular bases because I smile, asked for bagging preference, and offer coupons or a discount they would like for their products."
good,The best thing during about working at target was really the age group of the associates. This made it more comfortable for all the associates to communicate and sort of any issue that may have come up regarding the work schedules.
good,"I enjoyed the atmosphere of the employees and got to know our regular guests quickly. The job itself was fun and energetic but could get stressful during busy hours (Like Black Friday or after Christmas returns). Managers treated the employees to pizza, ice cream, or McCallisters subs in the break room sometimes.  As far as the job itself, It was easy and fast paced. If you want a job that's not going to work you to death, lol, then Target is it."
good,I actually really liked working for target. Very chill atmosphere and amazing crew members. The only con was the hours and the pay could’ve been a little better.
good,"I work as a cart attendant and it's a extremely difficult job to do by yourself. It's not only bring carts in from the parking lot. It's cleaning the bathrooms, wiping up spills, doing inventory in the back, and doubling as a cashier sometimes."
good,Managment actually does what its intended to do and handles any situation with ease. Its the only place ive ever worked at where it does actually feel like you're part of a team. They are very flexible with schedules so this would be a great job for someone in school.
good,Great place to work with room for advancement. It can get intensely stressful during holidays and somewhat boring during slower seasons. Customers will absolutely test you. I've worked with great people and made many friends.
good,"Target offers a great place to learn the basics of Security Guard fundamentals.  However, the pay and number of work hours do not provide an employee with cost of living opportunities"
good,I enjoyed my time there. It was my best experience of any retail job I've had. Was hired for seasonal and wanted to stay on but they didn't keep me so I was disappointed with that
good,"I have loved working at Target, I like members of my management team,"
good,"Target is a fast paced and multi-tasking environment where the work system is based on doing multiple tasks at once and providing excellent guest service along the process. If you have a strong sense of work ethic, great organizational skills, willingness to learn new things that will develop you into a better employee than Target is the place for you. Target is accommodating and flexible to work schedule so long as you put in the same effort into caring about the store and its business operating hours. Overall Target is a great place to work whether it's to move up within the company or learn skills that will help you succeed in the workforce."
good,"Would not recommend working as a cart attendant, it was always busy and management adds more work to do. However the people are nice, and understanding so we always helped each other out."
good,"Honestly I didn't mind working here. If it had met the cost of living and had full time benefits I doubt I would have left. The work environment is sore friendly, I went from knowing no one in the area to having several friends in still in contact with. The company tries to care for their employees while maintaining their bottom line. The unfortunate part is they're still not quite there for you to make a living."
good,"I enjoyed going to work for Target, however the job security aspect was an issue due to lack of hours and constant change to company procedure. Management was wonderful never had an issue and my supervisor being a fellow Veteran was always understanding and supportive of my personal issues due to military service. Directed me to homeless hotlines and assistance programs i didn't even know existed. Target cares, or at least my supervisor did. That sums it up for me."
good,It's a standard retail job so here's what to expect. Be at work on time and don't be late. You're gonna have to be a cashier at some point so remember your training. Always be polite to customers and co workers.
good,I learned to interact with the guest and be friendly and always made sure the guest was happy with everything they needed. I'm always happy to know that they were happy and I know I did my job.
good,I enjoyed working for Target all though I was making $11.75/hr until they bumped the wages up to 12.00 I received a 26¢ raise to put me at $12.01 which ended up being .01¢ more than starting associates I had great customer service and everybody there knew me along with customers that would come in and come to me because of past experiences that they enjoyed
good,"Work was great, especially with the type of people around you. It was like family. Hardest part of the job making sure everyone was happy, you get positive customers some days and negative ones on other days."
good,"The company is a great company to work for, each store has a different team culture.   Target provides advancement opportunities and on the job training for ambitious team members."
good,"I liked the floor managers for the front end but the higher up managers were rude and condescending. I still keep in touch with a lot of people that work there so the employees that they hire are great, I actually met my fiancée there. I just couldn’t stand the short hours during the week and the 2:30-11 on Saturday and than 8-4:30 on Sunday. Overall I’d rate it 4/5"
good,Target was an amazing retailer to work for. I worked at 3 different stores and enjoyed all 3. Pay was okay not the greatest benefits were decent. Only problem is if you are seeking development into management you have to be liked by everyone. You may even be passed up by other co-workers that had just made it to the bench team lead spot.
good,"Depending on the position, depends on the pros and cons during your shift. You will get bored, yet you will get stressed and you will feel overwhelmed. But overall, a great place to work."
good,I actually enjoy working here. The guests are mostly pleasant and my coworkers (most mgmt included) are as well! I cant believe you have to type at least one hundred and fifty characters to complete this.
good,I enjoyed working at target but I did not like how some of my coworkers here sniches about everything because of the color of my skin. The store was also pretty small for a target.
good,"I was hired on as a barista for the Starbucks kiosk. The difficulty with Target is that they try to run a food service kiosk the same way they run a retail operation--which really, in practice, doesn't work. There were hiccups along the way because of that. However, the HR team for one of the stores I worked at went above and beyond to help me out and make sure I got hours, even when I had unexpected car troubles. They were invested in their employees' mental health, which I thought was really cool."
good,"Healthy and welcoming environment with competitive pay, paid time off, and great benefits. Target is a great place for anyone to have as a first job or as something to do on the side."
good,I have worked at Target for 14 years now and it has its ups and downs over the years. This was my first job and has been my only job. I have grown so much by working at this company. I would say that now Target is moving to a new in a New Direction. They are upping their minimum wage to $15. That being said the hours don't match the minimum wage. You are getting $15 an hour for maybe a maximum of 14 to 20 hours a week. The store that I work at is in a college growing town. So the summer months are slow and the other months are steady or busy. I have enjoyed my time at here and I have made good friends.
good,"Everyday is different, never know what each day would bring. I would go to work and have to assess what I was walking into and change my priorities based on how my front end of store looked. I learned to  always have a plan and a back up plan so that my team could have a successful day. Everyone works well together throughout the store and we get along well. The hours are hard because there aren’t any set schedules so it can be challenging to have that balance, although I enjoy seeing my regular customers and seeing how they are doing."
good,"I have been working at Target almost 8 yrs and have worked in several areas. I’ve done freight, stocked shelves, hung clothes up on racks, filled tables with folded clothes and filled the isles with candy and gum by check out lanes. I’ve done grocery items and filled the freezers.i I’ve enjoyed learning cashier duties and socializing with customers. Managers have come and gone but the ones I’ve worked with are pretty good. Hours suck budget is limited. Over all I enjoy the work environment ."
good,Very fast pace always have something to do. Enjoyed the people I worked for & loved the discount especially during holidays. Not a lot of thing on necleses
good,"This job is relatively easy, around holidays it can pick up pace but employees are compensated with pay and catering services. The only downside I experienced was that at times customer traffic would slow, on the upside it gave me opportunities to try out new tasks and jobs to occupy myself."
good,Managers are really nice you can always pick up hours. The jobs are pretty simple and easy to comply with. If hours are cut u can always manage to pick up some on swap shift board
good,"The experience you have working for Target is directly related to how well you and the management team work together. If you don't show that you're willing, able and capable to perform your daily tasks, the management will not treat you well in any aspect of the job and make you feel like ""the black sheep"" so to speak. If you do your job well, over perform, and basically jump through flaming hoops- management will go above and beyond to give you special treatment and advancement opportunities. The work environment is dependent on which manager is on at the time of your shift, and it can be either highly enjoyable or complete misery."
good,Working at Target is a perfect school job for College and some High School Students (18 and above). Very Flexible work hours and great management staff that will help you no matter what.
good,Nice to work at.  Fast paced.  Always had something to do. Would go back if they wree hiring now near my home.    Flexible hours were available at that time
good,"job responsibility and working environment is good         "
good,Management was a little bad and they didn't really take care of you because I mean it's target but it was a fun place to work at for being Target. It was pretty easy to get promoted.
good,"I worked as an Electronics Team Member or now called Tech Consultant for 2 months. I was laid off by my ETL due to corporate cutting the electronics hours, I went from working 8-hour shifts to 4-5 hour shifts. "
good,Met a lot of great people and had opportunities to learn many different areas of operation in the store. They recognized people who wanted to work and had responsibility.
good,It’s fun to work there as a young person because I’m surrounded by people my age and I make the best out of it. I loved unboxing new merchandise and I would enjoy selling them to the customers
good,"Solid job to do. It was extremely busy during the holidays which made the days go by quickly. There was always something to do, but they always made sure that there was help at hand if a job was too much for one person, or if you did not know what to do."
good,Target was a very fun and fast paced work environment. Room for advancement and company likes training and hiring frkm within. Management is friendly and fun to work for.
good,"Management is sometimes awry, but most of the jobs get done in a timely fashion. However, scheduling hours tend to be unpredictable unless you are a full time worker. There are days where too much is demanded on you, but if you get most of what you were assigned done then there isn’t any harsh repercussions. It has it’s stressful moments but it’s also not a bad place to work."
good,N/a. It is a seasonal position with no chance of getting rehired. They go off your checkout score from your previous employment as well as how many RED card you register or gotten from customers.
good,"Great place to work, great compensation and work life balance for retail industry. Training and development programs are fair. "
good,"I like all my coworkers, but have some issues with how management runs things. They are not honest with workers and there is little transparency and consistency in work training and job expectations. They do not have checklist training, so I am still learning things that I could have been taught when I first started. I was trained by a coworker at the same level I am at, so they were not trained in how to train someone else. Target is undergoing changes right now and I am being retrained for some things- like for the check lanes, but not others like where I am usually scheduled. I find the organization and changes difficult to adjust to."
good,"buen clima laborar, horario flexible, descuentos a empleados"
good,lt was a fast paced and very busy place to work. There was lots of diversity and a learning experience for my first job. The only reason I left was due to the reduction in hours.
good,Going through some growing pains so is trying to identify new culture as a result. Have experienced a lot of turnover at the Store Manager level and up to the VP level as a result of the culture changes.
good,"The position was very relaxed, but very detail oriented. The product must be moved from the trucks and onto the sales floor to be sold. It was our duty to make sure everything was stocked and organized."
good,It’s cool there not hard just do what your supposed to and leave. If you come late and stuff you get in trouble after like 3-4 latenesses there’s also a 3 month probation so don’t do any thing stupid while your on it
good,"Target is a good place to work.  The corporate level really cares about providing for the every day worker.  The biggest draw back is that you have to become best friends with every manager you see if you even want a chance for promotion.  And these chances for promotion are dangled in front of you like a carrot on a stick.  Results aren't used as criteria as much as how much someone likes you.  "
good,"This was my first real job, aside from odd jobs, and I can say for sure that it is a good job starting out. The people are friendly and even during rush hour the job isn't very stressful. However I don't recommend staying for too long unless you know can get a consistent string of shifts."
good,Was nice. Management was very well trained. They had their off days but other than that the work environment was great. No issues with me just about my hours
good,Very relaxed and great people around you while working together to get the job done. Each task is assigned to a specific group but everyone works together to get the task complete
good,"Target has a Sunday - Saturday work schedule; as a Leader or TL you get every other weekend and 1 day through the week off. Very charitable company! Lots of fun, especially on Black Friday"
good,I got to know my co-workers pretty well and socialize with them on breaks. I was able to assist many people in finding items that they were looking for. The atmosphere was positive and supportive.
good,"Target has been a fun place to work - but expect to work hard.  Currently with Target's new way of doing things, ""Modernization,"" there's been a lot of change in job duties and hours, leaving many team members confused about their roles - and not always very happy. I'm hopeful that bugs will be worked out soon and there will be more job satisfaction. I've been happy with management and perks.  Schedules and time off can be very flexible. I'm not as satisfied with pay. The starting wage will be raised to 15/hr by 2020.  All current employees can expect to recieve a dollar raise every 6 months until $15 is reached.  What I don't like is that this renders merit raises essentially void.  I had my review in May, got a raise, but on June 1, my salary will go to $13. $13 is great, but not when I just had an ""exceeds expectations"" review and will only be making as much as new hires.  I think it's a pretty bad practice and not one that makes you feel appreciated."
good,"Guests comes first at target, they treat the guest with care and they make it a fun place for guests to shop. They have specials for the red cards holders"
good,"Working at Target requires flexibility,  strong work ethic, and a willingness to cooperate with team members and guests. Target provides its employees with open availability, and accommodations This is especially good for working students."
good,I enjoyed the work. Most of the employees were cooperative and helpful. I was taught other skills in departments other than where I was assigned. I wish it had been permanent.
good,"I've worked at Target for 17yrs. At the most part I enjoyed every year I worked there. I started as a truck unloaded. Learned as much as I can and was promoted to stockteam supervisor in 4 months of being hired. I worked in the backroom for 6years. I wanted to learn more, so I was given the chance to work on the floor. As a department supervisor. I wore many hats....hardware, pet supply, housewares, sporting goods and toys."
good,"Good benefits, good work/family balance, treat employees with respect. Good employee discount program, Good opportunities for advancement, pay holidays."
good,"Early morning shift can be hard. A typical day at work was busy, always a lot to get done. Half the time there was help. I learned the ins and outs of Target and how the business worked."
good,Great Benefits Nice Schedule everything is consistent and or is balanced HR is very verbal about everything and let’s you know about the business and how it’s going
good,"Objectives are posted on a board and able to be seen soon as you sign in. Upper management is clear and concise on what needs to be done.  Tasks are delegated appropriately and there is a sense of achievement when the whole team gets a good close and reaches their sales goal.  At the end of the day, you are still working retail, but the fun and light hearted employee staff makes the work shift enjoyable."
good,"Target requires all workers to be people friendly and respectful, first impression goes a long way with customers. I succeeded well with my time at target because the job fits my personality, busy, friendly, and hands on."
good,"They had a friendly environment and management was great, I just worked there during a slow period, so I didn't get many hours and it was only a seasonal position."
good,Working for Target was a positive experience. I got a chance to work with people from all walks of life and build some strong connections with people while I was there.
good,"Depending on what section of the store you work in, it can be kind of stressful to get stuff done. Softlines (mainly clothes, anything on carpet) is pretty easy, but I’d say hardlines (especially good and electronics) is the hardest."
good,I learned a lot f customer service values with Target. I took my Target values to other jobs and have been successful. I still use my experiences interviews.
good,"Advice to management make an effort to promote from within more. Encourage polite dissent rather than quiet obedience. Benefits. If you're looking for a job with excellent benefits, you'll love working at Target. Target employees receive numerous benefits, including health insurance, dental insurance, vision benefits, 401K, enrollment in an Employee Assistance Program."
good,"Leaned some cash register functions, and dispensing and drop-off, scrip count was very low , had a tech school volunteer doing most of the tasks , not much left for me a s paid technician"
good,"I loved the environment of the job; but sometimes the management did expect too much especially when you only work for example, 4 hours and you are closing. It simply is not enough time to. Overall, I did learn and enjoy working here."
good,"I worked at Target for roughly two and a half years. In that time I was a cart attendant, a cashier, a guest service member, I covered occasionally for hardlines, and by the end I was a GSA, which in my store acted as a shift manager. ( I learned over time that isn't the case in all stores). Overall, I really liked my job, it payed more then minimum wage, being cross trained I was able to obtain more hours a lot easier, and management was pretty good about getting more hours up when possible. Though there was plenty of weeks where hours were nickled and dimed away. Something I found annoying was that I got 3 pay raises since working there, one of them being for my promotion I was told. When I left I had the same pay rate as cashiers who just got hired, despite having at least 3 times the responsibilities."
good,Good training and able to jump into routine flow easily. Directions per day are clear while leaving a bit of room to complete or help with other tasks as well
good,"Target was a good job, it is very relaxing and easy work. Target treated me like I was part of the team and the work space was really good. They created a environment for everyone"
good,"It's a good job for someone who is in school. But definitely not for someone who has people to feed. My department averaged at about 22hrs a week, kinda sucked. But management was great everyone I worked with was awesome and helpful."
good,"I loved being a cashier and interacting with customers daily, I wish I could've stayed at this job longer but it was only a temporary job. I would highly recommend applying the pay is good as well."
good,Its a great place to work you just have to be committed to it and be willingly to work and working hard but i do love the work place environment the coworkers are nice and they treat you with all types of respect
good,"Learned to interact with customers, fellow employees, and stress. However, some days there was a shortage of staff and had to work a bit harder to pick up for absences. Overall a good first job experience and happy to have great members to work with."
good,I enjoy the people I work with and think the pay is fair for me a part time job.  Management is good but the down side is that's it's always changing.
good,"I don't really know what to say other than Target is a great place to work. The pay is progressive for my area, store management is professional, very tolerate workplace for all workers. All-in-all a great place to work."
good,"Every sunday is time and a half, understanding management, and a good group of people to work with. The hardest part was getting all of the cardboard disposed of because it was so much of it. The most enjoyable part of my job was working overnights because I could listen to music and it goes by quicker."
good,"A typical day at work for me would include printing reports, problem solving for team members, assisting managers with reports or questions, answering the phone, scheduling, monitoring training and any other requests for help in various departments.  I started at a Guest Service Attendant which is an acting front end manager position.  There I learned important people and problem solving skills.  After 9 years in that position I took a Human Resources support position.  I love Human Resources because it enables me to use my organizational skills and get to know each employee.  The hardest part of the job is scheduling.  It takes several hours to make a weekly schedule because of the different availabilities of team members.  The thing I enjoy the most is interacting with my co-workers and being able to care for their needs whether it be a scheduling conflict, help with training, or helping them with their benefits and any other problems that may arise."
good,"-8 hour days"
good,"I enjoyed my time at Target because of the culture and the various customers that came in. In my personal experience, the management was awesome most of the time and gave you guidance whenever you needed it. They were thoughtful of employees and if there was a lot of work to do in your area, they would help or send someone to assist you."
good,The pay is good as well as the people you work with. Schedules are flexible especially when you're having personal issues. Sometimes understaffed and sometimes things are highly expected of you by managers that are way out of your control but overall a good place to work at especially if you want to make a career out of it.
good,"I am a Retail Sales Associate in the Electronics Department at my local Target, and I enjoy it there. My typical day at work depends on what they have planned for me to do. My co-workers are really friendly, same with my managers. Everyone is treated equally, with equal pay as well. I usually get paid around $12 per hour, which is a good amount, especially if it's your first job. They usually keep you busy with things to do in your specific department, whether it be pushing new product or keeping the aisles tidy. Overall, I recommend it."
good,"Target was such a fun work environment for me, I loved it. I started as a seasonal employee and got hired on after 2 months. The issues I did have was the pay and the hours that are given to the employees."
good,"Enjoy working for the company, but am seeking to have more hours, for just cashiers only part time is offered and have to switch and pick up shifts to get 20hrs a week."
good,"It was a low stress environment surrounded by good people. I felt like I was given a fair amount of work to do. I wasn't standing around doing nothing, but neither was I under constant stress."
good,"target is a very fast paced environment so you're always on the move to get projects done. truck can be very big or very small, either way it keeps you busy. along with answering phone calls and helping other areas within the store."
good,"Target has helped me learn how to work a lot better with other people, I have learned the appropriate customer service ways to deal with situations.  They have taught me things about stocking and inventory as well as cashiering."
good,"This is a company on the upswing, both locally and nationally. Great benefits and compensation. Work life balance can be a challenge if you lack time management or prioritization skills."
good,"I learned various stocking processes, packaging processes, how to use different types of warehouse equipment, and developed good customer service skills."
good,Management very easy to get along with and please - just do your tasks for the day. Company has a lot of resources for you to use to help customers. There are also a lot of resources for the employee.
good,Being a baraista has its ups and downs. It’s a bit stressful when being a new employee and learning all the drinks and how the are all made. Once you get that down it’s pretty easy. I made a lot of close connections with regular customer that always came in they were all so sweet.
good,"logistic/instock team member restocking shelves of all merchandise, backstock items and pull items from brackroom accurately while preventing product damage, pick items for guest orders, maintain backroom organization and location accuracy and follow equipment guidelines."
good,"I worked there for 21 years and really enjoyed it.  I was in Technology Services.  A few years ago, however, if you were did not have an Engineer title, your job was at risk.  Over the last few years, they started eliminating the supporting roles."
good,"Typical workday consists of productive, customer-oriented work."
good,"Great company to work for. There are lots of benefits of the job. However, its a hard work/life balance for anyone with a family. Most shifts are 10a-8p and you always work 10+hr days."
good,Help keep the store safe and guest safe greet guest and hand out cart check receipt help with apprehend subjects merchandise high dollar item do live video surveillance on camera
good,"old management was kind of full of jerks. made you feel bad about ridiculous things, would gossip with other managers in front of employees."
good,"Target is a culturally balanced company, that changed often. Once you obtain Team Lead roles there is not much room for advancement. During certain times of the year, the job becomes stressful and overtime is mandatory which does not allow for time for family."
good,"It was decent when I was in high school, I was only on for holiday so I didn't work there for very long. It definitely was a good starter job, and the people there were really nice!"
good,"Hours are decent, they dont give ot, but hey always ave alot of free giveaways. i had this job for over 3 years, its very easy to keeep as long as you work decently and communicate with management"
good,Started out as a team member and really enjoyed it. Great benefits and hours. Overtime is on a volunteer basis however there can be mandatory overtime. Took a long time to get promoted to Operations Manager and found out it's not for me.
good,"I work in the clothing area which is very fast paced. Probably one of the least favorite departments to work in. Slow advancement. Hardest part of the job is balancing out duties for the day; pushing truck, fitting room, guest servicing, clearance, label maintenance, zone, and visual merchandising your area of the floor pad. Work flow is heavy most times in each approaching season or holiday. Most enjoyable part of the job can be guest interaction and the people that work there. Workplace culture is very diverse. Everyone is friendly. Management can be strict when it comes your completing duties in your area. I think that's the biggest struggle right now is how to finish your truck before a certain time of the day, meanwhile guest service by driving sales and saving sales, label and pricing maintenance. Its to good let management know if there is a problem you have. Many times they will try to figure out ways that can help the work flow be more efficient. Team members who are more efficient and have more open availability will get to work 36-40 hrs per week. It can be hectic but its good work ethic. If you're looking for advancement, it is easier and quicker to start out being a cashier. Almost rare in the rest of the other departments, unless they're in desperate need."
good,Filled with hard working people but also some who are nepotists. Employees who had few work experience were considered being promoted rather than employees that had more work experience because the supervisor took a personal liking to the worker with less experience. Other coworkers talked foul of one another when certain company wasn't present. Excessive drama in the backroom and was typically caused by the same two individuals.
good,"A typical day at work can be quite busy, depending on the time of day. Weekends are the busiest, but also during holidays are when it gets crazy. There is always a task to be done/completed. I learned great customer service skills, handling issues, solving problems, working with machines and handling money, and selling our Target Redcards to the guests. The management was okay, they were very attentive to your opinions/problems you were having, although it would be rare if any of your problems were to be fixed. They were easy to get along with, though. The hardest part of the job for me was when the photo machine in Target would get jammed, or whenever I had to deal with a big issue a guest was having. The most enjoyable part of the job was definitely the coworkers, meeting new people, and having great conversations with different guests."
good,What I've learned from working at my job is everyone is not going to like you as an employee. But you have to overcome the difficulties between employees. I think it helped me mature and become a better employee that likes to communicate with others.
good,Treated fairly and like an adult by management. Good amount of hours during the holidays but not after the holidays. Not sure about advancement. Overall a good experience and they pay fairly for the industry.
good,"While the retail life wasn't for me, as a company, Target is the best company I worked for. They have an excellent life/work balance and set up their schedules accordingly."
good,Good job for people that want something quick dont recommend for long term because it will take you 5-10 years to get a promotion but overall very fast paced be prepared to be a stressed out sometimes because it gets really busy in the weekends and seasons like winter and summer
good,"Target is a great place to start working if you are a student or need a part time job on the side. And if you want to go full-time into retail, the opportunity to advance to management is definitely there. Although Target stresses work/life balance, it can be difficult to find a balance if you come in with open availability since Target is open longer hours and more days than most retail stores. I think Christmas is the only holiday where the store is closed for the full day. Time off has to be requested 3 weeks in advance, but is otherwise flexible. Since many employees are students, Target is very flexible with changing availability to accommodate classes and leave of absence for those going away for school or internships."
good,good place to work while in school. I was able to attend school after work and balance my daily activities. The work place is very friendly and works together .
good,Target arranged many fun activities to improve the happiness of their employees. Management turnover rate was an issue. It is hard to impress your boss when you have 4 different managers in 3 months.
good,"Very easy job, not trouble getting used to it and a great side job as well. Fast paced, controlled and welcoming environment. Management was friendly and understanding at San Dimas location."
good,Coworkers and mangers were very friendly! The workload was never more than you could handle and everyone was willing to help in other departments if needed!
good,"I enjoyed working for Target due to their reputation as fun, with quality merchandise and great employees.  I coached a team, assisted with escalated calls, and was challenged with interesting projects.  The biggest challenge was ensuring that all customers were happy during our peak season."
good,The job really isn't that bad. I think it really does teach you a lot if you never had a job before. You do really have to have thick skin working in retail because you never know what could happen.
good,"I worked there many years ago but I have nothing bad to say about them. I don't really remember too much of how it was ran. O was just a teenager. I dont remember having anything to complain about. So it was probably a very comfortable , welcoming place to work at. Most teenagers complain about any little thing."
good,Very different culture than Wal- Mart. Everyone and everything is held at a higher standard and work was always fun with no awkwardness about asking questions. Managers and customer service were way more hands on.
good,"We always stayed busy and had plenty to do. Sometimes there was too much for the amount of time, but we always got to it eventually. The employees were nice and the benefits were great."
good,"A great place to work if you love retail. High base salaries and competitive bonus structure. Great technology and process that support workload. Better than average training, great financial  reporting and good retail culture to work."
good,"Unlike my last job, this is a good enviorment to work in. Great people, not bad hours. The Management is not bad but they could work on a few things how they have people work the hours and where they put people. I like people so it was easy to adapt and talk to customers like they were my friends."
good,"Very easy job, once you get in the swing of it. Competent managers. The only down side was very limited hours and frequent there were some very rude customers."
good,"It's been 3 years since I was a Temp cart boy at Target and from what I remember I loved the people there. Job tasks were straight forward and the employees were the best part of coming into work everyday. The management was a bit too much but I did my job and made great money, if I could go back I would."
good,"Everyone that I have worked with are very helpful and supportive. Although it can get stressful at times trying to get tasks done, everyone is willing to give there support and help you succeed."
good,"One theme I consistently found throughout the company is the willingness to help a fellow Team Member regardless of time, position, and level of urgency."
good,"After having been away from retail for 7 years, I was hired as a Team Leader at Target.I was able to further hone my merchandising skills, as I was assigned to the Toy Department for almost 2 years.  This experience helped further my career."
good,I enjoy working at target. Customers are always friendly. Management is not so bad. Cashiers work the shorest shifts 5 and half hours max.The only thing i would say i dislike is the hours they dont give lots of hours.
good,"Flexible fulfillment is friendly fast-paced and is a great job for people that are comfortable with that. Constantly required teamwork though it also a great role for independent people. Hardest part of the job were the somewhat crazy hours as my schedule was constantly changing. The most enjoyable part of the job is the sense of accomplishment when you get the job done. Management was great, managers were really helpful and patient from day one."
good,"I've worked at Target for the past four years, gone through three managers. Each one had their own style and I didn't agree with everything. Ultimately it comes down to corporate ways of running business. Over all like my job and like the atmosphere of the job. Hours can fluctuate and aren't always consistent but there is usually opportunity to pick up hours if you are willing to have open availability and answer calls from work/call back."
good,"I worked at the Exton location for almost two years, and I left last March to work at a pet hotel full time. That didn’t work out and now I’m stuck working at Bed Bath & Beyond, which doesn’t even compare to Target. This location has pretty great managers, and even better coworkers. I told my HR TL at the time I couldn’t work my last scheduled shift when I gave my notice, and she said it was fine and she’d get me coverage. That day came along and I get a call from another manager asking if I was coming and I said that I was told someone would cover my shift. Anyways, because of that, it seems not rehirable and I really miss working there, I highly recommend."
good,"target stores is one of the best places I have had worked,  Paid training, benefits, sick days, paid vacations.  friendly people a lot learning everyday is a  learning experience,, shame that under the same roof management has favorites and friends, I used to work in the bakery department where the manager and friend will take breaks together and leave alone the other person with the work load, the upper management super , love them,"
good,"Target was a decent paying job, I had no issues getting hired. All of the employees were very nice and treated me like family as soon as I started working."
good,Target Was An Really Good Experience And A Good First Step In My Life Due To The Fact That It Was My First Part-time Job. The Managers There Was Fair And Also Team Member Friendly. I Learned That Working In A Fast Pace Environment Takes Time And Thinking So That Everything Can Be Done On Time And Correctly. The Hardest Part About Working At Target Was That There Was So Much Back Up Work That IT Was Clashing With The Task That Had To Be Done In That Time Period. The Most Enjoyable Part Of The Job Is Interacting With Different People
good,A typical day at work would be helping out guest with any questions about the store overall. I would often cover many shifts because the other employees did not want to work at that specific department. I would clean up the isles and make them more pleasant.
good,"Target is a fabulous company to work for. Every year, you get a review where you get a small raise, which is great! But when the minimum wage rises, they change the starting rate to that. But everyone who had already worked their way up to that after years of employment we're making the same as an entry level part-timer."
good,I really enjoyed my job at Target. There was wide variety of tasks to complete. Management was lacking though. They had a large turnover at out store.
good,"Working at Target was especially fun and everyone who worked there was super friendly and helpful - it was genuinely like a family atmosphere! The guests were always super patient on busy days and generally very nice. Sometimes, it'd just get a bit stressful and hectic when there were nonstop guests coming into the Starbucks and I was the only barista working. I loved seeing all my regulars though and I loved talking to all my coworkers! I really loved it here and was sad to leave because I'll miss everyone."
good,"Working as a seasonal hire for target, I would rate my experience very rewarding. It seemed like a very experimental store but I definitely learned a lot about working in a department store from my co-workers"
good,"target is a very good retail place it helps you with customer service . you learn responsibility , how to get many task done at once . very flexible with hours ."
good,"I would recommend this job solely if you don't need consistent hours or high pay. Target has a very consistent slope of hours given so anything past May is decent but Jan-May, everyone's hours are cut horribly. Target is very strict on pay hours, breaks, etc. However you do get a yearly raise with good performance."
good,The managers were great and very helpful. It was fast paced and could get busy at times. How ever the managers and teams leaders made sure you get your breaks.
good,"i really enjoyed working there. made a lot of friends, co workers are super friendly. some LOD’s are bullies and make your job harder especially if you’re a cashier, they pressure you to pressure the guests to get one."
good,"Typical shift started with brief cleaning and stocking of my checkout aisle.  Learned to deal with co-workers, management and customers. Most difficult part of job was standing in one place for long periods due to constant customer checkout.  Enjoyable job with many opportunities for customer service."
good,"Although It was fast paced, the work was fun to do as long as you know there were coworkers there to help you. It was a great experience to have because the people you worked with all got along. The manager was great as well, he was very well respected and everything he did was great."
good,"Clock-in, for me I was a cashier so, I would go to my station, clean anything around it, then log-in and start serving customers. I would do this until the end of my shift."
good,"Pretty much the basic fundamental if you had already experience working in retail and customer service. Being out/well spoken in most situations you deal on the sales floor. Culture is the big key to success in target. Overall, I had fun working for target and with the other team members."
good,I worked at target fresh out of high school an I can honestly say I really enjoyed working there. Management was great at that time it was room to grow within the company. I had a wonderful experience while working at target!
good,"The job in itself was very easy tasks you could complete once you got the hang of it. Although it was a little confusing at first because there is just so much to learn, but confusion is expected at a new job."
good,"Quite a few great people that worked there. Had an issues with the scheduling a couple times, but for the most part they'll work with you. Only time I had difficulty was when I had to work flex (getting the stuff for the online orders) since you're on a time limit, but everyone did what they could to help out. All in all, pretty good."
good,"This job was exactly what I was looking for; physically active and good pay.  The hours before Christmas were pretty harsh though, 50-60 hour work weeks.  But when your shift ends it ends.  There's no working until you finish the job, you drop what you're doing and leave."
good,"When I have a morning shift; I get out to the front end and check with my supervisor to which register I'm on, or if I'm working self-check out. I then get to stocking candy and any promotional items that we have, I also stock the dollar area of the store with new items for the guests that come in. When I'm working a night shift, I check with my closing supervisor and see if any of my team members are going on break or if they going home. I also zone the soda coolers, the promotional areas, the end caps, and then the dollar area and savor spot. I also put away any go backs that we have, and any hangers left over from any clothing that guests had. "
good,i learned many new things working at Target. For a first job i do recommend others to apply and just go for it as i did. Some coworkers make it worth while and i look forward to work when i know i get to work with coworkers who see me as friends.
good,"Working at Target was pretty enjoyable, although fast paced. My co-workers/managers, at the time, were very understanding and a pleasure to work with. They offer okay benefits with a decent amount of vacation/sick pay. The only downside would be the very low salary wage."
good,"Social environment, fast paced, good training, one of the best perks is the discount, productive work area, friendly coworkers, flexible hours, supports education."
good,I dont want to work 12hr nights and weekends anymore. So this is why im looking for a new job. Ive met some nice people. The pay is great!! Holiday season is very busy!! I dont mind the hrs i like the change but i do miss 1st hrs.
good,Loved the workers. Didnt so enough recognition to the sales floor. Neec to pay better. They need to pay people based on how the work. But i like the job overall.
good,"Job requires great people skills. Management is friendly and willing to teach you a lot. My coworkers are fun to be around. Culture is warm and welcoming, you'll definitely like it."
good,"Target is a great retail opportunity. I mostly work in the guest service department of the store. a typical day involves assisting guest with card payments, returns, exchanges, price adjustments or corrections along with assisting with any other issues the guest  may have or encounter while at target. The one thig I enjoy the most about target is that everyone works as a team to make sure that the guest's needs are made. Sometimes it is very hard when every need can not be met for our guest due to certain Target policy's that must be followed, but when we do have the ability to meet each guest needs where they live our store satisfied with their experience, that is the best part of the job."
good,"dedicated workers, willingness to work with your available hours, concern for their customers and business growth.  Only negative was the lack of time put into training staff."
good,"A lot of waking back and forth. 90% of your time will be on your feet! it can be a very fast pace environment.... I learn all my customer service skills from this company. It has helped me advance in other places do to this experience. Management during my time needed a little improvement. Great culture ..I made lots of friends here.. Hardest part was advancing to something higher since i had no college degree even though I had plenty of experience and knew the ins and outs of customer service and the way target ran...they rather invest from the out side instead with those that have already invested inside .. and to top it off they give them better pay. Example: i got hired as a cashier and got  promoted  in 6 months as a GSTL making 10.11 an hr and someone in my same position from the out side ... a week later got hired making $14.25  an hour. This person had no idea how to do the job or what target was about!! i was her trainer. Thanks to me she learned the ropes."
good,"Target was very busy throughout the Christmas season. Co-workers were helpful and understanding in training me to use cash register. Each day was very busy with tons of shoppers checking out, The hardest part of the job was getting the plastic bags open. It was also difficult to read the tiny numbers on the backs of the gift cards and key them in. The most enjoyable part of the job were the grateful customers that I was able to help whenever there was a problem. I also liked helping the parents out by keeping an eye on their children while they were doing self check out and giving the kids stickers!"
good,"Helped clean the isles and get the produce section ready."
good,Working at target is fun especially if you loce shopping there. The discounts you get aren’t much but it does help somewhat. It is a fun place to work with depending on your fellow team members. It tends to be a little stressful and fast paced during seasonal but it dies down and is slow paced. Also depending the day work varies.
good,"It was a temporary job but I did have a good experience overall. My hours were good and I had long lunches. The store itself was very unorganized and sometimes I couldn't fulfill orders because back stocked merchandise would pile up and make certain areas inaccessible. I dealt with difficult customers in a professional and easy manner. I always cooperated with my fellow employees and managers even if I didn't get a long with them in certain cases. The environment was still friendly overall, and I'm glad I now know what it is like to work retail. "
good,"I have enjoyed my time working at Target. I have worked for the company for almost seven years, in many positions. Target has taught me a great amount of knowledge and patience."
good,"I had a really good manager when I worked there. Sadly he is no longer with target. "
good,"a good job if your in school. pays well. hours are great during holidays, but after hours are cut drastically. The better you work the more hours you'll get."
good,"A typical day included banking registers, supervising cashiers, addressing guest issues good and bad.  Management had some issues with playing favorites.  ""Hardest"" part of job was getting my immediate supervisor to be fair.  The most ""enjoyable"" part of the job was working with people.  I totally enjoy customer service."
good,"Target was, and still is, a great place to work. My only problem with them was a lack of consistent hours. Otherwise, the environment was fast paced and demanded you keep up with your work, but it was never to the point of being overwhelmed."
good,"Target Distribution is a great place to work if you are looking for something to keep you busy for a full 12 hours. Conditions during the summer can be very rough, but they make sure you stay hydrated. They have certain requirements that they expect you to fulfill within a month of working there. Aside from the paid breaks, you do not get to communicate with your coworkers (in certain areas). That can make the nights drag and feel like forever. I had trouble finding work enjoyable without having that communication with others. If you like to work alone and are a hardworking individual, the distribution center is right up your ally. Management seemed to genuinely care and listen for the concerns/safety of the employee. With the rise of certain holidays, the workload can get rough around times. Overall a great place to work if you are willing to put the time and effort in."
good,"You have to be flexible, not only with hours but with the customers. Not everyday was the same, however the atmosphere of target is amazing and it is such a great place to work at."
good,"The workplace culture was very relaxed and open. I felt as though I were being useful to both the company and the customers and I never felt like the job depressed me. Plus, paid breaks!"
good,Pretty easy job overall as long as you do what you're supposed too. made some great friends there. Didn't really enjoy the bosses there but everything else was fine. The pay was great.
good,"I have the opportunity to work at different stores with their own style of management from excellent to acceptable. But, usually, this company has a good environment from workers"
good,Target is a great place to start a career and gain management experience. Target provides challenging assignments in a fast pace retail environment. Where team work and guest experience are key to the success of the business and personal goals.
good,"During a typical work day you will clock in and go through a smooth transition, beginning your work without having to check in with any specific supervisor on an average day."
good,"Working here was pretty good. I was a cashier and the job was honestly straightforward and easy. Also, they want everybody to get a customer to apply for their credit card at least once per day."
good,"Target is a great place to work. It's just that, I wish the people who work within target should have more opportunities in moving up. The workplace environment is great. I enjoy helping the guest and making their day better. I enjoy accomplishing my red card goals for the day even week. I want to move up in my position, so I make sure I take every opportunity to learn something new."
good,Every day management was encouraging and came with a positive attitude. Target is extremely team orientated and pushes you to work collaboratively with your coworkers to be efficient and productive.
good,"Working at Target was a blast. My hours were flexible, the work culture was jovial, and the management was excellent. I highly recommend Target for people who are looking for temporary employment."
good,"Wanted to work full time but they placed me in a seasonal position as it was right before holidays. Was told on phone that I could work in electronics and ended up working Hardlines. 90 days later they kept me on as part timer. after 5 months they transferred my position to electronics (as I desired) after being well liked and working well. "
good,"Now with the starting pay going up to $15 an hour and the minimum age for working there still pretty young at 16, it's a great first job. It teaches you a lot it's just very stressful. The workload is a lot. You can advance if preferred. Paid 15 minute break with 4 hour shifts. Unpaid lunch with 6+ hour shift. Unpaid lunch at 5+ hours for minors."
good,"A routine schedule that's not difficult to get used to. As well as, room for improvement on personal communication skills seeing as target's main objective is providing excellent costumer experience"
good,I enjoyed my time at Target. It was hard work that while tedious was no less enjoyable and engaging. The managers where all great to work with and could often be found working on the floor with you. I still remember when one of the managers took over the grocery section that I was assigned because I didn't have any training in that area at the time.
good,Fast paced customer service focused job. I learned the importance of completing customer orders quickly and efficiently. Most all the associates in the store seemed focused on completing tasks and customer service. The managers in the store are hard working and personable
good,This company is ideal for part-time employees or seasonal... The best thing that I like is the interaction that is between the customers and the associates.
good,"I enjoyed working at Target because of my coworkers. They make time spent at work less stressful. The managers are very understanding and helpful. It's a great environment to work in, customers can sometimes be rude but that just comes with the job."
good,"The work environment itself is fun and friendly, and the managers are kind, and they’re usually flexible with hours. But when you’re in one area or position you tend to be stuck there."
good,"Great support for helping develop your career and help you grow in your role.  Lots of mentorship. But, leaders focus on metrics and numbers regardless of your efforts.  Not much support for the pharmacy department during situations when there was not enough staff.  It was necessary to come in on days off to complete managerial work, so effected work life balance."
good,"Target has a competitive yet friendly atmosphere that pushed you to try your hardest at your task with a smile on your face. Wonderful workplace. As an essential yet basic colleague, my activity wasn't what you should seriously mull over the true objective of one's working profession. However, it was as yet a superb affair where I felt spurred to work. I'd prescribe it to anybody searching for straightforward, low maintenance work."
good,"I had the opportunity to be trained from one area to another. Got the chance to learn how to do the in store audit, preparing the ad signing, cashiering, work on the online orders. It was fun since I was not just assigned in one particular area. They were trying to assess my skills and potentials."
good,a typical day at target is me coming in to help on cash register but mainly to get the carts from outside. it was a good working environment very friendly.
good,"As far as retail goes, Target is one of the best."
good,The job wasn't hard the target I worked at alot of my friends worked there too and I also met new friends. Mangers are chill the only thing is when the H-R rep is there the store manager is uptight although the H-R rep was pretty easygoing too.
good,Target is a good company to work for. They're inclusive and understanding with their employees and offer a good amount of support and benefits. The corporate environment can be demanding and always shifting to adjust to provide the best service so flexibility is needed.
good,Target is a great place to work if you want to learn and advance in the field of retail  They offer many training opportunities to help you advance and build a carer within retail.
good,Target is a fast pace environment where the people are nice.  Good clean working conditions.  Expectations are clear cut and not impossible to achieve.
good,"Its more of a job for twenty somethings. It was okay, the hours were low, not enough to make a real living. There was constantly theft within employees, stuff missing from lockers. There was favoritism there too."
good,"i worked there as part of the seasonal team and it was a pretty good place to work at. pretty difficult to get into, but you do get benefits and decent pay. you're also able to get overtime if you want it."
good,"Overall a great place to work. Great pay and decent benefits."
good,"i actually miss my Target work family from Missouri.  was employed there for 5.5 years; wish i didn't have to leave back then for my health issues.  left on great terms and can go back to work for them whenever i'm physically able to do so.  wish there was a Target close to where i live now in OK."
good,"I was actually part of the mobile department that was separate from Target. The store employees always seemed to be hustling from one place to the next whilst I was stationary in the location given. It was a very relaxed position with times of busyness, if your an online college student or just need a basic job this is a good fit."
good,There is a lot of work variety that can sometimes be stressful and other times be refreshing. People generally work well with each other and communication is fairly high. Compared to other retail Target is run very well.
good,Good company to work with. Company is rich and had good corporate culture. It is a leader in retail industry and has good taste both with the selection of products as well as the presentation format of the store.This is reflected in IT Divisions as well.
good,Was being paid 10 but somebody told me they start at 14 now not sure but that’s always good. Employees are all nice and friendly. Sepcificllay mama jear
good,Was mostly good a couple minor issues with working here enjoyed my co workers but supervisors sometimes seem uninterested in the life of team members can come off as “mean”
good,I worked in the backroom and did ship fulfillment.  For ship fulfillment you must pick and pack a certain amount of items in a certain amount of time.
good,I learned a lot about retail. From how to unload to placing product on the floor. It was fairly easy once you know what your are doing but sometimes stressful when your area receives a very large amount of freight and you are expected to finish before the end of your shift. interesting and fun to see all the new products as they came in.
good,"A typical day at work was to make sure my area was zoned, ask guests if they need help with anything, restock or stock new items. The hardest part of the job was when we were getting in new things and we would be in a rush to put them out or put them in the coolers."
good,A typical day was very busy. I learned very good customer service skills and supervisory skills. The workplace culture was good and always very enjoyable.
good,"it was easy fun and a goof working experience. stopped working there because they hired too many people and my hours started to go down, good job for seasonal people."
good,"The store management and other coworkers were outstanding people to work with.  Although the shifts could be exhausting, the work was always rewarding.  They also do a good job with team building and morale boosters (free food in the break room on occasion and prize giveaways).  Target has wonderful benefits when/if you are eligible and has improved its starting salary rate, but that is still not enough to pay the bare minimum in bills even for a single person."
good,This is a place for younger people to gain knowledge of the work force and the expected amount of effort to be give in their future places of employment.
good,I worked here for a month and loved it. Everyone gets along and it's like one big family. They all care about each other and look out for each other. The trainers are great and its a good working experience.
good,If your young it’s a great place to start a career. Pay is average but benefits are very good. Need a better discount then 10% though. Flexiable schedule for managers with every other weekend off. Incredible training. Very organized. Everything is laid out for you. You know what your to do daily and how to do it. Not a lot of decision making or thinking out of the box though
good,Performed predefined task to ensure store was eye pleasing and properly stocked.  I was allow to work independently without management supervisor. All aspects of the job was very enjoyable and rewarding. The job culture was extremely supportive. The flexibility of the schedule was the most enjoyable part.
good,"my hours were good 6am-4pm got paid $15.95h "
good,I went in sometimes at 4 am to help stock after A truck came in we would stock rotate and front all shelves in the area you worked in and help in other areas as needed
good,"Everyday there is a grid that has our name with our daily job next to it, along with out breaks. We typically learn something everyday that we may have not been taught in training. I have learned plenty while being there for just a year; price change, guest service, fitting room, audit, freight, POGS, VA, etc. The management varies, it can be improved. Workplace culture at target is good on the sales floor, the backroom could use improvement. The hardest part of my job would be POGS, because it is a process with alot of steps. I would say the most enjoyably part of the job would be working with my co-workers."
good,typical day is very up beat busy all the time unpacking replenishing shelf's prepping store for weekly sale back stocking could be very tiring. but its very busy and great for part time job.
good,"Target is a good company."
good,"My experience was okay, it was bittersweet, the customer can be rude at time but it’s not to bad. Also you have to take your break before your 5th hour or you will get written up"
good,"I love the people I work for because they care.  I like the busy atmosphere."
good,"I was pretty focused in my job, and loved doing it. The HR group i charge of giving hours would not always consider students not wanting to overwork themselves, and time off requests were often ignored. Higher management treated everyone rudely, even physically grabbing an employee once or twice while I worked there. But overall I enjoyed my job and stayed until I moved out of the city."
good,as an electronics lead i was able to help customers find what they wanted and empowered by management to look at current/future and other location stock to help find what someone needed
good,Target is overall a good job. There pay is not bad and there is still room in the company to move up in position if you are dedicated enough. Only downside is the hours. They can’t guarantee you full time
good,"A typical day at Target was to meet and greet people and assist them in finding products and serices, perform cashier duties as a fill in - perform desk attendant/telephone operator as a fill in - answering phones from cust about product availability and price. Managing a designated area by assuring price tags were in place, and that products were maintain on racks and tables, the environment at Target was good. Standing up all day was quite challenging by I got by. Management was good and made it very clear that every associate would be held accountable for the area that they manage."
good,I loved working with customers.  Management changed often and at times was not ideal but customer service is what I love to provide.  The hours are flexible. Overall if you love people any job where you serve the public is a plus.
good,"Seasonal hours spiked. The rest of the time, hours ranged between 15 and 20. Easy to get cross trained. Easy to talk to personnel representative. Work could be tedious sometimes."
good,"Target is currently changing their culture to try to keep up with amazon and the growing online market, but they are making it difficult on the employees. They have raised the current pay but expect you to sell your sections to customers while receiving no incentive to do so except the fact that they threaten you to lose your job. Overall though I think target is a great place to work for especially through school."
good,Target Herald Square is a great place to work with a fasted paced environment with many benefits to working there along with a culture that will breed quick and critical problem solving thinkers
good,I learned a lot in my time at Target. I got to help people that needed assistance with finding anything in stores. I met several new friends and everyone like my work ethic. The leaders appreciated the cleaning of the aisles and emptying items with things that belong in other departments. I did cashier work on the side.
good,Great place to work well compensated for your time and people who care. Challenging but offers resources to help. Cares about its team members and brand have high expectations
good,"I started as a regular team member. Over the years I was trained and developed to eventually become a Team Lead, which I did, of the very workcenter I started in and fell in love with. I had many jobs before and even while I have been employed by Target, and its the one I dropped the others for. Its been one of the best places I've ever worked. Its a very physically demanding job yes, but I can be myself and lend myself to the culture of the building."
good,A good place to work with some great benefits. They would feed you sometimes and once a year they bring in local taco maker who would make all you can eat tacos. I worked the overnight shift where we would stock shelves and it was fun.
good,Working at target is fun because everyone is always nice and greeting each other. The pay is very good bc you start at 12/12.50 depending on which role you work as. My time at target was okay i applied for cashier but got switched to another’s position which was okay with me. Target only have hours from 5-7 hour shift depending on what you’re doing.
good,"I highly enjoyed my time at Target, but granted I was coming from a far worse place of employment. The management was very understanding. Flexible work schedules that were easy to move around."
good,Typical work day was fast paced with occasional down time. I learned to maintain a clear head in stressful situations and focus on the goal at hand. The break room was a good distraction when work became too stressful.
good,"Fast paced, unloading truck in a fast CLEAN manner, without spilling or making a mess. "
good,"With much to accomplish during a typical day, the priority was always the guest.  Being easy-going and friendly was easy and it was easy to have a dialogue with management and other team members.  The hardest part of the job was when guests were unhappy about a prognosis or treatment, or when insurance would charge a high copay.  I really enjoyed working with the guests, and over time, have made wonderful friends."
good,Extremely smart people to work within the team and good projects. But compensation is average. Apart from that team is mostly comprised of highly qualified people and you will get to learn a lot from them
good,"Target was my first actual job that I could save for my first car. It gave m communication skills, Cashiering skills as well as just building relationships with the guess when they would come to my line and called me by my name made me feel special ."
good,the managers were friendly and helpful the people are very snobby but the company is good and you can advance fairly decently to get more pay and hours and such
good,Target offers flexible hours.  I only worked on weekends to help supplement monies for the cost of living.  It is a great job for someone attending high school or college.  I enjoyed cashiering.  I was friendly with customers and always greeted them with a smile.
good,"Great workplace, laid back stage. A wonderful job experience. And amazing family eviroment. As long as you can show up on time and do your job everything will work out."
good,Great opportunity for retail job.  Company encourages growth of their employees and promotes from within. Company provides decent benefits to full time employees
good,"It's retail. what could you say? The coworkers were great and easy to talk to. The hours were part time, but you could always take other shifts to get full time."
good,"The management could use some work, and most of the time you're overworked for little pay. They ask you to do way more than you're supposed to which then prevents you from completing your tasks."
good,Was a great place to work as a temporary position. Learned about the basic sales techniques. Good management overall with a positive work culture. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people.
good,"Everyone is motivational and goal oriented. Everyone focuses on what’s important. If their is ever a problem, we take the measures to fix it and help each other."
good,It was a nice and calm place to work. Had met many new people who loved working there and had a partition for the job they did and would come back every year for a new position.
good,"It's a typical retail job so has some stress with trying to stock shelves with guests around and having to answer questions. Management is great though. There is always an expectation to push freight faster, but there aren't too many unreasonable expectations. Overall a good place to work, especially for a first job. They do provide flexibility for people going to school or with second jobs."
good,"Target taught me a lot about leadership and offered great career advancement. I was given the tools and opportunity to succeed as far as my ambition would take me. Unfortunately, I left the company due to a major life event which led to me seeking a job with better work/life balance."
good,They treat their employees well.There is room for advancement.Very physical job. Not good for older people that have physical restrictions. I learned how to open a new store.How smoothly they store runs really depends on the upper management. The training program was terrible and very unorganized.
good,"J'ai appris sur ma personne et mes qualités et compétences."
good,It was a really nice place to work. I liked to helped people what they looking for when I am working on the sales floor. Help them return the items at the guest service.
good,"the people start to be a family to you , not a hared job . come into work get your task for the day and start. helping customers is just another obstacle you have to get over"
good,Pay and benefits are great at Target: Open opportunities for new team members and executives; Building great partnerships make the job easier and fun to complete.
good,"As part of the early morning receiving team, the first thing you do is go to the backroom area and if you're not in the back of the truck unloading you're at the side of the conveyor belts in a station and you sort the boxes for your area onto pallets. Once the pallet is fulled someone will take out to the sales floor to be sorted and shelved after the truck is unloaded - to be shelved before the store opens...if possible. Usually the whole crew will work on the pallets in order. The hardest part is getting to the store for 2AM during the Christmas season."
good,"• Answered customer questions regarding store merchandise, department information, and pricing."
good,I got along with all my coworkers. Everyone seemed really nice. This place is open 7 days a week. That is about the only downfall about working there for me being a single parent. If you’re able to work weekends then it’s totally fine.
good,"As a guest service team member, you deal with guests returning, price matching, and asking questions on a daily basis. You must be a people person in order to tolerate this position."
good,I have no complaints whatsoever in regards to my previous position. It was a learning experience that I would recommend to other fellow college students in need of employment.
good,"Target is the best retail job I've had, but after two years I need to find a real career now that I'm out of college. Part-time retail just does not meet the financial needs I have now."
good,"Luxottica is a good company to work for. After being with the company for 5 years, I'm looking to leave because I do not want to retire in the retail field."
good,"Although sometimes the hours weren't the greatest, and they seemed to make decisions that didn't pan out, the people you meet and the environment was always very comforting and you generally had a lot of fun!"
good,"I worked here over the summer between my freshman and sophomore years of college. The pay was good (much better than other part time jobs) and the work was not difficult. Hours were usually between 15-22 a week (scheduled). People drop hours all the time so that's how I would get a consistent 27/28 hours. I had open availability and was part time so I almost always closed, which isn't bad, we close at 10 every day except Sunday which is 9. Front end (guest service/cashier/self checkout) is almost boring but it's fine considering the pay. Sales floor is much more entertaining."
good,The people who I worked with were always friendly and nice. The managers actually communicate with team members. Overall working for Target was not bad at all. Sometimes they didn't have enough hours for employees.
good,When i first started this guy who was training me gave me an attitude because I didn't have a code to sign into the computer yet even tho it was my first day and making seem like it was my fault. Other then that it's good hours and good pay.
good,"The team environment at my particular Target was among the best that I've worked with, however, the lack of hours at my particular store left a sour taste in my mouth unfortunately. I would like to work there again if given more than 20hrs a week on average throughout the year."
good,You work hard but paid very well. You can move up in the company if that what you want. they have programs in place to help you make your goals. it's a good career
good,good hours and reasonable pay. flexible schedules and  good discounts. This location how ever writes you up if you do not sign people up for enough red cards.
good,The work days went by fast and most of the days were fun. The mangers were great until it came to a company visit they would get stress out a little to much. My fellow co-workers were great to work with as well as my store manger.
good,I started working overnight stock and then moved to the closing sift. I would still be there if I hadn't moved and all the local Target didn't need a new team member at that time.
good,Fun place to work! Competence especially with the red cards! They always treated everyone fairly! I always had fun working and getting to know my regulars that came in
good,"Target is a fast paced relaxed environment. The hours I worked were ok, the only thing was working from 4am to 7am. The time is great outside of work but the days are ruined. It doesn’t feel like there is a day off."
good,"Target has a great mission, and I focus on work that supports this. They are going the right things to compete in the new digital world by drastically changing their supply chain, and continuing to offer new brands for the guest."
good,I have enjoyed my time at Target. They are focused on leadership development and help you get to where you want to go. Target has helped me to be successful as a manager and wants to develop their leaders.
good,Fast Paced environment where accuracy and completeness are pertinent. Good place for those seeking warehouse experience and the health benefits are good. Flexible schedule with the option to work four days and get three days off by working ten hour shifts.
good,Target is a good place to work and treats its employees well.  I've just reached a point in my career where I'm ready for a new challenge.  My family is also looking to relocate and Target did not approve my ability to work remotely in my current role.
good,"Target was one of the best jobs I've worked. One thing to watch out for is the Target gossip... at least at this location. Rumors were really bad at this location and the former HR leader refused to do anything about it. In fact, she often listened to it and believed it instead of sitting her employees down to resolve issues. Other than that, I don't think there were any other jobs I've loved more. The pay was excellent, the job wasn't anything crazy difficult, and a majority of the staff worked hard, but kept it fun in the process."
good,Typically work days were medium/fast paced. Everyone was separated into teams that performed different tasks but still worked together as a whole.  Management was a bit sloppy and messy at times but overall tolerable.
good,Target was a very good part-time job for a busy college student.  Hours were flexible which made scheduling a bit easier.  The job exposed me to customer service issues and helped me to develop customer service relationship skills.
good,Love the environment and pay great but ran into late night schedule issue I depend on bus to get home so it went left but would def work for them again
good,"I loved working at target. The people there are great, the pay was great, and you get 10% off everything in the store on top of any deals they have going on at the time."
good,Good first job. Very relaxed environment and employees are able to sign up for more hours all the time. Not too tiring and employees are able to do a variety of different jobs if they choose to.
good,This have been my favorite job so far it can get from not busy to very very busy lines to the back of the stores and the quick thinking and being able to adapt to situations like that the employees are nice and you meant some rude customers but you meet a lot of nice people from wonderful places and have tons of stories you make new connections with people and that what is great about it somewhere where everybody welcome
good,"Definitely the most associate friendly place I've worked so far.  Even if you didn't agree with certain decisions, you were given the ability to give imput as to why."
good,Target is a fast-paced workplace for anyone who wants to put the guest before themselves. The team that works there is super friendly and is incredibly easy to get along with.
good,I really enjoy working at target. Wish I was hired on fulltime verses part time. Was looking to grow in company. I do enjoy my position as a beauty team member bc it is a new but great experience.
good,The job is great and you get to help a lot of people but the company or management team don't care about individual team members. You are treated as expendable
good,I liked working here. They were good at first with giving lots of hours then they slowed dow and I would barely get hours. And they would rather hire new people than to promote people they already had
good,"I would describe a day working at Target as fast paced, productive, and fun."
good,"I enjoyed working at target the short time i did."
good,"Many job opportunities, fast paced, great management, flexible hours, great paid, 100% productivity, learn new stuff everyday, every 6 months raise, great environment."
good,"I started working at Target as a cart attendant during highschool in 2003. I cross-trained on the Front End and Salesfloor. Eventually, I was given the opportunity to become a TPS, then promoted to Sr. TPS, and after graduating college, became an ETL-AP. My managers helped to groom me for these roles, and took time out of their busy schedules daily to sit down with me, for which I will always be extremely grateful. I left Target because the work/life balance of early morning ETL-LOG was not working for me. It was the hardest decision I have ever had to make. There were always unforeseen challenges that would arise, but the Team would pull together and we would get it done. From working at Target as a 17 year old until my late 20's, I learned how to be an adult, how to be responsible and reliable in the workplace, and all the ins and outs of retail."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Target. I was a part-time, seasonal employee around Thanksgiving/Christmas. I'm not sure if all locations have the same management style, but the manager/supervisor would gather the team members for a huddle each shift. The huddle was always positive, and I looked forward to it. The only thing I didn't like was how they put a lot of pressure on you to get customers to apply for REDcards. You even have to get one as an employee."
good,"Easy job, flexible hours, excellent coworkers. Opportunities to excel in the company.  Great job security.  Great benefits once hired as full time employee."
good,"Too many cooks (managers), some would want us tire ourselves out just to look like we were working even though everything was done, other managers would work with us when things got too busy (snow storm season for example), the benefits were good. good food. time in a half helps."
good,Sometimes when asking for more training in a different department it feels like you're talking to a wall. Sometimes training can be rushed and isn't consistent.
good,They always put the guest first. I would shop here even if I didn't work here. The store I am at  currently has the best team members ever. Everyone is so nice and willing to help each other and the guest.
good,"As the cash office specialist I was responsible for preparing deposits for the bank.  It was a fast paced position. Following cash office duties, I went to the sales floor as a cashier.  It was important to have guests leave the store on a positive note.  I enjoyed the customer interaction."
good,"Love Target.  The company was good to me and my time in the Kansas City District was a dream.  I loved my Store Team Leader, felt supported by my peers in my building and throughout the district, was given the training and opportunity to succeed and lead my team to success in key metrics.  Our teams were on the same page, everyone worked together for the betterment of the business and team, HR cared and moral was as good as it gets (there's always a rotten egg somewhere but over all the team was very happy). If personal life changes hadn't required me to move closer to family, I would have stayed in the KC area and made Target my lifetime career.  Unfortunately, I transferred to southwest Missouri and the store I stepped into was a nightmare.  Morale was terrible because management consistently retaliated against the team and each other when things didn't go their way.  The different departments didn't work together, but were more worried about getting ahead for themselves at the cost of the rest of the team.  The team felt every bit of the tension and there was a constant stream of drama which caused several amazing employees to leave and put the store in a perpetual state of being understaffed. I transferred to another store in Southwest MO and the same issues ran rampant in that store as well. "
good,I like Target Store because Target has culture that allow all employees to work in a fun environment. All employees seem to focus on the customers and being productive.
good,"Target is a great place to work. They treat their employees nice, have food in the breakout room, and are not too strict about set hours. The downside is that the retail industry is very erratic. Did not like dealing with some of the customers."
good,"I was a cashier at Target during Christmas season, it was rough but good. I had great team leaders who where there to help and guide me. The only problem where customers. Workload moderate. Good employee discounts"
good,"fast paced and always on the move. learned to read tags, unload trucks, set POGS, work electronics, learned payroll, learned accountability. some management is great there. the culture is great. Hardest part of job was learning to be a workhorse. Working with good people was best part"
good,"Fast pace, everyone gets alone, managers are great, but pay could be much better. Pay is good for those who just need an extra 200-400 dollars every other week."
good,Target was a relaxed place to work but I was only part time because of school. I really could not get as many hours as I wanted sometimes because when it was slow the hours were cut.
good,I am a full-time homemaker with 5 kids so I work this job as supplemental income for my family. Seasonal hours varied and some shifts were rough but money was made so I can't complain. The work was fairly easy. Managers & coworkers were nice to work with. I worked on soft line (clothing department) A bit of heavy lifting and monotonous work but I liked that about the job.
good,I will like to work for this job and I am a good person with others and I like to work with a lot of people and I wanted to see so that I can learn more
good,"All in all, the best thing about this job for me are the relationships I've built while working here. Their presence makes the job that much more enjoyable. That said, Target does seem to attract the more entitled bunch of customers, so prepare for people who expect things that an employee just cannot provide."
good,"target was my first job in Florida.I like the early mornings. i had the rest of the day to myself.I like target and still shop their.Target"
good,Helping customers find what they was looking for or tell them the best product. I learned great customer service and how to work a G.F.I. Management loved me because i was a hard worker and customers always lift leaving me with a smile.
good,I enjoyed my time at target everyone was very kind to me I just felt retail wasn’t for me. I was required to do simple tasks such as folding clothes picking up any garbage helping out as a cashier but I felt like I could have been doing a lot more.
good,a typical day was always to be productive and work hard. I learned that you must respect all peoples attitude but deal with them differently. Hardest part of working there was dealing with attitudes and the best part was helping people.
good,"I started at a store during college, graduated, then transferred to another store in a  different city. Once I transferred as a higher position than what I started as, I felt like that I was not appreciated, and that I was talked down too a lot since I didn't start in the store."
good,"Target was a great opportunity for me. I learned a lot about business working at target, I learned how to lead a team of many different personalities to reach a common goal."
good,"Target gives you the opportunity to grow as a leader and stretches you to be the best you can be. Their compensation for their managers is competitive and fair. The hardest part of the job is the work life balance, the hours are very hard for a family."
good,Target was a temporary job that afforded me the time to help take care of my terminally  ill mother.  I could have gone full time and into management but they prefer a degree.
good,"varies a lot day-to-day; work can be overwhelming at times when it is busy and shifts can be long; workplace is mostly friendly, employees are usually content and willing to help each other; allows a fairly flexible schedule; a lot is expected of new employees, more training for beginners might be helpful, very quick learning is involved. Overall a good place to work."
good,coworkers were friendly and helpful making sure that not one or two people where over worked when things got busy. management kept things running smooth as well
good,"Job was excellent it was a fantastic job experience you'll love it the only thing is your on your feet at least 10 hours that is the only con, other than that it's GREAT"
good,It was a fast paced environment. They worked with my schedule because of my kids which i deeply appreciated. They supervisors were very helpful and supportive. I just wish they would've let me advance to different departments because i had a lot of experience working in different areas throughout a store.
good,Target teaches you a lot about management and is always looking for ways to be innovative - not just on a store-level but also on an employee level as well. They provide good training and consistently challenge you. It's rewarding once you build a strong team and you have operations working effectively.
good,"I worked as a barista at Target for about 8 months, and got paid well. I was not counted as a Starbucks employee, so I did not receive any Starbucks benefits. Our store was much less busy than the stand-alone Starbucks across the street, and had a much more relaxed feel. Unfortunately, we were very understaffed and were mostly working by ourselves on most shifts. Management was also not the best. The job itself is a fun job; it seems overwhelming at first, but doesn’t take too long to click, and then is very enjoyable."
good,"I first started at target by working overnights which was from 10pm-630am or more..    Basically unloading the truck and filling up shelves for the opening hours of the store the next day.     Few months later I was pushed to the opening hours/closing hours    Working in the backroom a lot  by using a ""PDA'' gun where someone would make a ''pull'' and someone would read the item details and bring the item out to the customer or to fill carts of items that can be brought out to the sales floor."
good,Weekends were always busy. Didn’t have as many crazy people that walmart has. Managers were always quick to respond to cashiers. Easy job if you’re a cashier.
good,A typical day of working at Target involved opening shipping boxes and placing product on the shelves. I learned Target's policies on sales and how to store items on the selves.
good,It’s good working environment . Friendly colleagues and helpful managers. Flexible work schedule with good hours but the compensation is not enough to support living in Bay Area
good,Overall it's a great place to work. The holidays are hard because that's the busy time. If you aren't hourly they expect you to work 50 plus hours a week.
good,"Target is what you as the employee make. There has to be an internal drive with yourself to progress your career with target. I had a fairly progressive career with Target, receiving several promotions during my eight years with the company. Everything that I learned about the company was due to me learning and understanding of the companies culture and best practices. I have had a few great managers but many of them were terrible. I believe this is a huge pitfall for Target. The lack of training and recognizing the talent that lies within the company will forever haunt them. On paper target has a great culture but the lines get blurred with different management styles. The work could be easy and very challenging at times. The hardest part of the job was navigating horrible management and the most enjoyable part was getting to meet and inspire so many great team members."
good,it can be a bit too much at times but once you are used too it then it becomes a fun place to work at. I've learned quite a lot over the past few years here I started off as a cashier then slowly made my way up but whats difficult ab out it is that it changes everyday and you face different challenges everyday that you have to be ready for when you come in and work but you are not alone the management is there with you and they understand the work environment because they  have been in that same position before. What I enjoy is seeing the satisfied guest and making sure they are getting what they wanted and adding more things onto there basket that just tells me that I'm doing a good job.
good,Good people that are always thinking about team work. Non stop list of team players ready to help you become the successful you. Every day I went to go work at target I can say the people are there to help you build and understand how to work in a fast paced and competitive environment.
good,Target is a great place to get to know new people and create a bond with the team which makes a great team morale. They work with your home life and make sure to do what’s best for the team.
good,"- Fun environment "
good,Target was a great job for me while I was at school. They are more than willing to work around your school schedule. Was great for me while I was pursuing my degree. Look to promote from within.
good,Easy for right out of high school or for advancement.  Kinda pushy for signing customers up for membership cards and not very feasible.  Manager at the time was never around when I actually needed their help.  Most enjoyable part was helping people out and the compliments I received for being friendly and efficient.  The worst was when the manager wasn't around to help and the pushiness of the card signups.
good,A fun place to work with room for advancement.  Culture was good but definitely varies depending on the store and management was typically reasonable and supportive during work.  There does seem to be a glass ceiling as it pertains to advancement though.
good,i liked working there . it was just a lot of work to only get paid minimum wage. I was the cashier  for half of my shift . then for the other half i was a soft lines ( everything on carpet) sales associate.
good,"working there temporary was a good experience, got to know a little bit about how things work there, friendly staff, great working environment , mixing with social life depends on self and what you like."
good,"Awesome teamwork between Team Leads and team members, some over worked managers. Not enough family time for managers. Scheduling issues with team members."
good,It good working environment to be introduced to as a frist job. The people there are amazing and the manger are great but the hours are horrible. I wish to a full time but part time was the only thing they offer.
good,"All team members are so helpful toward each other.  I have worked at a few locations and management quality varies, not only by store but by managers themselves."
good,I worked as a cashier. The job was as most working in the public. Some days were busy and some a little more relaxed.  I worked with some very nice people and got along well with everyone I worked with.
good,"Liked working here. Good about getting breaks in time, and loved the people. Pretty successful with days off as long as someone else can cover for you."
good,"target wasnt bad at all its just no room for advancement. when the seasons change your hours plummet, while already getting paid minimum wage is just unacceptable for anyone who provides for kids"
good,"This was my first job, they hired me at the age of 17 with no previous work history (obviously kinda). The management was well ran id say, friendly and for the most part positive, they would push you sometimes but im sure the pushing was needed, for they had a goal to meet and was sure you could get the job done so you wanted it to be done. "
good,This particular location had a lot of challenges but provided a great opportunity for learning and growth. Lateral moves every 18 months keeps engagement high.
good,i was paid more for just stalking shelves than at most of my previous jobs. why more relaxed with some periods of we have to get this done quick. there is more ours available than i took but choose to not take them.
good,"Perform different roles throughout the day unless hired for a specific role. Management is inconsistent with some being good and some not so good. Overall a good place to work. Not great, but good."
good,"Company promoted all staff to become promoted within total company and it's individual department. Environment extremely fast paced, and conducted ongoing training."
good,"I only spent 5 months there as a seasonal hire, but it was a nice place to work.  My supervisor was compassionate and understanding while doing his duties.  9/10 would recommend."
good,"It had its bad days, but that is expected when working in retail. Your coworkers make or break the job, simple as that. Surround yourself with good people and it'll be worth the pay. Trust!"
good,The job was fast paced and was fun working in the fulfillment associate. It felt like shoppi g then you go and pack the items up. Even the shipping was fun and you work with good people in the back at your work area. It was a very good job and if it opens up again this Christmas season I will most definitely go back.
good,"I worked softlines and was required to fold clothes, put them back, answer questions from guests, assist them in locating items, pull things from the back if I could, back up on the register, and help out with other locations if needed. The hardest part depends on what store you work at. For me it was one of my coworkers who liked to act like a manager and peak around corners while asking you what your doing or push their work onto me. The most enjoyable part of the job for me would have to be that there was always something to do and I never got bored. The only issue I really had was when they made me wait outside for my ride in the dark when I closed."
good,"A typical day at my current store looks like this: clock in, get notes/directions for the day, have those plans change 15 times in the next hour, do everybody else's job and yours, be helpful and personable to guests, and absolutely NO overtime under any circumstances. As long as you do your job and you do it right, it's a pretty laid back atmosphere. Management is great, but sometimes it seems like they aren't on the same page. The hardest part for me is that plans are always changing. I like knowing what I'm doing and going and doing it, but I do enjoy that everything is always moving. There's always something to do and keep yourself busy."
good,"A typical work day started at 5 pm and quitting time was at 6 am the hours were long since the trailers really didn't have A/C, the pay was great, the managers were good because they want all of their employees to succeed."
good,Unload freight. Hardest part is working in freezer. Able to meet a wide variety of people. Fun place to work. Learned time management and how to work efficiently
good,I like working there it was fast fun an friendly the the management over night was very exceptional and so are my coworkers the problem I had with the Target because it was too far from my house and my pay wasn't enough to drive back and forth
good,Working at Target was enjoyable for me. I always like shopping and I hated when I go to look for something and it wasn't there but the system tells the sale associate that they have it. So I made sure I put item in the correct place when I stock the shelves. I still go to the Target I worked at and shop there.
good,"the atmosphere is friendly. only qualm about working there was that after the holiday season, working hours were cut tremendously because they had given so much over time during the holiday surge."
good,"Learned the following "
good,I held various positions within Target and all of them I loved.  Target used to be a great place to work.  I miss the training and development programs they offer.
good,"The job was okay overall, but upper management is slow to process schedule changes and time off, and sometimes your requests get auto denied. If you can put up with that it's an enjoyable experience."
good,"Target was all about pleasing guests. I worked cashier and sales floor. Theres alot of moving around and switching positions, the management is kind and understandable."
good,"Target is a very fast paced but friendly environment.  Typical day would include, making business decisions to improve sales and culture.  Monitoring payroll and operational tasks day to day.  Always fast, fun and friendly environment.  Hardest part of job is ensuring that each and every team member feels as though they have the tools and resources needed to be as efficient as possible.  With a staff of up to 80 people during 4th quarter, it can be stressful ensuring that all team members feel as though they are apart of something.  Assigning mentors to each and every new team member has help with our most recent retention goals."
good,"Great place to work, Great company to learn and develop manager skills, Leadership skills and Team work still. Target teach skills that allows you achieve  personal goals ."
good,"Good part time job. Very fast paced though. Open mostly small boxes and stock. No heavy boxes. Just work out of carts or off flats, no other skills needed."
good,"It is not a bad place to work, just sometimes slow, staff are friendly. Hardest part would be when it gets busy, hard to keep up and keep things in order specifically when people are purchasing many items or want some removed while having a long line of customers."
good,"The typical work day consisted of receiving incoming trucks which we had to unload in an organized and timely fashion. Once that was finished, we had to stock merchandise throughout the store ideally before the doors opened for business to the general public. The flow team was awesome even though we were few. The management was firm but fair. The most intense part of the job was the unload because we never quite new what to expect as far as volume goes so some days were much harder than others. I can't speak highly enough about my coworkers, they were helpful, funny, and overall just really nice people."
good,"This was my first job working as a cashier and I really enjoyed working with everyone. The guests and the coworkers were always really nice and made the shifts go by much quicker. After working as a cashier for a few weeks, they also had me help out as cart attendant, which helped break up the shifts and made the job more interesting."
good,working at target is an ideal place for a teenagaer. if you are 23+ i would not recommend. i’ve been there for over a year and have watched it decline drastically.
good,I learned good customer care and how to work in a fast pasted environment. the management team where fair and respectable. This helped enhanced my organization skills.
good,A typical workday at target consisted of a lot of customer service and Ringing up the guests. it was a fun and friendly environment. i learned how to use a cash register and how to service customers in a fast friendly and knowledgeable way. There were always a lot of fun events at target whether it was held in the break room or on the sales floor. Selling the company card. The most enjoyable part was seeing a satisfied customer leave with what they wanted or something better.
good,"Target was a great first job for me, I feel like I learned more than enough to help me get a job, and to understand how to use a cash register and how to handle cash. Working at target helped me understand what certain jobs tolerate and what jobs don’t tolerate. I learned a lot about the target industry."
good,"The hours are pretty flexible but they definitely prefer you be available on nights and weekends. It was a fast, fun and friendly atmosphere for the most part."
good,Target is a great company to work for with awesome benefits and unlimited ways to build your skill set. The hardest part about this job is the drive to keep up with the competition and ensure you are instock to make every sale. This could and did result in 12+ hours days. You will work with a great group on individuals but the pace is challenging.
good,"It was fun working at Target. The people there were fantastic and wonderful to talk to. Almost everybody was friendly. The hours weren't very good"
good,Professional and structured place to work. cheerful staff. friendly atmosphere. I would recommend Target Warehouse to anyone looking for a nice and profitable job
good,"As a beauty associate, the day goes by fast because it is constantly busy. There a schedule of goals that are to be completed every day which helps you to be organized within a hectic environment."
good,"You never know what type of customers your going to deal with, but its your duty to be professional/polite. I learned to ask if they would like to apply for red card, dealt with coupons/discounts.Always make sure your register isn't low on cash."
good,"If your new to working in an environment filled with people and employees. this is a good place to start a foundation. though, the hardest part of the job would be other employees not picking up their pace or other branches of the stores not doing their job correctly and you having to pick up their slack."
good,"I left my previous job for Target for the better pay and benefits. I was quickly identified to become an assistant manager and offered a salary that is difficult to decline in this area. "
good,"If you love retail, you should work for Target. They pay very well and are very organized. They communicate better than most companies and you always know where you stand."
good,"They are fair if you do your work. They are very flexible and try to work out a schedule to that benefits both you and the company. Target is very Guest oriented, so be ready to assist the guest the entire shift."
good,"go over goal amont of frieght that needs to be pulled to make budget"
good,"I learned quite a bit working at Target. I walked away with stronger customer service skills and a stronger teamwork oriented mindset. As my work/life balance shifted, I was able to switch between part-time and full-time positions with the company which contributed to my job retention."
good,"The team members were very friendly and helped train me during my first week. If I ever needed help, there was always a team member who was more than willing to assist me. I was also able to assist other team members, including the manager whenever necessary. Everyone was friendly, including members of the management. People treated each other like they were friends and working with them was neat. The only hard part of the job was just dealing with unexpected complications, but the team members usually came together to find a solution. The only part I didn't like was being given hours during my class hours, despite speaking with HR personnel."
good,"I think Target is a good place to work but it is real physical job and very fast paced. Target pays real well and has a decent benefit package and a good 401k. I was on the 2nd shift of 6pm to 6am saturday, sunday , and monday nights."
good,"Positive and accepting work environment."
good,I’ve been working for Target for 2 years and I could not tell you how much I’ve enjoyed my time here.  The people are amazing as well as the management. My only problem is the hours. It’s great for part time but don’t expect anything over 20 hours per week unless you’re hired on as full time.
good,Target is a fast paced supermarket that provides top of the line guest service. Employees treated customers with the best of intent and looked happy while doing so. Management was on top of everything and pushed their employees to do the best to their abilities.
good,Target was a face pace working environment with plenty of room to grow. The company is a team oriented company. You either succeeded as a team or you failed as a team.
good,Seasonal Employee Hired for the Christmas rush I Imagine I could have stayed on as a regular employee if I reapplied But I was Basically trying to make extra money for Christmas.
good,Target is a fun place to work. It offers opportunities for those who want part time work or someone who is looking to take a caree path in retail. The benefits are top quality and they offer many discounts and volunteer opportunities.
good,"Good management , fair to employees, good benefits and discounts available. Loved going to work looked forward to seeing everybody. Everybody was friendly."
good,fun place to work with excellent culture. fair pay and good benefits. lots of team building and room for advancement. only problem is too many bean counters!
good,"its a very active repetitive job, it keeps you moving through out the day. everyone working including management  is friendly and ready to help you learn new functions"
good,"I worked in the softline department at Target. An average day for me would include clocking in getting my walkie talkie and my zebra, which is a device to help you locate and scan products.Working fitting room you are the operator, you check in customers for the fitting room, organize the clothes people bring back and then separate them into brands in the back room of the fitting room, also( if you are closing) are responsible for the area you are assigned after the store closes, and also organize and put away the clothes that guest services brings you. Working on the sales floor you grab a cart fill it up with clothes from the back room at the fitting room, take it back to the racks, help customers when they come up to you, and go help out in the check out lanes when it is busy. You are open to work at either of these usually the LOD(leader of the day) chooses what you do. When closing you usually leave an hour after the store closes and pretty much tidy up the store. You have to fix the racks and  the fitting room back room has to be completely empty. It is very team oriented, especially when closing, you pretty much don't go home until the store is clean. So if there are 5 people closing and one person is done with their section and say,"" well I'm done with my section I'm going to go sit down,"" then that's not really going to get anyone out faster. It's good to work as a team to get done faster but that also means that you should be considerate and time yourself and try to not burden others and finish your section. Now the worst part about working there was being in charge"
good,Target was a good place to work. I didnt have no problems working here. My gstl's were nice and friendly. I love working with my co-worker and most of the time the guests were cool. You get the occasional upset guest but you just deal with it in the best light and move on with your day. Target was a good job in my opinion.
good,"Can be quick paced and overwokeds with few hours. Dependent on store location and leadersw, May be a great place to cut your teeth or advance. Can be excessive and hours are dependent on seasons and sales changes."
good,my time at target  i worked morning hardlines i would pull left overs to put back in its spot i also worked as a cashier and give breaks the hardest part was the lack of hours
good,Fast paced environment that had daily challenges of a retail business. Good for learning how to multi task and learn other department duties as well as learn excellent customer service skills builder.
good,"This was a great place to work while going to school, however they don't have much for advancement.  Great experience for all who should learn about customer service."
good,Workload was manageable. Very team oriented work environment with lots of interactions with co workers. There was a lot of walking and lifting. Overall not bad place to work.
good,"we still got paid on our short lunch breaks had 2 breaks not long enough for a 12 hour job, well paid, comfortable work environment, Got treated less then a worker mangement was poor. It was a seasonal job just to make extra money. i wouldn't recommend as a full-time job. I don't know how it is know but when I worked there a lot of people left including myself"
good,"Target is great for a first job. You do not hired as full-time, but you can always train somewhere else. Target works well with your schedule if you have school or another job."
good,It is a good place to work for. It is good when you are starting off from high school and you need a job to get under your belt. The people are great.
good,Manage  many customers at one time. Multitasking  one of  features. Scanning  changing prices. Assist team members .Stocking  checking prices. Cashier
good,"This is a good company to work for, however if you are looking to advance within the company this can be very challenging.  There are very few opportunities for advancement.  Also, the schedule can change frequently and without notice."
good,"I enjoyed working at my local Target. Fellow Team members were good caring people. Great managers who appreciate hard work. Job can be physically demanding and full time hours are tough certain times of the year. Limited benefits for part timers. Store and break rooms always kept clean, nice, and modern looking."
good,For the most part it was a fun place to work at. Some of the people were not the best but it was a nice experience. Some of the team leaders believe that they were better than the team members but those people no one care about.
good,"The co-workers were great. People with so many back grounds and stories."
good,The job was an amazing experience. They were all amazing coworkers. The job taught me to be more patience with people. Customers are always first and right.
good,Target is not a bad job to work for overall. You may have issues like with any other job bit they usually aren't anything major.I would say my experience there was pretty good.
good,"This was one of the funnest jobs I've had. It's great when you're young and it teaches you how to have a great work ethic while having fun at the same time. I learned how to pull items from the backroom and make my own batches to fill the floor with on the digital assistant device systems. Management was nice for the most part but there are those days where they aren't making sales and push us to work with more urgency which is good, but everyone needs to pull their own weight for that to be a success. Workplace culture was awesome. I made lots of friends while working there, probably the most out of any place I've ever worked and thats what I miss the most. I'm a people person and I love communicating an making new friends. Hardest part of the job was during the holidays and the hard labor in the perishables department when filling the floor with milk. We had to push them out on flats in crates since the backroom coolers were all the way across the entire store. Most enjoyable was making friends and having a good work ethic in a friendly environment where even all the managers were friendly and gave us recognition for the hard work we put in day after day."
good,"Working for Target is a great way to ""dip your toes"" into the work field in life. They are a good company that looks to bring people together to work as one instead of against or apart. A typical day at work for me is either helping guests ring their items up as a cashier, help them with any returns or exchanges at the guest service desk, or helping guests find what they need, restocking the shelves, making aisle's look neat, and backing up to help the front end while working on the sales floor. The majority of the time is pretty nice. Everyone that works there is always ready to lend a hand whenever one is needed. Target has people from different backgrounds and does not discriminate against anyone. Before working there, I knew ultimately nothing about registers, shelf labels, and different zones. Thanks to Target, I can now safely guarantee that I know the ins and outs of what it is to be a cashier, sales floor associate, and guest service attendant. The management is done by who I believe to be the best of the best, and are always wanting to lend a hand to others when they are called upon. The hardest part about working there was the commute to Target and making sure to be there on time. But the enjoyable part of the job is being able to make friends and build relationships their. I can't think of a better job to start out with, or join with."
good,I can't really say to much about target cause I only worked there for a year. I was offered another Job while still employed with target. For the most part my year there was cool the work was easy and pretty simple. We just had to restock everything overnight for the morning.
good,Great place to work. I like working independently and helping guests. Provides a flexible schedule while having another job or going to school. Provide employee discounts.
good,Heavy lifting but overall decent place to work at while in school. People were friendly. Everything was normally organized and were giving discount cards to shop there.
good,My responsibilities included processing customers purchases quickly an accurately and maintaining the front of the store so the it remained appealing to guests.
good,"Culture is positive and fast paced. Management is taken care of well. Development is TOP NOTCH and if you are willing to make your job a major focus of your life and willing to relocate, you can go far with this company. "
good,"I really enjoy my work at Target because of both my manager and my position. Being a perishables assistant, I worked on the sales floor as well as in the back stock rooms and was able to complete a large variety of tasks every day."
good,Has plenty of opportunity for cross training in several departments which keeps it interesting.  Stable environment.  Decent employee discounts and great benefits for full time staff.
good,My time at Target was very beneficial for my growth as a leader. You received a lot of training that is transferrable to some many fields. The level of operations experience is pretty great.
good,"Target has been a great place to work, they have always been flexible with my scheduling needs. The only con is they do not offer benefits or paid time off."
good,"Best parts of the job: Working with awesome people, great management, super flexible hours"
good,"I loved my time at Target in Hyattsville. I know not everyone can say that, but I enjoyed the people, my co-workers, and my role on the team. Holidays were crazy, but I enjoyed helping people and answering their questions. Target helped me find my passion for a career. I wish my time at Target ended on a better note."
good,"pretty good place to work, annoying co workers and people though. i enjoyed working here but they do favorte people and are shady as l that was real annoying"
good,I love Target as a first job. It allows you to advance in retail and learn how to handle difficult situations. Everyone is very friendly and they work with your school schedule if you have one.
good,"The hours you are required to work is extensive. Depending on your STL, you could love your job or hate it. Also, the company does not always give you the resources to get your job done, but tells you to ""figure it out."""
good,"Management and culture are generally great in my experiences.  I have gained a lot of experience in assisting customers and take pride in helping keep the store well-stocked, organized, and neat.  I have no plans to work in retail forever, but for now it is a good way to make some money and have something to do while looking for a job more relevant to my education and interests."
good,It was a good job I don't know if I can make this last for a hundred and fifty characters I like the job I like the people the hours were good the pay was decent it wasn't the best but I could make ends meet
good,Providing friendly environment for guest.  Having the knowledge to assist guest with location of items and how to safe with Target app Cartwheel. Assist guest with returns ad online orders.
good,"Great place to work and meet new people although sometimes has poor management. The experience of working for Target was great, I got to meet new friends and picked up some new work skills."
good,"Monday's office day"
good,"Good job to build costumer service and experience. Typical day would would vary on the season. I learn so much about products, people, and jobs in general. Management was poor most of the time. Culture is nice, target has a great tradition. Hardest part of the job is sometime do everyone's job and get paid the same amount and most likely not even recognized. Most enjoyable part of the job is huttles and breaks."
good,"a typical day at target was always fun for the most part , where you were expected to complete tasks as quickly as possible and expected to pay close attention to detail. Management is always there to help as well as other team members,was always a friendly environment full of respectable personnel. I would say the hardest part of the job would be making the expected goal time for certain tasks, most enjoyable by far is the people who work there."
good,"Overall, Target is a great company to work for but at the same time, then tend to cut hours drastically within certain seasons. A predicament like this one makes it hard for individuals who are wanting to work additional hours to gain extra money or make up for lost hours."
good,"Working at Target was my first job. It was ok, management at my location (Cupertino) was very nice and for the most part understanding. Unfortunately, I wasn't receiving enough hours and the ones I've been given was weekend nights. I left because I needed a better schedule and my yearly raise was a whopping 9 cents. (Kinda irked me that the girls got 9 cent increases and the guys got 10 cents). You get a 10% discount plus 5% from the redcard."
good,"Straight to the point work had to get to the required destination nd get started when you could, their main concern was saftey, and they were pretty approachable and very interested in what you have to say, the holidays were stressful but the pay was nice and the people were usually considerate, worked on multiple holidays, was a seasonal worker, was trying to be full time but they started laying everyone off for the next influx of workers"
good,"My time at Target started out great. I began as a ""brand ambassador"" (basically a custodian). I was treated fairly and given advancement opportunities and was promoted multiple times.  The environment is faced-paced and friendly, but as in all retail- it can get stressful as $$$ is the bottom line."
good,I enjoyed my time at Target. It was a fast paced environment. It was a great opportunity to work on customer service skills and learn about how to work as a team. The most challenging part of my job was collecting carts in harsh weather conditions. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers with their questions.
good,The culture was great and most all of the management was as well. The only issue is the amount of hours they require you to work is pretty rough. A typical work day for managers was 10 hours.
good,"*Fast paced filling prescriptions and assisting pharmacy customers."
good,Gained lots of experience interacting with customers daily which also improved my communication skills. I also gained knowledge in cash handling and working with a large group of people.
good,"Target is a fun place to work if you are organized & aren't easily distracted or phased by too many moving parts. You must also have strong communication skills to drive sales, engage guests as well as team members. Overall a peaceful place to work and shop."
good,"Thought this was a great work environment for me, helped unload the truck, stock and pull items from warehouse. Primarily spent my hours woking in back room keeping it organized it."
good,Typical day would be eating breakfast at on site deli. Then checking in with management on any updates also checking email. Management was hands on always available. Work place was call center environment hardest part about job would be dealing with down time some times could be slower then others most enjoyable part about job would be friendly environment.
good,Fun place to work good management good pay ok hours no full-time 40 hour weeks until the holiday season mandatory black friday Lord of layoffs after holiday season all in all a good job
good,"Fun workplace, Every day is something different, meet new people everyday,The management is not the best but its okay, the hardest part is just knowing how managed your time."
good,"I was hired as seasonal however they have decided to keep me on. Pay is well above minimum wage with a $1 differential for hours before the store opens and some days around the holidays have a $1 differential as well while the store is open. Most of the fellow employees are friendly and helpful, joys to be around. The warehouses could do better with organizing the shipments, which would make the Flow teams' jobs in the stores easier and quicker. The managers are good, high energy, and do not micromanage. I am only looking for a new job because I went from working 5+ days a week at 5-6 hours a day to 2 days a week at 4 hours a day after the holiday season."
good,"lot of work,not enough hours, I've learned a lot working at target. you get a chance to work in different departments. the hardest par of the job can sometimes come from the workers who don't t take the workload seriously. The enjoyable part of my job is helping the guests in any way i can."
good,"Working at Target was very great, i learned a lot while i was employed by Target, i had a great team, and an awesome management team, we also had ongoing training for staff and employees as well."
good,"Justa very stressful job, a lot of politics involved. You needed to say and do what was appealing to those who were in charge. Having a family while working there was hard. There was too much work to be done and not enough time."
good,"a typical day at target in electronics was setting up new displays for upcoming events for movies, toys etc also placing tags on models n devices "
good,"Fast pace, performance driven work environment. If you can handle the never ending line of customers, along with answering calls all day. then this job is for you!"
good,"It was a friendly place to work. We would help each other when we could. I would do the go backs,stocking, folding and hanging the clothes. I would also help the customers.I had a good experience working there."
good,"management was really good, awesome employees with good attitudes, can be a mix of fast and slow paced depending on hours and work days, very good pay but not a lot of hours."
good,"Deadlines are ever present at Target. Usual shifts start at either 6 or 8am. Work until 2pm on fulfilling orders placed on Target.com, from 2-4 packaging orders and then from 4-6:30pm prepping for the next day."
good,I loved working there! Everyone was easygoing and worked as a team. I worked overnights and it was fast paced so time went by quickly and it was hard to get bored.
good,"A typical day at target as a TPS was mundane. The work environment was is fun. However, my job was not. I would not recommend anybody to work security at target. As far as other jobs in the stores I strongly recommend college students working there temporally ."
good,"I was glad that I began working at Target. But after months of working there, you can see that some manager of the job weren't the best. Which made people want to quit there, which happened often happened. But there were also some managers that took there jobs seriously that showed a positive side of the store because they did look out for the team members and the overall look of the store. Overall I did enjoy working at target they have shown me  a lot working that year"
good,I learned a lot working at Target. Loved the environment and how fast paced it was. I did jump through different positions and loved running through the store to help guests.
good,"I thought Target was a good place for a first official job. I consider it a gateway to the other jobs I have had/will have. It's a great learning experience because you have to work with others, its all about communication. You have to help others and customers too. You also learn to comply with different kinds of customers. Good and bad."
good,"The two positions I held at Target were both very fun and quick paced, but also very relaxed. The people I worked with were extremely kind, wonderful people who never hesitated to lend a hand if they saw it was needed. I really enjoyed it."
good,"Folks are nice, pay is decent. Hours are difficult to come by if you're a lower tier employee. LODs are nice and so are GSAs. Target is very tolerant and forgiving of mistakes."
good,It's a good place to work if you like to be in a fast paced environment and interact with people. It's good for a part time job. Good company to work for.
good,"It can be a pro and con working for a constantly changing company like Target. Target is always changing things to stay competitive and challenging the status quo often. At times, this can be exhausting on employees and cause inconsistencies with management expectations."
good,"After I graduated from college in December 2008, I started as an Executive Team Leader with the Target Corporation in January of 2009.  In my 2 1/2 years with the company, I learned a lot about managing people and personalities, creating relationships, staffing, scheduling, and making the most of time alotted."
good,"Target is a great place to work. It provides a standard, rotating schedule to its Executives and pays well for performance and length of employment. Target always seeks to promote from within and focuses on training and development of its team from entry level to executive teams."
good,Target is a great place to work through college. They offer flexible hours and schedule you around the hours you're in class. There are limited chanced to promoting up unless you are friends with upper management.
good,"Great opportunity to grow and develop. Leadership is great, and the environment is perfect to cultivate retention.  Customer service is a main key to Targets achievements and I like putting the customers first."
good,"Good place wish would hire seasonals, needs to approve more hours and to expand there marketing basis to a greater audience so sales could keep improving"
good,"I didn't mind working at Target. I think it was a easy place to work, but they didn't give me enough hours during the week. Overall, the job itself was really great. Everybody who works there is very friendly and very helpful when needed."
good,"The employees at the Target Distribution Center are friendly and fun to be around. Some days the 12 hour shifts feel like nothing and other days it feels like a 12 hour shift. You can expect to be a little sore some days, since you are on your feet all day, but other than that it's pretty mindless work."
good,"Very structured work environment, easy to work with managers. Fast paced and always busy. A lot of customer interaction, overall a positive experience."
good,Very fast paced environment. There are no second chances if you have any safety incidents within your first 90 days. They expect you to hit your productivity while being as safe as can be.
good,"Enjoyable workplace,well respected employees,managers care about the welfare of the workers. Morale is very high,people are encouraged to do their best while not pushing themselves too hard. A good balance,We get a lot done."
good,Working at Target is a great starting job. They pair fair. The hours are flexible around a school schedule or busy schedule. Managers are very open to new and veteran team members. Everyone that works there creates a positive environment. The only downside is a small 10% discount.
good,Over all it was a great place to work very clean and the workers where very helpful and hard working. I regret not staying with this company longer. The management was excellent.
good,"Great flexible schedule and cross-training available into multiple departments."
good,"It was ok, the hours were flexible and there are a lot of chances for you to pick up shifts. The pay was great and the people were friendly. The management and communication kinda sucked but no one was mad if you asked a lot of questions."
good,"At target, I had to learn to work with an amalgamations of people. I had to be very skilled at multi-tasking and become more time efficient. My inter-personal skills became my most valued work ethic."
good,Overall a great company to work for. A typical day as an Executive Team Lead can be 8-10 hours. Very fast past and stressful during peek season! Great teams and great culture.
good,"Working at target helped cultivate my customer service, cash handling, and conflict management skills immensely. I learned how to keep my composure during stressful situations, and how to resolve those situations to a point where everyone is happy."
good,"Every day was full of learnings and lot of action specially when the team cracks the research on time. This company gives full scope for people willing to learn. It’s a delightful experience I had during my tenure."
good,I loved working for Target. The manager and team were very friendly and gave freebies like food for everyone. They were very supportive and paid well.
good,"Great workplace, with awesome team members. Lack organization, and communication in some areas of the store."
good,"Early shift, always work to be done, sometimes competitive fun. Lots to learn, and always busy. Made many great friends, and everyone was incredibly nice. Low pay though, and not allowed overtime."
good,Every day you hit the ground running in a good way. Amazing and dedicated teams. Great development for leaders around leading teams and implementing processes. The people you work with keep you connected with the job and make it enjoyable.
good,"Everyone in the team has a great responsibility to finish his work, a very good place to work. The discount policy for employees is very attractive and useful."
good,I love working here but sometimes it can be overwhelming with how competitive it gets. Managers are awesome and work with you and your schedule. Good place to work.
good,During the holiday season I worked there we had a busy but fun time.  It was fast-paced but our team leads were helpful and supportive.  We were given a lot of holiday bonus too.
good,"Get ready to be on your toes! Fun and exciting place to work, The overall culture is great, It's a great place to work if you are looking for professional development!"
good,"the supervisors were really great in that they provided an environment that focused on work, fun and SAFETY."
good,Target was a great work environment but was only meant as a temporary job I am looking to start a career. It was a fast paced work environment that allowed me the opportunity to interact with different people every day.
good,"It always starts with a meeting & then they have you focus on zoning "
good,"Its A Great Place To Work At, They Take Good Care Of  You They Would Provide Breakfast And Lunch Probably Twice A Month They give you credit where its deserved. Stay busy and you will be fine."
good,"Very fun and fast paced. Learned how to be efficient working as a team. Very physically demanding and didn't get as many hours, but also very fun place to work"
good,"Nice place to work, great people, relaxed pace, and all around great environment. Great hours during holiday seasons but all other times not so much. Great for going to school."
good,"This is a good job for starting off working for the first time, learned a lot and covered a lot of different areas of the store. Hours were all over the place and I didn't get out on time. However great pay at the time started at $8.50 and by the end of 2 years I was up to $10.50/hr. The stress came from pressure of having to sell redcards, not getting lunch on time. Overall, okay for starting but not a good idea to stay long term."
good,the people you work with can be very kind and fun. the managers really care about you and try to work around your schedule whatever you may need. the work environment is fast fun and friendly.
good,a typical day clock in and stand stand stand more standing trying to check receipts and intimidate shoplifters with your floor presence. everyone is friendly and the hardest part is the long hours on your feet
good,I enjoyed working here. I love fast pace and early mornings. I was with a team in the back room and we had to unload trucks and finish back stocking products. The discounts are great but my paychecks were spent pretty fast there. The holidays were horrible and getting days off at anytime was always a struggle. I never got out on time.
good,"Most days as a Logistics Executive Team Leader involve supervising the truck unload process, stocking the floor, and stowing product in the backroom that does not fit on the sales floor.  Other daily tasks include overseeing the sales floor presentation team, pricing team, and reverse logistics team member, team member and leader development, and guest service.  Most days last anywhere between 10 and 12 hours, especially during the holidays.  Management depends on the quality of the Store Team Leader of your store and other leaders within your district, group, and region.  Workplace culture is characterized as a very team oriented environment.  Your success or failure is determined by performance of team members.  Hardest part of the job is the long hours, especially during the holidays.  Most enjoyable part is the fast paced and team oriented environment."
good,great place to work. management is not always held accountable. for the most part my peers are great! workplace culture could be better but it is something that i'm actually working on with my manager at the moment
good,"My ETL is awesome. Constant feedback both good and bad, which is great. You always know where you stand and any improvements to make. Fellow employees are great too. Only one fellow TL is disruptive, but there are always one at every work place. Retail is what it is, always changing and trying to keep competitive in an online world. You never know if your big box store is going to close. Hours vary week to week, your benefits coverage depends on your average hours. If those drop consistently, then there goes your benefits"
good,"Work is very fast-paced and has very little downtime. You're given two 15-minute paid breaks but almost never any opportunity to take them as you typically work alone and no one can cover your shift so you can take a break. The work itself feels very rewarding and my coworkers were fun to be around on the rare occasion we were able to work together. Most of the managers were pleasant to work under, but with how many managers there were, sometimes wires got crossed and you'd end up being told to do something that another manager doesn't want to be done, etc."
good,It was a great company to work for. I really enjoyed the people and team members I worked with...I would highly recommend target to any body as a great place to work at
good,You have to adapt to changes quickly. Changes come with little to no direction. Expectations are really high and can often be a stressful environment to work in
good,"One of the best companies that I have ever worked for, they have great benefits for management, great team work environment and the entire store staff fells like family."
good,"Work life balance was the biggest issue. I would recommend this job because sometimes it was fun, the pay is great, and I feel that overall Target is a great company. However, if you want to have a life outside of Target this probably will not work long term."
good,"I am a student and target really helps by creating hours that are useful for me. I am only seasonal so I would have worked there more If I could've. It is actually great, coworkers are excellent!"
good,"Overall, the people who work at Target are amazing, even the guests are patient and kind. Taught me a lot about being part of a team. Also taught me how much I love guest service. Not a bad place to start at. Management is hit or miss depending on personal connections. Very physically demanding especially if you're not used to high activity levels."
good,I did work with great coworkers and managers. It allowed me to transfer to be able to help different members of my family and give them the support they needed. Target only hires part time but if you go in when someone calls out I was working 40 hours every week. A lot of walking and retail has a lot of late hours through the busy end of the year. I did enjoy working with a lot of people very kind and supportive.
good,"This was a 4am-8am job and required a lot of hard work, unloading trucks, picking up boxes, and quickly stocking the store before it opened. Despite the amount of work, it provided a friendly environment and professional management."
good,I like working at Target. It is a family oriented culture. The team members are fun to work with. Managers are genuinely concerned with the well being of the team and individuals.
good,"This job can often be fast-paced and demanding but overall you learn great communication skills and the work hours benefit college students tremendously. Management is nice, however occasionally slow to respond to issues within the workplace. Hardest part of the job is maintaining store organization during peak times of the year for business, it gets messy really quick, but overall I believe this job is enjoyable because it is a friendly place to work and really increases your level of experience as far as retail and communication goes."
good,"Definitely a good place to start if you are looking for your first job. Just can't go wrong with target. The staff there is just amazing, very friendly environment. Management always there to help with anything you need, and are always open to any ideas that anyone might have to help the store improve in any way they can."
good,"Would still be working there if I did not have to relocate. Over the time I was working there, one of our managers would 'high five' everyone in the morning shift as they walked in the door. It really inspired me. Managers should realize what an immense negative or positive effect they can have on their employees productivity."
good,"I would start the day by punching in and dropping off my coat and backpack. I would then proceed to the front of the store where we would do our group morning stretches and get our department assignments. We would then start gathering up carts and begin to sort our section by aisle, spot the product and then proceed to stock the department. This process was different from day to day because you would typically get different sections and you did not always know if you would get the same department from day to day. "
good,"I would refer to Target very much. I Had a great 2 years working. Very friendly, reliable work-place. Great hours, flexible hours. Received a lot of experience in backroom and overnight stocking."
good,"What I liked most about working with Target was that they understood my studies came first. They always accommodated my class schedule, and never made me feel bad for having to change my hours every few months to attend my necessary classes."
good,"Quality learning opportunity.  Eventually, will be able to learn a majority of the store operations.  Definitely a place to learn, work, and grow customer service skills.  Management focuses on the basic core values to be a good employee and be a good team player.  Good for students who are looking for part-time work.  Also opportunity for those looking to develop management skills and material."
good,good place to work manangers are slightly confusing and not clear about what they want from us empoyees and new hires get all the hours while the older staff dont get much
good,it was a very competitive work space you had to have very good interpersonal skills and initiative to get any task done being an assistant manager was a new and fun experience for me but i appreciated the leadership skills i contained working there.
good,"A typical day consists of clocking in, and reporting to the main desk for employees for a walkies and assignment. Each person grabs their designated paperwork and cart for back stock an replacement of items and reports to their department. What i learned at Target was how to manage teams to effectively clean the stores, as well as better selection of teams. Management was awesome for their ability to relate to the staff as well as being energetic an helpful with many customer issues. The culture of the workplace was friendly, fast pace but so much fun. The hardest part of the job was the restock of items back on shelves. The most enjoyable part was coming in everyday to new laughs and familiar faces."
good,"Target works with it's Team Members availability, opportunity for time off two weeks in advance. Our management Team is awesome as well as our Open door policy. Team Members who work seven hour shift or longer earn two paid fifteen minute breaks as well as a thirty minute unpaid meal."
good,"I would have stayed at Target in North Richland, Texas but my mother became very ill and I moved back to Albuquerque to help her with my younger brother and sister."
good,"It was a fast-paced and friendly "
good,"Ran Flow and Backroom process, several checks and balances to ensure accuracy.  Great support staff with in store HR.  Great Teamwork environment with great people."
good,A typical day at work is fast paced. I've learned how to better work with the general public. Management has been kind and welcoming. Workplace culture is fun and inviting. The hardest part of the job is working to make sure every guest is happy. The most enjoyable part of the job is the coworkers.
good,This job was a simple in and out task to perform your responsible duties provided by the manager in charge. The work environment was quite and average paced for any all employees to stay consistent with managing productive customer service and effective knowledge of the company.
good,"During the holiday season at target it gets super busy and everyone seems to speed up. It’s quick paced and guaranteed to get you 14,000 steps a day easily. As long as you don’t mind the average age of the employees at Target. Now don’t quote me, but in my experience about half of the employees were under the age of 20."
good,The sales atmosphere in the Electronics Department was warm and friendly. The products were up-to-date. The managers provided all the necessary materials for job productivity.
good,"Target as retail store, its faced paced and team work environment. Each day we would stock shelves and back stock leftovers. Make sure the store is clean and customers are happy."
good,"The people and your team make the experience, but long hours and slim resources makes it an exhausting experience. Really grateful for the 5 years there, but needed to get out before I burned out."
good,"There was always something going on in the break room. The time of year changed what you could see in the break room, most of the time it was birthday stuff other times it was based on the holiday."
good,"keep the aisles organized, return products to shelves, help customers. People or nice and somewhat diverse. Many minors and young people work there so they don't last long. Management is easy going and approachable"
good,Target has an awesome culture. The management team works hard to keep employees happy and engaged. You can really tell they care about their team members.
good,"I learned how to handle difficult customers."
good,Working with Target Mobile was very slow just cause of people not knowing that they sell phones at Target for their provider. It was a secure job and pretty easy just at some times did get boring of it being so slow.
good,"The management is a hit or miss for people, i am on and off with them, but its still a great place to work. Ive been working for them for almost a year now and have never once had any desire to just walk out of the door."
good,I work at Target part time I learned how to speak some phrase in Spanish for our Spanish speaking customers. The management was fun we also had some type of competition which I was the winner the majority of the time. The work culture was relaxed I didn't feel stressed and the hardest part of my job was when it was slow but the most enjoyable part of my job was my co-workers and how we made the competitions we had fun.
good,"Involves operating cash registers, meet and greet customers clean your area, handle return and refunds and answer question about products and services."
good,Working at Target is alot like being in High School. Very cliquey. Depending on what department you work in is kind of based on the relationships you made there.
good,"A typical day involved zoning and making sure our store was clean and presentable for guests. While working in a designated area, being called to help with the front lanes was a daily task. The managers were understanding and helpful. The hardest  part of the job was time managing. Making sure you paced yourself and got your work done in a timely manner was of top priority. The most enjoyable part of working at Target was the community. Meeting new people and connecting with costumers was a daily highlight."
good,"I work in the food department and there's always a lot to do which is nice but I don't get enough hours and I've told them that but they don't do anything about it. But, the people I work with are always happy and smiling and it really is a fun place to work at."
good,"Its been a great 2 years, I've learned much along the way and have been satisfied with my stay here. Friendly staff and amazing benefits. Great place to learn how to sharpen your customer service experience."
good,"I enjoyed the job, pace and management but with having my own family the hours and overtime didn't leave much time for them , this is a great company to work for with good pay"
good,"Will work the life/school schedule. Fast-paced, team oriented environment. Management support and positive influence. All-around growth/advancement opportunities"
good,Managers are really positive and want to help you succeed. I had no problems with co-workers or managers and everyone had good communications and listened to what you had to say and took suggestions.
good,"great environment friendly coworkers always willing to help each other, management stepped in when needed when staffing was short Black Friday's was always busy but everyone helped"
good,When working at Target you have some team members you get along with and those you don't.  In the end you all work together to make things happen.  We're all one big happy(ish) Family.
good,Overall this is a good company to for for if you're a teenager or in college. Or if you want to make extra money for the holidays. Team player and great customer service.
good,"Get things done."
good,"I worked for Target for nine years. I was able to start my day with no guidance. I started as a part time cashier and was able to advance at my pace . This allowed me to be with my family and utilize a work, life, balance way of life. Management changed often, every time you received a new manager, they wanted to change the way you ran an area. Most times they would see what you were doing in your role and help you be successful. once in a while you would receive an unruly manager.For the most part it was pleasant to work there."
good,"Working at Target presented lots of work, great pay with excellent benefits and an excellent culture to work.  Few opportunities for career advancement."
good,Target is an ok place to work at. You have to be wiling to work in a high pace job. Your coworker are really nice to work with willing to help you in anything.
good,"A very fast-paced environment. Not much room to take time to learn, as one has to pick up quickly on everything to keep up with the work flow. This being said, it's very easy despite the heavy work. Great amount of hours too if you're willing to work overnight."
good,been there for 4yrs now. hard to move up but they at least try to please your needs if they can. depending on the location it can be fun or rough workplace
good,"I enjoyed working at Target for the time I spent there.  It was a fast paced, fun job where I enjoyed the company I worked for as well as my coworkers. The pay was fair and if I could, I would work there again."
good,"I made the most career advancements at this job than any other. A lot of time was spent in developing leadership skills while on the job. Other skills that were improved while employed with target were organization, planning and team member development. I had made great connections with everyone within and outside of my team and had a great culture and environment up until my last day of employment."
good,"There is room for advancement, given you work for it. You get out of this corporation what you put into it. If you're looking for a part-time job for some extra cash, you got it. If you're looking for a long-lasting career, you could have that too."
good,"Customer service is key, depending on which department you work in will range in the amount of hours you are given. You can ask to switch departments after your 3 month probation period to which ever department you find suitable."
good,"Meeting new people daily, very good learning experience. Plenty of room for advancement. Management and HR is willing to go above and beyond to make sure the staff is happy"
good,Usually my work shifts consist of me doing multiple positions all while dealing with problems from customers and helping out my team members. Working here has helped me improve my multitasking and problem solving skills. I can adapt and learn to new situations whenever I am forced to deal with new information or learning different positions. There are times when customers give me a hard time but they can also be very enjoyable to communicate with during my work shift.
good,"Target is great for college students or recent grad to start growing skills as for the salary only offers very low income for freshly graduated and that is practically all they hire. "
good,"Management was understanding most of the time,the work environment was rough but thorough.Work life balance was great.Once you left for the day,that was it."
good,Me gustó haber podido ser parte de la empresa ya que pude aprender mucho y ganar un poco dd experiencia
good,they enjoyed me working there they always showed me ways to improve and become better at the position i had i always tried to make working my priority.
good,the job was stress free for the most part. I enjoyed working there. The hours were also great. I would definitely go back if the position was still available.
good,"Very fast moving place, you're always on the go. Helping customers locate any item they would need and knowing you did your best to help them is incredibly satisfying."
good,"At target we worked in doors with wonderful team members, All of my co workers always had a wonderful attitude towards work. Although we worked together we also had fun together, we had lil team parties here and there."
good,"Target is focused on developing their team. You have to be smart and an active person to be able to survive and move higher faster. Fast, Fun and Friendly environment for sure. "
good,A day at work would be long lines of people and working very hard at the cash register. But you always get your breaks when needed. Staff is very welcoming. Work hours are flexible as long as you communicate.
good,"This company is great to work for, and not just for the amazing benefits! Love the working environment, plenty of chances to advance up in management."
good,"Great working environment and friendly working staff. The management was mostly understanding when it came to personal problems, and were flexible on hours and prior engagements."
good,I started of as a cart attendant there and slowly moved up after cart attending I became a cashier then quickly start working in guest services. it was my favorite job
good,Great benefits but cold in the winter and hot in the summer.  Production rates are high and they constantly review your performance.  The weekend shift is Sat-Mon 12 hr days.
good,Outstanding training for Leadership roles. Target is very competitive and fast paced. Human Resources and compliance is a major focus as well as operational excellence.
good,"The Target Corporation maintains several company standards that must be met, but several stores cannot supply the manpower or other resources to meet all standards."
good,A typical day started with a team start-up where you did arm exercises because you would be lifting boxes for productions. You work a 10 or a 12 hour shift in a non-controlled climate enviroment.
good,"West Hollywood Target has high expectations from their employees, nevertheless, this will prepare you for future jobs with the transferable skills you will learn working here."
good,"Target, from my experience, is one of the better minimum wage businesses to work for. It was a little hectic at times, but no matter what you were doing, you wouldn't be doing it alone. Teamwork played a huge part in the workplace culture and it was echoed in the daily huddles that occurred during each shift. Management was always a walkie-talkie away. If they were unable to help at that current moment, they made sure to direct you to another associate whom they were confident could be of service. I found their policy of training everyone to be a cashier very brilliant compared to other businesses of similar structure. The only downfall is it lacked a clean balance between technology and the proper instruments needed to maintain function, primarily the lack in accessible chargers for the handheld devices as well as not having enough devices for all the employees that absolutely needed them. That said, it was a very enjoyable job."
good,"Coworkers were very respectful and the best part of the job. Management was helpful. Hardest part was selling the red card, but it bettered my sells skills."
good,I would come into work and receive the task that they had for me and most of the time it was in hard lines with is straightening shelves and making sure that everything was back in its place for the next day. If you completed your task then you would receive another task until you went home. You were given a break and the staff was always nice and willing to talk and have a conversation. The management was good and they always were respectful and made sure that you had time to get what you needed done.
good,"A typical day at working in target is not so bad, as long as you're focused your days will go by quick and the requirement tasks aren't hard at all. usually the customers are friendly but you do get those rude customers but as long as you keep a friendly and positive attitude you'll be able to make it through tough situations."
good,"Target is a great place to work. The atmosphere is fast paced, fun, and friendly.  Employees are trained to do various jobs.  Management is very flexible with schedules.."
good,"It's Was An Okay Job If I Could Go Back And Work There I Would. Very Good Environment Alot Of Positive People. Easy to work around. "
good,Some days were better than others. Management needs improvement. Some workers were given special privileges. The hardest part of working was waking at 2 AM every morning to get to work at 3 AM.
good,"A great place to work, lots of customer service experience. Busier than most Targets (connected to a mall), but sales were hit and miss it seemed (the store would meet sales goals and miss them in equal measure). This meant that a lot of people didn't get hours at times. Pay was great though. The most annoying thing about the workplace was how the management seemed to change a lot. Pregnancy, people moving to different locations, interns, managers changing positions, and a LOT of firings. I had 5 STLs (Store Team Leads) in my history of working there. This might just be a normal thing for retail, however, but as someone who was just attending school and working at Target, it could be a little overwhelming. However, I would say it was the best place to work retail in Mankato."
good,"Really enjoyed Target but got tired 3rd shift and got a position elsewhere. 3rd shift Logistics if not for everyone, I loved it but its hard work and fast paced"
good,Target is a great place to start working at if you've been out of work or it's your first job.  Lots of college people work there.  On time breaks and lunches.
good,"I was a seasonal team member, working as a cashier for the Christmas holidays. I was able to learn the cash register quickly and maintained my work station up to their standards. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting and talking with customers. The hardest part was the extreme coupon customer, who came to my lane with 4 baskets full of items. I'd never dealt with something like that before and it was a learning experience."
good,Awesome culture focused on good results and people. They drove hard for improvemnet but cared about the voice of the employee. It was amazing to learn how Target accomplished both these aims and achieved a positive bottom line.
good,"As a first job, Target is an excellent place to gain experience. I would recommend it to anyone just starting out to get the experience they need in the workplace."
good,"Any position at Target will keep you moving.  You are setting transitions, working pulls to keep the floor full, you are cashiering, and providing customer service.  I always felt like I had a productive day at work. Very rewarding."
good,The building shut down.  But I was a good place to work if you like long hours and warehouses.  the pay and the benefits were great.  The hours are long but that's no big deal.
good,I worked in a college town so most of my coworkers were similar ages. Because of this management was very willing to work with school schedules. This was a huge plus for me and some of my coworkers.
good,"Fun,fast pace working environment you have all the tools that you need to complete your job. Really good flexible schedule if you are currently in school."
good,"Employees at my store were respected and treated well by an excellent management staff. Occasionally stressful, but coworkers were quick to help each other when needed."
good,Target is a great place to work at. The benefits are amazing and if you work hard you can have a future within the company. I started as a cashier and moved up really quickly.
good,"Friendly people to work with , good mangers understanding, good hours. Lots of items to do , it tends to get busy but there is always something to do to keep up the good work."
good,Target is a great place to work. Managers and coworkers are friendly and easy going. Just wish I'd work more hours at a higher hourly amount. Target is a fast paste business and keeps you busy.
good,"Lots of things to do!! Sometimes don't feel like you can get it all done but it does create a difference in pace.  Everyday is a different day. I sometimes call it the boot-camp of leadership, you will be stretched and developed for sure!!"
good,"- Most of the days start with a different and new challenge"
good,"Being paid to do yoga at the same time fulfilling sales and admin works certainly is challenging and fabulous— infusing mindfulness and yoga experience into your clients’ is indeed enjoyable, while you may love doing a group exercise sessions, organizing the reception and sales target may seem daunting at first glance. But with proper time management, a dual-role job can become an easy daily grind at the same time it allows you to be more productive in your field of work."
good,"Target is Fast, Fun and Friendly and like any job, it is what you make of it. Team Members and Guests were the reason to come in every shift. The interaction with Guests and the helpful, dedicated Team Members made every shift enjoyable and rewarding. The culture passed down from the corporate office to the districts would vary from store to store based on the management style of each stores new executives. Some store executives had a walk around approach, others delegated to mid-level executives, while some were micro managers. If you worked in an “A” store, management was stable and predictable. If you worked in a “B” store, it might be a trainee store. Corporate would send management trainee teams to these “B” stores to gain experience and “get their feet wet” before being assigned their own store. These trainees would typically be in a training store for 9 months to 18 months, depending on performance and results. Training store Team Members would have to adjust to constant management churn and management style changes. Many times, Team Members would be reviewed by the new management trainee team and told to make changes to established routines, some made sense, others did not. This constant change in store management required Team Members to be flexible and adaptable to the many and varied management styles of the new management trainees."
good,Target is a fun and entertaining place to work. You are able to have a flexible schedule. The hardest part of my job is dealing with needy guest.  The most enjoyable part of my job is the people I work with.
good,"Again, its retail but from that perspective a nice place to work. Its the work life balance that gets you, all the weekends, holidays and etc can sometimes get you down."
good,"My typical day was simply fulfilling orders. It was very physical (which I didn't mind). I was paid very well to do the job. The hours were long (12 hour shift), but I only worked three days a week. That part I loved."
good,"As my position was seasonal, my experience with Target was limited.  However, employee morale was good as was management accessibility.  The store at which I worked was maintained in a very clean manner."
good,"it was good work environment, lots of opportunities  to advance. it was a great fresh start after my military service, allowed me to transition for military life to civilian life."
good,Target is a fun and fast environment. You will find great satisfaction from your work. Advancement can be tricky as they mainly hire from the outside for management positions.
good,"A typical day working at target is enjoyable, not overly challenging, and satisfying. I was able to develop skills which helped me to properly and effectively communicate with a team of employees as well as guests. The management was, for the most part, fair with those around them and qualified for their duties. Target has a culture of acceptance and openness."
good,it was one of my first jobs. very fast paced and fun.  lots of getting to know people.  managers were great. great first experience as a supervisor learned a lot.
good,"I enjoy my job as being a flow team member at Target. My team is full of highly motivated individuals, and the atmosphere is positive. As a flow team member we organize the store, and stock the shelves. We also assist guest, and offer them a great experience."
good,Target is a very fun and neat place to work at. The managers are very friendly and helpful too. If they see a task that requires additional help they won't hesitate without a doubt and get you help. They are very flexible on hours in case you go to school or have a second job. I would recommend this place for a first job especially if you want to get retail/sales floor experience!
good,This was and still is a great first job. I enjoyed learning what working is like here. I love having great conversations with guests and look forward to going into work every day.
good,"Had family that worked here and that helped me get hired. Management was fine and the job was typical compared to any other cashier job. Co-workers were really great but, that's always shifting with seasonal hires."
good,"A typical day at work for me was organizing as much of the store as possible, helping guests, working in the back, grabbing items from the back, and working as a cashier whenever the front of the store needed assistance."
good,Not a bad company to work for but the pay is not the best when you have a family to support. I had to change jobs to make a fit income for my family. Needed more hours.
good,Target's drive to provide excellent customer service was one of the things that I liked the most about working there; customer service is paramount in any organization.
good,"good work place, friendly environment, spacious break room, good hours, great team members that all worked so well with each other,always new things to be learned"
good,"It's a good place to start. Everyone is ver nice and accommodating. Benefits are also reasonable, free medical. They raise every year. The management are awesome."
good,"I'd suggest this as a short-term work experience as there aren't a ton of chances for advancement unless you're willing to break a spine or two (metaphorically). Plus, it's not the best resume builder if you end up doing ""grunt work"" for the majority."
good,"It has been a while since I have worked for Target so this might be dated. It is retail so the pressure to get credit cards, long hours, weekends, and trying to get any time off around a holiday in like pulling a well-rooted tooth. Yet Target does treat its employees well. There used to be plenty of events in the breakroom for holidays and just because as a thank you. during the summer we used to hold employee BBQs out back for those working. And for a couple years, we held games in the back room with prizes for the winners. The store in Rogers became a test store. We got to try out all the new software and equipment and even policies. Alos, and my reason for leaving, is that store became the first stop to train all the new managers before they got shipped off to their home stores. Monthly manager turnover was not pleasant."
good,"My time at Target was fairly enjoyable. The staff is very friendly and I got along well with the majority of my co-workers. My managers were very accommodating and because of the size of the company and the location's staff, everyone was very flexible and willing to help each other out in times of need. Target was my first work center and it taught me the basic skills required to continue to move forward in retail. It also taught me valuable social skills that I lacked previously. The experience was something that I'll look back on fondly."
good,"I enjoy working for target because me and my co-workers always working as a team, there wasn't a no for a answer we always willing to help but most of all get the job done.The hardest part of my job was to unload the truck just because you was sign to any department and some of them was pretty heavy.The most part i enjoy re-stocking the store, i was a overnight crew so having the store ready for the next day had me happy."
good,"My time at Target changed often.  I worked from high school years to mid twenties.  I worked all different hours from evenings, overnights, to early  4 am shifts.  I found my time with target to never be dull, always able to learn more each day, from proper Customer Service to Payroll and Scheduling needs compared to store allotted hours.  In my experience, management could be extremely wonderful working along side regular employees, but also had some management that never left behind there desk, I feel retail is a tough field and you must be ready for the good and the bad.  In the almost 10 years I spent with Target, I met many diverse groups of people and loved learning about culture and backgrounds of others.  I liked leaving after a days work knowing I may have made someone else feel good, whether I helped a fellow employee finish a task, helped get something off a shelf for a guest/customer or made someone smile, who was having a hard day, it was a good feeling to end my day like that."
good,A typical day at work for was a good day because my Starbucks team knew what they were doing regards of their responsibilities. It was usually cal throughout the week but in weekends is when we got a high volume of guests come in. The management team always worked together to make sure each department was good with coverage or supplies. The work environment at Target is inviting. The employees have a great attitude when on the job and always help out guests.
good,"Working for Target really was great , I enjoyed working for the consumer and selling phones from all wireless vendors, assisting with accusations and upgrades."
good,Working for target was always fun which is why I went back. Both times I worked there I was working another job and was able to manage well. I enjoy meeting and helping people and customer service is one of my specialties.
good,"Prepping food, making pizzas, customer service popping popcorn, all in a days work.Learned a lot of the Target brand and store and how target operates"
good,"I look up to my current employer. My team is dedicated to do their job and management rewards us and recognizes our commitment. We keep our store clean and greet guests with a smile, I know I play an important part in influencing people's opinions and experience with Target. I have never disagreed with any of Targets acts as a company and am always proud to see them supporting my own beliefs. I work in a place where I know I will never be judged for who I am, and will be treated the same as everyone else. In short, I love working at my job at Target."
good,"I was a seasonal worker at Target in Harker Heights and i really enjoyed it. We got good benefits, they would have sandwitches during our breaks for us to eat, and the managers were very understanding!"
good,"Fine place to work. Work well around class schedule."
good,"A typical day at work would be:"
good,"Good place to work, always hard working supervisors and a supportive team to help out when the store is full but its really the people that make the workplace."
good,Target is pretty easy going employer. They are willing to work with everyone as long as the employees are willing to work back. The work culture is very friendly and open. The leaders of the store are hardworking in most instances and will to be flexible when need be.
good,"a typical day of work is fast paced non stop work till break, i learned to multitask better and work as a team effective team member, management is pretty cool, culture is really diverse but cool, hardest part was trying not to get lost your first few weeks, everything is enjoyable mostly the environment, and people"
good,It was stressful at times but that's what made the days go by fast. I learned how to work quickly but efficiently. The management is caring and friendly.
good,"The fast, fun and friendly culture is a great ideal. Unfortunately, they have really high expectations compared to the realities of the business. The perception of the work environment all depends on which store you work at and your attitude. May the odds be ever in your favor!"
good,Working at Target does not require special skill sets. The job is very easy to do and the environment is very good. Everyone does their job and finishes their task in a timely manner. Sometimes it requires to work at a fast pace but everyone has no trouble with the adjustments.
good,Great company and has a proven track record of success. Always trying to improve and changing slightly for the better. Defintely a company that cares about its people and moving them up.
good,Breadth of job opportunities available.  Only worked with Target India for 4 months.  Great people and are highly valued.  Recommend any opportunity to work with this group.
good,"Breadth of job opportunities in fast past organization.  Value placed on collaboration, communication and diversity.  Well being and work-life balance is also fostered."
good,A day at work was never a bad or okay day because the employees remained positive and supportive at all times. So it was impossible to have a bad day besides being tired when its time to clock out. The best part working at target was learning and experiencing many position I never thought would happen. And that made it easy to use  for any other job or company in the future.
good,Target was an overall ok company to work for. enjoyed customer relations and workplace culture. I  .enjoyed the team I worked with in soft lines . The hardest part of the job was not having enough staff in my department .Target was a really fun place to work and I am happy to say I worked with some truly amazing individuals.
good,"Target is a great company to work for. I enjoyed working for them seasonally. I liked the hours I worked and the tasks I did there. "
good,"Good breaks, decent pay, nice people, good hours. 10% employee discount. I honestly don't have any complains, target is probably one of the best retail stores you can work at."
good,I liked working for Target. I learned a lot and I appreciate Target for giving me the opportunity to work for their company. The store management and employees where great to work with.
good,I enjoyed being a team member at Target. There was a team work environment and they are very customer oriented. Management was helpful when I encountered a problem.
good,good work for starting job or second job. The hours are great and allow you to work in another industry if you need to. The supervisors are great people to work with.
good,"Cleaning, folding, register duties, prepare to be busy!"
good,"Good pay, managers are easy to talk to. Hours are a little excessive or lacking, but not too bad as far full time goes. Work is easy to do, and the job is easy to learn."
good,"Compared to other retail companies, I believe Target to be rather fair with it's scheduling and work environment. While advancement potential is limited, there is room for people judged to be exceptional."
good,A great company to work for with a great management team. Co-workers are hard working and very friendly. Always work to do which makes the work day go by smooth and quick.
good,This job is challenging and fun. It is a good way to get customer service experience and make good work realitionships. Target pushes its employees to sell red cards to its guests and sometimes that feels like it's more important to them then customer service. It can become annoying when your asked what your red card goal is every day.
good,"I loved working here. i would go back if it was logistically viable. The employees are for the most part friendly and the team leads usually try to keep the employees morale up. I liked the fast pace environment of the flow team and very organized way unloading trucks and stocking the store. breaks are short but so is the shift. 6 hour shifts usually and it goes by fast as long as you are working like you are supposed to.  As for the security part of the job. it was slow, boring for the most part. At times it was exciting. security usually work at their own pace and mainly just observe and be a presence in the store."
good,As a seasonal cashier I was able to work evenings and weekends. In a typical day i usually was assigned to a certain cash register for the duration of my shift. Keep in mind that this requires you to stand for extended periods of time.
good,Good pay with an easy job. Management is supportive and praises your hard work. I have enjoyed working here the last 9 months and will continue to work here on weekedns.
good,Target is a great brand to be associated with and a company with the best culture ever! A company that values its community and serves the needy......
good,I currently work for a 3rd party sales and marketing company that provides support to Target. This would not be relevant to rate Target. We support the mobile solutions in electronics.
good,"I mostly had to unlock and lock items for guests other than that I was required to zone aisles that were in my department. I also had to reshop, which was to put items back where they belong. The management could've been a lot better but when I changed my availability, it would take them weeks to approve or deny it but majority of the time they never checked on it even when I asked."
good,"Good job for people new to the work force. If a good leader ant team player, advancement is not difficult if a position is available. Can be mind-numbing at times due to the repetition, but overall a good job."
good,"Target is amazing however, they do not know how to run a Starbucks. Starbucks is big. Not as big as target, but still big. Corporate cut hours and because of that, we have failed to be a successful team. People quit and get overwhelmed with not having coverage. People have to wait in line for more than 5 minutes because a lot of the times, there is only 1 person working. It's not fun being yelled at by a guest who's been waiting to order for a long time when you can't control the hours or coverage. Other than that, target is a great place to work it. I feel comfortable with who I am working there."
good,I really enjoyed working at Target.  The management there really allows you to do what you went to school to do - interact with your patients.  Great place to work.
good,the hours are given and you can switch with other people but it has to be approved by manager first. hardest part is getting the Red Card applications quota met each day
good,"Highly competitive job culture which requires you bring your best everyday!  Lead, develop and manage teams to deliver exceptional service and outcomes for our guests in all aspects of store interactions and activities."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to work along with other people, The job not only allows me to work independently, but it also allows me to work directly with a number of people."
good,"This review is exclusively for CVS pharmacy within Target stores.  Since the CVS takeover there has been a steady transition from patient services to company metrics.  Also, there is instability of pharmacist/tech hours since they fluctuate from month to month. "
good,"Target's management is open to innovation, and constantly welcome forward thinking. "
good,"As a senior Team Leader at Target things are always changing. It is a very fast paced environment with constant multi-tasking skills required. The main priority is helping our guests to drive sales. As a Team Leader, I have to make significant impacts on a store level to meet sales goals as well as any other goals set by the store and corporate office. Target has given me a lot of skills over the past years that I couldn't have learned in a classroom. However, it is difficult to have a work life balance because of nights and weekends that you're required to work. Especially during the Christmas season with extended hours and more weekends worked. Otherwise it's a great environment with support from upper management."
good,"Each store is different. Different managers, different personalities with the diversity of employees. I am fortunate enough to enjoy my coworkers in my location. "
good,"This job is pretty much what you'd expect for retail work. You have to help customers, work a cashier, assist coworkers, pull/push inventory, and facing shelves."
good,"Target hires a good team, and expects them to be great at their jobs. In order to provide good customer service, they want a skilled and quick staff. It is a positive work environment, though it can be fast paced, sometimes tedious, and sometimes difficult."
good,Company    Has.    Been     Great    To.   Me.   Overall.   But.    Retail.      Is.      In.      Difficult.      Position.     Right.     Now.     And.      Looking.      At.    Challenges.
good,Target  was a place to get my first job. It was initially exciting but the push to sell red cards was stressful. I enjoyed getting to know coworkers and never doubted I would lack hours.
good,"I personally enjoyed my team and their work ethic, however i believe there are better ways to get them to work to their full extent. Redcard goals can seem very unrealistic based on situations and ""type""(mostly tourist), of guests presented."
good,Target was a great place to work as a first job. The management is very micromanaging and there is very little time spent actually interacting with your team members. Management makes sure that every second is spent doing busy work if real work is not present.
good,"Fast paced environment and constantly changing. However, they support a light culture where you can have fun at work and customers. You're constantly pressured to get redcards."
good,It was a nice place to work.  The people were nice for the most part.  The work was not stresfull to me.  I do have 25 years expierence in retail.  Management was very nice.
good,Target has a diverse culture that allows its team members to learn many work centers. Holidays are busy. Friendships are easy to build. Management usually works with schedule flexibility.
good,I been with the company for a few years I like my job and what I do but would like to expand more a lot of work to get done target is a fun and friendly place to work
good,"Target is a nice job, I get along with majority of my co-workers, some of them are messy. The hours are inconsistent, seasonal is where you get max hours. After seasonal the hours shorten and It really is not a lot for a person who has multiple bills to pay. Management at times can be annoying and try to be slick of getting employees to do things they should be doing themselves. The supervisor over logistics can be an arrogant jerk who is on a power trip. Overall I like the company because i have cool co-workers, they work day goes by fast due to the amount if work we do. The company was very helpful and flexible when it came to my college schedule, That is a positive."
good,"Unload truck,line assembly, use floor jacks to take pallets to the floor store,break down pallets,and stock shelves,break down boxes and take them to the back."
good,The jobs great! I enjoy the people I work for and with. It can get pretty monotonous day to day but still overall a great experience. The only bad part about working in electronics is that there isn't any commission.
good,"Each day was pretty much the same routine with a few twists here and there. Learned quite a bit about myself with the help of my executives. The workplace was open and everyone was friendly and helpful if I had any questions. The hardest part of my job was being placed in a leadership role because the team lead went on maternity leave. It was a very challenging experience that I took on while being employed less than six months. "
good,"Target is a typical retail company with regards to pace and urgency.  Your days can be long during peak selling times, but if you are a strategic thinker and solid planner you can work under 50 hours a week.  The benefits Target offers are great and they match 401k contributions.  The culture of the company is one of openness and inclusivity and even though it is fast paced and sometimes stressful it is fun most of the time."
good,"No horrible things to say about my experience working for Target. Retail just wasn't the right fit for me at that time scheduling-wise (i.e. early morning or late closing shifts meant taking a cab or walking an hour when buses weren't running, as I didn't have my own transportation at the time).  A typical day consisted of helping guests; supervising and working with team members to maintain shelves and replace returned/misplaced inventory; preparing and posting new price labels on shelves; working service desk or cashiering when necessary; or counting register cash receipts when closing,. H.R.staff were phenomenal in terms of training and always seeming approachable. Had limited interaction with upper management; no complaints to speak of.  Workplace culture was team-oriented and friendly.  Hardest parts of the job were making the schedule work for me (at that time in my life) and getting used to being on my feet/walking around all day.  Most enjoyable parts of the job were friendly customers and the warm and welcoming nature of my favorite team member."
good,"Target is a really great place to work, the management listens the employees are respectable and fun to be around, the only gripe I have is the first pay check was really late."
good,Schedules changed everyday. The people were friendly but you sometimes don't even know what you will be doing that day. Very diverse in age and ethnicity.
good,"I was part time, and in high school. I worked every Saturday. I wanted to work more but I felt like I couldn't talk to someone about it. HR was not there when I was, so it was frustrating. The training was weird, but I got the hang of it. The mangers were so nice. I loved my managers. The workplace environment was relaxed, but it was hard to get involved in the people who were already working there. I felt a bit like an outsider. I loved my job, talking to new people everyday."
good,I work on different jobs within the company depending on where I am needed. I do like the change of pace on different days. I would rather the hours be more steady but that's the way retail is. I've never had an issue with any other employees or management and they all do their best to work with you if you need to change your schedule. It's probably the best part time job I've ever had.
good,"Work flows smoothly as long as you're on schedule. Management was good, although has changed since I've been there. Hardest part of the job was the tedious work. Best part was working with the nice people."
good,"Target is a well working place. I enjoyed working with strong learders, and team members. During the different times in the year we got alot of work done as a team. Our store is #1 in the district in San Fransisco for many reasons."
good,"Target instocks is a lot of work due to the demand of physical labor and early hours, but it is worth it in the end. You end shift at 8:30 or 9 A.M. and then you have time for other activities such as college classes during the day. They pay pretty well, starting at $10, but eventually have the opportunity for raises."
good,"Fast pace with a great atmosphere, diverse group of team members. Slow Advancement if any, management is more worried about delegating than doing any of the work themselves."
good,"A typical day at target is all smiles, you are praised for working hard, management is usually young people so it may need better structure, or possibly just more diverse. The hardest part of the job is time restricting lots of work in little to no time. Most enjoyable part of the job is the community guest and coworkers alike. we can all have fun and work. Also I like that target does a lot of volunteer events for the community."
good,"Great environment to work in and wonderful customer service, but lacking in benefits and job security. Would be great if they offered benefits and did not have such a high turnover rate."
good,The people were young. I was able to relate with most people. The job requirements were easy. Nothing too hard. The store was well kept and surrounded by competition.
good,"Great learning experience , not work life balance; very difficult to manage family and friends while working and leaving work on time. Management is not always adequate and is too many hours working without getting pay overtime."
good,"answer question from customer about merchandise and advise customer on merchandise selections"
good,The people who worked with me were always kind and I cherish the laughs I had with the friends I made while working here. Everyone was accepting of other's differences.
good,This was another job I liked because I got to work with my hands and also I liked it because we worked as a team and I enjoy using warehouse tools like RF scanners and forklifts
good,the work tasks are very simple. My co workers are very friendly and cooperative. Good teamwork. Manger does poor job on keeping everybody in place. The only stressful part would be when we cant finish a certain task under the time frame given.
good,"I have worked at 3 Target stores over the years and only 1 I had a great experience at and actually miss working for. My first time with Target in 2005 I was a cashier and was treated very poorly by supervisors. In 2014 I was hired on for price accuracy and had an amazing team. All the people I worked with were super nice, management was easy to get along with but also stood their authority with their position. Sometimes work would get backed up because the workload was too big for the small team we had, but management would sometimes come help or bring in people from other departments to help and get them more hours. The store was understanding of the workloads but also strict on us staying on task. When I transferred stores because of a move I had the same price accuracy position but there was a big lack of respect from management and other team members. The compensation was right for the positions and area of the stores location, but everything else just depends on the individual store."
good,"I put in about 60 hours/week at target. The salary was decent for just having recently graduated college, but the hours I put in significantly decreased the amount I was making per hour. Company culture is good, but it is very sorority like. You need to fit a certain prototype to make it in the company."
good,the store is okay. depends on who you work with and management. some managers are full of them selves and abuse power and are rude.
good,"Target is a great starting career choice. Great management, with flexible hours according to personal   needs. The team has a great relationship with each other and respect is shown. Management is respective  to guest and team members."
good,Target is one company where you will get to learn a lot without any limits. Its completely employee friendly. Its a great place to learn a lot about retail. Management here in India is not that great but they are trying to improve. Culture here is amazing. Everyone is treated equally with utmost respect.It is definitely a safe place to work.
good,"The team is great, but it is a large company and you tend to get lost in the shuffle sometimes. They do have an open door policy so you can always speak to people about concerns."
good,"Work-Life balance is great. People are talented, very focused on success. Company is very forward thinking if you like to think out of the box, Target is for you"
good,"I like Target. I've met many people who are really great. While scheduling has been a problem for me, I understand it is because we are understaffed in my area."
good,"Target is a great company that provides up to date trainings to prepare you for challenges now and in the future.  "
good,Typical day involves a lot of walking and lifting but no aspect of the job is hard. Easy grid system to learn. Management had clear goals outlined and gives you the necessities to succeed. Employees of target become friends fast and feels almost like a home away from home. Best perk of the job is the 10% discount you receive on everything.
good,I worked at Target during the holiday season. The environment and schedule were great. Leadership and management go above and beyond to encourage team members to enjoy their work experience and do their best.
good,"I like target, the pay is good and the other workers are nice. The hours very are flexible, management is pretty social, and firm. Target workers go above and beyond to make sure all guest have a smooth sailing visit."
good,Working at Target was a great experience. A typical day at work was often fast paced. I was able to work in different departments.The management was always present and available. The hardest part of working at target was working in the bakery due to overwhelming list of tasks. The most enjoyable part of Target was the friendly staff and  management.
good,I loved working at Target. I enjoyed my job and most of the people I worked with bu you never knew who wouldn't be there one day. They would fire people seemingly out of the blue. I was seasonal so I wasn't there long but I never dreaded going to work.
good,"As a sales floor member, I have learned a lot about engaging guests and providing outstanding service. While I did enjoy assisting guests and providing an integral service to a team as a whole, my main concerns would be the overall environment of the workplace. I enjoyed working for Target, however sometimes management would place stress and have a lack of communication to their team members, which would instill a sense of unimportance and a lack of inclusiveness--both of which goes against the Target brand."
good,"At Target I learned how to stock shelves very quickly,also to unload trailers by hand very quickly,and to deal with early morning customers."
good,"•	Knowledge of store service and department locations while maintaining clean visual appearance of department merchandise."
good,"This place offered great opportunities, but this place was not for me, personally. There was a lot of room for improvement and opportunities for any worker."
good,"Everything about the job is repetitive. If you applied for cashier, you'll stand in one place and clean around the area when it's not busy. If you applied for softlines, you'll fold and pick up clothes, then organize everything at the end of the day. It's what you can expect everyday. If you're a shy person you'll definitely learn how to speak up and have a tough shell. Customers aren't always going to be nice, and you'll have to deal with them in a professional manner. The most enjoyable part was getting a RedCard. It starts to feel like a competition to see who gets the most at the end of the day."
good,"I got to say, this was probably the best job that I ever had. At the time when I was working there, things didn't seem that good, but I've heard this saying before and it goes like: ""You don' t appreciate something, until it is gone"". And I wouldn't mind working there once again."
good,Its a great place to work at the culture and job but there is hardly any growth but the work environment is really good and the culture too is nice
good,I have worked there for five years an have gotten many opportunities to learn new task each and everyday. I cross trained for many different positions an I am proud to assist when  needed.
good,"I was straight out of college and was lucky enough to get this opportunity to work for a store I shopped way too much at. Before this I had various part time jobs and worked 6-8 hour days, but this was a true wake up call. The HR not only works in that area, as they also must help manage the floor. It became overwhelming, especially for a newbie like me. It is a great place, but it does come with stress. It just always seemed like your job was never done for the day, even with the 10 hr+ workdays. I praise all my co-workers who were able to find their home/work balance."
good,Loved working here . Had free lunch on certain days. Employee appreciation was taken very seriously. Flexible hours. Comfortable work environment and friendly co workers
good,"This was my first real job in the workforce aside from programs and for the most part it was a good intro."
good,"Seasonal employment was challenging and rewarding. A typical work day was varied and required lots of energy. It really helped pass the time. Overall, a very decent employer."
good,"Greeting guests/maintain sales floor"
good,"very cool crew to work with, very understanding. enjoyed the sense of family we had there. work was good the hours were a bit hard but went by really fast"
good,It was a good place to work seasonal. They gave me sufficient hours. They gave me a two week notice before seasonal ended which was nice of them. Very busy.
good,I had a lot of fun working for target. Their was a lot of high energy and a pish to better and sell. There was always a goal to reach by the end of the day.
good,Target is a great place to work with a great staff and fun work load. The work is rewarding and the hours are flexible. However the management can often make you perform tasks outside your job description. This isn't necessarily bad though as it allows you to gain extra experience. At Target you will always get your hours and benefits.
good,"my average day consisted of stocking, packing, cleaning, my daily pulls, as well as guest pick ups and carry outs. i enjoyed and appreciated my fellow team members."
good,"Pulling pallets of boxes, unloading the truck, stocking store shelves, and a lot of walking. A great place for a starting job. Team members are kind and will always willing to help."
good,I enjoyed working at Target because of the team members that I worked with on a daily basis. They were all very helpful and friendly! They made my job worth going to!
good,"The managers are really understanding. I have had problems with some associates in the past, but overall great company. They are great with vacation time and paid vacation time. You really get to know the people you work with."
good,"Good place to work, most of the time you are allowed to work later than scheduled. The people I work with make the job fun and worth while."
good,My typical work day consisted of assembling bikes and scooters. I had a blast learning to connect and disconnect equipment . The hardest part of work was black friday.
good,"Executive Team Leads (assistant managers) of Target Stores typically work five, ten-hour work days per week with every other weekend and one specific weekday off per week (week is Sunday-Saturday).  This is exceptional for a retail conglomerate as large and successful as Target."
good,"I loved the diversity Target offered.  It is a great fast, fun, and friendly environment where you get to meet all kinds of people.  The Executive teams are usually the cream of the crop and I have relationships with people from Target to this day.  Opportunities for lateral advancement were abundant, but at times I did feel like their was a glass ceiling for advancement no matter how much you gave the job your everything."
good,"This target night stocking job was perfect for me while in school. It payed minimum wage, but offered great hours. The management staff was friendly and willing to work with your schedule."
good,Management has an understanding of situations that are beyond their control. They are really flexible with your hours if you are a school student and are willing to help
good,"Great for seasonal help, but not advancement-friendly.  Great working environment, friendly co-workers. Good with cross-training around store, lenient with school schedule when they have advance notice."
good,Since working at target in march '16 I noticed management is patient for the most part. Mostly solid work team. GLBTQ+ friendly and supportive. As well as special needs supportive. I feel safe and respected. HR has had my back very well so far:) they take time to help me understand certain areas of work and reasons behind certain work areas. I recommend this job for beginners very strongly!
good,"Good company, but poor district and regional leadership! Decent entry level pay and great benefits. ETLAP are required to have floor manager and AP responsibilities."
good,"Interesting and a very busy atmosphere to work in, especially during the Holidays. I enhanced my interaction skills with guests and management. Hardest part of my job were the various hours that I worked. My most enjoyable part of my job was meeting people from all walks of life. I had a very good management team, overall who saw to our needs,"
good,"they expect you to learn fast and be productive or they will get you out of there. The will not baby you or hold your hand. you wanna work you better, and they will tell on you for anything. there are no secrets so just do right."
good,"Target was good at times to work for. There were moments when it wasnt the best place to bed, but i guess thats at many work places. Overall its a fun place to be and great people to work with."
good,"Overrall its a good place to work to make good money, learn new things about warehousing & has good benefits. The only thing i disliked about it was all the extra mandatory overtime days. Its great money & a great opportunity for a career, but not enough time at home."
good,I've worked at Target for over two years now in the backroom.  Management changes quite a bit and the workload can at times be quite daunting.  The managers are willing to listen if you are up front about the situation and will understand if not everything could get done.  Hardest part of the job is just that you work alone a lot and there's more work than one person can handle so you're basically leaving work for the next person that comes in.  Generally the people that I've worked with though have been fun to work with and were hard workers.
good,"I was at target 8 years ..long hours but the pay was worth it..."
good,"Target was a great place to work for. Being a cashier was not always an easy task, but there were great regular customers that made the time go by fast. The management and the coworkers were okay...I did not feel they love their jobs as much as they should."
good,"Working at target has been pretty okay, retail is retail pretty much. Take it or leave it, it's not for everyone. What you're willing to put up with in your day to day shift is what determines whether or not it's for you."
good,"The pharmacy was located into the mall. The OTC are was large and the counters, shelves and furniture were new."
good,I enjoy the people i work with. There are challenges that come to working retail but the co workers and managment know how to help you through it and how to run the store.
good,Teams are outstanding. A lot of hard work is done each day by everyone. Fast paced. So much knowledge given to the teams about business growth and development.
good,Great company to work and everybody is helpful and have alot of useful knowledge about whats going on in the company. A typical day is fast pace and its always work to be done.
good,"Really good company and great job. There is a lot of room for advancement, and as long as you put the work in you will be rewarded for it, whether it is with a raise or a promotion. The only downside to the job is the very poor work/life balance."
good,working on the register. help customers clean. I learned that the people at target were good people hard workers.  nice environment to work in. I would not mind going back to work for them. the management was very nice at the woodlands tx location. very helpful to me when I needed them. I some really nice co-workers to work with very helpful and we worked well together . hardest part of the job was the drive from where I lived to the woodlands. the most enjoyable was the people .
good,I honestly enjoyed working at Target. Co-workers were very respectful and friendly always willing to help out if there was any questions or task that needed to be done. I would honestly say the Co-Workers and management was a second family. Great company to grow with. I miss it.
good,"I was the new guy and never felt like i belonged, the other team members were not friendly or welcoming. Most customers were very nice but standing for so long with not much freedom to do anything else isn't ideal"
good,"The high point of Target is the nice people you work with. The culture is to work as a team, be helpful to everyone and have fun while you work. There have been changes in the last few years that have made working a little more stressful- less hours for employees and less people working at a time, but overall it is a good place to work."
good,The HR department was kind and generous. They are the one who made me love my job and let me see threw them target was the wonderful place to work. Didn't care to much of some of my GLs but I always stay very positive about my work in front of me and don't let anything bother me.
good,"They do their best to bring in talented leaders.  Benefits around medical are pretty bad, though about on par with other large private companies in MN."
good,They start you off at 10 witch is better then sams walmart and kmart. But theg also give you a 15% discount on everything in the store and it reallly helps out of you use cartwheel sales on top of that. So it helps adults that are stuggling better then teens like me who just need hours and $$$. Great environment.
good,"Target has made great improvements. Although, you work is hard, the culture is innovative and exciting. It's nice to be part of a progressive company. With all of the recent transformations, there is a little uncertainty and a noticeable increased workload. The unknown can be a concerning, but things are noticeably moving in the right direction.  Management needs to continue to be as transparent and positive as possible and this is an excellent way to keep teams motivated and excited about the current direction and future of the company."
good,Target provides great pay and benefits to employees and is willing to work with everyone individually to provide the best experiences possible. Hours and scheduling are usually flexible and raises are guaranteed annually.
good,Follow store routine and policies to complete assigned tasks. Enjoyed interacting with public and my co-workers. Management worked around my full-time and other part-time job when creating my schedule. The hardest part of the job was closing shifts in Food Ally. The most enjoyable part of the job was successfully assisting customers at the service desk.
good,Sometimes A Little Slow But Great People And Great Mangers. Easy Work And Light On Body. Very Helpful And Understand People!
good,Helping guest with all of their wireless needs and providing great customer service to meet their needs that's outside of the wireless department.Ensuring their satisfaction and loyalty to continue doing business with our corporation.
good,Target was a good company to work for.  I've learned a lot in the retail world.  Improved my customer service skills and got more confidence communicating.
good,"The associates who work at the store provide a diverse background that reflects the surrounding community. There is alot of teamwork, and areas of opportunity to advance in training."
good,"As a Guest Service Representative at Target, a  typical day of work includes returning guest items, processing payments, and practicing fast, fun, and friendly service to the guests. Patience and kindness is key to a happy guest. The hardest parts of my job is the late hours and the process of helping an already unsatisfied/angered guest and making sure that they leave the store satisfied. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with my team."
good,Working there is definitely cool everyone is very friendly and they help each other out it's really a wonderful  place and again the team is great
good,"Target aimed to be a fun, fair work environment and for the most part delivered.  It was a great learning experience and was a good employer for gaining managing experience."
good,"At the management level, Target provides great advancement opportunities for those who own their development and are able to produce results. For those who punch-in & punch-out, you may get worn down by the repetitive nature and challenges of big-box retail. Overall great culture, and definitely will provide opportunities to learn. Target is evolving into an even greater company, but with change comes growing pains, and learning to shred old expectations to produce higher quality results. Retail is not easy, but Target compensates well at the managerial level. As one colleague described it - it's ""dirty money"" because work get down and dirty and work hard to run a great store and make good pay, but don't expect a white collar cubicle job. You have to like to stay busy and be ok with constant engagement with guests and team members."
good,Fast paced company with excellent customer services for employees as well as the general public.  Excellent training for advancement.
good,"Working in Assets Protection, I found my job never to not ever be exciting. I worked with great professional people and the management there always had an open door policy. I loved that my job was a challenge and had a great friendship with local law enforcement."
good,"working at target was a good seasonal job, although it became tiresome standing for 6+ hours I learned a lot from it. I liked interacting face to face with the customers, they gave good benefits and the management was nice."
good,"Lots of exercise , great co workers always willing to help, ability for advancement is nice and I always felt safe working there"
good,"benfits of work here good knowledge about Acccounts capable to learning different types of acccounts summary."
good,Target is a great opportunity job if you want to move up in management. Its great to learn lots of trade things and experience a little bit of everything.
good,"Best company in retail. Amazing culture. Fun work environment. However it is still retail...Weekends/holidays/evenings"
good,I like working at Target. You can learn so many new things all in one day. They are more than willing to cross train for any department of the store.
good,Working there allowed me to have a better idea of how there supply system worked. Fellow co workers were friendly and the management was focused and acted professionally.
good,"I was hired on to be a cashier. I had to bag items and take care of payments, as well as keep various things stocked on my register. My co-workers kept to themselves mostly. Management was okay. Whenever I had my interview, 2 people told me different things in terms on what I was going to be hired on as. Hardest part was definitely the long hours, but I got used to it. Also getting ahold of someone when you needed help was definitely  a pain."
good,A greta company to work with. Tremendous energy and full of fun. Lot of learning and very inclusive culture. Lot of young crowd and a friendly environment.
good,"After working at Target for over 2 years, I can say they truly cultivate an environment that is very much guest-centric. While it may be seen as putting guests before your fellow employee (as I've often heard while working), it is the mindset that sets Target ahead in customer satisfaction that competitors like Wal-Mart. The main gripe I had working for my store were the ETLs (Executive Team Leaders). While some were hard-working individuals with a ""lead from the front"" attitude, most were lazy, complained too much, and did not cultivate a positive work environment that makes it enjoyable to work."
good,"CVS was the best job I had. I learned to much about running a store , how to problem solve , team work and so much more working for this company."
good,I've been working here for a year now and it's a great place to work at. The pay is decent and the management was great. Met a lot of nice people.
good,Fast-paced work environment with long hours. Worked as an overnight stocker and was off during the day. It paid the bills but it wasn't for me.
good,Target demands lots of energy and a flexible work schedule. Expect to work a minimum of 55 hours a week but it is possible to advance with a great salary and great benefits.
good,"A great company to work for, especially if you are energetic and love all aspects of guest service. They treat their employees well."
good,"A typical day at Target usually started with taking items from the back and replacing the ones that were misplaced or purchased. But everything i learned here is that staying extra careful when it comes to most products cause usually most products at this location were pretty fragile. Also most of the management was helpful and wasn't afraid to ask for help when it came to task they could't do alone, and all the team members there were the friendliest bunch I have met in quiet some time. "
good,I think that Target is a good place to work. The people are great to work with and I will continue to have great relationships with all of them.
good,Work is very easy. Stocking with the locations on the box makes sure you can spot find quickly and efficiently. Helps you learn how to work in fast paced environments.
good,"A typical day as an Asset Protection Specialist is writing incident reports, greeting customers, watching cameras for suspicious activities and updating counts."
good,The work we do is typically not hard outside of unloading the trucks. We have a very relaxed but efficient vibe. Management generally takes our opinions into consideration. The most enjoyable part of the job is my co-workers who help keep a smile on my face on the rough days and the guest who come in regularly to walk the store and chat.
good,A typical day at target(CVS) pharmacy was all about costumer service. You greet a guest with a smile and have them leave with a smile. I've learned most of my customer service from this job. I've learned that if I be me customers love that more than a robot. My coworkers were amazing. The hardest part about this job was the hours. But this was by far the best job I've had with an amazing team.
good,The Logistics side of things I love is that it's nice and fast-paced of a job. You always have things to do and never are bored of the job. You will learn alot about other people and are able to be crossed trained into other areas and work your way up.
good,"On a typical day you can expect waves of customers depending on the time of day they are larger or smaller."
good,"A typical day at work was nothing that you wouldn't expect from the nature of the job. "
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is working with other team members. As for lower management, they aren't the most competent. They gossip a lot, it almost reminds me of high school. Other than management, it's an ok place to work."
good,"Management and coworkers were great! Job was easy. Helped with unloading the truck and stocking merchandise in the appropriate aisles in the store. "
good,"A typical day always kept you busy; whether it was stocking produce or serving drinks at the Starbucks."
good,A typical day at work is helping a lot of guests and keeping the store up to point.  I learned better guest service skills along with better B2C communications.  The management at Target is coordinated and feel very much like anyone else on the team.  Co-workers are all diverse and interesting and when the store has a balanced team the team becomes its own little unit or clique.  The hardest part about working at Target is the inability to please everyone.  That comes standard in most retail settings though.  The most enjoyable part of Target is the unique atmosphere of the place and people you work with.
good,"The management at Target really is the bane of the corporation, but that is of most corporations.  The job itself is very lax and you are able to deal with many different ethnic groups and peoples.  All in all it is very interesting and will keep you busy."
good,"I know this would be a opportunity to grow in my field and to be the very  best in all areas. I feel that working in an hospital would help me to be better once I""m  in the working roll again."
good,Great workplace; Target invests in Team members and practices very good HR policies. Provides equal opportunity to Team members to grow.
good,It was a very friendly environment to work at. I learned lots of things about new cell phone which were out during the time. The management was in order.
good,Target is a very diverse company. The work load is Depending  on the store manager the advancement opportunities change.  Over all I enjoyed my job there.
good,A typical day at work for me was getting as many people I could to sign up for Red cards. I at least got 10 people per day I worked. I enjoyed trying to convince customers.
good,"As a cashier I had to greet every customer, have a conversation with them so it wouldn't be rude or awkward. As I would check out their belongings I would offer the credit/debit card which would allow them to get 5% off every purchase. At the end of each week our managers would look at all employees percentages in sign ups, and I had one of the highest every week."
good,"I would start at 6 am start by checking my email and see if anything needs my attention first thing. If not then I would continue working on my weekly preventive maintenance."
good,It was a very professional environment and I learned something new everyday. My co-workers were very friendly and I enjoyed working with them. My manager was always willing to help and was very approachable.
good,"Most days at Target are fairly the same depending on the department you are in. The management is fine, there could be better top down communication. Co-workers are the best part of the job, you can make some good friendships."
good,Always a fun place. Management will do anything that they ask a team member to do. Opportunities to grow are always available. Advancement is possible for all who want it.
good,Great place to work. Management treats everyone like family. Feels like everything is a real team effort.Just sometimes tough to balance work and family around the holidays!
good,"Great pay, great people to work with managers were fine but lacking in direction and finesse. Learning how to manage a team was a definite plus."
good,"People come and go so it can be frustrating retraining and continuously introducing yourself. Advancement is possible, but not if you consider target your only job."
good,"A typical day at work involves taking orders from customers and making their drinks to their liking. Also, cleaning the dishes and handling the register. I've learned a lot about customer satisfaction and team work from this job. I really loved my bosses and the team at Target. My co-workers have been extremely helpful and hard-working. The hardest part of the job would be when we get a rush on the weekends, having to assign certain workers different places at the job (one at cashier, one making drinks, etc) and keeping a steady flow. The most enjoyable part is working with a great team and knowing you are satisfying customers, along with my regular customers."
good,"At the time it was an amazing group of us working together, But then our boss left and one on one we left they started to hire lazy people and it was never the same."
good,"Target is a great company to work for.."
good,"Since it was holiday season most of my job consisted of replenishment and zoning.  I was impressed with the caring of the management staff.  They were very supportive."
good,"A typical work day as a Store Manager is 10-12 hour shifts. The day begins by checking email and reviewing reports. As a leadership group, we walk the store and evaluate priorities. Adjust the team and daily focuses based on business needs regarding payroll, instocks, merchandising, staffing, sales trends, and workload. The hardest part of the job is continuous improvements on productivity and detail in store brand while maintaining payroll, guest service, and team moral. The most enjoyable part of the job was celebrating wins with the team on operations reports and watching them grow and develop in their careers."
good,"This was a very fast paced job!  Reading blue prints for setup of pog, ans  building extremely accurate and precise department for setup of new products to go out on the sales floor.  I enjoy working in a fast paced environment and knowledge of exact height and location of products was extremely important. creativity and mindset was a must have for this job.  Placing  shelves and pegs from the blueprint form must be point on.  I enjoyed working this job because everyday was a challenge."
good,"Check in; review work situation and preparation with safety tips, proceed to get the urgent/behind workload done.then spend the rest of the day maintaining and updating the inventory and have everything shipshape while servicing our guest. Supervisor felt confident in me to work alone and able to handle Heavy work load and closing with best attitude."
good,"It was a pretty typical retail job experience, but it was far from unpleasant. My coworkers were all nice people, and management kept it all running pretty smoothly without being overbearing."
good,Target was grate with there employs and i would go work with them aging i worked there for 10 years and had no problems and also got my certification on the job
good,"Target is a fast, fun and friendly workplace with a diverse culture of employees.  My initial hiring as an entry level employee was ideal for my life situation at the time.  The company was willing to work around my school schedule which allowed me to complete a degree in computer networking.  I will always be grateful for the opportunities that Target made available to me."
good,target is a well oiled machine that gave me a chance to be a part of it. i am grateful for that opportunity. the typical work day was easy. i am the only oe in my deprtment giving me a lot of responcibility. my bosses have faith in me.
good,"Target is a great company to work for. They have some great leaders and some that were not."
good,Good experience but not to make a career out of it. Met many great co-workers.  Management is always there to help.  Not easy to advance.
good,"A typical day at work requires alot of moving, no time to sit and be lazy. (especially if you're on the sales floor) You learn alot about the store and also the people that work there as well. The managment is great, they are all very friendly and same goes for co-workers! The hardest part would be making sure you get the hang of things and where items go, but that catches up quick with you. And the most enjoyable part about working at Target would be the people I work with, they are all wonderful, different people!"
good,"We all know the name Target, but it is much more than just a retailer with comical and well put together adds. It has been for me an opportunity of great stature that has shown me many things that I can carry to other companies. My coworkers are my team and, for the most part, they are my work family. The team member that I oversee and regulate are exactly that, a team. Inclusion is a big part of Target's strategy and has proven its worth on many different occasions. The hardest part of my job is watching someone who either does not wish to or simply will not engage their full potential. For me personally, I enjoy developing, leading, and strategically making game plans for success with and for my team."
good,"A day's work at Target is fun, the workers are very friendly and always maintain the rule of teamwork and are always available to help at a difficult time."
good,"Target is a great place to work if you are looking to gain experience in several departments. I learned how to multi-task, use a number of devices and operate different pieces of equipment. The hardest part about working here include slackers, and sometimes managers will spread you too thin. All in all, it is a great place to work, especially for college students."
good,Wake up early unload the truck stock the shelves and then go home it was fairly easy and great with my school schedule. I learned how to use technology i had never seen before. The hardest part of the job for me was to wake up as early as they wanted me to.
good,"A day at Target usually starts with walking through my department and seeing what needs to be done. I work through product that has been misplaced or overstocked, update product counts and make sure we have what we need on the floor, and customer servicing and helping other team members along the way. I learned how to multitask and guest service! In my previous secretarial jobs, I helped troubleshoot problems and guided people, but not like I have been at Target. The management at Target is wonderful. It's tiered system in that there is a manager of the store and then managers of each major section of the store. I'm a brand manager, so I am still a ""regular"" team member, but I am in a designated part of the store for every shift. Coworkers went from being just that -- coworkers -- to friends that I am happy to work with. The hardest part of the job is having difficult customers. I have learned through this job that every individual deserves kindness, patience, and has a reason for who they are at that moment. The most enjoyable part of working at Target is helping people every day. Even though it's ""just retail,"" I like to think that helping someone find a product, educating them on it, and sharing a smile is somewhat making a difference in the world."
good,Working here gives me experience of dealing with different types of situations such as fast times during the busy season and slower times during off season. Management and co-workers are friendly and welcoming making it enjoyable to work here.
good,Target is a great culture to work in. Lots of talented people to work with.  Management can tend to be of one mind nut otherwise a good place to work.
good,"Managment was somewhat unorganized, although workers were very we rounded and worked hard. The environment was relaxing and clam."
good,"Although the Target Canada was not in good commercial business, I still remember the days I worked there. I am happy to work with Target coworkers."
good,"A typical day at work normally consists of making sure our guests have an amazing shopping experience. Guests are the key driving point of this company, so as a supervisor it is my duty to make sure guest experience is positive in addition to making sure we are en route on reaching daily, weekly and monthly goals when it came to Target Red Cards- which drove guest loyalty. Starting off as a cashier in August 2012, I quickly found my self learning a lot in the first few months. As a result I was given the chance to cross train throughout the entire store in various positions. Soon to be promoted to Front End Supervisor (GSA/ GSTL)."
good,"Working here provided extra experience in customer service, also learning new ways to solve issues. Management provided good feed back and advancement opportunities."
good,"It's a job. It requires more physical energy than most, especially if you are brought in through a staffing agency. Nice group of people to learn from though, also minor safety hazards."
good,"I learned a lot about shipping things in the back room, Spent most of my time on going out to the floor of the store an picking products for online orders. Some would not scan into scanner but was able to match up numbers an codes for them. Then they moved me out to cashier an I pick up quick, Loved this part of job although it was only"
good,"Benefits were ok, The pension was deleted and health benefits are expensive.  4th quarter, no personal time off granted...  Long hours."
good,This is a great place to work full or part time. Compensation is fair and there is room for advancement. The vibe is very positive and friendly.
good,"A typical day of work was not all that entertaining, and was sometimes slow. I did not learn much considering my recent job was basically the same. My co-workers were pleasant to be around, I have no problem working with others.The hardest part of the job was achieving the stores goal of red cards.I enjoyed talking to my customers and interacting with them the most."
good,"The management staff was very friendly, and on point with their duties and responsibilities.  For special events and holidays the store would provide lunch for the staff.  At the entry level the job very easy to learn and their training is spot on.  All in all I had a good time working there. For people interested there are many advancement opportunities."
good,Target is a somewhat fast paced with highly productive management. My coworkers were great and I am happy to call some of them my friends even after I stopped working for Target. Schedules were not consistent.
good,I came in mostly on mid-shift so when I start it's fairly busy. I bagged up a lot of groceries and other necessities and I also took payments in multiple types of ways. I learned that sometimes people just need someone too talk too. I think management was on point. I learned basically all I needed to know in as little as a month. the best part about that job was the co-workers. I had no problem at this job.
good,we would go in at 10 pm unload trucks take a 15 min break then start putting freight out i learned a lot at target they were great about letting u explore different parts of the store and learn.Everybody got along and the assistant managers even pitched in and helped when needed.
good,"Although I was there for a short time period, I saw that there were problems in HR, especially when it comes to scheduling!  There was also slight favoritism.  One of my co-workers had been there for 3 years, and had 3 complaints on them in one day and still wasn't fired, however, in the handbook the co-worker should have been fired that day or at least had an investigation."
good,"It's not horrible, just make sure you're constantly asking about Red cards or they will be on your back all the time. The higher management is wonderful and they're really good at working around your school schedule."
good,"Management was nice and helpful when I started."
good,"Great team moral, fun and positive place to work. Management was always willing to help when needed. Awesome experience"
good,The environment of Target was better than most people sale retail out to be. I met some really amazing people there. Every day was a fun new challenge. One of the great things from working in this retail location was the amount of cross-training I received. I really believe that I will take a lot of what I learned from this location and apply to any future career in my life.
good,"Target people are very ok to work with and are very helpful in a lot of aspects. "
good,job is all about change every year. Management is all about pushing the red card and cross training employees to do multiple duties.
good,"Long shifts, never ending tasks, odd hours. I learned that working in an environment that is very organized makes it easier to help the customers find the product they are searching for. Management seemed to be very stressed and never seemed to have enough time to have one on one conversions with employees. Hardest part about the job was going in Meat Freezers with temperatures of -30 degrees F. with fans constantly blowing air! That was painful. The most enjoyable part about the job was meeting new people and figuring out what the customer is looking for."
good,Working as a team is so much fun to me. You get a lot done and it makes your job easier. Its a fun place you gotta stay on your toes and the people were great!
good,"I had to work at least 10 hours a day without much sitting. Can handle long days without resting periods due to the fast paced environment. Managing and developing over 70 employees was exciting as I was in their shoes once and could relate to the majority of employees. My co-workers was hard working individuals that worked together to achieve one common goal. Sharing responsibilities with each other and doing what's best for the store. The most enjoyable part about working for Target was the consistent interaction with our guests and how no two days are alike giving me the opportunity to learn something each and every day. "
good,"Great job and great people to work with.  Guests are number 1 and it is fun to solve their problems and create brand loyalty,"
good,"Must be able and willing to interact with the customers or quest and be nice and able to assist the quest with questions or able to direct them to one who may be able to answer them."
good,"working at target was a very busy, fast pace place. having different type of guest yelling at you when things didn't go their way only made you stonger, and having a million of things to do made the hours fly by. I've learned so many things while working at target such as, how to communicate better with guest, how to open and close a store. I've learned just about everything i had to working in retail. my co-workers were the best i found a friendship in each one of them. as of management i would rather not say."
good,Working for Target gave me a better incite into the good quality and hardwork Target tries to provide to their customers with kind and friendly well paced service; as well as good customer service. Which me as an gave more appreciation for their company.
good,"Management is very supportive, the most enjoyable part of the job is the appreciation which you get.lucky to have such wonderful colleagues."
good,"You get nice discounts on what you buy, but you have to deal with a lot of long hours on your feet. If the managers don't feel your ready to advance in the job, they won't always tell you, they tend to just give any excuse not to let you do what you want career wise."
good,They really know how to treat their employees. Some of the managers need a lesson in treating people fairly but otherwise I've really enjoyed working there. Very flexible with their schedules.
good,"Was running the logistics team and worked on trailer unload."
good,"Flow team is early mornings, fast paced and detail oriented but easy to learn and usually off before noon on most days. Breaks down store into three four sections to help cover store more efficiently."
good,"Working at Target was a fun experience for me. It was a very friendly atmosphere to work in, and there was always something to do. A typical day would start with me, going out into the parking lot, and bringing in the carts. By about three O'clock is when the store is at it's most busiest, and I will be called to help out on the registers. near the end of the day, the lot should be close to empty, and by the end of the day I would take out the trash."
good,"The location i worked at was very high volume. we excelled in the face of that. My coworkers all worked well as a team, and i truly felt like part of a community. "
good,"target was a very fast, fun and friendly place to work. Nothing was unbearable, or hard to do. it was a job that came right when I needed a job and I don't regret anything. very grateful for the opportunity."
good,"Not a horrible company to work for, but they are a corporation and you do get paid rock-bottoms salaries. My customer service skills are definitely sharper because of this position."
good,Fun work place the best thing is after 15 years you develop a family away from home. I like the guest that are regular guests that also become your family. There are some headaches and politics that you deal with but that is apart of the business side of the ever changing world we live in. Some change is good and some not so good. I look forward to having a place to go every day and doing something every day is an adventure. The best thing about my job is that I can pick and choose what I want to do that day and I do it. I am basically my own boss. Don't get me wrong they set preventive maintenance jobs up that I need to complete before a certain time but I can pick which one for that day. This was a great job some headaches but over all not bad. The worse thing was being told that they were closing and after the first of the year you had no place to go that they were closing the doors. Yeah a real reality check where do  I go now.
good,"The management team was well trained and knew how to make a normal days work feel like a true difference maker, which helped create a more satisfying feeling to end the work day. However with a business that is as large as this, the corporate politics spill out and affect even the lowest of the jobs on the totem pole. At a store level the management team did I good job of making everyone feel their roles were vital, even if it wasn't necessarily the case."
good,"My workload is different every day, depending on the seasonal  time of year.  I have displays to assemble, signs to change, and  decor to change. I am also part of the planogram team two days a week, keeping up  with the chaging product lines. Everyone in the store is part of the cashier back-up team, and hurry to help ot as needed during the day."
good,If you want time to fly by this is the place. Never a dull moment. Their is always something to do. The Team that I have as well makes working here that much better. The management staff cares about you as well not just the work that needs to be done.
good,"Working at Target was one of the greatest experiences of my life.  I was in school at the time which made it difficult but my supervisors were extremely helpful in making sure that I kept up with my schooling and also received enough hours to pay for living.  I was a Sales Floor Team Member which means I was responsible for stocking shelves, making sure everything looked presentable for guests, and helping said guests with any problem they had that related to our store.  I was also responsible for covering the electronics section when the team member would step off the floor for their break.  This means there was a lot that needed to be learned in case someone had a question and watching over the keys that unlocked the cases to the high price items was very important.  The hardest part of the job was making sure that guests were always happy.  Sometimes it was easy to help out a guest but a lot of the time it was difficult.  Some people would be angry or frustrated and it's difficult to keep that from effecting how you interact with the team members.  A lot of us were yelled at and called names and it was difficult to not take it personally, but eventually, you learn to shrug it off.  A lot of it came from being up as a cashier, which I also did from time to time.  What I learned though is that everyone has a story.  The man who came in looking for tampons may be buying them for his embarrassed daughter, so don't laugh.  The woman who was frustrated and took her anger out on you because you were out of her type of shampoo may have just had a really long day at work and really"
good,Great Company to work for with amazing benefits. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people and the relationships you build/create.
good,Target was a great place to work because it was different every day. Some days I would work early and open the store and others I would work until closing.  This gave me a variety of jobs and job duties. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing customers happy when they walked out the door.
good,Fun place to work at with great supportive team member. Emphasized on customer satisfaction. I learn to come in with a great attitude.
good,"Being with target for 3 years was an experience.I always wanted to work at starbucks because i really love coffee.To be able to better my knowledge at the job while sharing it with the guests.Working side by side with my managers was awesome,selling the coffee products and serving the best quality service we could bring to our guests.Team members there are always a bundle of joy overtime i went to work.The downfall though was being left alone for hours with no support until the next relief.I enjoyed the job everyday."
good,Target has a great guest focused culture which attracts incredibly gifted leaders whose leadership abilities are second to none.  The team members and leaders are service oriented people with a passion for the company to excel in the industry.
good,"1. Well conducted training sessions before execution."
good,"My work day consist of plan-o-grams , cashiering , being a operator, and a mentor. I have learned a lot here like the Target Brand, Management is great except for them changing a lot. My coworkers are the best. the hardest part of my job is when my orders do not come in on time and the most enjoyable is going home."
good,Target was once a great place to work. The training was once great and hands on. They really use to care about their employees by having outing and bonuses for great work and management of your area.
good,"I started this job as a seasonal worker,and i was allowed to stay because of my performance. Great place to work ! I've gained a new family ,and enjoy working with my team . Management is awesome!"
good,enjoyed working there great atmosphere management team was friendly easy to get along with pay was okay would recommend to any one needing a job
good,Worked here in high-school. Super flexible schedule and management was great. Company cared about team members and I always felt well taken care of. Company morale was high.
good,"All the team members have a positive attitude within the company and each member has worked effectively well with many customers. Working at the company for many years, I had the opportunity to gain professional growth within the company."
good,Target was a good first job. Always something to do and employees always there when you need them. You get a chance to experience different tasks every now and then.
good,"Day starts out at a fast pace, unloading trucks and stocking merchandise. Also assisting guests and other team members on sales floor while completing other tasks asked by team leader."
good,"I first joined as a part of the flow team that would start in the mornings. After the next couple of months I was moved to other parts of the store, such as pricing and presentation, signing, electronics, hardlines and produce. It's definitely a great place to move up and everyone is flexible with your schedule. The management started getting a little impersonal, as I would kinda get shut out instead of actually talking with management. I have to say though that I learned a lot from coworkers and the like. Overall good."
good,"A retail business to work for."
good,"Fun and enjoyable job culture, enjoyed management and felt as if everyone enjoyed me being a part of the Target team.The most enjoyable part of my job at target was being able to interact with and help guests and know that they are leaving with a smile and good impression. The only thing I felt was difficult was the ability to juggle my every day life and my work life due to the forever changing/rotating schedule, which I was not expecting whatsoever. All in all I enjoyed working at target and enjoyed the team I worked with."
good,"Target finds itself at a crossroads of sorts. In this age of digital business transactions, led largely by Amazon, the overhead costs of a traditional brick and mortar business location is forcing large box companies worldwide to reconfigure their business models. Target is no exception, and a typical day at work reflects those most salient changes."
good,"Great place to enjoy assisting others and really getting involved within the work and community as a family. I really enjoyed how the managers would motivate the cashiers by creating a mini competition if you will, in order to get the sales up and in return win prizes."
good,it ok you can move up fast but the management suck suck suck and they have there favorite people and the hours suck they don't care if you have a family
good,"productive and quick paced environment to achieve strong guest satisfaction, provided me with a strong opportunity to enhance my guest service skills and to multi task, most enjoyable aspect was the everyday interaction with the guests and fellow team members"
good,Great company and I wished I could have worked for them longer.  Always laughter even with hard work and we did work hard. Loved stocking the shelves and seeing what new items were arriving.
good,Working for target was a great experience. The staff was very friendly and store is always clean and very organized. The guest was pleasant and I enjoyed helping and talking with customers.
good,"The job can get extremely stressful but at the end, it had helped more people got medicines that needed for their health."
good,Working at Target allowed me to work 40 hour weeks however the schedule was different every week. i would take care of the entire electronics department
good,employees were compensated for what they did but target's management team was lacking the proper skills to effectively run the operations of the daily business of the organisation.
good,"Everyday there was some skill to learn in retail pharmacy with this company. Within my 5 year employment I had to learn and master two computer systems (PDX, EPS) which was a challenge but easy for me because I am a fast learner. Helping people is the most enjoyable part of pharmacy."
good,Good managers it is a great company calm cool and collective type of environment when you come in everyone greets you also when you leave a lot of lunches.
good,"Flexible work environment that fosters collaborative relationships.   Innovation is part of the culture at Target.   The best part of Target truly are the people, it is why I worked there for so long.  The only hard part was the uncertainty of the reorg."
good,Working in logistics at Target can be a demanding job. Unfortunately the pay does not reflect that. You will make the same as anyone on the floor or cashiering for much more manual labor. Benefits are good for FT team members and management will work around having a good family life. My store in particular was very understanding of time requests off due to family concerns.
good,"Everyone is nice to you when you first start working, but there was a time that the manager didn't teach me how to do my job he had another team member show me in a short amount of time. Was making us to hurry up and get the job done."
good,target was a good place to work taught me alot of new things i never knew management could have been better but it was alright  it was my first job so i didnt know what to expect great company
good,"After preparing for work, I work pulls putting away recently sold merchandise. Next, we ""zone"" by going through designated aisles to straighten up the area and make it look presentable for the next days happenings. Between each assignment I assist guests, answer questions, direct them to what they're looking for. Up-sell products that compliment the item desired. Act as back up cashier during the rush or guests ready to check out and leave. Persevered through management coming and going through the store. Enjoy and relate well with people I work with. The hardest part is being so active with little relief from the heat but I love the people I work with. Their ages range from teen to older adults and they all have a great sense of humor. I've stayed so long with this company because I love who I work with and I love what the company aims to accomplish."
good,"I was hired just before thanksgiving, while working here they told myself as well as other seasonal workers that they end up keeping many of the seasonal workers, I loved working here great co workers and they understand that you have a life outside of work, however I wish they didn't tell me that they would most likely keep me because as soon as December was over I was jobless. I loved this place and I wish they would have told me a lot sooner that they were not going to keep me. This is my only complaint because other then that I loved working in this environment."
good,"unload truck and stock shore shelves, i learned the importance of accuracy and time management, the management team was supportive, the other workers were also supportive and very friendly, the hardest part of the job was finding where items went without a bar-code. the most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with other employees."
good,Good job but boring.  It doesn't require much skill or intelligence.  Good to gain a deeper understanding of customer service.
good,"A typical day at Target is fast and hectic, you learn that you can not all please everyone and management is very helpful and also your co-workers and the hardest part is clean up after the store closes. The most enjoyable part is sometimes the customers."
good,"I learned most of my money handling and customer service skills with this company.  Great place to work, and awesome and affordable health benefits, though the job it self can wear on you.  Friendly staff and environment can help you get past that, but it can be stressful at times.  Hard working team members can easily be promoted if they show initiative and and actually inquire about advancement."
good,met interesting people shopping for Electronic Devises they knew nothing about. Came across a lot of Customers with fake money and even learned about certain electronic items while on the job.
good,"Love what I do, love the people love to make people smile brighten up there day. Finding exactly what they wanted all the time makes me appreciated my job on a daily basis."
good,"Every day at target Canada was a new challenge. It improvised many aspects in different ways to suite the clients and employee relationship. "
good,"Working at Target was my first overnight experience, which was better than Home Depot. Working there wasn't stressful, but the seasonal hires did stock the shelves quickly."
good,I love the people who i work with. We help each other the best we can. The process of hiring is very fast. The HR personnel is considerate to give what schedules you can work.
good,"most days are non stressful, hectics days are when back to school starts. co-workers are fun to work with everyday. working weekends and holidays are probably the hardest part of job."
good,"A typical day is Customer service, cashiering, stocking and merchandising."
good,Great company to work for and they have great technology.  They are very organized.  It's been about 10 years since I worked for the company but I enjoyed it.
good,"Warm up for work."
good,"Working at Target could sometimes be too much about socializing projects and not enough about actually doing the work, which was frustrating especially given the hours you are expected to put in.  Having said that, there was tons of opportunity for advancement."
good,"A typical day at work included checking people out at the register, and making sure they were satisfied. I also tried to promote a red card that we have for customers to save money."
good,"Target was sometimes busy, so i would have to work fast pace for 8 hours. Its fun working there in the back, the people i work with are cool and fun. But other than that, its a really fast paced job.Especially sundays."
good,I have only been here for about 6 months and it has been wonderful. I wish I had more hours or even full time. I also wish I had help on the weekends. It is very busy  just for one person. Yet starbucks gets two people when slow.  LOD's are super friendly.  But the most enjoyable part would be the smile and happyness I bring to guests !
good,Learned alot from this job. Love dealing with the guest that came in to shop. They have outstanding team work and team members.
good,"Culture and effectively the people are what made Target Canada what it was. A very collaborative environment to work in, where each person was treated with equal amounts of respect no matter rank."
good,My typical day at Target included the usual working at the register and moving shopping carts inside. what I've learned from my experiences at Target is to multi-task and to carry out those task with ease.
good,Typical day at work I would walk in and begin my routine. I would partner with managment to see if there is anything that takes priority over routine. My coworkers felt safe with me and knew they could count on me to insure the job gets done correctly. The hardest part of the job was leaving my job at the end of the day and knowing something went unfinished. The most enjoyable part of the job was having a team to work with and knowing each other inside and out to where we knew what our next steps were without talking to each other.
good,"This place is an amazing first job into the working world. The Job rigor may be a bit much at times but its all part of the discipline. Great People, Great Leadership, and a great opportunity."
good,"Hardest part of the job:"
good,"As an Pharmacy technician at Target, we worked as a team to enter each patients prescription(s) into the data base, fill the prescription(s),dispense the medication to the patient and provide information regarding their medication. In addition, to helping the patients, we as a team worked on inventory management, filling prescription  answering the telephone and helping guest out on the sales floor with over- the-counter products."
good,You never know what to expect when you get placed some where everybody has a different story but overall I like my clients whom I worked for everyone was nice .. Get a chance to work with different people everyday
good,It was always great to meet new people who travels and you learn how to deal with tough situations when it appears.  You also learn how to work in a fast paced environment.
good,The thing I liked most at Target were how positive and helpful my coworkers were. They made it feel less like a job which made it entertaining to be there.
good,its a place like every other store like superstore or walmart. Co workers were cool some of them were my friends so it made the job fun.
good,learned as assessed leadership skills and learned how to work the salesfloor. learned cash handling skills and how to work as a equal team
good,"At Target Financial Services, our job was to contaact customer delinquent on their Target Visa cards and find way for them to bring in current. "
good,"A typical day at could be enjoyable, for the most part. I learned how to deal with people from different backgrounds. I really enjoyed my co-workers. the hardest part of the job could be holding your your lips closed with an irate customer. One of the most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that in some small way I helped someone find what they were looking for."
good,My experience at Target has been great overall.  I would recommend this company to others looking for a retail job.  I really enjoyed the people I worked with and the team environment.
good,Working in a fast pharmacy teaches you work ethics. You'll never feel like you have a hard job when your first job is one of the busiest phrams.
good,"A typical day at work would be energetic, laugher. What I have learned about the business is that no matter what our Guest comes first. Most enjoyable part would be the interaction with the guest and team members."
good,"The presentation team is the best position at Target. You can work independently, and get the job done. The people were nice to work with."
good,"A typical day consisted of arriving at 4am, unloading the morning trucks and stocking shelves until 8am, with my shift ending at 10am. Management and co-workers had the most incredibly positive team attitude and work ethic. Concerns were always heard and addressed. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work uninterrupted and at my own pace (provided my pace was quick enough, and it usually was.) Hardest part of the job was waking up at 3am."
good,"Target is fun and great place to work."
good,"I've worked in HR at Target for over 10 years and have really enjoyed it.  Good culture, exciting business, strong strategy.  Leadership is working on moving a little faster, more agile, and less about building consensus.  Incredibly talented workforce at Target."
good,"As far as Target is as a company i have no complaints. The employees on a lower level are great. Everyone gets along very well, and people will go out of their way to help each other. However management on the other hand runs rampant, with no accountability held towards them. They target employees and push to get rid of them at whatever cost. While even notifying senior management and HR, nothing was done to improve the situations at hand, although they say they will ""look into it"" however they say what you want to hear and that's it. The compensation for the work is more than fair, as well as the benefits they provide. I have learned a lot about the warehouse environment and hope to use this at other jobs. All in all I would say the job itself was great, however management needs to be held accountable for their actions more."
good,"The store is always busy, so that helps target sales go up. The managment is very helpful and they care about the co-workers."
good,Friendly workplace for most of my time. The guest could be mean and rude. Co-workers were very nice and helpful. Management was great for first few years. New management was not as helpful. I learned to further my language skills. To help as much as possible and share burdens. I learned to quickly aid guests.
good,"i've been with the company (marketsource/target mobile) for six months now, no major complaints, lots of communication and scheduling issues in my personal experience."
good,"J'ai adoré travailler dans cette entreprise, tout le monde est cordial et j'ai eu de la peine lorsque ce magasin fut fermé."
good,Follow routines and manage security staff on all directives. Learned how to control profits by marginal gain on a quarterly basis. Involved myself with executive team on how to manage and train my security staff. Worked with guest from a theft stand point as well as customer concerns. Lead security team to top three ranking in profits and theft metrics.
good,working at target was fun and enjoying.i did learn just bout everything that u could bout working in a retail store.it is a great place to work and shop
good,depending on the store all moral is different but i had a great experience there for majority of the time that i worked there. management changed our store became a franchise store and things started really changing from the Rona culture.
good,"Target's culture is very team and collaborative focused, and they pride themselves on creating an enjoyable work environment. Target's commitment to personal development is very engaging, and they create future leaders quickly for those up to the challenge."
good,"Target Abbotsford demonstrated a very positive work environment, one which many of our guests would comment on on a daily basis. Being part of that team and that environment was a wonderful experience. Despite it's recent closure, I can honestly say that I have had consistently good experiences during my employment with Target."
good,"a typical day at work i would be working in the warhouse stocking product and organizing backstock according to type of merchandise ( deco,home,sports,toys,acc,ect) loved working ther easy going but hard working team overall great job"
good,Target is going through a very significant time of transition. I enjoyed my time there and look forward to seeing where the company goes in the future.
good,Good company to work for.  Expect high expectations and hard work.  The job can be very rewarding with lots of growth potential.  The job is very structured with many Leaders overseeing you creating undo stress at times.  Do more with less attitude!
good,The best part of working at Target was who you get to work with. Everyone brought their full talents to work and it was a joy meeting and working with so many widely talented and versatile people.
good,"pay could be better, could have more hours, expect us to accomplish things that we can not in the amount of time given. hardest part is getting everything done in what little amount of time they give. coworkers are always there to help."
good,I really loved working for Target.My background was really suitable and set me up for a great position at the company. If I did not have to travel that much I think I would still be working for the company and advanced through different positions there.
good,One of the most enjoyable aspects about working at Target was the clean environment. It was very nice to see a clean store every time I walked in with satisfied customers. The management was always very nice and flexible.
good,"I really enjoyed working with the independent contractors and helping them to do the best possible job for the client."
good,"* Denotes : If you plan on having them as your JOB choice , not career"
good,Completed daily work assignments. I wrote assignments to the employees on my team. I assisted customers. I got along well with co-workers. The hardest part of the job was working nights and weekends. I enjoyed working with people.
good,Target is busy work day. you learn a lot about different cultures. The hardest part is the unpleasant quest. The most enjoyable part is pleasing the quest.
good,My job heavily involved stocking merchandise on shelves before store hours. Wonderful and entertaining coworkers helped to make days not feel so tedious. Management easy to work and get along with.
good,"Met a lot of interesting people at Target. "
good,"Primary requirement of the job requires keying data into the system. Apart from keying the data in the system i also train, guide and mentor new Team members in the team. The software that i am well versed with is SAP HR. The work environment is an important factor that i am looking forward to and at target that is at its best."
good,Great vibes everybody works with a smile on their face. Everybody is willing to help one another. Co workers are always there to brighten your day just to make the shift flow a lot smoother
good,"Overall Target is a great company, they make amazing products and generally you work with very talented people. They only hire the best so the young talent is particularly impressive. They have made some poor choices in the last 5 years but I firmly believe the direction they are headed currently is going to get them back on top. The full package (benefits, pay, etc) is pretty average, nothing impressive unless you are headhunted and some experience under your belt."
good,"I had left the medical field for a while to focus on my own health, so Target gave me a chance to take some time for myself. Most of the managers there were so caring and understanding about my new medical diagnosis and accommodated well. The environment is a fun place to work, and there were always compliments being given out. Communication could have been better, but I think the overall goals for the day were met because of a hard working staff."
good,I oversee a team of 50 people who work together to accomplish daily and weekly goals that help the company drive sales. I manage multiple processes on a daily basis. I truly enjoy the people I work with and meeting the challenges to reach our goals.
good,A typical day includes punching in and getting equipment. After I would usually head to the back where all the item pulling is done. After pulling out the items we will then head to the floor and start stocking.
good,"Shifts 5-12 hours, great crew, management very hard to work with, co workers were amazing, high paced and not enough managers"
good,Overall good place of employment. It was especially good for me because I gained a lot of warehouse experience and learned to work well with others at a fast pace.
good,"- 9 to 5 with a great work/life balance"
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job, were the people.  I really got to know others and we encouraged each other on the job.  I really liked helping when needed.  It was challenging in that way, always something new."
good,"A Day at work involves a busy flow, of customers, looking for a variety of products. Being able to keep up with answering questions, and giving the best advice on product knowledge is a must. Most enjoyable part would be meeting new people and the happiness you can provide for them when they find something in which they were looking for."
good,cest un travail qui ma beaucoup plus nous travaillions dans un  environnement agreable . Employeur comme travailleur  etais aimable.
good,"This is the one of the best retailers to work for. The work life balance isn't the best, but that is just the nature of the retail business. You go into it knowing that you will work long hours, weekends and holidays. Target does well to compensate you for those with pay as well as time off. The co-workers are great for the most part, as in any job you will have a few that you do not like as much as the others. The best part of the job is getting to go home every day knowing that you got things accomplished."
good,a great experience in retail. fast paced. customer service driven. coworkers were great and we had lots of fun. i enjoyed working with different teams and learning various jobs through cross training.
good,Fast paced yet has a huge turnover rate because of the lack of hours they give you. Its a fun place to work but can get frustrating with the lack of training you receive.
good,This job has been and is a fun environment to be a part of. It has challenging requirements but is worth the hard work. The management is ok and is definitely there to help you through your everyday activities.
good,Target is a very good company to work with. The management training is very intensive and detail oriented. It prepares me as an individual to be ready for a great performance. The benefits are awesome.
good,Undergoing large transformational change.  Shifting priorities to become an omnichannel retailer.  Lots of change.  Fast fun and friendly place to work.
good,"Target has a great work environment and my coworkers were all friendly and willing to help if needed. The management also did a great job handling their responsibilities of the customers, employees, and the store."
good,Great company culture--everyone is polite and 'Minnesota Nice' but sometimes that can mean issues and problems are not confronted. Good work life balance--ideal for families
good,"Target is a busy business. I learned that you have to be a friendly, fast person to do your job well. My co-workers and I worked has a team. The hardest part of my job was not having enough time in the day to finish your work but good team member's always help out. the most enjoyable part of my job was helping my guest and team members."
good,Big on development opportunities including promotions pay grade level increases. Opportunities to learn multiple facets of the business
good,great benefits and as an employee you are union.  Sales goals are difficult to reach and commission changes every year. Pay is very good
good,"Lower level management is fantastic.  Lots of opportunities for new experiences if you are not afraid of change.  Compensation is based on what salary you joined the company with, so those that are promoted a lot are usually behind the curve as far as compensation is compared with others in your same pay grade/job family."
good,It is a nice place to work. I enjoyed the time that I worked there. It was something to enjoy everyday. From greeting customers to setting up displays. Management was very easy to get along with and knew there job.
good,the most enjoyable part of the job was finding that guest that you knew was totally lost in the store. Approaching the guest and helping them find what they were looking for was such a great feeling.
good,"Target is a company that really takes care of it's employees.  At the sales floor level, most employees are younger and in either high school or college.  It's easy to make friends and really get along with the people you work with, which makes the job fun.  Some of the day-to-day duties can be tedious and boring, but working with your friends makes the time go by quickly.  Managers are approachable and easy to get along with and always offer support.  Pay is competitive and benefits are good."
good,"Target has a great culture and is very fun and fast moving.  There is a high focus on personal development, with a multitude of classes and seminars available."
good,A typical work day could be described as slow or hum drum to really busy and hectic. I have learned to be extra productive on the slow days as well as level headed and focused on the busy ones. The majority of management is well seasoned and effective while others just require a little more experience. My co-workers are extremely friendly and patient not to mention experienced and dedicated. The hardest part of the job would have to be working on a busy night while being understaffed. The most enjoyable part would be a guest saying that you were the highlight of their day.
good,"Pros - Friendly co-workers, Fair pay, and great culture."
good,"Greatest Company I ever worked for.. disappointing they didn't let us finish what we started.."
good,The Target Corp mission remains the same. A superior shopping experience and products to keep our guests satisfied and loyal to shopping with Target
good,"•	Set up offshore /onsite team and deliver large end to end programs & projects."
good,"A typical day could have been chaotic but with strategic planning and the right team it was an enviornment of fast fun and friendly team work that consisted all 40-60 team members to achieve a common goal."
good,"A typical work day at target was very enjoyable but filled with work. I got along with all of my coworkers, the management were very friendly and helpful when needed. The hardest part is dealing with multiple customers at once and also dealing with attitudes. The most enjoyable part is working with a team that can help succeed in all projects and we accomplish all that needs to be done."
good,"Target est une entreprise formidable qui offre beaucoup d'avantages à ses employés. Malheureusement, comme vous le savez tous , Target fermera sous peu, donc je suis présentement à la recherche d'un nouvel emploi ... "
good,"Ensuring that each customer receives outstanding service by providing afriendly environment, which includes greeting and acknowledging every customer, maintaining solid product knowledge and all other aspects of customer service was a pleasure for me . I enjoy working with people and seeing them walk out of the store with a smile on there faces was an  accomplished mission for me every time ."
good,come in and unload truck. go to my station and stock shelves and when finish help other coworkers. after  finishing stocking we go back and level shelves to make the product look nice and neat.
good,I was really satisfied with my job until Target decided to leave Canada. I can say that it is one of the best retail organizations to work for with great culture and people with great attitude.
good,"Boa empresa para trabalhar, fornecem apoio quando o colaborador precisa, os colaboradores da sede preocupam-se com a resolutividade dos problemas nos terminais. A equipe está coesa e unida com o objetivo de oferecer um bom serviço para o cliente exigente (petrobras)"
good,"From the beginning, Target Mobile offered me plenty of opportunity for advancement. I started with the company as a sales rep and within 4 months I received a promotion to Sales Manager & now also district team leader."
good,"Target is a great company to work for. The team I worked with were amazing. We had daily huddles to talk about events happening, what we needed to work on and recognizing team members for achieving goals and doing a great job helping customers."
good,Working at Target was a fun experience for me.  I have never worked in retail before but working there taught me the ins and outs of retail business.  Helping customers with their needs and keeping my produce section cleaned and stocked brought me great joy.  Management was helpful and gave you the tools you needed to get your job done.  The co-workers varied from old to young but all were professional and kind.  The hardest part of the job is opening up your paycheck and seeing what you couldn't buy or afford because they pay you so little it brings tears to your eyes.  The sadness of seeing such little pay for such hard work would make you think that pan handling on the street corner would bring you more money.
good,As GSA at Target I can say I thoroughly appreciate the experience I've gained. Anytime I need help or advice I could look to fellow team members to be there. This job has allowed me to meet and engage socially with many different people. Target makes people happy!
good,"Overall, a typical day was well flowed. Although the management team could slack on providing efficient methods of completing work the best. The environment was diverse and easy to be a part of the team. The most difficult part of the job was having to team leaders trying new methods, thou it's great we had a really tough time completing the task in the set amount of time. Yesterday's work would pass onto the next day."
good,"A day at work"
good,Target is very team based and makes you feel like you are part of one giant family while working. I learned how to be a more professional person at target and also how to be a leader that got me to where I am working today.
good,"J'aime ça comme emploi, mais le seul inconvénient c'est que je n'ai pas assez d'heure pour subvenir à mes besoins, malheureusement j'en demande, mais il ne m'en donne pas.."
good,"If you work at Target, you definitely work in a positive environment. A typical day at work would be where you carry out tasks given to you or what's left to do from the day before. I learned how to work in a team, and how to put the customer's needs before my own. Management there was always helpful and willing to work with you with things like your schedule and compensation depending on your work performance. My co-workers were cool to be around and it made for a good work environment. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the flow of traffic we'd get and getting some things done on time. Sometimes you stay over later until it gets done if you close on a night shift. The most enjoyable parts were the events they had whenever something special was going on."
good,"I love working here, great people and Guests.  would be good if there were more hours available during the work week.  Benefits are good, flexible work hours and fast, fun and friendly environment"
good,"Great Management good training towards learning different parts of the store. Questions about items in the store or general questions about work are answered fast by other team members, ELT'S  or Team Leads. Target Makes me feel like I'm someone not just a worker and treat's me more like family then Wal Mart  dose and Target cares more about you as an individual and your family then Wal Mart."
good,"The job is very comfortable. The people are nice and fun to be around. The management are pleasant enough, but are very financially oriented. The job can be difficult. Hour cuts cause stress and less than comfortable work environment. Benefits are very good."
good,"My day starts at 09:30 AM and end mostly by 08:30 PM . Involved in People Management , Customer Handling , Escalation handling , Brining new business , and off course learning lot ."
good,love that this job had meetings before the start of a work day also give thanks on how everyone works on each shift and accomplishments that we achieve and need to achieve.
good,"I work overnight shift from 9pm until 8am sometimes until 10am. I learned from this job is how to communicate with your boss, helping other team members. My bosses are very professionalism. My co-workers are very helpful. The hardest part of my job is to use a wave(machine to lift you up) and go up in the sealing to hang  a Marketing Signs and also to remove old signs and put new ones. I really enjoy this job because of the flexible time they giving me and a lot of nice people in my team."
good,"Overall a good place to work. Not good for people who do not like change, as things are always changing."
good,Great place to work. Even in the crazy mayhem of the holidays the store always manages to look amazing.
good,A typical day starts off simple with unloading our trucks and placing new inventory on the floor. I've learned the inside of retail and the process of how the store operates from an employee view. The management is overall genuine and there for the support of the team. I enjoy being apart of a growing team and ensuring the shelves are fully stocked so the customers can have an excellent shopping experience.
good,"Working at Target company is a good opportunity if you're a student or needing a little extra money on the side. Their are not enough hours to go around but enough if you are a student or part time, they do have great benefits towards education, and health care if your full time."
good,While employed there I learned how to really work as a team and it was a great place to learn customer service skills
good,Not a bad a palce to work. Chance for advancement. Applying is easy. Low pay
good,I had a great time working for the company. My manager was fun always understanding willing to help in anyway she can willing to give you overtime if needed. Straight forward and Strict when needed to be. I typically came in at 11pm and worked through the night. I unpacked to items off the truck and put them in the area of sale. if there was a new product me and a few other members would set up the display and the pricing. I learned what it was like to work in the retail field. I learned to respect them and the job they do. The best part was that we were allowed to work on our own with out strict supervision and the co-worker who were able to get everything done in a timely manner. The hardest part was adjusting your sleeping pattern to fit with the schedule you had and the lack of individual recognition.
good,"	Utilizes company tools to diagnose opportunities and develops action plans to improve performance "
good,"Coworkers were amazingly fun to be with but the job itself, well it's fast food is it not so what do you expect? The management was fair and a typical day was almost the same as any other."
good,"Its a fast,fun and friendly place to work. If you enjoy working hard and volunteering then I can't think of no other place better. There are lots of job advancement opportunities and too take full advantage I would suggest getting your college degree. It 's a place where that piece of paper can make the difference between $ 20,000 or 60,000 for the same amount of work."
good,It was a good work place and I gained a lot of experience being that it was my first job.
good,"As a Target employee I do not receive many hours or great pay. However, the Managers are friendly and respect the work done by the employees. As well there is a good working relationship between co-workers."
good,getting to meet new people and learning new things on the job and working as a team in a fun friendly fast paced  company and to get the work done as fast as possible by giving very friendly and courteous  service  and do the best you can do.
good,i stocked the backroom with the overflow from the floor. My co-workers were kinda lazy but we got it done.I learned that some people get special treatment. Management was very helpful. Hardest part was not having enough equipment to do the job at hand. I enjoyed working with all the young employee's..
good,I learned a lot from Target Corp. with learning how to set up a store to my leadership style. The management team really worked well with one other and making everyone fell part of the team.
good,"A typical day at work would be supervisor cashiers. Check guests out of the till and work in guest service."
good,"I love working at the Target Distribution Center, I work with a great group of people, though, management leaves something to be desired."
good,"Close knit team,everyone has everyone""s back,You can depend on team members and leads if their is a problem"
good,"On a typical day, I did a lot of counting. It was a fun job and I worked with really great people."
good,"This  a hard job if you don't know what you're doing."
good,"Working at Target is always fun. The team members are very nice and friendly, its busy but with all the team members the work load is equal and its easy work."
good,In this position I perfected my customer service skills and how to be as helpful as possible in every situation. I improved significantly on operating the cash register. I learned how to perform my job as quickly and efficiently as possible but I also learned how to seek help when needed. The hardest part of the job is keeping your speed up to reduce waiting and long lines but the co workers were always willing to help.
good,Very nice places to work for but some managers are very sexist.
good,"Have always enjoyed my time working at target, through high school and in college. Management has always been great, either holding employees accountable or coaching them to be better."
good,"Specific core rolls were very prompt and clear everyday"
good,"I would either cashier or go get carts from outside. the management was great, they cared about you and what you were going through. my coworkers were also fun to be around and they worked hard. hardest part about this job was getting carts outside in the summer."
good,A nice place to work.  It wasn't that hard fast paced. The coworkers were kind and were very helpful.
good,A typical day at Target is productive as well as fun. All of my co-workers are positive and outgoing. The hardest part of being at target is the hours not being consistent. Target will sometimes provide me with 40 hours and sometimes none. For the most part Target is a great place to work with a lot of great people.
good,I liked Target. The customers were so thankful and they showed it greatly and told your supervisor. My co-workers were very helpful and you got some pretty good benefits working there like 10% off for being an employer I didn't get good communication with my supervisor but in the end we always found a way to fix it. There was nothing hard about the job except for probably figuring out your lunch hours.
good,"What I have learned from working at Target is to be a forward thinking Leader with a demonstrated ability to drive business forward, achieve results, motivate teams to achieve excellence, and establish a culture that drives for continuous improvement."
good,"- A typical day of work for the service desk is a bit monotone. You do much of the same every day. However, I feel as if it is a lot more rewarding than being a cashier. You are able to help guests learn more, and assist with their needs better. "
good,"Take customer orders, answer emails and phones, completed jobs in a timely manner.  I learned various aspects in printing and graphic design, how to create price quotes within the company's profit margin, clearing copyright materials, and the steps of notarizing legal documents.  I was able to initiate and complete many different jobs throughout the day and monitor my co-workers in the completion of additional projects in the store."
good,"My time with the Target Corporation was very challenging and rewarding. To gather a team together with the motivation and passion  for the processes needed to succeed in a fast paced ever changing environment."
good,Not a bad job for part time. Get a 15min break and lunch after your done working or just go home.
good,"Environnement de travail agréable, "
good,Learned so much working at Target. I loved the job just not the hours. If you want a job in retail I would highly recommend it.
good,The hardest part of the job was getting the numbers before the end of shift. the best part was having this job.
good,"Target is a company that has a mentality of ""The Strength of Many the Power of One"".  You go and have fun with your team while delivering results."
good,A typical day at Target includes servicing guest to the best of your ability.
good,i enjoyed my time working here. there were not enough hours to go around though.
good,"I found that I enjoyed going to work. The team was hard working. It had a positive environment and everyone seemed to like being there. "
good,"We would have a group huddle right at the beginning to discuss our daily goals and targets, recognize team members from previous day, stretch, then prepare to unload truck. After the truck has been unloaded and merchandise properly place in correct locations, the team begins to distribute merchandise to proper aisles. After that task has taken place, the portion of the team begin to place merchandise onto proper shelving and hangers. We continuously repeat this procedure until everything is correctly in place. During this procedure we would maintain cleanliness and proper storing procedures. I learned how to use power equipment. The management team is amazing; very friendly and can effectively communicate with the team. The co-workers bring energy and life to the work place. Everyone was very entertaining, friendly and most importantly productive. The hardest part of the job would probably be the use of new equipment, even the simplest equipment such as the ""patel jack."" The most enjoyable and most accomplishing feeling would be finishing ahead of schedule and being able to come up with or fix minor projects, tasks and assignments by the team."
good,"Target was a nice place to work as a seasonal hire. I was a sales associate so I had the main duties of a regular associate, in addition to cashier. The only difficult part was selling the RED cards to customers, because the managers really look at how well you are effective in your selling techniques to each person. Co-workers are friendly and respectable to each other."
good,amazing workers and fun and clean environment ill work there again
good,"Learned a lot of new things, staff was kept well informed. Family owned business."

good,"I loved working with the team I had when I worked with Target. Target was a grate place for me to grow and learn about customer service, and team work."
good,"I have been in two different departments working for Target. In in-stocks, my day began with scanning and locating products. I have to scan each and every item row to row to confirm product counts and keep them available to customers. Soon followed up with assisting guest to their needs. In logistics, I start off on moving the stocks in the backroom to the sales floor as ordered. Then it comes on a hour basis depending on the sales. While I process the orders, I am back-stocking items that returns to me due to overstock on sales floor or other problems. My team in both of these departments work at a very fast and fun manner. I had a great experience working with multiple managers and learning the process of each and every department. I enjoy helping guest a lot, especially when I can answer all of their questions. Feeling smart is amazing!"
good,I helped students find there book and stuff they needed for college. I also did some advertising.
good,"Very fast working environment, you get to work with great people and if you ever need help someone is always there for help. over all fun place to work at. A typical day would be finding out who you work with and getting excited to see certain people, love the fast movement all day defiantly keeps you busy. Being my first time in retail I learned a lot how to deal with different situations and how to solve them. management is always there to help, very friendly makes you feel welcomed. what I enjoy most working there is seeing different faces and some come through my line just because they like how friendly and fast I was defiantly makes me feel like I am doing something right."
good,"i liked cooking, taking orders,seeing customers satisfied,keeping target clean in food avenue"
good,"Protect and serve"
good,"- Plenty of room for advancement"
good,"Can be a blast to work for ."
good,"the day was always filled with something new, people were great to work with, and room for advancements."
good,"Working within a large H.R. Department advising managers on employee related issues."
good,I would have worked at Target longer but the hours just weren't there.
good,"From the Executive level of management down to the store level, the business plan is transparent and accessible. Community involvement is a huge part of the culture and personal support is amazing."
good,short shifts work with great people.  this job is a great place to work if only for the people you work with.
good,"I work with the overnight crew stocking merchandise for daytime customers. In working with Target, I have learned to work in an environment where people love to help one another. I have also learned some customer shopping techniques in order to drive store sales and also operate different equipment machines.  I have worked with some very good managers who value my work efforts consistently.  My coworkers are nice and understand that we are in the work place to complete desired work tasks.  The most difficult part about my job is unloading merchandise off of the truck because so many pieces have to be removed in a specified time frame.  The most enjoyable is stocking the store shelves and placing items where they belong."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working at Target. Friendly management, cooperative team members. Diverse Customers. Overall great place to work!"
good,As a Target team member I have been able to hone my communication in a fast pace environment.  I was also able to use my organization and multitasking skills to perform efficiently with target ever changing demands.
good,"working at target was fun, as long as you enjoy helping the public."
good,"I worked here the longest out of all my jobs. It was a good place to work, but hours were very hard to come by."
good,"I worked at the coffee bar daily and sometimes on the sales floor."
good,Very clean and coworkers are like family.  Activities monthly to make you feel appreciated.
good,Just do what is asked show up on time come in to work. Dont get into trouble and everything will work out.
good,I worked in every department during my time there. The skills I wasa blke to learn here have helped me in every one of the jobs i have had since.
good,"Overall, awesome experience working for a company that fostered personal development and presented numerous opportunities for growth. This is a big-box retail environment, which does negatively impact work/life balance"
good,"A normal day at work would consist of executing go-backs, then jumping into zone (making the store look good), or detail zoning a specific area. Sometimes you have to go up front to backup cashier also. I learned SO much here. I gained more skill on how to drive sales, but learned how to work in the backroom and on the floor, how to research items and how to make aisles look more full the right way. My co-workers were fun, everyone gets along fine and even if there is a problem between someone you wouldn't even know. The hardest part of the job is when there is a call-out and there are few (or only yourself) on the sales floor. All of the work to do is put onto you and it can get very stressful, but it is balanced out with the most enjoyable part of the job being able to just hang out with your guests and always being recognized for your hard work."
good,Target in all honesty is a good job to have. I learned plenty of interesting and helpful information that can be used time and time again. Everyone there always maintained a good level of professionalism. I didn't remain there long enough so getting into a lot of detail is not possible. So I'll end with this Target is a good job but not a career.
good,Its an honest and fair place as any. I enjoy the people and the management. Chance to meet new people with each new day. Always an opportunity to take advantage.
good,"Target in Apple Valley is a great place to work. All the staff are very friendly. The hours are flexible to fit your needs. They are a very friendly family oriented work place. I learned about more foods that I never knew existed. The hardest part of the job is learning the produce codes, however managed with time. Meeting so many nice and dedicated people (customers)."
good,Being new to the area at the time my co-workers were very welcoming to help me learn more of the area and of the workplace
good,"I had a great experience working at Target. The compensation is extremely low, but the workplace is very nice, and the people are great."
good,"Maintain sales floor."
good,"I LOVED working for Target, I love to interact with the guests and I loved helping them find what they are looking for. Everyone I worked with was always willing to help or give helpful advice on how to further myself or do a job a bit faster or better. Great on working with whatever schedule you currently have and there were always friendly people to work with."
good,"Seasonal positions in Target requires quite a more hours, even some late shifts, however there isn't ever a dull moment. Your day begins at your shift where you're assigned a register and given a precise time to take your breaks. The days never feel long since you're almost always busy ringing out a guest with their shopping carts filled with goodies and toys for the children. "
good,"A typical day on the sales floor starts by putting out the re-shop for the area you're scheduled in. It continues by zoning your area and finishes by putting out another round of re-shop. While you are doing this you may be called on to back up the cashiers at the registers. After you finish your assigned area you may be asked to help your teammates finish in their areas.Target is a very team based work environment. Everybody helps in all areas. Management does too."
good,Such a great company for recent graduates. A great place to learn leadership skills and earn a great living doing it.
good,"It was a pretty basic job, but for the most part I enjoyed it. It was really the co-workers that made it for me though, I appreciated the people that I worked with. The lower down management was fantastic, I loved every single one of my supervisors. The hardest part of the job would be when there was too much or too little for the limited staff to do. Sometimes the backrooms would get so full you couldn't get products out of the back and there were carts of products lining the aisles. Other times there was very little stock to put out so we were forced to compromise, putting over stock out into the aisles, if it turned out to be a full aisle of microwaves, Nutribullets, or air conditioners, it didn't really matter. But other then that, I really loved the culture that they promoted, and the fact that they fed us on a regular basis."
good,"I learned how to move faster, stock trucks real tightly with products from left to right The hardest part was getting materials in order so they want get jammed"
good,"An ordinary day at Target is very simple. The LOD gives you multiple tasks so you are always busy, which is a good thing for me because I like staying busy. It helps time go by faster. The management is great. They are constantly on top of everything and giving off positive attitudes and encouraging the employees. The co-workers are great as well. We are constantly doing everything we can to help each other. The hardest part about the job is usually when the store is busy and many of us have to multitask between our guests and your duty, but our guests always come first. The most enjoyable part about the job is at the end of the day after a crazy busy day, or just a regular day, everyone gets together to help make the store look presentable and we all still find a way to smile."
good,Target can't keep a manager longer then 6 mouths because of how hard they push them and the consistent changes happening.
good,Target is  a good place to work. One of the benefits of working retail is that you get a employee discount off clearance . Normally the work with your schedule just let them know when you need time off or trade schedules with someone.
good,"A typical day of work was unloading the truck. We had associates unloading the truck then different associates pulling the pallets out to the floor while we worked the truck. After the truck was done we would work the grocery department, then move to another section of the store as directed. i learned a lot about the store and the working environment. management was fairly young and mostly women. They treated the associates with respect and didn't hesitate to jump in and help us if we needed it. My co-workers were usually all split up except at lunch. It was more of a solitary working environment on most days. The hardest part of my job was line we unloading the boxes from. we never really had enough associates to make the line run smoothly. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to have conversations and talk to associates that weren't all that different from myself."
good,"Working a target was an enjoyable experience. They were very big on team work and doing things as a team. My coworkers there were very friendly and nice when I first started helping to make settling into the team easier. I started my shift at 4am unloading the trailer and stocking the shelves. The most enjoyable part of this job was my team, my coworkers. The hardest part of this job was being unable to receive a steady schedule."
good,Target is a great example in team work. Everyone works together to get goals accomplished. I love when target gives recognition for a great performance of their team members. I also like that we call our customers guest instead of customers. I believe it makes people feel more welcomed. Target also works well with students to fit their schedule. The hardest part of the job is getting customers to apply for our target debit/credit cards.
good,"A typical day at work included answering phone calls, helping customers in the fitting rooms/floor with finding items they needed, Helping check out customers when the store got busy, nightly closing announcement."
good,Great manage but pay was ok i learned how treat customers with well respected.
good,"Each day brings you a new challenge to take on. The company has a great, strong culture built on teamwork and a focus on the guest. Working side-by-side with your team is the most enjoyable part of the job and you have the opportunity to learn new things all the time."
good,"* help as many guest find what they are looking for while completing my assigned areas."
good,"In the dynamic and rapidly evolving world of mass retail, Target offers a fast paced work environment where young professionals are entrusted to run multi billion dollar businesses."
good,"not a bad company to work for, but some of the stores need work, low management"
good,"Love the work just long hours."
good,"Friendly management, Friendly coworkers, great pay for entry level position.  Day usually began with setting up register, helping coworkers with various tasks up front and sometimes in the backroom.  I learned a few more ways to handle customers, the register and coworkers that could help in the future.  Hardest part of the job was managing long lines and angry customers, but the most enjoyable part was the friendly staff."
good,"A typical day at work included partnering and communicating with managers about what duties needed to be accomplished in my work shift. After, I assessed the work load that was given to me, and began planning and prioritizing what needed to get accomplished. By the end of the evening, I voluntarily provided management with a write-up of everything that had been accomplished that shift. "
good,"Target was a good company to work for.  Change is inevitable and part of the culture.  If you're resistant to change, Target may not be your best fit.  Target has high expectations, but not unrealistic ones."
good,"Good place to work for extra cash, mostly part time workers. Management is friendly and caring about people while still being professional"
good,"There is no typical work day at Target as a Team Lead. Priorities shift by the hour, unforeseen events occur and just never know what the day will bring. I enjoy the fast pace environment and juggling multiple task while motivating and leading my team towards success. The management is supportive and hands on, which makes the job even better. I learned a lot about myself as a Team Lead. The professional and personal development showed me my strengths and opportunities for improvement."
good,"I learned a lot about logistics and plan-o-grams and how to merchandise products to get the most attention from customers."
good,A typical day at work was going in doing stretches. then naming the work place you would be in that day. then you would be given so many trucks to load to hit your percentage they want. I learned how to stack boxes and how to use a scan gun. The management was nice there. The hardest part of the job was keeping up. The most enjoyable part of the day was breaks.
good,"I never knew before I worked in retail how much it takes to run a business that deals with heavy traffic like Target. It strives on making everyone that walks through there doors feel like a guest. I moved up fast from sales to a merchandiser, handling a team and making sure the areas I ran were up to shoppers expectations. I love dealing in customer service and helping people find what they need."
good,Wonderful management always had your back when it came to extraordinary ideas in reference to the company.
good,"My typical day at work consisted of cleaning workspace, prepping food for the baker the next day, cleaning dishes, helping customers with finding products, writing cake orders, and putting product on the floor as well as helping as a cashier. Also helped cut fruit and put product out for Produce, and helped cut meat as well as close Deli. I learned how to work at a good pace to get everything done in the amount of time I had as well as help other areas. I learned how to decorate cakes as well. Management was great and my co-workers were great as well. They were helpful if I was falling behind, or getting advice on the best way to fix things. The hardest part of the job, well that was when I was helping some customers who had attitudes, but I kept a smile on my face and did what I could to give the customer what they wanted. I loved being able to help decorate cakes and cupcakes. That was so much fun, especially to see the happy faces of the customers. Always made my day."
good,"Working at Target was like extended School Time, in the fact that I got to go from being with friends at school my age to being with more friends at work that were my age.  The manager of the Customer Service area was always making work fun for all of us employees.  Working at Target, I felt like I was really part of a Family more than just being fellow employees."
good,"I enjoyed working at target because I had daily face to face interaction with everyone, I felt it was my duty to have each person feel as one and be heard ."
good,"I unloaded a truck, stocked shelves, and set up planograms (which I learned how to do there).  My planogram manager was terrific, expected the best out of you and got it, the truck manager on the other hand was pretty bad...  I made a lot of friends at the job even though I wasn't always around people.  Truck was the most strenuous thing I did there and the thing I got the least credit for.  The friends I made were the best part about that job."
good,As an extern student i got to learn a few skills due to the fact the location this target was located in was pretty busy. Got to have hands on in filling prescriptions pretty quickly but accurate and carefully. Co-workers had a lot of experience and helped me out on things i wasn't that familiar with.
good,Good job for a college student who needs flexible hours. You're able to request your own hours which is great if you have class. Coworkers were good. Management was okay.
good,"The Lisbon Target is a overall good company to be a participating team member with. I say there Security and Employment benefits meet standard requirements. Management was well structured, and culture commendable. I am happy to have been involved in benefiting and sharing this corporations  experience and beliefs with loyal and on coming guests."
good,"unloading the truck, sorting the cases all over the store then stocking the product, clean all the store help guest, talk to ETL"
good,"Great place to work, amazing culture. The most organized well run business I have every been part of. They take career development to the next level,"
good,Good place to learn how to run a retail store.  Everything is on the forefront and other companies copy what you do.
good,"The team I was a part of comes in at 6:00 am to unload the trucks.  Most of us even though it is fairly early are in a good mood and everyone works hard.  There is some heavy lifting required especially in the furniture section but I like it because it helps me stay active.  you are always on your feet and walking around.  If you get a job here make sure you are open to cross-training for example I'm trained to work on the Flow Team, back-stocking, as a cashier, and I'm being trained to work in reverse logistics very soon.  EVERY employee is cashier trained even the managers.  For me the hardest part of my job is working in the clothing section it's a little confusing to work in.  One of my managers is a little short tempered but it's only because they're stressed about deadlines.  I always enjoy hopping onto the cash lanes and talking to guests (customers) and making sure they had a good experience shopping at Target.  I highly recommend working here most days I love my job."
good,Just a typical day at work I was responsible for opening up an area so guest can be served with everything they needed. preparing everything that was for the most part pre-set and some thing weren't. I handled guest in my area as well as answering the phone and putting up orders that came in and placing. I also trained other employees to work independently in our area.
good,This is a great place to work. I am looking for more hours to cover my college costs.
good,"A typical day at work at Target as a sales associate or cashier basically just involves helping customers all day. One really great thing about Target is that if a customer complains about you to management, they will back you up no matter what and give you the benefit of the doubt."
good,"i didn,t care to work 3rd shift. i loved my manger and my co-workers. lots of laughter and good time. always had something different to do every night. although sometimes i struggle to get the shelves in , my manger was there to help out. we were all team players and helped each other out. i left the company because i wasn,t making enough money. other than that everything was good."
good,"Typical day includes:"
good,"I've been working for Target about 3 months so I've got a pretty good idea of what it's like now. If you like routine, you'll like flow team. Every morning I get up at 2:45 a.m., get ready, get to work, get punched in by 4:00, and head to my place on the line to sort merch from the truck. Then we go through the same rotation every morning stocking shelves with said merch. I actually like it because all my co-workers are really nice and my team leads are awesome too."
good,Target is one of the better places to work if you are into retail sales.They have great employee incentives and with the right mgr made being a team member there was a great experience.
good,Work flow is relatively heavy and that would be what I enjoy the most about this job because it keeps me engaged all day long. The least enjoyable part is probably working inside the freezer where the temperature is well below 0 F and it becomes uncomfortable within just few minutes. Everyone in the store has a great attitude and are respectful towards one another. The management is lenient and flexible with everyone's needs or requests. This position has allowed me to improve my productivity and organizational skills. Overall I enjoy working in an environment with high ethical standards.
good,My typical day as with any would be to say hello to my team members. This was a seasonal temporary assignment. I would say it was like fun helping and assisting customers over the Christmas and new year holiday. It was challenging organizing the store for the next day but we got the job done with team work.  I really enjoyed working here and learned a lot about marketing of a product through sales and customer service and I definitely enjoyed the guest they where very nice.
good,"I really enjoyed my job. I had a very supportive exec team as well as store manger. However, it was difficult to have a family with this job. I was paid as a team lead when I did an executives job. This was the only upsetting part of the job. I enjoyed the team and going to work everyday. I was able to calm guests down as well as team members who were upset. I had an open door policy that the team utilized on a daily basis."
good,"A typical day at work would be cashiering, zoning my lane, and working the guest service counter. I have learned a lot about customer service and how to talk to several different types of guest, moods and personalities. I get along well with pretty much all my coworkers. Although management can get busy, it is good. the hardest part of the job would be offering the ""Redcard"" to every guest, and not getting discouraged when I am denied. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to meet so many new people every day, and getting those that come in just to see you."
good,"I had to stock shelves, counters and tables with merchandise. I learned how to stay awake at night during this shift. It was hard to manage life with this shift because i slept during the day and worked at night. Worked as a team with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was having to work at night."
good,"It is a nice place to work for students going to school.  I can not speak to how it is for upper management but as a student working with other students I enjoyed working, and my managers were also very nice.  They are very flexible with scheduling for students and will usually allow anytime you ask off."
good,"I can honestly say I didn't hate going to work there. One of the few reasons I left was because I wasn't learning skills that I could actually use at other jobs. Another reason was the specific title that I had for Target was a Cart Attendant. Although some of the duties weren't bad, other duties were absolutely unbearable. Whenever I asked to switch to a different department they always dismissed my request. My coworkers were the main reason why I stayed as long as I did."
good,Presentation isn't the easiest job but it's something that constantly keeps you busy. Every day we go in and set the planograms given for that week while also providing great customer service. I've learned a lot about time management and how to finish planograms as quickly and efficiently as possible.
good,"Management could be more people oriented"
good,"Hardlines is not an easy job but someone has to do it for the store to succeed. It is an integral part of the Store Culture."
good,"great place to work at, but only accepting seasonal workers when needed. no room for hire, or advancement."
good,"typical day at target is always interacting with guests from the beginning till the end of the shift."
good,Working at target was a great experience for me. All the team members were nice and all work together great. They definitely Made you feel like family working there.
good,"Bon travail et bon salaire, mais comme le magasin était nouveau il y a eu une baisse d'heure pour les employés. Journées agréable et bon  environnement de travail."
good,"A typical day at Target Distribution Center included stretching, warming up, then stacking boxes and running around all day/night. I learned how to use a pallet jack, juggle several tasks at once, and stack boxes in an orderly, safe fashion. My management team was poor and did not help with things like safety concerns and did not train us well. The hardest part of the job was the physical aspect of lifting boxes over and over and only getting about three seconds to touch each box from the conveyer belt to the truck. The company did not leave us adequate time to take water breaks (which are needed) or give extra time for mistakes or mishaps such as the conveyer belts getting clogged or merchandise broken. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping our teammates when they were falling behind or displaying a yellow light; indicating that they were moving too slowly."
good,"A great place to work where you can gain an immense amount of experience with leading a team, improving processes, and delivering what Target's guests want when they want it."
good,"Customer service, soft-lines, hard-lines, cashier, operator, price accuracy, instocks, cross-trained, PDA/ LPDA programs, Microsoft Excel, ad placements and take downs, adjacencies, merchandising, stocking, storing, inventory, computed accurate price changes and situations, etc."
good,"Working for Target was overall a wonderful experience. Unfortunately the seasonal position wasn't longer. You walk into work through a door with a code to insure safety which I did like, and then we had access to where we clock in, as well as a nice break area with plenty of tables and vending machines. Management was very pleasant, as well as the other employees. It was very fast paced, which I liked, and I caught on very quickly. I was given an award for customer service within the first 2 weeks of working there. The hardest part of the job, was having to stand in one spot for so long, but I really enjoyed working with people and seeing so many faces everyday."
good,"Over the past five years, I have grown tremendously as a leader at Target.  They have offered me fantastic growth opportunities both to grow personally but to also mentor others to grow and develop."
good,12 hours standing and moving consistently stacking boxes anywher
good,Was a great place to work! always being appreacated for hard work. It was all pretty easy flowing if you worked hard.
good,A very high tech process. Good place to learn new and unique skills. A large team reduces physical impact on individuals.
good,"A fun place to work at that was Fast, Fun and Friendly. A work environment that never made work look like work."
good,"Checking items, cleaning backroom, inventory checks. Learning about the supermarket industry and the way a store operates from inside out. Management is very supportive, firm and helpful. Co-workers are support and are real team players. Hardest part about working at Target is the laboring. Most enjoyable part was working with people who care about their establishment and the people they work alongside."
good,"I loved working here as a teen.  It showed me how to work my way from the bottom up!  As I got more involved it was harder to separate life from work, it was very time consuming."
good,"Good work environment, they have good work/life options."
good,A typical day at work is usually very productive in softlines always have something to adjust and make pretty for the next guest to see. At the register it is usually just stocking up the side shelves and trying to keep above 85% on speed when checking a guest out. I have sort of made it into a game. I have learned that there are different ways to go about speaking to guest in a retail store then there is in fast food. Guest like when you make them lough but at the same time when you have the knowledge to sort of guide them in the right place and choice of which item may be better. I love the people I work with they are all very pleasant to talk to you and will help you with something if you need it.
good,It is good for a Career in Retail right out of college. I have been a Sr. Team Leader for a year now. Fast paced environment. Great guest (customer) service experience.
good,"In my short time at Target Corporation i made many new friends and met a lot of new faces. The work was not too intense or fast paced; everyone got what needed to be done, done. However the company did have many rules and regulations regarding work procedures."
good,"My typical day is always a very busy day. ""So much to do so little time"" is how I feel most times. It all depends on what area I work that day to explain what my tasks are including Electronics, overnight flow, and softlines. The hardest part of my job would probably be that I always feel like there is more things to do or fix and not enough time in my shift. The best part about my job is that we offer treats and goodies in our break room which also has a huge TV, couches, old arcade game machines, and fun games like guitar hero and donkey kong. I would also have to say its kind of like a big family there and had the chance to make a lot of great lifetime friends."
good,"My day consisted of either unloading frozen palettes or keeping the food section organized. My co workers were awesome, but the management was very sub par. More of a high school environment among management."
good,"It's a nice friendly place to work I learned to scan boxes and pack products in boxes at a fast pace,,i got along with co-workers go, because it was a friendly place, the hardest of the job was, some days having bad work to work with ,but that was natural, some days good' some bad, the most enjoyable part of the day is when you getting your production and over.only worked 2months doing seasonal"
good,"A warm and friendly work space with professionals who smart and took care in there work"
good,"time went by quickly, never a dull moment. Lots of employee engagement activities, such as movie popcorn day, sundae day, etc."
good,"Though it was only for the summer months, I thoroughly enjoyed my employment at Target. Management was very helpful and flexible to the employee's needs, and regularly encouraged and praised employees as they worked hard and did well at their jobs. Team members in all departments were friendly and helpful, and it was a pleasure to work with them."
good,"This used to be a great company to work for, but in the last few years they have become overly focused on big profits and have begun to schedule fewer and fewer people, therefore, asking more and more of those who are scheduled. Hourly wages were once competitive where now they are not."
good,"There really wasn't any typical day, one day I would be in charge of a certain area of the sales floor and the next I would be on switchboard and then the next be in charge of the fitting room. "
good,"I very much enjoyed waking up every morning to go to work especially because I always had a fun time with the customers and co-workers. I liked being able to communicate with everyone as if they were family or friends. Sometimes it would be really slow or fast, but that never bothered me. The slow times gave me a chance to learn how to do something new like re-shop and soft lines."
