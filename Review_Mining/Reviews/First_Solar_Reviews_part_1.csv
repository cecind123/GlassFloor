rating,review
good,Well organized and fun place to work.  Good leadership.  Structured and process driven. work life balance.  work culture is open.  good benefits and onsite work out facilities.
bad,I can’t say anything good about this company. I saw very questionable behavior by management including shipping defective solar panels to avoid contract penalties.
bad,"Empresa no responsable con su personal"
bad,"This job is a joke since the layoff the supervisors are sketchy and will lie to your face about how the company is doing or going.The only way to get a promotion or a good raise is to be related or sleeping with your supervisor. No one is properly  trained on anything. They give jobs to people who aren't qualified for or have any knowledge of what the job is because someone in their family is hire"
bad,"My manager was a snotty rich white lady who looks 100 and is barely 50 I assume.  She took me off the project after I informed her I would be exploring opportunities elsewhere but I would give her my 2 week notice in advance, she terminated me the same day.  This was only after she would constantly call and check up on me which I didn't mind until she started talking to me like I was incompetent and always accused me of lying and not being in the office.  I shared an office with another employee who she was having an affair with, who was not my supervisor, yet she had him constantly checking on my whereabouts.  The world would be a better place without management being able to fire someone over her petty  power trips."
bad,It was ok did't like it so far good luck to everyone i think they don't have a clear vision nor a clear idea of what they are doing they should get rid of management
bad,spend more time at work then u do your family work hard no notice of what you do favorites picked amongest workers and bosses  people dont care their
bad,I really enjoyed working for First Solar Electric. I learned a lot of thing dealing with electricity while I was there and I worked with a lot of really nice and kind individuals.
bad,The job I performed for 8 years included testing and utilising equipment to determine product reliability. I found tah management lacked direction and the ability to organise their employees. Because of this it made for a very toxic work environment.
bad,"Do not waste your time. There is nothing positive about this company besides the fact that you get benefits pretty much right off the bat. There is no advancement,  just another boring line to be put on. The only people saying that this place is a good place to work are the liars that are making $150,000 a yr. And maybe some of the maintenance workers. This company doesn't care about you. They purposely open positions to favorites and yet post it for everyone. "
bad,"Repetitive work. Higher ups are not fit for their job, and only care about themselves.  Only a handful truly care about you as a worker. They will ask you to do “special projects”, but in reality it’s a bunch of hard back breaking labor for nothing in return besides getting to do something new. Would not recommend this company."
bad,Horrible communication and I repeat horrible communication. Long hours and overwork staff and training is more on you to learn than actually being trained by qualified individuals. A who you know and are friends/family too than actually care to hire qualified and motivated individuals.
bad,Slowed down and laid off employees than hired temps at a lower wage to replace them. I feel first solar could have gone about that in a totally different way.
bad,"Wrong policy for the company future. R&D is too empirical, not enough science. Solar market is tough and requires flexibility in manufacturing of solar panels particularly in terms of  size. No such adjustment in First Solar"
bad,"Ever since the ""mass layoff"" i have been struggling to find work! i wouldn't be in this position if i would have never gotten layed off thankyou!!!! Put in years just to get left to struggle!!"
bad,"Basically if you're lazy and just want to stand in one spot for 12 hours than this is the place for you. They don't really care for the general production employee they can easily find another body to watch glass roll down a conveyor. Awful forklift drivers and training program, witnessed at least a handful of accidents a week there. Maintenance team was average and would have you waiting forever before they showed up."
good,Well organized and fun place to work.  Good leadership.  Structured and process driven. work life balance.  work culture is open.  good benefits and onsite work out facilities.
bad,"I just recently been laid off from this company that I worked for, for 11 years. It didn't matter how long or how experienced you were on your job. The selection process was a joke!!"
bad,"You will learn that u r easily replaced. The pay was poor, with poor 35 cent raises. They say there's room to advance but good luck. It's who you know not what you know. Line workers were very unhappy but since it's a job people stay quite."
bad,"Always solving problems of different nature without a well established management approach that could benefit the company for future projects."
bad,Executive management would not listen to employees in an effort to save money and become more competitive. Executive management would/could not make a timely decision.
bad,"Will only advance if you kiss the right person's butt, or know the right person...as opposed to actually being qualified. Doesnt care about what you have happening outside of work as far as family emergencies, or birth of a child, just cares about the numbers. At one point was giving people a $1500 sign on bonus to leave their previous company to come there without giving a 2 week notice"
bad,If you care about anything other than money and benefits First Solar is not the place to work if you don’t have a degree. No options to move up in the company otherwise. Every single task is so easy it makes me want to blow my brains out. Lots and lots of downtime also. Just a mess.
bad,"Current working in FS"
bad,"The pay is quite poor.  They do not give raises to some employees for 16 months after hiring in and raises are always deficient.  Raises do not keep pace with cost of living.  Most employees get 30 cents per year, and new employees are always paid more than tenured employees.  Starting pay is $13.00 per hour."
bad,my day at my employer is a long boring day consist of monitoring solar panels and troubleshooting problems such as alarms when they are alarmed. the supervisors are not fully trained to help you with many problems or question you may have.I work with a lot of friendly people who are willing to help you.my most enjoyable part of the job is learning the the most difficult task given to you to do.
bad,"High potential company mired in growing pains; there are some really intelligent and good hard working people in the company, but retention is becoming a problem. Talent base shrinking and a growing vacuum in leadership at middle management is troublesome.  Frequent reorganizations are leading to lack of confidence and low morale.  I find the corporate strategy on point but implementation falls way short."
bad,"When I started 7 years ago, this company was completely different.  They advocated for the employee: good pay, great bonus/incentives, employee advancement and clear direction.  Forward to today and this vision no longer exists.   Like most companies politics plays a huge role over who will be promoted and who will be made a scapegoat.  Very disappointed after giving them 7 years of hard work."
bad,This was a great company to work for and was not until the transition of the company that the majority of the senior management was released and that the personalities and job ethics of the new company management changed from a team/family environment to a more competitive/ every man for himself environment.
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of putting on safety equipment."
bad,"A typical day as a Telesales Adviser at the office would be a 10am start and we as a team would start our first calls of the day straight away to our new potential customers. As a team we would be told by the team leader to create as many leads as possible for the potential sale of Solar Panels. We would each have our own personal and team targets to commit to and it was a very competitive place to work. We would all sit at the telephones calling homeowners across the uk for 9 hours a day. Sometimes the experienced members of the team like myself would be asked by the team leader/manager to train new members of the team. This was an opportunity for team members to get to know new colleagues and also learn about leadership and training, communication and team skills. All telephone handlers were friendly, polite,persistant and professional when dealing with customer care and new sales. I learnt numerous skills at this job in customer service,sales, working within a team, achieving targets and handling calls effectively and efficiently. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to talk to my customers all day and achieving and exceeding my targets. We would leave the office at 9pm to go home."
bad,good company too bad never happened in Mesa.  Great culture and people
bad,"First Solar has benefits available that you can participate in but the company is constantly changing. Unfortunately, the company's wishy-washy business plan forces people out of a job and forces some of their workers into positions they did not apply for in the first place. For many years I worked for this company, and I cannot begin to tell you how many faces I saw in and out of there. They hire temps and let the majority of them go after their probation period. They have done countless layoffs or paid people to leave on a small scale to stay under the radar and resemble a positive company in the public eye. Then they turn around and announce in the papers that they will be hiring some large number of people so that it looks like they are supportive of their community."
bad,"Most coworker are friendly, decent pay and benefits."
good,hard work pays well long hours  coming and going to jobsite lack of manager skills but a good experience and you are treated well  if you get hurt you are treated right away
good,Every day every year the benefits and pay spiral down. Meanwhile management get their bonus and stock options. Just try to make it from one layoff to the next..
good,"Excellent pay bonus benefits"
good,Well organized and fun place to work.  Good leadership.  Structured and process driven. work life balance.  work culture is open.  good benefits and onsite work out facilities.
good,"Good payment, good benefits, but the management does not have a clue to construct a healthy environment. Lots of politics and favoritism you must praise management if want to keep the job."
good,First Solar would be a great company to work for if they had management in the correct departments. They have management in departments that have no clue about that department. You are not able to go to your manage for help or advice without they pushing you away or just plain out blowing you off.
good,"O&M good fun working environment."
good,"Well, they lay off 300+ people and the top 4 executives at the plant get 25000 shares of company stock (about 750,000$).  Seems they could have kept a few and took lower stock numbers."
good,"Company is doing pretty good when it comes to personal development of the employees, they invest in employee by giving them training, however, job security is only for the people who has going out type of relationships with their higher ups."
good,"Growing company but its suffering from growing pains.  Although it can be a challenging environment  it can be difficult to move up in the company without higher education (masters, PHD).  There is little emphasis on growing their own talent and they place a high emphasis on outside education.  They are cutting raises, and have cut bonuses recently.  They have also made the insurance not as attractive.  They do pay for further education but this is only dependent on your manager."
good,"There is little work life balance, however the company is very innovative and employs lots of new technologies. The culture has drastically changed for the worse. First Solar has become extremly top heavy and centered towards negative changes."
good,"There are substantial differences between teams. Some teams are high performing and care about getting the job done while others only care about moving about the corporate ladder with as little work as possible. Unfortunately it seems the poor management teams are winning out and causing many intelligent and hard working people to leave, leaving only the incompetent corporate ladder climbers left."
good,"associates are nice and some aren't, contract workers don't get their benefits right, chemical product are always on safe 5S procedure. They should hire more effective workers that really kind of futuristic"
good,No job training.  Hard to get in or get promoted.  No much interaction with upper management.  The company is in a nice area and they have a beautiful building.
good,"Working for a sustainable energy company such as First Solar in rewording on that basis alone.  The company manufactures solar panels, builds new solar farms, and manages new solar farms or assume management of existing farms.  The construction side of the business performed poorly and is being off-loaded.  The O&M side of the business is performing well financially however much of the staff leadership is reserved at the mid-level prone to politics and competing goals.  The organization is not being managed as a single entity but as islands and politics weigh heavily at all levels and even impedes staff performance."
good,"Pros: good pay (permanent position) "
good,Poor place to work if you value time at home with family. Above average benefits and good hourly pay rates. Below average management leading to low moral
good,as far as management goes the would be some of the worst Ive yet to see. as far as planning and being prepared they lack the motive and art of good work. the employees get most of it done and pull there own weight with there own ideas to get the job done. only to have the manager over look it.
good,High competition globally in solar market. Mainly face challenge from low cost silicone module. Costs are very concerned. Module efficiency is the key.  Changes of business are very quick.
good,"While working on assignment, I was able to travel to different jobsites and worked with some of the best subcontractors and clients. I value the new contacts and friends that I made working here. Unfortunately, once my contract ended, I do not feel that I was given any further opportunities with this company."
good,"No work-life balance."
good,"Job environment was OK.  The various groups responsible for  creating new projects tended to operate in ""silos"", which lead to unnecessary problems in the project creation.  Many very talented people were employed there.  "
good,"Was only there for a year. Just like any other work place concentration was on production and not employees. Few employees really strived to do their jobs and many others where there for just a paycheck. Management and Supervisors never acknowledged the potential of other employees even after knowing that employees work history, work ethics, knowledge and experience.."
good,Well organized and fun place to work.  Good leadership.  Structured and process driven. work life balance.  work culture is open.  good benefits and onsite work out facilities.
good,the company takes good care of the employees the hours are long the pay is good co workers are good the weather is bad its either hot or cold overall its a good company
good,"Needs change of leadership that actually understands construction and EPC."
good,"Work with solar panels, inverters switching of medium voltage. Perform daily inspections of shelters, inverters and transformers."
good,"Perform warehouse layout, organization & storage capacity managements"
good,The 12 hours was long. I would rather work Monday thru Friday 8 hour days. I dont prefer to work weekends. And I'm more on keeping busy.  Just wasnt fast pace enough for me.
good,It was new challenges and new environment for me. I think i need to learn more and be more competent to work at First Solar Malaysia. I just hope the management can give me chance to work there and not basically choose based on races.
good,The work culture is laid back but the managers were very mean and unhappy with their job made it very hard to talk to them about things that mattered to the works
good,"Hired as a Electrical Designer to cover for full time employee who was out on disability time for approx. 3 months."
good,Leading the industry in Photovoltaic design with over 100 watts per square foot. Consistant backlog of construction jobs primarily in the Southwest US and Eurasian markets
good,"Immediate management supportive but beyond that poor, "
good,"I liked this company for the most part.  The management is constantly changing roles, and plans and expectations are so then constantly changing.  I would only recommend this company for someone fresh out of school."
good,"I have learned a lot about communication, business tactics, asset management and the solar industry working here. The people you work with are always putting in their share of work to keep up with the ever changing industry."
good,"Depending where you end up in the company you could spin your wheels career-wise, meanwhile other groups will invest in their people and you'll see them advance, but even then it's only the ""favorites"" that will succeed. You'll know pretty quickly if you're one of the ""favorites"". "
good,"i enjoyed it alot, however they did an unexpected mass layoff which really sucked. Good people to work for and made many friends, relaxed. but did not expect that layoff, no one did"
good,"Material handler."
good,Strong company in the solar business and steady climbing. Keep employees safe whole preforming all job duties. Time on job and home life balance well.
good,Well organized and fun place to work.  Good leadership.  Structured and process driven. work life balance.  work culture is open.  good benefits and onsite work out facilities.
good,very relaxed due to the fact they would take the time and teach you how to perform the job task correctly and safely. always talked about safety every morning with everyone to insure that everyone was aware of all hazards on job site.
good,"Executive Leadership works well together; however, departmental managers are silo'd in their execution which make collaboration on projects difficult."
good,"-A lot of work and tons of projects under their belt."
good,12 hour shifts. rotating schedule with work every other weekend. pay starts out comparable to other manufacturing jobs. lots of time off and a fair amount of vacation time.
good,"Working with fun there because can make lots of friends,be a hardwoking person,helping company but some supervisor and manager didnt follow the laws.."
good,Great place to work would recommend to everyone. Great benefits and opportunity to travel. Great for anyone that can travel and or move. Pay was great.
good,"it is good company to grow the personal life as well work balance.."
good,"A typical day at work was a learning experience, even though I had to travel over 50 miles everyday to start work in a remote area in a solar plant. I learned many skills and gained experience in the Solar field."
good,"The company has been through many management changes during the last 3 years.  These changes have been due to various reasons, CEO retirement, market and product offering are a few reasons.  I do think the current CEO is on track for making business, cultural and over all changes needed."
good,I worked for First Solar installing Solar Panels and wiring them together. It was a temporary job but I enjoyed me time there.
good,"a clean,organized, and compliant workplace. people matter is one of the core values but its hard to advance, seen many people permanently laid off with no notice, and if you come in through a temporary agency - many do not get hired"
good,"Never a dull moment, a very fast pace job , most of the time. Understaff most of the time. Supervisors were great never bothered you and Great co workers. Pay could be better."
good,"Was a great work schedule 12hr days but only work 50% of the calendar year. we always had time for family."
good,First Solar will most certainly provide a person with marketable skill-sets if willing to learn.  Many moving parts in this working environment.  I always take the positive experiences in any culture-so I've gained a wealth of experience.
good,"pay isn't bad benefits used to be better, show too much favoritism to their friends.clean environment.work isnt that hard  or laborious.Hours are okay.good vacation schedule."
good,"Great on site management team, too little job security. Co-workers were excellent. Company shows little loyalty to field employees."
good,Well organized and fun place to work.  Good leadership.  Structured and process driven. work life balance.  work culture is open.  good benefits and onsite work out facilities.
good,"easy work, not very good top out rate, good management, I would recommend this company to someone who is fine with only making 11 an hour their entire career"
good,If you just starting out not a bad place to get experience and learn.  After awhile you will get stuck doing the same things every day and there is no room for advancement unless someone leaves or the company grows.  Upper management cares more about the people above them then below them.
good,"Every job site has its ups and downs, this one was completed on time and on budget, regardless of a few hiccups on the management side"
good,"Leader in PV industry,  facing difficulties in price competition"
good,"For a foreign company working in Australia, difficulties are expected."
good,Manufacturing and construction company is hard for logistics and material buyers that cause impact on schedule. Detail materials like nuts and bolts should have no red tape to acquire.
good,My job was all over the place; i intervened with all departments and was/am the point of contact in Canada. This job has been like a book I have not put down;
good,"Comfortable to work but lack collaboration, many things can be learned but it is too difficult to get the tutor from the senior, to be self-reliant sometimes at discrimination & rivalry between senior and new employees."
good,"nice place to work , fun environment, long worthy hours , nice managers nice crew. easy to catch on . Very clean areas . i loved my partner who i was assigned to work with."
good,"I loved my job and was praised for my good works all the time by my manager. I had an amazing annual review the last week of November 2016. The next week I was blind sided by being laid-off ""do to company downsizing"""
good,"Liked the job and the environment for a factory. Was happy with my pay and my hours. Management was alright, definitely a difference in HR and rest of facility. The cafeteria is cheap and decent, which is a saving grace since most factory employees cannot leave the campus on breaks."
good,"Hi"
good,First Solar is a fast paced semiconductor company which is similar to many bay area companies. There are a lot of challenges and salary is good. But whole solar industry in in down turn. and First Solar is impacted significantly.
good,"The people at first solar aren't bad, it's the insane act of having a worker on his/her feet for 12 hours while performing their work. They place mats down to try to help with this, they're the cheapest most worthless things that they could find."
good,"First Solar always has good challenges and gives the employee a sense of direct impact based on their contribution. The technology and management system is a proven success. The benefits are not as good as they used to be and seem to be becoming noncompetitive, from a health care standpoint."
good,"First Solar is a great place to work, if you appreciate a fast pace work environment. Unfortunately, they are known for layoffs, so job security is minimal."
good,Well organized and fun place to work.  Good leadership.  Structured and process driven. work life balance.  work culture is open.  good benefits and onsite work out facilities.
good,This is a great place to work with opportunity for advancement however; requires long days not allowing for much family life
good,"We had to report to our workstation on a assembly line, we loaded solar panels on the line for production,  we checked the solar panels for defects, checked the scribe lines for specification, made sure the oven was up to temp and made sure the robots was functioning correct. I learned CAD Chloride how to do a trigger test to make sure the plates wasn't being over sprayed. It was was a fast pace workplace very diverse, the hardest thing was trying to get the robot to work properly when it malfunctioned. The best part was the learning process of it all."
good,"At first this was a great company to work for and then for some reason the issues with the market starting to change the mind set of this great company.  They reached out to people that did not know anything about looking out for people but were for on looking out for the money.  One really gave up their life balance for this company as they required you to be away from home more then you really wanted too.  Most of the first employees of the EPC side of First Solar are now gone due to being replaced for set up to take a fall, which a lot of them did and have."
good,"Great opportunities to learn about the Solar industry and Project Development."
good,"Flexible work culture, thorough attitude to duties. Exposed to other areas of the solar pv industry such as contract management, EPC ecosystem, subcontracts management, project development process. Great team to work with and supportive."
good,This was a good place to work for.  The only parts that was lacking were overall feedback and health insurance. Safety record was good.  Overall team support was good.
good,"Typical day was that there was no ""typical"" day. Favorite saying in our group was ""never a dull moment!"""
good,"This job is great for leaning a lot of new things in the mechanics area of the factory and gaining computer experience.  The benefits of this place are great, insurance, pay, and 401K. Poor management at times, eyes always on you waiting for you to mess up so they have a reason to let you go."
good,"The workday was a twelve-hour shift, starting at 6:00pm.  I was involved in the final stage of production of the solar panels, which included installing connecting wires and testing.  The work was not very difficult, and I really enjoyed what I was doing."
good,"Able to explore new job scope"
good,"First Solar is a good place to get engineering done."
good,"Through my interview at First Solar, I gained information about the current market in the field of solar energy. I also had helpful training sessions, where I learned about the technology at First Solar and also learned how to model solar plants on their company software. Moreover, I had the chance to visit their solar power plant and learn how the plant is maintained. I also had the opportunity to do a comparative study on photovoltaic plants and concentrated solar plants."
good,"Fast pace,sense of accomplishment trouble shooting alarms and continueous movement on production line"
good,"It was a great place to work. the people were great, the location was great, the benefits were great. i met a lot of fantastic people while i was there."
good,"Working as BI Reporting Architect on Tableau technology. Hands on Experience in Business objects. Worked on Developement,Enhancement,Support and Manage Service Models."
good,Well organized and fun place to work.  Good leadership.  Structured and process driven. work life balance.  work culture is open.  good benefits and onsite work out facilities.
good,"-can work from anywhere"
good,"The days are long but, all in all it is a great place to work. Plenty of room for advancement One of the best manufacturing job I have personally held."
good,Very well balanced company. American cultured company. Chances to work in overseas are given to all. Always progressing with new technology every year.
good,"Very fast paced environment, with constant change and flux but deadlines remained the same thereby creating very challenging days for many of us.  Learned all about the solar industry that includes exposure to engineering, system designs, drawing packages, site development, various technologies, integration, SAP, Product Life Cycle management system, material management, etc.  Co-workers were great to work with and learn from as they were always very helpful and eager to help."
good,"First Solar is a nice company if you enjoy monotony and hate surprises. You will do the same work day in and day out, but that isn't always a bad thing."
good,First Solar Construction group was developed out of a manufacturing company. Most of the management style was based out of manufacturing and the construction side of the company is still in development. Overall CLP took orders from First Solar as I was contracted thru. In a very competitive market First Solar definitely has the upper hand.
good,First Solar is a great place to work and I wish they had bandwidth to bring me on full time. The People who work there are very amazing people.
good,Good Company with opportunity for growth. The company is approximately 6 years old and has enjoyed great profits during its start up.
good,Always work to be done and co-workers were easy to work with. Good opportunity for advancement.
good,First Solar is a great place to work at.  They have great benefit plans and contain a high amount of departments in which one can excel into from production level.  The management does a great job of breaking down the production areas and provides the associates to excel in many different parts of the plant.  The group in which i am in is very busy and fast paced and we take care of all of the Engineering departments test modules in our warehouse.
good,"An extremely fast paced work environment and well compensated teams, though the amount of hours required were atrocious. 80+ hour weeks during month end close"
good,Most enjoyable part of the job is leaving at the end of the day.
good,Great environment in the field and HQ. Would anticipate this company growing and becoming the leader in this industry.
good,- Perform Recycle and treatment PV module for extracting reusable materials and materials for disposal.
good,Totally different kind of work experience. Always open to new challenges and this was one I enjoy very much.
good,Positive company with a lot of great employees. Technically diverse work environment.
good,Nice and clean working environment. Really like job but the 12 hour days are just too much. The people were good to work with and managers are also good people. I did have 4 bosses within the first year.  Must be able to adapt to change constantly.
good,"Good facility in First Solar company that enhance associate to work out after work. Also, good in the benefit, for example, allowance for the business trip will get 1000 USD if taking economy flight."
good,"First Solar was a good conpany to work for however, I exerianced 3 different times layoffs happended. The third time it I felt it was time to start looking. Overall good company, good people and culture."
good,Well organized and fun place to work.  Good leadership.  Structured and process driven. work life balance.  work culture is open.  good benefits and onsite work out facilities.
good,Need good arrangement people from management. Do not be biased. Do not favoritism. Always be fair with subordinates. Always helpful if needed. Need good cooperation from all department.
good,Good company to work for with very competitive benefits. The company is sound and zero tolerance. I cant complain the job was good while it lasted. I learn a lot in the power transmissions field.
good,"Great place to work were there is always something new to learn, opportunities to advance  and gain further knowledge about the process and product. Multi-cultural plant with friendly personal from all walks of life."
good,Good company culture with any type of training needed. Safety is top priority and everyone works as a team. It is a large corporate environment which has been very successful.
good,"Im looking an experience in first solar company and i get new experience and information, beside that i have qualification in skills certificate and technician certificate"
good,it was a good place to work till they down sized and let over 450 ppl including all the ppl i worked with for a fully automated line. there 401 was good and so was the insurance
good,The management and all the people I worked with were great. Good work life balance. Daily duties included operating the waste water treatment system and lab analysis.
good,"I met like 3 different races that I literally have never been around before in vast numbers. I worked with Bulgarians, Mexicans, and Native Indians, which were great groups of people overall. I learned a lot about the solar world of employment. I learned how to install several different parts of the solar panel and the panel itself. I learned how to drill, impact, torque, do inventory check out and in procedures. I calibrated the torque tools before each co-worker used them. I learned how to do QC/QA work...which was quality assurance checks and quality control checks behind my co-workers before the stamp of approval for inspection was flagged on the ready array work."
good,"was a good place to work until we were told layoffs were becoming possible, then, went downhill quickly. worked with a great group of people, that always helped each other out when needed"
good,"Typical day is comprised of several cross functional meetings. The working environment is high paced. Innovation is the main objective. However, internal processes need maturing across all organizations. My co-workers are very professional and embrace collaboration. I enjoy learning from my colleagues and cultivating cross functional processes."
good,I really enjoyed working at First Solar. But due to cutbacks my job was eliminated after 6 years of employment.I worked a 36 hour week one week and a 48 hour week the next week with every other weekend off.
good,"I worked for this company before it became what it is today. Without going into too much detail the company went from a very family oriented/for the employee type of company to a ""you're just a number"" type of company. The management was sub par with the exception of very few, and very nonexistent when line issues occurred. My co-workers were for the most part very good and always willing to help each other out which these days isn't always the case. "
good,"Liked the new concept of large solar development and the modular design."
good,"As a public company, they are always looking to cut costs, which is understandable. However they should have looked at processes and procedures before they started cutting essential employees"
good,was ok place to work like the people in the clip crew and post crew
good,"Pros: Good pay, most benefits good, enough staff so no one feels too busy."
good,"It's a nice place to work. I'm not unhappy at my job, I just need something that pays a little more in order to pay off some debt. Working two jobs is taking its toll on me. But overall I like first solar."
good,"My experience at First Solar working in development engineering has been largely positive as far as my personal and professional development is concerned.  It is a great place to start your career as they offer many opportunities to grow in your position and develop as a young engineer.  If you prove yourself you will be given the opportunity to have more responsibility and have an increased impact on the organization through promotion.  However, the promotions at First Solar come with modestly disappointing pay raises.  In general, First Solar does not pay very well for a technology company and your promotions come with a small percentage increase based on an already low pay scale.  After you have had multiple promotions you will often find yourself making thousands to tens of thousands of dollars less than a comparable position at another company in the current job market.
