rating,review
bad,"The the company is losing a large amount of high end clientele.   They have been laying off for the last 5 years.  "
bad,"It was a serious downturn in my career. Poor management; unethical behavior, etc. Bad management, uncaring/overworked teams, extremely poor bid defenses left operations to make up the profit."
bad,"Hostile work environment. Zero training which leaves you to pretty much fail at your job. You're allowed one fifteen minute break the entire day. You're expected to work overtime. Zero incentive to work here. Cut throat work environment, benefits are terrible, vacation time is ok but you're discouraged from taking time off. Pay rates are horrible. "
bad,"Ok place to work but no career path ! "
bad,"Environnement de travail peu agréable. Difficile management exercé sur les employés, forte charge de travail, pas de compensation sur les objectifs remplis."
bad,"Hostile work environment, every day and every project was treated as an emergency, extremely negative managers, no work/life balance, management did not support employees."
bad,"The HR organization needs an overhaul. The environment is restrictive, inflexible, non-collaborative, non-supportive, disingenuous and deceptive. The turnover in HR is very high. There have been significant lay offs in the company over the last few years. There are very few opportunities for advancement in HR and vacated positions are often not being backfilled. Internal HR talent is often not considered for what few opportunities exist or are misinformed or not informed about potential opportunities."
bad,"I have nothing good to say, from misleading hiring process to unqualified management staff and co-workers to work life balance.  No security of job security , No career path or advancement"
bad,"Changing goalposts come review time, inconsistent and contradictory demands made on my time by the various managers. Very Hierarchical structure with little chance of promotion and very poor wages."
bad,"Management people are the worst i repeat ""The Worst"" , even HR management doesn't try to solve the problems. The worst Internal Politics company in the world."
bad,"No healthy cuture , lot of micro management ."
bad,"Discrimination in the employees. Laid off people on the discrimination of likes and dislikes."
bad,"La empresa no tenía la capacidad de gestionar las comunicaciones, lo que resultaba en una mala gestión del tiempo alocado a la transmisión de la información."
bad,"	Lead Clinical Data Manager on multiple protocols from start-up to database lock"
bad,Don't work for this company unless you like to be verbally and emotionally abused by managers. It is a culture of CYA and there is no support for a professional CRA with a mind. You will not be heard. GCP is ignored. Managers are the worst in the industry. Horrible position. No recognition for work accomplished. 
bad,"The companies management was lacking and there wasn't a clear path for advancement. This place is for a job, not a career. The way the company operates is to keep piling on more and more work on each employee until they burn out, which is why the company is having such a large turnaround problem. They are spending more money on insufficient training for new employees rather than retaining employees with experience. The companies managers do not do a good job with accommodating employees when they, for example, have a doctor's appointment making it a difficult place to work. As well, it does not feel like a friendly work environment, not making it enjoyable to go to work every morning. "
bad,This company seems to be having major difficulty in handling their recent growth. I recommend avoiding this company at all costs.
bad,worst place to work .No appreciation what so ever
bad,"Folks in the contracts area worked far too may hours on weekdays and weekends, and it was expected from the manager. My manager (TY) was petty, partial, far too interested in employee's personal lives, fake, and she often lied. It was difficult working for someone who expected you to befriend only the people she was friendly with. Working at Parexel was not a happy experience and it paid far below the market rate."
bad,The work environment was poor with no regard for work-life balance.  Typical days were 12+ hours. Management stressed high volume output with little attention to quality work. Benefits lower than industry standard.
bad,"They don't often promote or give salary increases. It's a great place to learn about the industry, but not a great place to grow."
bad,"Lousy management, hostile work environment."
bad,"This company has the poor management, training, systems and procedures in place at the expense of employees and specially customers. You are basically an overworked paper pusher."
bad,"A toxic environment to work in."
bad,Not impressed at all.. very slow work culture..things go in circles forever. Have no vision and people lack skills. There are NO training programs for employees. Too many layers of hierarchy and managers lack hands on skills that make lower level employees drive as per their whims.
bad,Sueldos muy bajos. 0 apreciación por el empleado. No se preocupan nada por las personas
bad,"they give all facilities and take back when ever they need no job security , no managerial skilled managers no team support no proper respect to the employees"
bad,"Great pay, but culture of the company is horrible! I hated working here, the management team sucked. Working with the corporate office functional groups were not efficient. It seemed like we were working against each other even though we were on the same team."
bad,"Quality is a secondary thoughts and often times minimized.  Management has said that the person who excels and stands out is more of a deterrent, because it makes other look poorly.  Management also tends to practice micromanagement rather than ensuring and having confidence in existing staff."
bad,"I have worked for more than ten companies, and this one was by far the worst. In order to maintain margins, this company sells what it cannot deliver, and overworks its employees to try to do so. Clinical trials are chronically understaffed and riven with turnover, because, frankly, everyone is trying to get out and many do. The result is cut-throat competition inside the business and an often degrading atmosphere wrought of business demands that simply cannot be met."
bad,The department was small and cut throat. My Manager used me to do all the work and took the credit and took the promotion. I heard that Other departmentments do not run like the one i worked on and i heard that our department was not well liked by other departmentments because we were unfriendly. I can definately understand that. I have seen manager mistreat staff that they did not like so that they would quit. even. heard managers talk bad about staff. Negative environment and it comes from management. The management spies on staff and it i was told tht by a manager. Managers have no management experience
bad,"Management did not give the promotion to advance their careers unless you are managers pet."
bad,"PAREXEL used to be a great place to work. It is no longer so. If you take a job at PAREXEL be prepared for 80 work weeks, poor training annual looming layoffs and a soul crushing workload. "
bad,"Working remotely for PAREXEL was going very well, until new management came in and decided it would not allow this at my level, despite the fact that it had been working out fine for two years before they came in.  Thus, they demanded everyone at that level or above to relocate to Waltham, MA.  I and numerous others could not do this so we had to separate from the Company."
bad,"$$ can be good, only if you are hourly and the sponsor company pays door to door, home-office to airport for departure and return, (arrival), back to your home office.Then you can be on conference calls, all day and do your follow-up paperwork, another day,answer emails, etc."
bad,"Although the business was really interesting, learned so much about clinical trials, management was horrible, they expected long hours, many of them had no children. I had no family time, I am glad I left!"
bad,"Management lies to get people to accept a position. Then HR defends them. Just an unethical company with people who have low to no morals. Additionally, they expect you to work, work, work and if you need to take some time for yourself for a doctor appointment or such they want you to make up the time when you are working well over 60+ hours a week. Horrible culture from the top down!"
bad,"Great place to learn all about medical trials, and very stricy best practice processes and documentation since they get regularly audited. Agile teams are efficient with great results.  Unfortunately, it had a fast turn around of employees. and salaries were way below average"
bad,"Layoffs and office closures for the last 6 years with more of the same in the future. Management keeps talking about growth but the company is quietly shrinking in the background. Used to be a nice place to work but at the moment there are more managers than actual employees. Buildings are full of temporary contractors, Low level cheap offshore labor is hired to do the work of professionals. "
bad,"If someone wants only money and ready to sacrifice self respect this is the place, only applicable to Parexel India CDM. Other departments are good. Overall not a good place to work."
bad,"No focus on learning or training, it’s only outputs that they want. No one is keen on sharing the knowledge but everyone is keen on looking at mistakes. Management doesn’t take the accountability and responsibility and turns deaf ears to you. Blame game is what everyone plays here!"
bad,Management does not clearly mention the expectations. Not really a professional environment to work with. No clear picture of the future given and not too much of job security
bad,"Work culture is changing, used to be a good place to work with a  great team. There is no shortage for work load, everyone is always busy. However, did work with some wonderful people and learnt a lot."
bad,"Lo unico bueno y para agradecer es la oportunidad de iniciarse en la investigation clinica que da Parexel. El resto: trato, sueldo, beneficios, aumentos salariales, etc son malos en comparacion a la competencia."
bad,Company is growing rapidly and hiring many new employees. Great co-workers! Work life balance is not a priority for management.
bad,"Long days, long nights, no appreciation or respect, no understanding of work life balance, poor compensation and overall corrupt corporate culture."
bad,Relies on inexperienced management and staff to perform complex tasks they are not up to doing. From a quality perspective the teams are simply looking to work around SOP's and regulations instead of complying with them.
bad,"Focus on the customer at any cost. Work life balance was a struggle to negotiate with management. "
bad,"No hay mentoring, ni seguimiento del progreso del empleado.  RRHH a cargo de una señora violenta, sin ningún título habitante, que discrimina y castiga a quien llega con algún reclamo justo. Todo se soluciona con la desvinculación.  Management que atrasa una década, no preparado para dirigir milennials.  Mucho banner pro y pocas acciones efectivas. En resumen, un almacén con fachada de multinacional."
bad,nice company to start with but not suggested for long term. people are very political especially higher management. lot of processes but no results. no work life balance. very unstable job and lots of mental pressure.
bad,"PXL offers a good starting point for new PMs, but there is a lack of work life balance. PXL also offers many internal opportunities for advancement to its employees."
bad,I was told my job was safe and the changes were happening over seas and would not effect the USA. Next thing I am receiving my severance package out of nowhere! Lies lies lies!!!! Don't trust a word they are saying because it is all lies.
bad,"24Hours of work"
bad,"10 - 12 hour work days, limited training. Unrealistic expectation, poor upper management. Processes are lengthy as so you cannot get approval for sites in a reasonable time frame. Turn-over was constant, there were new people in my 8 people area withing 1 week after I was employed, like a revolving door. I did experience Canadian site approval (on my own - with no support from management - via trial and error - errors were counted against me as well as language barriers with NON US managers). In enjoyed the cube height. My personal manager was great, but probably had limited decision making."
bad,Workload is typical of a CRO. Personnel turnover is high although colleagues were wonderful and became close friends. Great learning environment for anyone wishing to stay in clinical research.
bad,"The company like most has issues but it is what it is. In my opinion, some manangers who have been there for over 10yrs are too comfortable and it is time for a change to improve the organization holistically."
bad,"Their Agile process is one of the best I have been in. Took a while to be implemented, but with the training and having qualified people leading the project, everything goes clear and smooth.  Unfortunately here was never opportunity to advance. and once they moved all developing to India, the office closed"
bad,After 3 promotions in 6 years I got a new manager that shot down everything someone that wasn't her favorites said.  She picked 'her crew' for the best assignments while others worked longer and less high profile target trials.
bad,"At the time, company focused on rapid growth and didn't also create management structure; this caused problems in managing projects and staff with very high staff turnover.  I have heard that they have learned to manage growth since then."
bad,"Fast Pace/Demanding/Too much unrealistic travel/inexperienced Lead. too many changes in management. Metrics over things i had no control over. No work life balance. Working with global projects and management, not all us holidays acknowledged."
bad,"I worked there for years and decided to leave after my last review.  I was held back from promotion for not completing something that wasn't included in my goals.  There workload is heavy, it's difficult to get promoted and the department goes through frequent reorgs"
bad,"Some days would be productive than others, reason being other days there would be minimal work available.  This is because the company over hires employees when there is not really much work to do.  Typical day would be checking my work availability (matrix)  and resource the work accordingly.  Reply to any client emails and make phone calls.  I acquired some skills working at ABC, like time management, working under pressure, communications skills and the handling of data.  Most importantly quality work.  Working in the Pharmaceutical Industry was something totally different for me but it became a challenge as I wanted to learn more.  And after 6 years I knew the company very well.  I enjoyed that for half the time I was there.  The company lacks growth and development for its employees.  And underpays its stuff."
bad,"If you do not have anyting nice to say..."
bad,"It can be a good place to work in terms serving as an entry point into the pharmaceutical industry. The fundamental problem is that the work environment is fraught with office politics, and poor management. Line or middle management is poor, there is no managerial presence in terms of guidance or direction for the employ, essentially management throws people at projects and provides little or no guidance. Essentially, it is a sink or swim environment. Not recommended as a place to work."
bad,The Leadership Team is completely in touch with the business. This is by far the most employee friendly company that I have worked in. The environment was conducive
bad,"Worked for kmi then parexel took over and ruined the company"
bad,Salary and Compensation is very low compared to market standards. Management issues. No chance of Open communication. Especially Facilities and Transport Issues.
bad,Managers and HR not willing to work with you not flexible. Communication between managers and staff not good. Remove entire departments without warning. Job culture not good
bad,"Since the massive layoffs in the spring and summer of 2015, the morale is down, the atmosphere is unpleasant and everybody is looking to switch it seems like. All finance groups were shuffled and their tasks changed, which made people feel insecure and wonder what is it exactly that made upper management think that giving people brand new tasks would make them more efficient. The management however keeps talking pleasant banalities to everyone to somehow keep afloat. Newcomers still believe the banalities."
bad,"It all depends on your line manager.  Some are great others are not.  You may learn but there was no freedom to express your opinions or views or even free to ask a question after a meeting, It  all depends on the manager/director you report to."
bad,"Lo bueno de la empresa es que uno puede trabajar de forma independiente, hay home office y flexibilidad horaria."
bad,"I have worked for PAREXEL for four years and have gotten good employee reviews. I have applied for over forty positions internally and have been turned down without notice or feedback. I brought it up to my manager's attention, and also HR's attention. all they had to say is keep up the good work. "
bad,"Days are very busy but go quickly.  You get exposed to a lot of information in a very short time but you learn every day.  Management is hands-off and lets you do your thing.  They appreciate professionals that take ownership, make decisions and move forward.  Co-workers are supportive.  The fast pace and workload are the most challenging aspect of the job but the flexibility to manage your workload in a way that works for you is a huge benefit."
bad,Upper management weak. Line managers do not have good people skills; are rude; not supportive. No warmth to this company.  Lack of integrity. Employees are just a number and dispensable.
bad,"The most enjoyable part of this job is my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is to keep your cool when somebody doesn't perform accordingly to the standard operation procedure. My manager is amazing. She always has your back no matter what. I've learned that no matter how many projects you are put on, time management is key. Also i've learned to leave the work at the office. It gets too stressful when you can't forget about it when you go home."
bad,"Great company to work for in respect to management and culture. Very friendly, supportive and cooperative. However, the company misses on compensation and work life balance"
bad,"Pay is very good, but this is the second round of layoffs since I started working there less than a year ago.  Management isn't giving any information but trying to move people around without any information."
bad,"I would prefer not to comment, as I was recently laid off."
bad,"PAREXEL ist eine durch und durch amerikanische Firma, mit amerikanischer Firmenkultur."
good,"Great for getting your start.... just dont stay there."
good,"Management is lacking. Too many turnovers, CRAs are jumping ship because of recent changes to workload. Other staff are being forced into roles they do not want"
good,"There has been numerous issues with this job. They compensate new hires with the same educational background as the current employees way more and encourage us to train them with no extra compensation. Also, the ""raises"" that they provide stop after a couple of years but normally its just a few cents more."
good,"Worked as a translator.  Work environment was good."
good,"Ok Place to work. No career progression. If you want to have job without any dreams of getting promoted, please work for the company."
good,"1. the typical day at work is very busy and hard"
good,Great place to get experience with a global company. PAREXEL needs to work on development of their employees and retaining talent. Work/Life balance can sometimes be non-existent depending on workload and deliverables. Very fast paced environment with high demands.
good,"The job is easy but they do want to pay their employees. The management is not great at all. The coworkers are great, but they are not fair at all"
good,"Unfortunately, the cons of working in the PAREXEL call center far outweigh the pros. The pay is dismal, especially in light of the heightened expectations about call volume."
good,"The colleagues are overall helpful and easy to get along with, and nice working environment. However, the team leader will be the key who have direct influence to you. There are many senior leaders who has reached certain level that they provide no guidance but holding your back. "
good,my day outbound calls follow ups scheduling appointments.I have learned how to be productive the hardest part about this job was working with the public. the most enjoyable part about this job was meeting new people.
good,"Workplace culture is unstable as there are frequent updates coming up. Management should strive on making a stable and streamlined process. Salaries not bad, but could be better when compared to the market condition. There is no security to Job as the company is taken over by Pamplona capital company and there are frequent layoffs without prior notice. Would definitely not recommend this company to anyone."
good,The fact that you work remotely is good but at times the goals of the company are not communicated to the employees properly or they are not inline with the project you are on.
good,"A typical day at work when in home office was to field phone calls, answer protocol questions following up with sites. I learned you need to have a work life balance and shut off the computer at 5pm! Management was good in the beginning and then it was not good. My colleagues were great to work with."
good,This was a good place to acquire Clinical Research Organization (CRO) experience.  I learned a lot at Parexel about the differences of Pharma vs CRO work activitives/ culture.
good,This was a very favorable job. Worked independently as a consultant. The pay was very comprobable to open markets for consulting companies. I found the experience very rewarding
good,"It was a great experience working for both PAREXEL and IQVIA, however currently there is no more room for growth and would like to immigrate to New Zealand and further my growth and development within the Clinical Data Management Industry. Besides for the Growth there is also a lack of work life balance which is another reason for a new experience within the Clinical Data Management Industry in New Zealand."
good,"Work life balance is good"
good,"- Everything is due at the last minute. "
good,Flexibility is great at this place. The teams seem to be working as one to get a finished product and meet all deadlines.  At times you are just an employee.
good,its gud company to for beginners it gives ample time to learn the technology required to work in day to day
good,"Typical day - 12 hours"
good,"My office hours are from 9am to 5.30pm, Monday to Friday, with flexability allowed. I assistant the project managers in all administration tasks i.e from EC documentation to ISF maintanence. I have learnt to work in a team and manage my time more effectively. I work with a small team but can adapt to a bigger or smaller team but also not a  problem working on my own. "
good,"Poorly Managed"
good,This was years ago so I am sure things are updated now but back then there were many delays due to software issues.  Did provide the work/life balance and that was recognized overall.
good,"Flexible schedule and ability to work remotely; however, underpaid and overworked. Great team environment, great staff. Management needs more structure."
good,"Out of date top-down managing, PAREXEL is struggling in the evermore saturated CRO industry because of this. "
good,"Employees at PAREXEL were generally very well trained in skills required in the high-risk field of managing clinical trials.  The staff with whom I worked were very dedicated and frequently worked 60 or more hours per week, as exempt salaried employees, to make sure that quality standards were followed."
good,"It's a great place if you have an experienced manager. If not, it can be very challenging. Pay is good but doesn't make up for the lack of consistency and organization within the departments."
good,"Long days, late nights, weekends, are expected and usually not predicted. If training is needed, management is not very helpful but fellow team members are always willing to help whenever able. Not much confidence in Managers willingness to assist when requested and often times, the communication is left with a delayed or no response."
good,No proper management as the company just started off at the time I Joined and the night shifts and works stress made it even worse.
good,"Overloading employee's with work, while saying they will work hard to reduce the workload. Work/life balance does not exist. If you plan a vacation, you have to keep in mind that you need to check in almost every day. Weekend hours are also required due to the fact that you cannot get all of your work done during the week. Love the people I work with, but cannot work constantly."
good,California Clinical Trials was bought by them five years ago.
good,A business model that is enduring and relevant to its industry that provides its employees with challenges that foster personal and professional growth.
good,Management by crisis does not use planning. Poor compensation.
good,Need some good managers to get this company a better name and some good job out of their employees.
good,"Parexel is a great company to work for. One's experience is contingent upon personality, and overall professional skill set. Co-worker are extremely friendly."
good,"Uncertainty of management and changes. Strong Sr. Clinical Project management in some cases, however disconnect for how CRAs were assigned and driven wholly by metrics."
good,"Parexel est une entreprise honnête et sérieuse. Elle offre beaucoup d'avantages sociaux. Mais fondamentalement, elle manque de qualités dans le choix des études, dans l'apprentissage des ARC, dans la façon de travailler. "
good,"This is a successful company that is dealing with changes in the pharma/biotech marketplace and is currently struggling to compete for opportunities.  The company was recently taken private with the goal of improving and driving continued growth, but is currently still in flux."
good,"It's a good pharmacovigilance company with great team, friendly work culture and good quality management system. The company believes in delivering best to the clients with full effort and dedication by the staff."
good,"•工作日常"
good,"Nice people to work with and flexible working conditions, but 24/7 culture of the business and organisational issues."
good,Upper management can use some work- work life balance is good most of the time but sometimes forced to work weekends you are unable to. Little-no room for advancement
good,Typical east coast culture. Ok for a stable career but nothing too exciting or new.Currently undergoing massive organizational change & hence major chaos
good,"Trabalho tranquilo, monótono, repetitivo, operacional (área de Projetos)."
good,"Perform all clinical in-house monitoring tasks and/or remote visits for assigned projects in accordance with relevant regulations, SOPs, and study specific guidelines ensure patient safety and data integrity at all times. This includes managing/supporting site activities remotely, resolving site issues, and ensuring timely/high quality data entry at a site level. Conduct and facilitates study specific start-up activities such as Site Regulatory Package (SRP) collection, Clinical Site Agreement (CSA), payments to sites, Informed Consent Form (ICF) negotiation, and all supporting site management activities to ensure timely site initiation.  Perform work according in accordance with ICH Guidelines, GCPs, local Regulatory Agency requirements and PAREXEL and/or Sponsor SOPs, as applicable."
good,"The end-users were super nice to work with!!!!"
good,"- More manual work in m current company."
good,"Parexel is a good company, but is not in the position to allow travelers to transition into other roles at this time."
good,"I enjoyed working at PAREXEL and learned new things each day. Until the office suddenly closed and I lost my job, I felt valued and accepted by PAREXEL"
good,"Work is non-stop, all the time, and everyone expects everyone immediately all at once. If you can't learn on your own, it will be very hard as there isn't a lot of time for personal mentoring. Most people find this very hard."
good,"Busy work day"
good,"I enjoyed working at PAREXEL. The people were friendly and I was able to move around within the company and try my hand at many different positions."
good,"Its a very nice place to work feels like a family and a second home, however, the pay is not that great and there is no progression, therefore, most people leave after a couple of years."
good,The main issue with the company is the senior leadership in finance. There is no development or mentoring and it can be a hostile environment. Other departments do not have this same issue.
good,"They would allow an individual to move cross functionally in order to further a person's career path.  They provide a verity of auditing experience from internal, external and regulatory."
good,"Challenged each day, busy day"
good,"I enjoyed the location and the people I worked with . Upper management had little to be desired. Too much office politics. "
good,"Stressful and highly demanding. You may need to sacrifice your personnel time. One need to focus on other activities (pleasing, bluffing) to get advancement. Not a right place for genuine talents."
good,"Work hours helps alot"
good,"Co-workers are very helpful.  The team mindset is relatively active in most projects.  Unfortunately, transitioning to a more challenging study is very difficult."
good,Co-workers are great with the organization but exposure is very less compared to my last organization.
good,"The Clinic starts each day with current schedule, available staff and allocation of effort.  Critical to success of the organization is the communication of critical paths, and the inter-relatedness of departments as the morning unfolds."
good,all departments are adequately covering the workload so employees can truly enjoy their vacations
good,"A great company to work for but applications are on old stacks ,and as a company not willing to upgrade scared of Regulatory audits. Management takes decisions to close facilities without proper communication."
good,"Parexel is is in a state of change at the present. They offer good benefits and opportunities for growth. However, processes are cumbersome and teams are frequently under resourced."
good,"Productive, yet stressful and fast paced. Parexel offers a range of services to the bio pharmaceutical industries, so working in the company gives a good understanding of the clinical research industry."
good,PAREXEL is a good company with many skilled people.  There is a culture however of sink or swim. For new people the processes and procedures are difficult to learn and constantly changing with little to no warning.
good,"1) Doing payments by Oracle against ASAP, Europe, USA & UK.    "
good,Early day of coding and meetings.  Collaboration with the team is always a must and sometimes you're working with teams across country. The drawback is that you may have to work really late and long hours to get things done.
good,Currently going through a transition period.  Difficult to balance work/life because they are short staff.  The management team is fair and tries to keep assigned studies at 2.
good,"It provides you a nice platform to learn basic understanding of your profile."
good,"I am unable to provide a fair assessment of PAREXEL, as my employment with them was so brief.  Six months into my new job with PAREXEL I left the company to attend to my family which was overwhelmed with loss and grief due to a series of unexpected family deaths over a brief period of time."
good,"The day is never predictable there is always something to keep you on your toes. "
good,"I love my job here at parexel, I just wish I was paid more for all the work that I do.I don't always like the participates but I love the work that I do. Me and my coworkers are like one big family."
good,"Same as above. The company was ok but they were really interested in moving contractors to permanent workers.  They were looking to change both CRAs and PM into these positions, otherwise they were fine as a company."
good,"Great ability to work remotely and is embraced and successful in the company.  However, the work culture is not set and the demands/responsibilities are ever changing.  This encourages turnover and lower continuity with collegues"
good,"This is an extremely demanding and highly challenging work environment with little reward for quality work and very little chance for advancement. The management was unable to truly develop the department of marketing and due to funding cuts and budgetary issues, much of the ability for position to do its job successfully is hindered. As well as management's largely disassociated attitude makes it difficult for one to show or demonstrate their work."
good,Typical CRO with poor work/life balance. Competitive pay with benefits but you earn them if you do your job. Good organizational- led training. You must verbally VOICE to your line manager if you are being worked too hard or you will be spread thin (like every other CRO out there!)...Too many management levels to the point that you forget what to report to whom. Hardest part of the job is attending/contributing to the required number of meetings per day/week to the point you will find yourself working after hours to get your actual work done. Most enjoyable part of the job is quarterly face-to-face meetings and opportunity to be trained if you want to advance your title.
good,"There are constant changes to internal processes, staff and naming conventions often without notice or training. Very little work life balance, most people work 12-14 hrs a day if not more. Consistently adding more work than a person can handle. Disconnect between upper management and employees. "
good,"There was zero room for growth or advancement. Most of the time I got my work done within an hour, and then was put to file documents the remainder of the day."
good,"I had a good opportunity at the Parexel.  My responsibilities were reasonable, good work-life balance, and (mostly) had great colleagues.   My immediate management team was strong and capable with great ideas and balance of work.  Unfortunately, I never quite had the sense that the senior leadership was supportive or forward-thinking enough.  Upon even my first day, the equipment provided was used and > 4 years old and failed quite often.  The technology the company used for VPN access was quite dated (bitlocker thumb drives).   The company is years behind in technology as compared to other medium to large CROs with which I've worked.  On the bright side, this means that there is opportunity to share new ideas.  The team members that I worked with, and that supported me, were great.  I enjoyed the personal atmosphere and the work ethic of those with which I worked."
good,"Not really, employees do not get the chance for career advancement, limited management assistantance, and little  training, very hard place to worked,I will refer anyone at this time to worked there"
good,Le télétravail permet d'être dans une dynamique internationale et de réaliser /suivre les missions qu'elles soient en lien avec l'Asie ou l'Amérique
good,"This company has telecommute opportunities and flexible hours. "
good,"- The employee's improvement in the management/timeliness of the monthly Quality Evaluations was valued."
good,"PAREXEL was an average company that seems to stay true to their business model. Of lesser importance, the company needs to improve their lunch dinning hall."
good,"good environment to learn about bio-pharma industry however, frequent restructuring can make job security an issue. Would recommend for temporary placement, but unlikely for long term employment"
good,The people at the company are great.  co-workers are very supportive. Management is bad. Productivity is measured by numbers which is fine except management keeps changing what is important and defining goals that are loaded with buzzwords but are fundamentally useless on a day to day basis.  Learning is OJT which is fine. there is always a budget crisis.  But the people are really great and the sense of humor at non management levels is enjoyable.
good,Manager unavailable.  Manager didn't return phone calls or emails.  Co-workers helpful.  The hardest part of the job was contacting my manager.  The most enjoyable part was not being micro managed.
good,"I have learned lot by working at Parexel, it a good place to start your clinical research career. Some times the it can be busy and sometime it can be manageable. Good benefits, good people"
good,"PAREXEL's mission is to combine the strength of it's expertise, experience and innovation to advance the worldwide success of the biopharmaceutical and medical device industries in preventing and curing disease"
good,"Management and Pay is good when compared to the Market. Can learn great things like Leadership qualities, Team Management and Project Leading skills."
good,"I interned here in college and was hired immediately afterwards and thought this would be a great opportunity to start my career, but there is no room for growth at this company (within Project Finance)."
good,Worked across several departments and systems. Worked with very smart individuals with different backgrounds.
good,It was very limited experience but had good learning experience. Good Team to work with

good,Productive work environment.  The organization does a lot of good work internationally
good,"Over all parexel is a good place to work. I have learnt so many things about the clinical research organisation.Now ,im looking for a job change."
good,"Great place to start a career, but that is about it. Zero development or leadership from uppers. They expect turnover, and you're just a number."
good,"Work hours begin at 9:30 and ends at 6. Work is being assigned to individual from the respective team leads, it should accomplished by end of the day."
good,The company was acquired by venture capital and culture drastically changed in the last two years. Long term goals were replaced with short term goals. Cascade of the layoffs followed.
good,The flexibility is second to none. The benefits are great and the people are nice. It is hard to get promoted and get a job in a different department.
good,PAREXEL is now decentralizing employees to work from home.   There is not a great workplace culture or interaction with fellow employees.  The most challenging part of the job is the number of projects at the same time and the work-life balance.
good,"Upper management is not connected to the larger work going on, making it difficult to implement meaningful changes that will affect the bottom-line positively."
good,The highlight of the company is the people working for them. I have made beautiful working relationships with just about everyone I have come in contact with. My major gripe is the current direction of the company and lack of stability.
good,"Challenging , fast face, remote , distributed team. Good opportunity to work with different cultures and nationalities. Projects are based on clients and some product debelopment"
good,Everything is good at this company but the service bond makes the employees feel like slave. Employees had to wait for 2 years till completion of bond to take a switch in their career.
good,"I work in Study Start Up which is very fast paced and high demanding role.  You are in a meetings daily or bi-weekly keeping your team informed on the progress of your sites.  I've learned that each study is never the same even though you have the same role.  The interesting part about the job is that things can change in a matter of minutes.  Management is there to assist/guide you, however you are allowed to make decisions that you may think is best for you.  We are world wide so we have a variety of cultures working together.  The hardest part of the job is when your giving unrealistic timelines to meet a deadline.  The final results of getting a site enrolling patients for a study is the best reward."
good,Es un empresa con demasiados sistemas que dificultan la rapidez de la gestion de los proyectos.
good,The day to day management of clinical trials is difficult.  Most of your time is spent putting out fires and ensuring sponsor confidence does not slip.  There is high praise for making a deliverable on time both internally and from the sponsor.
good,"Buen ambiente, he aprendido muchísimo sobre los ensayos clínicos"
good,"Pros - good benefits, ability to work from home, peers are helpful "

good,"PAREXEL is an OK company to work for. They offer a competitive wage and good overall benefits. The company seems to be a little unorganized in their day to day business models, but is currently attempting to improve their processes. The office is very quiet and has little interaction amongst employees outside of scheduled meetings. The work/life balance is above average, specifically in roles that have the capability of working from home if need be."

good,"we have a great time in parexel, we have learned enough skills."
good,Bardzo dobre szkolenia oraz możliwość rozwoju.Słaby social.

good,Productive workplace with very nice co-workers within my department. socialable and work as a team
good,At this company I had the pleasure of being part of a growing team taking every opportunity to learn and develop.
good,Gud company friendly environment but pay is less. Manager thinks like is giving the salary from his pocket not more 4-5 percent of hike. But he will get gud hike he reports to onsite managers
good,"Growing CRO, normal organizational structure and changes as with any large company. Friendly staff, lot of resources available and training to get up to speed."
good,Contract people aren't treated well or valued.  Managers are stressed with high turnover.  Time clock is strictly adhered to since they installed a fingerprint checkin system.
good,"A very dynamic environment, with flexibility within some divisions and potential for progression if you are prepared to challenge yourself and learn new skills."
good,"Friendly and very open co-workers and bosses, never experienced any hostility in the work environment, wide array of experiences to learn from, would work there again"

good,"PAREXEL is okay for the most part. I am sad that I must now leave in order to advance my career, but the closure of the career pathway for me role is completely unacceptable."
good,PAREXEL is like working for any big company. It does have some good programs but upper management is out of touch with their people. There is always room for improvement.

good,"Good training programs, regional travel great for family-work balance . proactive and knowledgeable line and functional management make this a good organization to begin career with"
good,"Having good work culture and provide best services to the employees. Facilities are good. Regarding job not much work pressure, only if there is a deadline."
good,Company is facing rapid growth through acquisition. Leaves little time to invest in employee or efficancy development. This also creates a gap in quality of our service. Unable to work efficiently with volatile organizational structure.

good,"Dans le cadre de divers projets de recherche clinique, je fournissais du support aux chefs de projet, à savoir: Gestion des ressources et analyse de leur impact sur le budget, contrôle d'accès aux systèmes utilisés par l'équipe de travail, coordination des réunions (à distance), préparation de présentations et analyse des rapports en ce qui concerne les étapes importantes du projet, son état économique, le temps de résolution des problèmes de qualité, etc. Communication permanente en anglais, oral et écrit."
good,"Very fast paced work environment. "
good,"En la empresa hay un ambiente cómodo para trabajar."
good,"Handling WW Invoice Processing"
good,PAREXEL is a good place to work but employees feel like numbers not people. Everything is too profit driven and not quality driven.
good,PAREXEL is a great place to work. Employees have various options to choose from for career advancement. It is a great place to begin a career in clinical research.
good,You will learn quite a bit working at PAREXEL. It is a fast paced environment that will teach you to think on your feet. It is great experience for someone starting out in Clinical Research but the limited growth opportunities and low salary does not make it a sustainable place to grow.
good,Great place to learn different jobs and move up the chain.  Must be able to work without a lot of supervision.  May work alone as many teammates are decentralized.
good,"Good company overall, but some things are somewhat shady. The pay is relatively competitive and the job requirements are easy to meet. Performance can be somewhat skewed because they base it almost completely on numbers. That said, if you get on a study with a lot of people that aren't very good then it will be extremely hard to move up the ranks."
good,"Interesting work"
good,"Multiples beneficios para el empleador."
good,"I find Parexel a good place to work."
good,"Company staff including management very supportive."
good,"The responsibility of a Clinical Monitoring Associate (CMA) I is to perform remote clinical monitoring tasks and remote visits for designated projects in accordance with relevant SOPs, study specific procedures and regulations.

good,Trabalho com procedimentos definidos globalmente. Muita prática do inglês e o espanhol.
good,"Arrive in at wotk, prioritize on teh emails I receive and respond to them accordingly. I have to cjeck all my studies and make sure that any outstanding issue is dealt wth, by contacting the relevant peole and applying procedures that will ensure that all data is accurate and as it should be. I help my co-worker as I have more knowledge on some of the things and thus, I am a point of contact on some processes.I work flexi hours and the environment is friendly. I communicate with people globally and it helps me to grow on a professional level."
good,Great flexibility. It offers career growth.  Technically a complex environment with multiple tools to carry out the activities. Dealing with different teams across different countries and time zones gets work done faster.
good,a typical day at work was answering a multi line phone and learning to be patient with the clients. The management was great workplace was also great. the hardest part of the job was when the client didn't understand why they weren't approved for the program we had to explain to them that the computer made the decision. the most enjoyable part about the job was we got a bonus for being polite with the clients.
good,"Lot of fun with colleagues, work environment is good, Team coordination. Line managers will support in any situations with direct interaction with senior management."
good,"If you are not careful, you will lose your sanity in a heartbeat. Some teams will work you to the point of breaking down. Good crop of Line Managers but study leads are lousy"
good,Empresa com cultura de alta performace que busca a qualidade e o desenvolvimento profissional através das experiências cotidiana (learn on the job).
good,"The office time will be eight hours a day and has 24 hours working client services."

good,"Fast passed, leading edge global company with a diverse talent pool."
good,Good company to work. The company vision resonates with employees and it is very rewarding to work in an environment where our jobs helps people with rare diseases. It can be a very high-pressure environment depending on your role and department. The company offers flexibility but the cons of that are blurry lines between work-life and home-life.
good,"Se inicia la jornada laboral a las 8:30 y tenemos a disposición la cocina con cafe, te o leche y panes para tomar un buen desayuno, tambien frutas. en un inicio reviso mis correos para diferenciar los temas mas importantes del dia y poder asi organizar mis tareas."

good,No dayin the life of a CRA is the same. You have to keep traveling and moving. Conduct site visits and Monitor site activities. I work homebased and conduct site visit but based but the organization has a good workplace culture and supportive staffs. Management are proactive and wants their employees to succeed by providing much needed support and development potentials
good,"Parexel had a pretty good work atmosphere. Even though there was alot of information to retain the constant training was extremely useful. Management, unfortunately, was still stuck in the past when it came to marketing and advertisement. There was too much red tape to get marketing campaigns approved by the corporate office."
good,"While most employees and management are nice and friendly, the work culture is stressful, demanding, and tough.  The work load is challenging, a lot of rigid protocols, and at the end the company is servicing the pharmaceutical industries to put out more medications at a quicker pace without really understanding long term effects of those medications on humans."
good,Loved working for Parexel.  Unfortunately our department was disbanded and the jobs sent overseas.  I would still be there if not for the decision to disband the department.
good,"Very professional environment to work in.  Management did not micro manage, however, they provided guidance when I had questions and the overall vibe was very positive."
good,"Je nach Abteilung ändert sich dort die Ansicht auf die Firma."
good,"I enjoyed working there, it was a friendly, collegiate atmosphere.  The place has changed a lot since I worked there though, I understand that most people now work remotely most of the time."
good,"It is a great place to work if you are in the right group with the right management. The company operates as independent SBUs and work groups. Some are fantastic and some, not so much."
good,"PAREXEL exposes its staff to a large landscape of the pharmaceutical and clinical trials industry. You are well equipped with an overarching understanding of the industry, whether you are a software engineer, project manager or requirements analyst. You are well educated and versed in SOPs as an employee."
good,"Good place to work."
good,"I enjoyed my job.Unfortunately my function was transferred to India. If that weren't the case, I would not have left PXL. The business is subject to economic downturns producing layoffs. It is also a very cost conscious industry, resulting in senior employees in high paying countries being replaced by less experienced employees in 3rd world countries."
good,"flexibility working hours and usually can work at home, no need to go to office. Good training system and mentorship , however, a lot of sop and system need to take care."
good,"work life balance is good."
good,"This was a great place to get your foot in the door with clinical research. However, as a Per Diem employee, the hours were never consistent and there was little room for advancement. You would have had to spend years there to advance, and with the little pay they offer it was impossible. This was a second job for me for less than a full year and then I moved on in the field but at a different institute."
good,Worked for them for many years. Nice company with good people. There was limited growth and compensation but hey made up for it with flexible hours to balance home/work life.
good,You get lot of learning time and work pressure is moderate. A very good work life balance. You can learn the industry related topics also get certified and company will reimburse.
good,"In the short 7 months I have worked for the company, I have learned a ton. I did not expect the career to be as lonely. Working 75% by myself, without human interaction."
good,Global CRO with excellent personnel who strive to make a difference. Talented senior management. This company provided my first introduction to Oracle E-Business Suite and Hyperion applications.
good,Good work place to be with and pay is competitive. Flexible in work and considerable. But always know your worth and create new skill sets and you never know your future.
good,"Parexel was a nice place to work. The work culture was positive, and management seemed sincere in their desire to integrate us into the company from GSK. I would still be there if not laid off due to lack of billable work from GlaxoSmithKline. If given an opportunity to return I will seriously consider it."
good,"The staff is great, though it seems if you are popular you are more likely to get an advancement. Hours fall during the summer months. It is a good starter job in starting in the medical field after or while attending school."
good,"Good place to work.  Unfortunately being made redundant at the end of September 2015 though there has been room for development throughout the last 11 years that I have worked at the company.  A low turnover within the Finance team has meant that the core of the group has remained the same and we have grown as a team.  I have learnt various aspects of the Finance department as a whole across the 3 roles that I have held within the company.  A typical day currently involves many discussions with the contracts team and Project managers to break down what is required on change orders for our many clients, reconciling individual study budgets as studies move towards closure, providing client billing forecasts and overseeing the work done by the billers done within the team.  It has been enjoyable and I will be sad to leave at the end of September 2015."

good,"Parexel was my take off - training ground and I learned a great deal! I went from Data Management, Records Manager to Project Coordinator."
good,"** Learn while we work."
good,"I had a very good time working for Parexel. I had a great supervisor who walked me through every step of the process in the beginning and introduced me to the culture of the company and then once this short unofficial training period was over I was on my own."
good,"Started as a per diem, or really 'Full-time temporary' without benefits. Eventually my status was changed to full-time after a year of working there. "
good,"On a daily basis I deal with requests to update a specific Client's database with necessary update, amendments etc from colleagues from various locations worldwide.  I also work through reports which are received on a weekly basis and compare the information on two different systems match.  If not issues are raised to the relevant team members for resolution."
good,"Participate in meetings of deferred and unbilled balances on studies including eliminating credits on aging transaction register"
good,A parte mais difícil do trabalho é a falta de novos desafios profissionais.

good,"The company is growing, and it is a nice place to work.  The compensation and benefits are excellent.  The job is demanding, but it is a great place to be as they continue to grow."
good,"As a Proposal Manager for PAREXEL, most days included multiple hours of teleconferences discussing strategies of how to present the company's best practices, successes and quality of team members to Sponsors. As a global company, the hours of a typical work day varied based on team member locations and time zones, but everyone worked together as fluid as possible to get the work done as efficiently and respectfully as possible. Pre-breakfast calls or late night meetings were not unusual, nor was the understanding that dogs barking, car doors closing, airport/flight/train announcements or children asking questions may briefly interrupt those calls."
good,Busy with lot's of interesting projects and it is international company so you will work with people from all walks of life and living in different countries.
good,"Great place to learn things as a newcomer, life work balance a bit challenging, supportive management team, Global exposure, attractive salary package"
good,"Depending on your department and role, the expectations will vary.  Management in  each department is run differently.  Each department has their own workplace culture"
good,"a very nice atmosphere, relaxed with very good work-life balance. It has a company's restaurant close by where you can enjoy your lunch during your 30 mins break."
good,"Great company to work for. I enjoyed my time here. Excellent work life balance with work from home options. Micromanagement does not exist, allowing employees the freedom to make their own decisions."
good,"Good company to work with.Management collaborates with individual team members to establish a development path, holds employees accountable for their own results"
good,This company provides an excellent working environment for go-getters who like to learn and apply what they learn quickly. The turnaround is high but the people who breeze through are definitely appreciated while they're there.

good,"Parexel has allowed me to grow as an individual."
good,"Usually start my day at work by checking e-mails and mark the important ones for action. Most of my day goes in meetings with my Associate Director, other Service Line owners, Team leads(my reports) and running MIS reports. Customer Care Operations is a perpetually pressured work environment with requests coming from various Clinical Users, Clients and Patients with usually demanding of shorter TAT on delivering resolution. Challenging yet enjoyable. Its a 24/7 operations with your co-workers spread across the shifts so we hardly have daily personal interaction however we make sure to meet up at least bi-weekly."
good,"In Parexel work is good however with respect to Salary is not upto the market standards."
good,PAREXEL has a good work and fast paced environment. Learn many aspects of Early Phase Clinical Research. Diverse work group and opportunities to travel nationally and internationally.
good,"poste international."
good,"Overall, it's a good company to work for. People at Parexel is nice, and I enjoy working at PAREXEL and recommend to everyone."
good,"A typical day at the office, there's always work. A person can get assigned close to 5 studies at once but with different timelines. I have learned that it's very very crucial not to keep your timelines as a result it can have a big impact on delivering poor quality work and on your PMD. So always plan ahead and keep your timelines. I have a great manager one of the best! He always looks after his people! Have the greatest team ever, we have a great relationship always open for new ideas and always innovative. Hardest part of my job is dealing with a very difficult(""knows what they want"") client and working under tight timelines. Good thing is that we're always open to help one another and we have the advantage of working from home, but it shouldn't be used inappropriate."
good,"Parexel is a very good organisation for people with no prior work experience. Working at Parexel teaches you how to handle different types of people, how to manage your work load, how to stand up and   work in a competitive environment."

The hardest part of the job is that it is very demanding and you can fall behind at times due to on going projects that are handed to you. But if you are a hard worker there is enough work to be done and the hours are great.

The day involves a lot of contact with people, ranging from the building management team trying to describe our needs to a contractor who, in turn, transforms them from plan to reality; to an ill employee where I must make the quick decision to simply call their spouse or call 911! I must remain mobile in the event I need to visit another facility and rapid problem solving is also a ""must do"" task of the day. I do a lot of standing and walking and, at any time, be able to lift 35 to 40 pounds or more if necessary! The most important thing I've learned is to be flexible.

I learned a great deal about insurance companies and prescription benefits, how to work collaboratively with others in the health care industry and how to be most effective and make the most impact on the team. The hardest part of the job would be getting denied for prescription coverage knowing that the client is in need of it and all the appropriate steps have been attempted.
