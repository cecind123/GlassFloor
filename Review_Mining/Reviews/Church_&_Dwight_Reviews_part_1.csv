rating,review
bad,"Allow me to put the above statement into context. I have worked extremely hazardous jobs in the past. I have done everything from handling depleted uranium high explosives, to performing work on jumbo jets. The forklift operators are completely out of control in that factory. They are allowed to operate the lifts in an extremely hazardous manner in the name of productivity. The ventilation in the factory is completely sub standard. I would go home at the end of the day and blow oxy clean dust out of my nose. They do not care for their employees at all. The culture is toxic. As long as you agree with the right people you will be fine, disagree and they will get rid of you."
bad,"Extremely unfriendly management, favoritisms and no room for growth. No training and development for employees .long hours of standing. Unfair upper management"
bad,worst place to work ....hard workers get the short end of the stick and or fired....  they like to keep the people who don’t do nothing or the bare minimum....better places out there
bad,"I HIGHLY do not recommend working here. Their concern about safety may seem great, but they seriously lack in action. Way too much favoritism between employees and management."
bad,"This place hires so many illegal immigrants it should be required of employees to learn Spanish to work here. "
bad,"Stressful, not a family friendly environment: no work life balance, not much room for growth,  salary not competitive, benefits and 401k options were strong."
bad,It use to be a lot better place to work but it became a hostile and very unpleasant place to work. I wouldn’t recommend anyone to get a job working there.
bad,The management at Church & Dwight does not care about the working class person. The advance people based on who they like rather than who is qualified for the position.
bad,"This is a horrible place to work. They suck up all your time and then kick you to the curb as soon as you're time slot is up just so that they don't have to provide health benefits and things like PTO. The managers are rude and are only concerned about numbers and their personal bonuses. They tell you there is potential to keep employees permanently upon hire, but that's a lie because they really only extend employees stay by a couple weeks until the employment agency finds someone to fill your position. Everyone is disposable there."
bad,Management is totally screwed up. They expect you to work overtime 5 days a week and still come in on the weekends when they (management) won't. They did away with multi shifts. They treat you like a dog and wonder why nobody gives a dang. STAY AWAY!
bad,good company to work for but the main company was manpower so once the job was over there was no more work to be done they didn't hire anyone on full time
bad,this company is full of people who are idiots. including the contractors from HCL. Bad management and Bad work culture. I would not go back to work for this company again.
bad,Maintenance manager and supervisor have no experience or a clue what they're doing and don't care about anything but themselves bad place to work
bad,"High turn around. Very few employees stay past two years. MANY leave before."
bad,"Physically Demanding!"
bad,Managment awfull alot of RACIST people working there! They treat you like you are a nobody! I dont recomend anyone working there!
bad,I hate this place the pay sucks 3% raises once a year dont take this job what really ar u kidding me freaking kidding 3% of 12.72 =.38 No thanks
bad,Human Resource Department is terrible. HR manager was controlling the entire company including the CEO.  If she did not like someone she set them up for failure and would fire them.  She needs be gired and sent to jail for what she does to people. In luding others iin the HR department.  A big cluque..  better yet. Do Not Accept Position There.
bad,There is a lot of favoritism toward older employees by HR And management. Newer employees do not last long and are unfairly treated. There in no family and work values. You are constantly mandated to work or you  are threatened with your job.
bad,"Managment is a joke to say the least. In almost every department as long as you've shown some form of ""value"" you could get away with anything; drinking at work, being high at work, never showing up, fighting other employees, stealing from the company, harassing employees, dealing narcotics, etc. And your breaks would be cut short if managment was worried about the schedule being done. I was appalled by the lack of management. And forget about speaking with HR, they'll do as little as possible to keep everything hidden under the rug, and the turnover rate is the highest I've ever seen at any company. They work with a temp agency and in my short time being there, I witnessed 7 people come and go. Managment will not tolerate anybody ""challenging"" them for equal rights so if you take that route, expect to be targeted and spoke to about your sudden lack of work ethics. All in all I would give it a 2/10 rating because some of the employees were good people. Get it together managment."
bad,poorly ran... supervisor stays in office all the time...if they come ou on floor they dont speak to  workers on the floor.... you go to HR for questions they act like you are wasting there time..or they dont have a answer for you.....
bad,"The lack of communication and lack of showing appreciation to those who work harder than expected to the job done.  Also, too many new people who are not properly trained which makes the it harder to do your job accurately because you have to constantly keep checking behind the unexperienced trainee.  The most enjoyable part of my job is when the two minute bell rings before seven o'clock!  Sad, but true!"
bad,This company has broken relationship with SAP and run by idiot IT Management. Every single internal project managed internally is a failure. Want to spoil your future job prospects you are welcome to join this company.
bad,"Bottom line up front, as a shift supervisor, you are not able to make any decisions, you are told how to run your shift, you will work a 12 hour shift (13-14 in reality), and you will be critiqued on everything you do."
bad,This is the worst company I’ve ever worked for. You never forget that you are completely dispensable and they treat you as if you’ve committed a triple murder and should be punished and treated very poorly every single day. Management is pathetically incompetent and mostly focused on ways to t screw over the employee. Horrible horrible horrible place to work. Don’t do it!
bad,"A well  organized place to work, if you need time off you better have time available otherwise they write you up and you have a good chance to get kicked out. Don't spend too much time in the Restroom they to a time study, Cameras are everywhere. I am glad to take early retirement I left because I was fed up after 2 Years."
bad,"HR Manager and Asst. had their own agenda. They enforced the rules with some employees, but then let others get away with the same exact things. Couln't get promoted or bid out of your department if you weren't one of the boys."
bad,"One of the best for benefits but that's about it. workplace is dirty with mold on the ceilings producing food!?? Someone needs to investigate. Lots of favoritism in the company and clique like environment which makes new employees discouraged. Physical fights among employees and only God knows how many drug over dose victims. Training isn't good because the people who train you are people who have been there for a period of time and they are miserable. The morale in this place is unheard of. Management has a very small group of people who actually care. The other managers party with employees and involve themselves in drug activities. There was a recent firing of a boss who partied with temps and pictures got out of naked employees. Very professional? this place is perfect for people who only care about money. There is very little promotion within unless you're close with management. They even have open  harassment case where a manager was accused of a certain activity on an employee and the HR manager swept it under the rug. Not to mention she resigned for better opportunities in life. Yeah right. And new HR management has just as much knowledge as temps. Once they started changing management positions and handing jobs to friends based on social reasons instead of job knowledge and skill set, everything fell apart. Not to mention all the lawsuits this place has faced over the past 10 years. all of this will be brought to the media of these unfit working conditions."
bad,"I am surprised I lasted long. With the harassment done to me by multiple co-worker, supervisor and the HR, I really thought I would have been long gone. People have special treatment by tolerating number of people to use their cellphone on the floor, eat on the floor, take multiple break times, take 45mins to an hour lunch, clock out late by staying in the restrooms or cafeteria, tolerating people to use someone else's badge and letting a regular employee access a supervisor's computer without supervisor's supervision. Most of anomalies have been reported to the supervisor but instead of repremanding them, they are warned ahead of time when there is any surprised inspection. And harassing people who report the anomalies. Anomalies reported to the HR Manager and just stated that it's the Supervisor's responsibility to repremand the people who break the rules. Also stated that these are all normal and that ''Sensitive people must leave it or leave the company"". AWFUL! Just vented how I felt. But BEWARE, DO NOT TAKE THE CHANCE! If you love yourself and your well being. Apply in another company. At least until the management has been replaced completely."
bad,"Backwards company.  Had problems with some lady, so have other people and they do nothing about it.  Just let her overstep her boundaries and could care less about it. Other things have happened as well. Not clean at all, bathrooms are filthy."
bad,"The plant I am located at does not, and will not look at your education as a qualification for advancement.  They don’t even care about experience. It’s all about who you know, and how much butt your willling to kiss."
bad,Poor place to work. Most of the managers are hired outside the company. Lots of turnover people rarely stay. It is up to employees to train managers how to do there job.
bad,"This place is beyond ridiculous. They don't care about their employees at all. Their health insurance deductible is outrageous, making it impossible for an employee to reach it.  If you're a single person who wants to work 6-7 days per week, 12 hour shifts, then this is your company."
bad,"Terrible employees, treat you like trash. Racial slurs and rude remarks CONSTANTLY. Only work here if your a Spanish man. Look for something better..."
bad,"Either you were a production worker standing in the same spot for 12 hours a day, driving a forklift kitting all day OR boxing packaged bottles of gummies all day."
bad,"Great place to work, senior management are all down to earth great people. Only downside are the health care benefits. Summer Hours on Fridays are a perk."
bad,Church and Dwight was not a supporting company for management. They left all of us on our own and did not give support. I worked the weekends and had to support 7 different areas without a phone call back ftom area Supervisors
bad,There is no structure or guidance because the management is all over the place. Lab technicians are treated as disposable and often given menial tasks which in no way require a college degree. It is very difficult to learn anything new or gain any meaningful experience. Being treated like a second class citizen by the chemists does not help.
bad,"Equipment in poor state of maintenance, out of adjustment, manufacturer support non existent. Report to production supervisor. Forbidden from stopping equipment unless stopped from catastrophic  failure or approved changeovers. Not a good employer to work for, don't be late of have a transportation issue, you will be discharged."
bad,"To be honest the job itself isn't bad at all. It's probably one of the easiest jobs that I've had. It is my opinion that the problem comes from management. They absolutely suck. The work/life balance is terrible because at any given time you can be told that you have to come in in your day or days off to cover someone else who took off regardless of what you have or had planned and if you don't you'll face severe punishment. In the maintenance department you're expected to come to work and perform the same job as the other mechanics while getting paid substantially less. Raises are based on favoritism and not skill set. I could go on and on but I'm not wasting anymore of my energy on this place... They suck!!!! Soon as I find something else even if I have to take a slight pay cut, I'm out"
bad,"This review is for Victorville location. Which i hear is going south anyway. The job was good, fun even. But management gets involved too much, micro managing and employees are afraid to speak up dor themselves. They stress safety and teamwork, but only if you can produce mass quantities of product, with disregard to quality. While having QA down your back, and management harassing employees."
bad,Management is blind . Hr will do nothing  when an hourly employee  brings proof of misconduct against salary employees. Corporate needs to come in and clean house.
bad,"I spent my shifts testing samples from bulk soap batches and those form in-process checks on the filling lines. I learned nothing here as it was not in pharmaceuticals. Management was incompetent and lackadaisical. The professional culture was insincere and unconcerned with quality control. The hardest part of the job was being told that out of specification results would be passed because it was ""just soap"". The most enjoyable was a couple of the people I worked with."
bad,Management is clueless. Some of the supervisors know nothing about there department and depend on senior employees to much. To much cell phone usage by younger employee's. Don't miss the drama.
bad,"not a clean place to work,hot in summer,cold in winter, no good air quality,stand in 1 spot all night ,lineleader rotates who they want,discrimate against certain nationalities, to much drama, the workers back stabe on another and they try to get you into trouble,ex.not squeezing the tubes on the naire product."
bad,"no room for advancement, Corp. has no clue how to treat their employees.  Many employee create drama and management ignores issues."
bad,"I was assigned a full-time night-shift position at Church & Dwight and remained an employee for roughly three months. During those three months, I experienced the highs and lows that accommodate any warehouse job."
bad,Good company but bad location in Washington. Management stands together even when one of their own is way out of line. Even when one is proven to be doing things against policy they still support and stand behind them.
bad,If you like talking and gossiping then you will get along great with people who worked in the QA department. But if your not about that life the QC department seemed more mature and on task. I obviously didn't last long due to not being a Chatty Kathy.
bad,"its a job to get you back on your feet. i get this job through a temp agency. it was all hear/say and no solid grounds to continue your employment, easily replaced if needed to"
bad,HR department needs to have more qualified employees and that area. Management needs have better respect for all employees at the process area and operation dpt
bad,"Let's lay it all on the table. The work environment is cool sometimes depending on the department you're placed at and the people you're working with. Management utterly sucks as they're willing to discharge hard working super productive employees due to minor attendance issues. They favor some employees over others and are not open to corrective suggestions from employees, though they pretend as though they are. Out of every department at this location, you'll dread the Material Handler department, i.e. ""Cartoning Department"". Here you'll find the most ghetto people on the planet, co-workers who have shady attitudes towards new faces, and trainers who talk and play more than they train."
bad,"The pay is good however we get called in every weekend. Wanted to watch your kids soccer game? Too bad the church and Dwight manager will tell you that their company comes first. It's labor day and you have Monday off. 3 day weekend? Yeah right, forced to work Saturday or Sunday. This company doesnt care in the least about the employees. They've told us numerous times we're all replaceable."
bad,"I worked as a machine operator in dental.  The people I worked with were grouchy and bored.  I worked the 3rd shift from 11-7 so that probably had a lot to do with it."
bad,Good place for work its stressful when it turns in to a routine but you feel good once you get along with the rest of the coworkers its a peace full place
bad,"Would not recommend this place to anyone since the new company took over hey are trying to take the cheap way out they care abt production not .quality of their product I know there are other church and Dwight companies but the in Colonial Heights Va is totally different poor management, u are consider late if you punch in at one minute late of your shift"
bad,"All employees in my office were being humiliated verbally and micromanaged by the senior manager. Fantastic co-workers, excellent training, "
bad,"I have learned some laboratory works and able to use some machines. Although,  the sad part is that no matter how much effort you show but no chance to be a permanent employee."
bad,its a ok job managment sucks you cant ask uestion becouse they make you feel dumb real stress full invirment HOT place to work fires people for the dum things dont even give you a second chance you give them 100% and they fire yu for aking a break becouse your super tired.
bad,Hire only temps. Temps rarely become permanent. Little to no upward mobility. Boring repetitive tasks. Works you like you are replaceable.
bad,"Good work life balance, compensation, benefits"
good,Its a lot of thing that could be better from the supervisors to management. They show favor through out the plant and cover for whom ever they want to.
good,This could be the perfect job if it was not for poor management and low pay. This company says they like to promote from within but never does so. Management is not approachable at all and is not involved in anything until it is time to chastise an employee for doing a bad job.
good,It was long hours working twelve hours shifts on rotating schedule of three days on four days off then four days on three days off. You would work in a clean room environment weighing and packaging the vitamin gummies. And putting them in boxes and palletizing them.  It is a six month temporary job and hard to get hired on full time.
good,"Alot of favoritism, not much room for advancement unless you suck up to the boss's. Its alot like high school with all the gossip and rumors that get spread around."
good,Would be a good place if it offered better benefits and pay. The work is fast paced and time goes by quickly. Flexible work shifts. Their are friendly people there.
good,"Doesn't promote within, doesnt listen to employes about suggestions or ideas. Work place if full of drama and cut throat. Has gotten worse each year.  Very full of politics and is all about who you know in the company to get what you want."
good,"Was fun when I first started but too many cliques. The change in operations managers every year has gone down hill fast. Was a great place to work and grow until management changed. Used to work 9:30 pm to 6:00 am, M-F, with an occasional Saturday or Sunday mandated. In the last 2 to 3 years weekends became more and more mandated. Training is a joke and those with seniority just complain about it but won't do their job to train, that's left to the least experienced. Management became unbearable for a lot of the early hired employees and most of them left the company already. Management only looks out for themselves and there cliques. Human Resource Department is terrible.  HR knows about the problems but doesn't fix it as they are involved. HR will do nothing when an hourly employee brings proof of misconduct against salary employees. HR manager is controlling the entire operation. If she did not like someone, she set them up for failure, then fire them. She needs be fired and sent to jail for what she does to people...including her minions in the HR department. "
good,"No clear direction given to shift supervisors"
good,"My experience with Church and Dwight was alright management was fair people I worked with change in and out a lot, and it was twelve hours night shift so no way having a life out side of work. also i was a temp so not job security for that."
good,"they pick and choose who works and who gets sent home. constantly on your feet. sometimes just standing in one spot and not moving very far. lot of bending, lifting."
good,"check stock levels, check quantities of finished and return goods for logistics, load / unload lorry traffic as required, stock the production line  to ensure continuous production, stack and store inwards goods and log all in/out movements into company SAP system, order quantities as necessary for day and night shift, keep general working area clean and safe, assist colleagues as required, wrap pallets and scan into SAP for export dispatch.recycle all cardboard, plastics and reject components.."
good,I felt targeted most of the time by management. I felt unsafe at work knowing most of the workers are bad people. I do like few of the friends I have.
good,"Management is solely worried about production and nothing else. They will tell employees anything to appease them but then follow through with their own agenda anyway. Promises of advancement aren't seen through. Responsibilities grow but pay does not. They have loopholes which allow them to continue running the company in such a manner. Large amount of favoritism. If you are bilingual and have no care as to what you do or how little you get paid, they will love you here. If not, then it's an okay job as a stepping stone to something better."
good,"You should be ready to work hard and never be appreciated for it. Only raise you get is $.30 yearly, doesnt matter how much you learn, and how capable you are at your position."
good,Not really a good place to work if you like organization and consistency . Managers come and go often .. I’ve been there almost 4 years and I’ve seen at least 4 managers come and go
good,"Lack of communication between management and rank and file on a daily basis. Monthly meetings not sufficient. 24hr, 360 day operation requires constant communication and support. Including engineering."
good,Good experience for a starter but not for a careers because there is no pension. Would be a good company to work for if it offered better benefits to its employees. Its a starter job.
good,Financially Secure Company.  Benefits and Salaries are average.  Culture is challenging for many resulting in very high turnover.  The high turnover can make your job challenging and could make you feel your contributions are making little to no progress.
good,"As a machine operator, I had to make sure I was the first on the production line. Work started at 7am, I was there at 6:30am setting everything up. As the day carried on, I ensured that production for whatever product we had appointed to us ran well, as well as the machines. "
good,My time there I learned to operate heavy industrial mixing vessels and driving forklift and scissor lift for day maintenance repair and other jobs required for production of vitamins
good,"Was a great place to work and grow until management changed. Used to work 5:30 am to 2:00pm, M-F. with an occasional Saturday or Sunday mandated. The last 2 to 3 years there it became more and more mandated of both weekend days when there was not even enough work for the week days. Management became unbearable for a lot of the early hired employees and most of them left the company before I did."
good,It was a job.  Politics and agendas played a role in manager decisions  It was still a good place to work.  They had good perks.  I would recommend working on the back shifts.
good,Was fun when first started but to many chiefs and no Indians. I learned a lot here but the change in opperations managers every year has gone down hill fast.
good,C&D is a growing at a great pace in need to grow technically and operationally.  There's lot of great opportunities if you are looking for challenges.
good,Enjoyed working with fellow co-workers since we always work as a team. Excited to learn new formulas/recipe that will be introduce later to the consumers. Has contributed to the advancement of several R&D projects. Always sure to keep safety as a top priority for the team.
good,"CONS:Ryder, favoritism and micromanagement, Ryder poor management, no team work from most Supervisors and lead, most workers gossip too much, 2 Supervisors back stabber, only 1 great Supervisor- he got your back n really helps u out, HR not good-he's really out to catch u slippin' n finds way to fire u and messes up your paycheck, GM is no good, doesn't know how to manage his management team big pricks."
good,"Church and Dwight pays well, the healthcare and other benefits are unbelievable and 40 hours a week minimum offering overtime. High physical labor and dangerous work areas, cut throat people to work with so drama is an all time high."
good,It was a great experience to work at Church and Dwight . It gave me a window of opportunity to learn different things about the job and I worked with a lot of different people
good,"Management does not seem to care what the people on the floor say, or how the job actually gets done.  They roll out changes that make the floor persons job harder.  HR does not hold the poor employees to any standard. This makes the people who work have to work twice as hard. The pay is good. The giveaway every quarter is very appreciated."
good,"typical work day, too many policies with little regards to personal issues with employees, work loads are not equally done among the crews and some times there is a lack of communication."
good,"The job is simple, but can be stressful on the fact that others co workers did not take their job objectives seriously, therefore the job was a bit challenging. The job consisted of placing plastic detergent bottles into a assembly line to be filled with laundry detergent and Quality Assurance. Management were fair, to the extent of people skills, but doing their jobs it was not pretty. The hardest part of the job was to work with people that were lazy. The enjoyable part of my job was going home."
good,"Pay is fair but if you don't follow their rules and attendance you will be canned in 2 weeks,they have a Union there but no one is in it because it's a Joke."
good,"The company has performed well over the recent years, but vision for future company growth is limited."
good,"El puesto que desempeño es parte de un proyecto, que a pesar de tener excelentes resultados, la empresa no tiene interés en mejorar los beneficios generales de los representantes médicos"
good,"Very very good place to work lots of opportunities to move up or transfer to other departments. Very good pay and benefits. Bosses and employees very helpful. Benefits and pay are very good, overtime usually a very good option if you want it."
good,I like it but they could care more for their employees. Benefits were great and some supervisors were ok. Management seemed careless to employees more then customers.
good,"The contractor i was working for did not give me a great opportunity to move my career forward.  It was a job i could hold until i found another, but no opportunity for a full time hire"
good,IT has been a long time since I worked there but being a small company you do get good experience which will help your career later. Good place to start as a young professional
good,"The days were very boring for me, we inspected vitamins for defects a majority of the time.  We had to wear protective gear every day.  It was a very clean environment since we were working with food products.  I did not feel it was managed very well."
good,Pay is ok but the management sucks . They work you to death if you let them once they see you have been trained and many departments they will use you
good,Loved working with professionals in the work environment. work hard and enjoyed making a difference in the work environment.  Giving good and positive examples.
good,"the job was a learning job that had changes from time to time. Had to stay on top of the procedures.There was no hard or easy part. As long as you did what was required of you, it was good ."
good,Great opportunity to work on leading national brands and be an entrepreneur.  Very limited opportunities for advancement and change driven by corporate structure.
good,"In a typical day I would pump off tankers, unload trucks, sample material for the lab, long commute, & the hardest part of the job was being in inclement weather"
good,Its a start up Department so there has been some bumps in the road but other than a handful of people its a great place to work with tons of benefits and good pay
good,This company offers good benefits and 401K plans to their employees. The company provides uniforms for their workers and has a decent working facility.
good,The hardest part of the job is changing the machines over for a different size. The management is excellent for my shift but overall it could use some work. My colleagues are great easy to get along with and hard working. I have learned how to operate and trouble shoot various types of machines. I really enjoy the competitiveness throughtout the company.
good,A good company to work for. management and coworkers are easy to get along with.
good, Good Place to learn and have scope for development and has good challenges which gives lots of learning.
good," Examined contents and compared with records, such as manifests, invoices and orders, to verify accuracy of incoming and outgoing shipment."
good,I worked there for five years I enjoyed  working there. I didnt want to get laid off but they say they were downsizing. The company was great to work for and I love the jobs I didnt there.
good,"Good place to work, just that hours are too long, also a lack of communication from your superiors made work difficult."
good,La collaboration avec plusieurs départements est essentiel à la bonne gestion de l'entreprise.
good,"The environment is fun at times and noticed there is a lot of favoritism. Low pay for a hard labor job, and they hire lots of temp employees which means it’s hard to get on permanently. Also, lots of work place gossip and it feels like high school at times. If you like work in manufacturing for low pay then this job is for you. Most of the people are pretty cool."
good,Interesting place to work.  Many diverse product lines.  Interaction with corporate office.  Fast-paced work environment.  Dedicated to improving the environment with green initiatives.
good,"Church and Dwight is good job to have that is great on benefits and 401k. Average paying job, but no growth or raises no matter how long you have work here. Hard to get by."
good,The hard part of job standing in one spot to sort the gummies and then having to tear the machine apart to deep clean and looking at gummies all nite and puting the machine back together when cleaned up
good,"Most newly graduates start off as temporary employees. If you showcase your skills, work hard and network, you will most likely get a permanent position. Great managers, love what I do. One complaint is the HR department. HR treats entry level employees as second class citizens. Although full-time, HR will breathe down your neck and treat you like an hourly employee. Best part of the job is working with innovative, driven individuals committed to the projects. I am speaking to R&D. Least enjoyable part of the job is only 10 day vacations for entry level workers and low pay. Got to start somewhere, I guess. CHD is a great place to START your career- as for as longevity.. even my manager tells me: ""If you are really good at what you do, you probably won't last here."" Turnover rate = HIGH."
good,"Lack of communication,out dated machines. Inconsistent work practices,unneeded competition between work shifts.Constant change of regulations"
good,"Lean company, provides ample opportunity for young professionals to make an impact, but becomes difficult to advance due to lean culture.  Very little flexibility (limited work at home, no alternate hours/compressed work week), average pay, however company has strong track record of success."
good,"Fast-paced environment with a core competency of being able to deal with ambiguity on a daily basis.  Strong performance on Wall Street and bonuses every year in the last 7 years, even in down-trodden economy.  Lead shareholder of sales for most power brands.  Company sponsored activities at Arm & Hammer Park."
good,"I've work in Church & Dwight long enough to observe and experience the favoritism and politics issues in this plantation. Supervisor only sees who he wants to see. From temp to tenure employees, people break rules. People take their lunches / breaks for 30 to 60 mins, walk around during work hours (cafeteria, warehouse breakroom, restrooms & /or cars), hanging out in the restrooms for 30 to 60 mins so they can punch out late, using their cellphones in the operations floor, eating gum and / or candies in the operations floor, and signing up for over time but doing nothing. But the Supervisor only sees who he wants to see. People who do any rule breaking for 1 or 2 times, get in trouble if you are not the favorite, with public humiliation included. Favorite employees get the liniency no matter how manny times they break the rules. Just very bias and unfair."
good,Church & Dwight is a decent place to work. They pay pretty well according to your job title. The management was good and stood by their employees. At the end of each quarter they give you product to take home. You can get almost as much OT as you want.
good,"Honestly I have never found a job like this. I would give about anything to go back. But over the years as management changed things got kind of bad. I remember in one meeting, a lot of us were upset because we were only given one week notice of our shift being removed. And they weren't even going to give us that, but one guy demanded we know. We were used to working 6pm-6am.. and it was all changing. We were forced to change our shift to 6am-6pm. Someone spoke up about it, and the plant manager was completely rude. He said, ""If you don't like it, quit."" It just didn't seem professional at all. The new management knew nothing about the place. The Human Resources lady banned tank tops and short shorts... not realizing, HELLO everyone here is over 18 and there is no AC and we work with hot machines. It wasn't until a girl passed out on the line they realized they should allow us to wear whatever we wanted. I did a lot of hard work for this company. I went above and beyond my job requirements. But they REFUSE to hire me back. I left on good terms, and the only reason I left was so I could join my fiance in his home country. Things didn't work out between us, and I tried to get my job back. I called once a week.. they always told me to call back, but after months I realized they were stringing me along. I am re-hireable, my direct bosses loved me, but for some unknown reason they wouldn't let me come back. The people I worked with on a daily basis became like a family to me. It was almost us against them when it came to those in the cool air conditioned offices up front. The job"
good,"stressful work place and fast pace. It's a work place for anybody who doesn't have kids. Rarely hire direct applicant, mostly hire through employment agency for six months only."
good,"Supervisor of warehouse/Lead SUCK! They create a horrible work environment for everyone, 2 hour morning meetings talking bad about a different employee/supervisor each day. Doesn't have a clue what consists of the job because all they do is gossip to whoever will listen! Both of them are complete idiots and everyone knows it but them!!!"
good,it was ok it was a job it paid it was just a temp job i could still be there but i need part time for college
good,I'm summary working for Church & Dwight very good company only managers have a very high turnover therefore is ending the opportunity for the employees to search for other employment.
good,"Dia dia bem corriqueiro, sempre novos ensinamentos, ambiente agradável, geralmente quem entra na empresa não quer sair, porém com a crise não há mais investimentos no Brasil."

good,new schedule from upper management will not work for my lifestyle. otherwise as long as you safely do your job its a good place to work. Most of the work is not physical just long days
good,"Overall a great experience, the company started making many changes which I found unfavorable toward the end of my employment. They do offer many decent benefits, as well as product giveaways which make the job much sweeter."
good,Great place to work and advance.  You have to be proactive on advancement.  Weekend and holiday work is required at times.  Product give aways are nice.
good,"C&D is working to match competitors. As the company expands, management is working towards catching up with best in class processes and benefits. The company is investing in its people."
good,"A typical day usually involved making machinery adjustments and monitoring machine operation. After a period of time you tend to learn most of the common equipment malfunctions and solutions. Management for the most part is pretty informative, but didn't quite always see situations from a technicians point of view. Overall the work environment is fairly pleasant. The hardest part of the job in my department was probably dealing with the heat . The most enjoyable part of the job was definitely the people."

good,"Very stressful environment."
good,"overall I learned a lot from this company, some of it good and some of it bad.  I learned the bad side of office politics and how the can be hard to deal with."
good,C&D is very lean and requires that you perform more than one job function.  Very fast paced but not truly employee focused.  Training is lacking and compensation is low.
good,A very good place to work. Everyone is very helpful. Learned a lot of things. Fast placed environment. Staff is friendly. Very high turnover rate. Great place to start working straight out of college.

good,"I was good at my job and they put a tremendous amount of work on me which came from six other individuals, plus my boss. I enjoyed my work, but I was never appreciated for it. Many other employees in my position felt the same way. When I resigned from the company, no one internally wanted to work for my group because they were all type A personality people. They ususally hire from within first, but they had to find someone from outside the company. When they filled my position, my position was re-structured and all the work I did was now being done by four people."
good,"Lots of great people working there, i had to leave my job there due to an injury and I wasn’t able to take care of my family on the pay i was getting so i had to leave"

good,"I learned a lot about the abrasive blast cleaning business, and enjoyed traveling to many sites around the USA to support operation."
good,"I loved this job, everyday the people there were great. Fun conversations just a great environment to work in!"
good,working at church and dwight was a challenge at first because u have to roll the protection supplies and send them down the line and pack them in boxes according to weight

good,"Work was both strenuous and fulfilling."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company.  The great things they do is are:  If you break a record on a line, everyone on that line will get free lunch. But they don't pay the temps lunch since the temps are the ones that are doing most of the work.  Most people are friendly, some aren't.  Some want to learn where most doesn't want to learn any other lines.  A new line comes in, and no one wants to learn it.  They want to stick with their line that they know how to do and go top pay.  They pay people high pay that don't want to learn how to do every line.  Management thinks they know what goes on out on the floor but they are hardly ever on there.  Did enjoy the outings they supplied like Worlds of Fun, Kansas City Royals games, Cookout, and free giveaways for fulltimers.   The temps who work there also and do more work than some of the fulltimers do not get any free detergent."
good,small office and very personable and were treated like family.  Received free products we represented which was a nice perk. Management was very understanding if you needed time off.

good,"They have great benefits, many positions for a variety of skills, and they care very much for safety. Management isn't necessarily bad, it is just that many people are on different pages and usually ends up in some sort of dilemma. This really is a great place to work and I think most people would enjoy the experience."

good,An employee can have a very positive experience with this company if s/he is motivated by the work to dive in and accomplish goals.  Leadership depends on the department.  I would not recommend line work in manufacturing unless someone has no career goal to advance.  Packaging department seems to function at a higher level.  Custodial team was dysfunctional when I worked there.
good,The usual secretarial job.  Mostly worked on computer and typing reports and preparing batch records for the preparing of products and then reviewing batch records for release of product.

I feel important at work, and peopl treat me like I know what I'm doing and it feels good that people can come to me for help. The hardest part though is when there is next to nothing to do, but i have to sit in my office just in case someone does need something."
good,"Check all emails and address issues that pertain to inventory. I work with any issues that the operators may have that prevent them from doing their job and is related to inventory. I release product for upcoming orders and if our Customer Service people need my help with inventory issues such as; orders will not allocate, product needs a pick slot and anything else they may need I will assit."
