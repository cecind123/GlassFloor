bad,"They don't care about you, they keep cutting budget, they give you a lot of work, not even a thank you or appreciation. Cheap company, you haver to pay for everything- no freebies or benefits. They give you impossible task and train a lot of new people but they don't want over time and if you do, They make you feel bad like it's your fault. Bosses they don't even say hi or good morning. A bunch of stuck up people. Don't work here, worst place ever! and they pay the lowest."
bad,"After transferring to the Security Department after a year as a Player's Services Rep, I had worked and volunteered countless overtimes to help them accommodate for their lack of night shift employees. Simply because I didn't see a minor get on the boat while I had answered a phone call to a higher-up, they decided to suspend me for an entire week and then told me I was fired. They even protested my unemploynent so I had to live on EBT until found  a new job."
bad,Management is very lazy the manager does not know how to run a warehouse she is very racist uses profanity a lot to her employees and supervisor is no better I worked there before the training is unorganized and they don’t train right they throw you out there I got hurt in the warehouse and the supervisor and management never checked on me to see how I was doing or if I was okay.
bad,"Extremely corrupt management with a double standard. Management using racial language and racial slurs, management did nothing but used fundamental requirements against employees they did not like. Management used contentious objections against certain employees even after reviewing evidence of compliance."
bad,"They are dictators! If you want to try and move up or to a different department and your boss doesn't want you to, they simple write you up to block your transfer. Lots of drama and childish nonsense. Tattletaling is encouraged!"
bad,"management was horrible surveillance superintendant played favorites no family life,kiss weekends and holidays good bye and they give a whopping 21 cent raise after you put in about 14 months how live on that considering your starting pay was horrible"
bad,"Do NOT work there!! Any other place is a better pay!! They have 22 tables of Baccarrat, where the customers NEVER tip!!! They stiff you all the time!! 30 dealers every shift , make NO TIPS!!"
bad,I don’t get paid enough to put up with all the negativity and attitude with the new manager that got promoted. Technicians are dropping like flys and everyone else is left to pick up the slack with no extra pay and mandatory overtime. With this new manager your personal life comes last even though she is home between 4-4:30pm everyday. She will gps and micromanage you to death at this lowest paid position
bad,"Don’t work for casino in Mulvane cause there’s way too much drama and managers play Favorites and it a waste of your time. U won’t have a set schedule and u be lucky to even get two days off back to back if not u will work four and a day off then two then another day if u lucky. Full time to them is 32 hrs and the pay isn’t worth it if u work in the food and beverage.  Back Stabbing people also.  If u ask for a day off u be lucky to get it off and they write u up if they gets chance . "
bad,"Banquet dept.  Horrible food, unorganized and clueless managers, no structure or organization.  Quit after 3 days.  Very low pay by industry standards.  Extremely old and very dirty back hallways.  Scummy employees wear filthy uniforms because Boyd doesn't clean them. If you have one ounce of class, you will not fit in there. RUN!!"
bad,"Messy management, favoritism too much gossip among managers and older coworkers. managers were rude and talk down to you like you're stupid. "
bad,"The workplace culture here sucked."
bad,"This was the worst job I have ever had! I started in 2018 and left in 2018"
bad,Could not eat it of serve it so I left Was moved around a lot was bad hours and did not get benefits was a steady extra moved to another location and was payed less for the same job so i left and now fighting with company over back pay.
bad,"Spent three years in the company, and is the purest definition of dead-end. On-call employees are treated like machines and little else; management expects you to work whenever they whim and punish should you refuse them. On-call workers are ineligible for transfers within properties and between no matter how many years you put in with the company. Even if you're part-time/full-time, management makes any meaningful upward mobility next to impossible. Company culture is virtually nonexistent save for making as much money as possible regardless of how staff is treated in the process. The customer base isn't much better, as unless they're hindering the money-making, their poor behaviors are overlooked."
bad,"Management sucks if your not one of their friends you stay in trouble.   I never been in trouble so much for nothing.  They think their metro, not their only security but so many power trips.   To many corporals that they think their better.  It's not team work here."
bad,"If you're interested in seeing what 1950s ""Old Boy"" systems are like, apply at Boyd. If you're a woman, a minority, or simply not a white male, do not expect advancement."
bad,"In my experience with Boyd gaming there is an utter lack of any coherent management. I've lost count of the times I've been lied to. Ultimately they don't give raises. Loyalty and integrity mean nothing to management. I would never encourage anyone to work for Boyd. I have known many people that work at other casinos never have they experienced anything like the typical ""boyd"" experience. My interview was a ""bait and switch"" which lead me to endure conditions I would never had if not for the false hope of a future with this company which is a bold face lie."
bad,Do not work here. They treat you like garbage. Ran this place into the ground a long time ago. The gm is a real piece of work. Lp with a chip on her shoulder. If you like being talked down to and disrespected on regular basis then this is the place for you. They even try to set you up to get fired on the regular.
bad,"Management cares  nothing about you. They let the high rollers treat us like dirt.  Low pay, tip share, and the majority of the guests don't tip. They took out our cooked food that was delicious in the EDR and replaced it with expensive snack food."
bad,"Company boasts about ""Boyd Style"" but does not uphold that philosophy. According to Boyd style, I was encouraged to address any concerns, and when I did address a few observations/concerns in my training period they decided to term me 17 days into my employment having had positive reviews from coworker Trainer and Management. Was never told by management I wasn't performing well, on the contrary I received positive comments. Colleagues were not welcoming. Management plays favorites. Was forced to work in an 80 degree office. Training/Trainer was bad - either his way or no way at all. Be very wary about accepting a position within Human Resources."
bad,"- 1% raises while Management is overpaid with bonuses"
bad,"A bunch of liars "
bad,"From the management to ""free lunch."" This place is garbage. The only people that are happy here are the people who opened with the boat. They don't know any better. It's a complete dead end job. They don't work around schedules. You have to literally be dying to get paid time off. The pay itself is horrible. You would think being that this is a casino you'd get paid more. Absolutely not. The benefits are probably as bad as management. Each department is ran by some over weight power hungry slob. I wouldn't recommened this job. Oh and let's not forget their famous attendance point system. Such a joke considering you have to take a shuttle bus to the casino, and the employees driving the bus are in la la land ninety percent of the time. They pass you up. They drive entirely too slow. Since Vincent left this place it's just gone downhill. They valet supervisors are doing taxes in the office while valet drivers are smashing up customer cars. You have dealers who are always on some type of muscle relaxer. Grooming standards here are absurd. I'm surprised this place is still running. Luckily for me I've found a new job using this website here. Good luck to you all, please don't apply here!"
bad,"I currently work at Kansas Star Casino. I am a bright, educated, very hard working person. I am not recognized at all for my work even though my ""team"" would be a mess if they had to do what I do. My work goes unnoticed unless it's not done so people take me and what I do for granted. I am way under paid, benefits are outrageously expensive, not to mention the coverage is barley considered coverage for the premium price. The management staff is very ""clicky"" and they don't hold their employees on the same level. If they're friends, it's okay to break the rules with no punishment, but if management does not like you, be ready for unjustifiable write ups that will eventually lead to termination. Employees are treated so poorly by supervisors and managers, it's unreal! In my department all of the supervisors are on at least one type of illegal drug but it's overlooked because the director is too lazy to find better, smarter, more professional staff. He also knows he would have to pay an actual livable wage if he hired good staff but he's a Penny pincher with his staff and pays them the very minimum. And forget annual raises! The maximum raise is 2% but good luck even getting that. Most people get .75-1.15% even if they deserve more because the directors have payroll budget to meet and if they don't, the directors don't get their huge annual bonuses. No one likes to help anyone else.... Not on their team, not in another department, not anywhere. This is a very selfish and poorly run environment to work in. I wouldn't recommend this company to my worst enemy! You WILL be treated"
bad,"This place, is by FAR the most god awful place I've ever been employed (yes, even worse than my high school fast food jobs)  "
bad,"I was the most qualified. I was liked by the chefs. I was basically told I had the job then discriminated against because I have a medical marijuana card ;( Their loss... I am creative, hardworking, loyal and great at what I do."
bad,"Only applies to the California Hotel & Casino, since there is no culinary union they do with their employees as they please and even the human resources lady on property knows little about their rules and careless for finding out and just says whatever she thinks it is without finding the right info, corporate website says one think she does not care hear or to know about it, managers have their preferred people that do whatever they want and since there is no union again as employee better don't say anything or might get statement advising if it's not ok for you, you can go home, get hire to be on call forever even when they need personnel and rather get more outside to be on call than to give full time jobs, employees is common to see 1-2 years or longer on-call before getting full time jobs, they said that if in your 90 days after you decide to seek a different position within the property they welcome your desire to learn and with their support is possible... well it does not happen like that, they list jobs that do not follow up on filling up position for months, some have been there for so many years that they have forgotten how to deliver great customer service but since they have been there so long that no one tell them anything, since they allow employees to gamble while on break or after shift, many have gambling issues. They keep cutting benefits and at times they have you working 2 jobs for the same pay."
bad,The facility dicrector is very arrogant an not professional. Also seniority dont count for anything there an there pay very low. So if i had any advice for the people do not waste your time there.
bad,"my experience working with this company was horrible , i never had a traumatic experienced in my life .suncoast food and beverage department especially the manager no education and lack of experience run the coffee shop like like gangster ,big time favoritism ,big on discrimination,dress like a ghetto, ... head of human resources only can talk but dont and wont listen to any opinion , too scared to lose her job so she will make decision base on who got power.. management are nice to the person who got power below them are nothing but a but of course not all of the manager some deserve promotion but this only lady D----- made malicious gossip she loved getting people fired and the headof human resources love this kind of activities.. boyd gaming where is your open door policy???? Doors should be shut to this kind of employee who spoil the name of a nice company.shame on u power hungry ,heartless n conniving ."
bad,"This is where your career will go-to die. Endless meetings about meetings. Legacy employees hate new employees because they don't want to learn. Extreme micro managing, and not a place to succeed. Glass door has this company rated at 2. Glass door isn't lying!!!!"
bad,Over the last few years Boyd style is gone.  The company does not have a defined mentorship program and most Directors and VP's are concerned more about keeping their employment than nurturing team-members to advance in their career.
bad,"Very 1975 They don't care about there employees. there "" Boyd Style "" Is worse then most Casinos. Management is very not technical. "
bad,I enjoy my job and have been very lucky to have great co-workers.
bad,Escort money
bad,"My department wasn’t bad, but the other teams, higher ups, and project managers made performing my job very difficult, because no one knows what they need to get done or get accomplished to begin with! This is difficult to deal with when your department has to be the transit center of getting information, incidents, and communications routed to all other departments and between 23 different properties as well as 3 different headquarters and corporate buildings across the entire country. The worst offense being that due to multi-state compliance issues, nothing is standardize and we have to navigate every states’ laws like a minefield with limited knowledge and exposure. As another reviewer of possibly a former colleague said, there is too much change for the sake of change, and with that brought a steady stream of new problems and challenges that to this day, much time after I have quit, hasn’t been resolved. I would like this to be words of discourage from ever taking a position at this place. You will be working in a chaotic place where no one knows what they are doing, everything gets left unfinished, blame will be shoved on you when you weren’t even part of a problem that didn’t correspond with your team, and worst of all, not even be given credentials to do your basic tasks even after TWO years into employment."
bad,"Simply the worst job I've had in all my life. Worked in many casinos, this was by far the worst. Good ol boys network, if your ""in"" you'll be ok. If not, they literally made life miserable."
bad,Sad that permanent employees are so insecure about their jobs that they will do whatever it takes to make sure no one outside their circle has a chance.  Just ridiculous.   High school all over again.
bad,"Compensation is very low (laughable). I only took the position because I was severed from a competing company and had the position thrown at me. They will lie to you about your position and title to get you in. My duties and title changed upon starting without renegotiating my compensation.  Boyd Gaming Corporation is the most unorganized company I've ever worked for. The work is not challenging, no one seems to know anything or really wants to make a difference, make changes or cares to. Just bodies in seats. Not an innovative company at all. New ideas seemed to be frowned upon and old outdated processes are kept. They are miles behind the industry. I will say they are trying to become a better company, but low pay and lack of transparency about job titles and duties pushes people with talent away. If you want to come to work, not be challenged, do minimal work and collect a paycheck, then Boyd is for you"
bad,Boyd runs its business by chronically understaffing and underpaying their employees. Plan on skipping lunch breaks and staying late in order to get your work done. Corporate is rude and has ignored our plea for help. Everyone is exhausted and looking for another job. If you want to work here plan on being treated like a pawn to Boyd corporate. They somehow have enough money to buy 5 new casinos but don’t have enough to give us a livable wage. Employees are frustrated and have been taking it out on each other. It’s painful to have to go into work everyday knowing you work for such an evil corporation.
bad,Not the best place to work at. Pay not worth the work they want you to do. A lot of corruption go on in that place of business. Nothing ever gets done about anything personal as to co workers being bullied and business wise.
bad,"I worked at the Suncoast for 8 years, in 2006 Boyd gaming owned it and the casino begins to go down, low quality food, no compensing costumers as they get used to with the previous owner, the management it's horrible, my coworkers and I complained about her attitude in HR but they never did nothing, those king of supervisor are the one who pick on you without a reason even if you are a good worker."
bad,The place is run like your easy replaceable. Don’t hang on to the good and hard working employees. When I really needed the  company. The company failed me. I hope no one else has to go through what I we t through . Very traumatic
bad,"Used to be a good place to work. Going down hill fast. Good job security, almost impossible to get fired. Raises and promotions are nearly non-existent. They claim they need to cut benefits because there isn't enough money but they continue to buy more casinos all the time."
bad,"Boyd Gaming has grown a lot over the last 10 years and unfortunately it has done so mainly on the backs of its employees as revenues haven't gone up, but the company has found lots of ways to cut back and reduce expenses to make their bottom line look better than it is.  In a similar fashion they have cut back on guest amenities which is also why revenues are flat.  Nice that they opened several new restaurants, but really how many Steakhouses do you need in Las Vegas (Cornerstone, Angry Butcher, Alder and Birch, Redwood Grill, etc)?"
bad,It was ok i was past employee went above beyond for the. My work was was outstanding from what i got told an did they appricate work u did No all they did was push more on u when u do job of 3 people. Pay was poor for what u did for compamy. I worked there 5 years an all u saw if u wherent there favorite  person they just didnt care for u. U are just number to them. They would rather hire new pay low pay than keep long term people.. when i first started it was good then it just changed for bad. Really cant make living an they are lowest paying place on coast.
bad,Mom taught me to never say anything if there is nothing good to say.  Bad Upper management and A LOT of favoritism!!!!  Nothing else positive to say but the Fremont REALLY is a piece of ...
bad,"Very low pay, dead end job, benefits are the worst I've ever had. Management is really good. Co workers will back stab you in the back. Just stay far far away from all boyd gaming jobs if you have bills to pay,"
bad,"While Boyd gaming executive get pay millions, regular employes get worst pay rate casino only gives25 cents or less horrible, under pay every other casino gets decent pay or double don't expect to make a living with there pay rate.warehouse receiver and drivers get pay miserable rates when other companies are the highest pay in that department no wonder nobody last in this company."
bad,"The pay was the best thing about the job.  They expect the work of 3 people from 1 person.  I worked for them for 6 months and absolutely hated every minute I was at work.  Management was useless and was only around to complain if you were the slightest behind, but never would help get caught up.  I was also a ""steady extra"" which means I got part time hours with quite literally no benefits at all, not even paid days off even if I worked there for years."
bad,I worked in the marketing dept. Sam's Town will have you doing multiple jobs at a very low pay. Management is horrible. I wouldn't recommend this job to my worse enemy. Not to mention all the hateful and jealous coworkers. You can't advance with this company if you not a certain color.
bad,"Starting pay in surveillance is 13.70 with annual raises of 1-3 precent depending on job performance."
bad,"If you are looking for good pay without a degree, this is a good job, but not a career. Everything else else pretty much sucks about this company but I'll leave it at that."
bad,"In my experience with Boyd gaming there is an utter lack of any coherent management. I've lost count of the times I've been lied to. Ultimately they don't give raises. Loyalty and integrity mean nothing to management. I would never encourage anyone to work for Boyd. I have known many people that work at other casinos never have they experienced anything like the typical ""boyd"" experience. My interview was a ""bait and switch"" which lead me to endure conditions I would never had if not for the false hope of a future with this company which is a bold face lie.. they do not care about you WHAT SO EVER. The only good people ARE YOUR SUPERVISOR THEY SHOW THEY CARE BUT THEIR ISNT MUCH THEY CAN DO TO HELP YOU BECAUSE THEY ARE LIMITED. They pay? Forget about it if you think you can work and provide for ANYTHING on your own. This place is really a joke. I wouldnt advise ANYONE to work here at all!!!!!"
bad,"This is the worst place I ever work for. They give you an impossible to complete and blame you for not completing that task. The work/life balance is horrible. You cannot take care of your family, go see doctors, or enjoy the little things in life. Your are expected to devote majority of your time to the company. Your work extreme hours during close and expected to work 40+ during the non close periods. Do not work here if you want a good career in Accounting."
bad,"Boyd Gaming sold me on a non-existent culture where you are under appreciated. You are expected to work in an environment where you have zero documentation, and must document while being highly over worked and highly underpaid/under appreciated. Management only cares about themselves and are extremely fake. They will tell you that you are doing a great job and then one day state that your skills have plateaued and are difficult to talk to, only caveat is that they don’t talk to you. This is not a company that is good to work for. They do not value a work/life balance and expect you to be a 24/7 employee."
bad,[Joker's Wild Casino]:The place has horrible management and they are just awful. Warning Just don't apply with them. Our staff is short handed and they want us to do they impossible.
bad,Management does not communicate events and employees are left to figure it out on their own ..Second hand smoke and unruly customers were the cause for me leaving .
bad,The GM was of poor character and acted unprofessional.  Started creating unsafe working environment.  The Corporate staff was also of little help.  Poor resources and poor guidance.
bad,"Took an opportunity in the Boyd Gaming Corporate office that I will always regret. I was sold a culture that does not exist. I'm good with process, but not when process changes weekly, and includes process that overwrites previous process enacted."
bad,Upper management was good but management with my department was bad. They need to look into new supervisors and the turnover rate wouldnt be so bad
bad,The management is very poor they treat u like you are in prison the ppl in jail get treated better they talk to u any kind of way they just need better management
bad,"I’ve been working at Boyd Gaming as a graphic designer for several years at the Dubuque office.  I’ve worked in fast paced environments previously but this place is chaotic, unorganized, panicked, and bass ackwards.  The uneducated casinos run the show and designers are given no direction and no time to complete projects.  Any suggestions are met with “well that’s just not how we do things here.”  Account managers load work on a few select designers while the rest lounge around all day.  If you aren’t constantly smiling you will be accused of not representing “Boyd Style” and will be punished.  The company has more money than God but pays everyone peanuts."
bad,"Unfortunately this company has fallen behind for all the wrong reasons. If your starting out this might be an ok job, but if you have experience this is not the company for you. This company is still living in the past that gambling is the way to go and has forgotten about non-gaming.  The worst part is that no one at ANY level of management will ever listen, they all believe they are Steve Jobs visionaries.  They are so afraid of change its sickening, so they use fear to stop any conflict even the kind that would help them.  The customers are not to bad, however, the customer service is a disorganized mess as that is the only thing management believes that counts. Co-workers are just the pieces of the chess board to get big bonuses, but for the most part are good people, the front line that is.  The pay is low which makes it hard, the majority of guests are ok too.  Benefit prices have tripled in four years.  This is not a progressive free thinking place to work you have better options unless you are new to the business."
bad,Working here is not good. Especially security. Get treated not very well and pay is worse. Considered not money makers so get payed very low and looked down upon even though security gets called to help with everything and keeps the casino from getting big fines by going their jobs. They don't tell you in interviews or anywhere how much you'll get paid or the fact they don't have holiday pay.
bad,"They do no enforce codes of conduct and will allow almost anything from what they consider to be ""high end"" players."
bad,"Supervisors were great, above that the managers just didn't care about their employees. When one department loses 70% of it's staff including 2 supervisors in a span of 3 months you know something needs to be look into."
bad,"You won’t gain any professional skills to take with you if you plan on leaving. No mentorship, no career development, and no advancement opportunities. I can only speak for my dept."
bad,"I was told as a child, “If you cannot say something nice, say nothing.”"
bad,Very short staffed.  A typical day at work was very overwhelming.  Took 4 people's job increased the work load and one person performed.  The HRD is overwhelmed with the work load.
bad,"When I started working for this company I thought it was a nice job until I start noticing favoritism. The management of the hotel department is awful. They do not care about their employees, just as long as the job gets done they do not care how it get done nor how long. There's no such thing as team work in the hotel department. Your PTO's are very hard to get, you might put your request in first but the person after you might get it. Your job title might say Clerk II Hotel or Front Desk Clerk but you will be doing 4 or 5 other jobs. Housekeeping, PBX Operator, Bellman, answering maintenance radio calls etc. You will hardly ever have a set schedule. You will never get off on time. Supervisor is very rude along with the hotel department manager. Also the business at Sam's Town is extremely slow. This company is more of a casino that cater to the elderly."
bad,"The company is not responsive to the workplace issues.  It is grossly understaffed and expects you to handle the issues without management intervention. The company thinks it is saving money by under staffing, but is only costing itself customers and income."
bad,Worked with company as an Intern.  Small team environment.  Local properties
bad,"My coworkers are honestly the only reason I have stayed as long as I have. The immediate supervisors are kept out of the loop just as much as the regular team members. It's the managers and directors who seem to have a lack of care for their staff, atleast for my department. We cannot retain employees due to the mismanagement of the current staff and the new hires dont see it worthwhile to stay because of the current climate. If you submit a suggestion using the provided suggestion box, you never even so much as recieve a response."
bad,"In the casino industry, you will be expected to meet the needs of the guest. So if you are required to stay late because they don't want to close a game, you're stuck. If it's too slow to keep people, you can get out, or be forced out. The hours are poor, and no incentive to work nights. You will be put on a schedule that is the low end of the totem pole, and you will drop the most tips, but you get payed the same as everyone that can't drop a dime."
bad,"I enjoy the customer interaction with the job I perform. The company has a hard time staffing the Department I work in. I never here positive remarks from other employees, just the negative. Support from management is poor. I feel a better job in communicating can result in a positive work environment."
bad,they offert you a full time job but you never make it to full time.all ways trickyng emploeeys.always lying on raices.every year is a new lie.they ask you to work harder every year but at the end of the year you are worth nothing
bad,I left here because I had concerns about the safety of the pool guests that management refused to address. Several guests were injured even after I brought certain discrepancies to light.  The management when I started was very helpful and friendly though. And the people I worked with were amazing.
bad,May all take note and caution prior to applying for a position within this company. Although you may very well enjoy it thoroughly. I loved it for the first 6 months and ever since it's seemed nothing short of politics with a slight taste of corruption corroded throughout the industry.
bad,"I am toying with quitting this job after only 3.5 months of abuse, but I'd like to see how easy it is to make a lateral move first. HR seems to be trying, even though it looks as if the poor souls are buried under boxes of useless paperwork. "
bad,"Work is only good if you want it to be. Cool life, but a lot of butholes. Some people will try to look down on you for nothing."
bad,"Dealing with senior people. Some are easy to deal, but some are nasty. Coworkers are great. Management is all right. Job opportunity depends on who you know. Pay scale is low."
bad,"People are nice to work with, its a fun and happy place, there's a lot to learn, the insurance is pretty good too. Sometime's they don't care if there's some action that needs to be done. They ignore it. And you get overworked."
bad,I'm a current employee at The Orleans Hotel and Casino here in Las Vegas and the only thing I can say is Do not apply for the Count Room for this casino Boyd gaming prides itself in having their employees work as a team which is Not happening in this dept pretty much almost everyone has bad attitudes towards each other and they do a lot of complaining about each other then their always complaining about being short handed they have one guy who's on call but they won't call him when we need people on certain days in short I'm disgusted and I regret coming to this dept I also have to say I was warned about this dept before I applied about how it is so now I'm back looking for a new job
good,"They talk the talk about the family atmosphere at Boyd and ""Boyd Style"" meaning integrity, appearance, team work etc. They do not live up to this. Some of the managers are terrible, dishonest and totally self serving. They have methodically cut employee benefits in the last several years."
good,"Company is ok but management is really bad. There is no support at all as most supervisors, leads, and managers spend most days in meetings so there is nobody to ask questions or get authorizations. Many of the manager do not know how to do the basic job they were hired to do  or know the workload of their employees or have a clue how to do the work at all. Many, including mine, lack the skills or even a formal education to handle the position they have been hired for. I lost count of the times I had to explain accounting tasks and basic math skills or computer tasks to my supervisors, leads, or even the department's manager, with many of them not being able to understand what was all about or how to do the work or how to hire someone who could do it as they do not know what work skills to look for in new hires. English and Liberal Arts majors are managing accounting work and online graduates with little or no practical skills other than copy and paste papers to pass grades at online universities are in charge and  bossing us around without a clue of how to do the job. It is exhausting and stressful as employees spend most of their days in meetings trying to explain how the job gets done to ignorant managers and supervisor and then find the time to do their work with the little time left or have to deal with constant work changes as the people in charge keeps making bad decisions. On top of all that, most leads, managers, supervisors, and even upper managers spend hours upon hours in their cells phones texting, checking emails, showing pictures to each other, sending messages"
good,"nothing special but has work/life balance, The Internal Audit VP is not experienced but the Directors and Managers are very experienced and will assist with anything needed."
good,"I didn't understand why it was such a high turnover rate. It's High turnover rate because of bad management, poor pay rate and training/development of officers. It's like Lord of the Flys in some ways. Some young supervisors that abuse their authority, and talk to new staff disrespectful at times, a bunch of budding up. But I need the benefits, which are pretty good."
good,"If you are at the top of the pay scale for a job, management will tear you down so they would not have to give a raise. No raises for 2 years. Once I left my Supervisor said I was doing such a good job. Crazy People in management!!!!"
good,"I bought into the Boyd Style  because I really thought  it worked. I was proud to say I worked here. Now there are a lot of changes  in many departments including managers and the stability is less stylish. I truly feel that Boyd is a great place to work or could be again if the Boyd style starts with Boyd.  Genuinely reconnecting with the employees and treating them like 4 stars will help build a bond. In fairness, employees have responsibilities to show up and follow standards and procedures. Be kind! We have some of the best guest in our casino and hotel compared to other casinos. That is what I enjoyed the most. I think that it is important to keep the employees smiling so guest can continue to feel the Boyd Style."
good,worked in room reservations. the job was fine it consisted of answering phones and data entry. the environment in the office is awful no moral support and management will help depending on what mood they're in.
good,"I learned a lot at Boyd because they expect a lot. There is a very high turnover because they over qualify you and basically hand you over to someone who will pay and treat you right. The recent tone at the top has been cut cost at any cost; under pay employees, deny maternity leave benefits, condense jobs, cut health options and retirement contributions."
good,"It can be a interesting place to work, unfortunately advancement, and benefits package is to limited. I like what I do giving good customer service, training my employees. Taking a difficult situation and making it into a positive experience for the employee and guest."
good,"I was very happy with my job until I was accused of calling another supervisor offensive names and was ultimately fired. I feel that the investigation into my innocence was not done. I was not allowed to contact any employees, current or past, to refute the accusations."
good,"Great and amazing entry level training and educational development. Suffers from corporation stagnation, does not have competitive wages. Has low advancement opportunities, though great for getting use to the Casino style of customer service and industry but now for career bases."
good,"There are a lot of really great departments within the Boyd gaming family however , I worked in room reservations and the work itself was easy the atmosphere was almost too relaxed. The department had a lot of supervisor who were Young and who were not"
good,"Working in a high volume business required use of customer service skills by greeting and taking food/beverage orders from guest. Prepare and serve food in accordance to established service standards (SafeServe certificate required). Operate cash register, 			complete cash and credit transactions, and maintain an accurate bank at all times. Maintain cleanliness of work area at all times. Operate all necessary snack bar equipment. Majority of shifts are 8 to 12 hours with mostly standing and walking throughout. Required 		to lift up to 40lbs. Maintain all licenses or certificates including OSHA safety skill training."
good,"Need to improve with the customer ,it have great people work their make a joy coming to work the pay okay but hard to advance because everyone step on each other to get on top"
good,Job was good but one of two of my supervisors were unfit for the position mentally. He liked to belittle people and call them names. Brakes were good free if not dirt cheap meals.. And actuallt good meals. I wasnt full time so didnt recieve PTO. Or benifits. But they were offered to full time/part-time employees. Decent hours about 20-25 a week as a on call-steady extra. Lime the job as a whole over all.
good,"Work table games at aliante casino. Tips are ok, but we’re severely over staffed so that cuts into what we can make.  Most table games supervisors are good, but there’s a couple horrible ones who have no business being in charge of anything. Shift managers are nice, but spend way too much time in an office not having a pulse on the night at hand.  There’s a reason a lot of workers including myself that are looking elsewhere"
good,"Decent money, suck benefits.  Used to be a really cool job, but progressively becoming worse. No communication, short- staffed, but all in all not a bad place to work."
good,"This is all from my point of view as a housekeeper."
good,If you are in school its perfect because of flexible hours and location by UNLV. The pay rate is not the best but you can save. Worked there for a year with no health benefits.
good,"Boyd Gaming is a good company, they are strongly interested in seeing advancement from within however there is currently little opportunity. They have a diverse group of workers all pleasant. Management as a whole is doing the best they can with what they have, there seems to be poor communication from all departments and trickles into the department."
good,"its a good place to work if you are related to someone there for advancement, but over all if your ok with maintaining your starting position it is good."
good,"If you enjoy being stressed everyday by unorganized management, and receiving a 1% raise each year, this is the company for you. This could be a great place to work, but the entire structure needs an overhaul. Unqualified people with no experience in design are the ones who run the show."
good,To give support to the 24 properties on setting up the configuration of their slot system.  This makes the job very full filling and nice to go to every day.
good,Good place to work if you don't mind working overtime. The down side is getting low pay when your dealing with intoxicated poeple!
good,I worked for a few months the people were nice enough you just have to be ready to interact with all kinds of people and have patience for when things dont go according to plan.
good,"okay not too bad"
good,Its an ok company to work for but looking to have oppertunity . I do like what I do but needing a better wage . I make 11.50 per hour and operating heaving equipment and working around dangerous race horses .
good,In the Casino World there is very rarely a typical day. When you report to work you could be facing multiple challenges and you must be ready and capable of dealing with those challenges and understanding how to deal with them. The most important factor though is making sure your guests are taking care of and providing the best  customer service that you can.
good,"Provided technical support of casino floors across the country, Doing software development and upgrades.  Workplace culture is diverse.  The hardest part of the job is being on call every weekend.  The enjoyable part is the collaboration with co workers"
good,"Good place to work and free meals while working great people, and you can meet different people everyday you are there. Great places to eat and very nice rooms"
good,"There is no micro-management of job duties and very professional atmosphere. However, incredibly stressful work environment.  Culture is not as team oriented as I thought it would be."
good,Decent place to start gaining experience. The upper Management team is great they just don't pay well as other casino IT departments. My co-workers were some great people.
good,"Even though it is a interesting place to work, the smoke environment and loud music are not a plus and if you like rude customers and gambling. it is the place for you. also advancement in your field  is almost non-existence."
good,Run product to meet departmental needs. Variety of job tasks on a daily basis. Personal challenges met and different daily.
good,"Learning something new, the accounting/ auditing department there is always something new to learn , management was always willing to help or explain the job, my coworkers some been there long time they were always helpful, hardest part of the job was having to balance at the end of the day, Enjoyable part of the job was when everyone balances at the end of the day and were all able to  go home."
good,Tranforming from casino locations to corporate location.  Very busy accounts payale offices servicing multiple locations.
good,a typical day at work was counting money to the customers and I have learned to take my time. management was good and they did show concern with the mistakes that people make. they were easy to get along with. the hardest part of the job would be to make sure the money is correct. the most enjoyable part of the job would be interacting with the customers
good,There was always plenty to do at the Ip. We  had management meetings several times a week and safety training was an important aspect.It was kind of a family type atmosphere as far as  the management and coworkers. Usually  once  a month  there was a pizza party in our department.
good,"Worked with some intelligent people, learned a lot about management/operations. Wish there was room to grow and advance within the company."
good,Counted money the entire day and dealt with cashiers.
good,"Extremely stressful and hot ,aggressive environmen due to seniority,  very humid and a lot of machines going around you as you work.Not a lot of training ,you are on your feet for 10 hours a day for 4 days in a row. It is production oriented."
good,"Took advantage of promotional opportunities, especially on Grave shift.  Had to transfer departments and now it is time to make a change out of the organization."
good,"I worked for this company for over  2 decades.  I did learn a lot of on the job information with the time accrued with the company. I was given training courses to gain further knowledge to advance.  But as with many businesses as of the past 10 + years, advancement is few and far between in opportunities."
good,Love to work when all my life has been working.try to stay home but not for me. Boydgaming is a nice place to work if their weren't to many Bosses and not enough communication.
good,"This company seems to care more about their workers more than the average casino industry."
good,On-call status was beneficial in that it allowed me to work different hours and all beverage sections of the casino. Management was always helpful whenever needed. Fellow employees were friendly and helpful as well.
good,Providing a high level of customer service is the name of the game.  Making sure and ensuring that the customer experience is a very positive one is the key challenge.
good,"I’ve been with Boyd for a month at the IP Casino in Biloxi. My managers and supervisors are very nice and helpful, I love my coworkers, and the job is actually easy. The only cons working as a cage cashier for this company is bad training and low pay."
good,"The hardest part of the job is trying to get clear instruction from my boss. If there's no definite vision, it is difficult knowing what needs to be done."
good,"I currently work here as a reservation's agent. The job title kind of seems like you'd be working at the front desk, but it is more like working in a call center. We wear headsets and our only interactions are with guests over the phone. There are opportunities to rise up the ranks here and good benefits. The negatives are the hours, favoritism, and the guests are really really rude when their complimentary offers aren't available. I applied as part time since I'm in school full time, but after maybe 2 weeks of getting around 25-30 hours a week I was getting scheduled around 50+ hours a week (8-10 hour days working 6 days a week) without my manager checking with me first. I asked for my hours to be cut back to part time hours, she said just stick with it for a week or 2 and she will. 8 months later, I'm still stuck working overtime. While the employees who have been there for a couple of months were working over 50 hours a week and their one day off, the manager and 3 women who have been there for a few years were getting every weekend off and weren't asked to work late. The manager would let them go home early, always approved their pto, worked around their kid's schedules, dr's appointments, wouldn't try to call them in on their days off, gave them holidays off. They also had their set schedule for mornings, while everyone else would have to work a closing shift which is almost 10pm and open the next morning before 8am. A good example is I put in PTO for the 4th of July and a few other days in that week 4 months ahead of time. I asked the manager before putting the request"
good,I'm currently still here but that place has a ton of issues and is very unorganized. I wouldn't recommend anyone to apply in the kitchen there. Other than that work would be great. I would love is the boss sholled some care in the employee's but they don't.
good,"The typical work day consisted of being exposed to second hand, cigarette smoke on a shift which typically lasted for seven hours."
good,"Every day there were smiles on peoples faces and everyone was so nice.  It was their ""Boyd Style"".  My typical day was non-stop as I assisted seven directors and the CIO as well as the entire IT department along with the Executive Secretary.  I provided excellent support to the entire department. My co-workers were very appreciative of the help I provided them."
good,"Work 8 hour shifts sometimes 12"
good,"I enjoyed meeting in the security office to get our schedules, and radios, and we all walk out to our areas were assigned to for that day. I learned a lot from just about everyone from multiple departments to me it was like a big work family. It was my first time being a security officer I learned how to write reports, use the radios, learn the 400 codes, basic first aid, AED and CPR training. I learned to dispatch and to use the cameras and i got to learn surveillance. I don't really remember having hard parts I enjoyed it well I guess the standing around when theres other stuff i wish I could be learning thats the only thing I would say that was hard."
good,I didn't like it bicouse I want to be more than a kitchen-worker
good,I was overseen by 3 managers only 1 of which was professional in the work place. The other 2 managers other than helping with things I needed from them seemed to set me back more or just completely disregard the things we needed done.
good,"Orleans Accounting bad place.. Corp. nice building, nice work stations. Accounting, AP Manager had staff in fear, "
good,They don’t care for there employees they will fire you and have no reason . They never want to move up in-house always hiring out source to take higher positions instead of giving it to someone who deserves it .
good,"Nice folks, however, the only thing that really matters is the almighty dollar. I cannot suger coat this., The act like they care but will put the blade in your back in a heartbeat."
good,"I had to quit this job because the management refused to hire enough employees to adequately handle the work load. We would have a backlog of calls 15 deep for the entire day, with dozens of callers quitting every half hour. These conditions would last from when the day shift started to shortly after it ended. This amount of work was left to a team of about 4 people, even though we had room in the office for 12."
good,A good place to work.
good,"I was impressed that so many employees have stayed with Boyd for decades, a sign that for the stability-minded this might be a great place to work. Average salaries seem to be on the low side, however."
good,"I started at 10 pm and I would direct officers to their posts, then verify their location, and begin supervising the floor.  I learned how to work well with customers and coworkers.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with intoxicated customers.  The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know customers and seeing them have a good time."
good,Not all about the numbers  but how you personally how and develop. a fast pace work environment.  A lot of variety in the position.
good,"I enjoy working with people and solving the problems that may come up as part of my day.  Working with team members at Boyd has taught me so much about Excel, Access and Word.  I learned everything with a hands-on approach.  I schedule my day by priority and ensure that the most important job is done immediately.  If something may come up during the important jobs I will readjust my priorities if needed."
good,The place itself is ok to work but pay is not near equal to some of the difficulties that come with the job as employees come and go never staying to long.
good,I do enjoy my job very much I just don’t feel that I am being given opportunity for for growth outside of my current position. I enjoy the challenges and detail required to do my job however would like more training to improve my knowledge base.
good,They are not competitive with their pay and benefits and it is hurting their ability to hire people. The training cadre for their properties are adequate but need a serious overhaul. As they do not practice good customer service with their fellow employees. A little civility goes along way. Some if the command staff and trainers are lacking in this. There is more than one reason they are short staffed and it starts there.
good,"The pay wasnt the greatest, but the people i worked with were wonderful, and the clients for the most part were great! Immediate supervisors really work with you and are supportive. Never had much dealings with upper management"
good,"Nice to work with people. No complains about the co workers. We help each other. Friendly people. Working in this company is help you to have good benefits, insurance and help you to save your money from 401K."
good,The  trianing  is helpful and the turnover rate is extremely high. I learned that housekeeping is hard work. The most enjoyable part of that job are the friends I made.
good,"Boyd Gaming is not known for the best compensation, but it is a relatively lax environment, and there are some opportunities for growth, depending on your career path."
good,"The culture is amazing with many great people behind this great company.  I have had the pleasure of working for and meeting many celebrities in addition to many guests knowing and asking for me by name.  It has been fun, but I’m seeking a new beginning with another great company."
good,Keeping a safe and up beat working environment for all guests and employees in and around the area.  Making sure to handle each encounter with guests or team members regardless of situation in a courteous and professional manner to keep all happy and wanting to come back.
good,I absolutely loved working here when I did. Everyone that works there are so nice and have been great friends. Great atmosphere to be in when you work with people you like.
good,Co-workers are the life and blood of the company. these jobs would not be done as well if it was not for the other workers. The fast paced environment is not ideal but the co workers make it worth it all.
good,Its a fun atmosphere where you get to have fun with patrons while being in a relaxed atmosphere. The hardest part of the job would be working on holidays and weekends.
good,"This job was very easy, the people and management were very pleasant to work with and talk to, and so long as i wasn't at the register i could play games or watch TV on my phone while we weren't moving cars."
good,"Fast paced. You learn how to multitask and make fair and consistent decision making skills."
good,"Only worked there on temporary basis, but the time I was there I enjoyed it "
good,Boyd Gaming can be a quick paced job depending on what department you are in. They provide the proper training for your job and higher management shows they care for the team members.
good,"Good place to work, laid back, but stressful at times. Good customer relationship.Most managers worked with you. Too many different rules, they change daily and by the manager on duty at the time."
good,good company to work. Friendly staff and very good job security. The work culture is 2nd to none. The company is still growing so if you are interested in growth this is the best place
good,"Love dealing with the public , lots of things  different daily make the day go fast and look forward to seeing and speaking to new people and helping people daily"
good,my employment at boyd gaming was a structured and pleasant work experience. it was agood company to work for. every day at work was a different work experience.
good,"Go about the duties of a Security Officer.  Usually different duty stations each workday. One is customer service first. Security Officer duties are required always.  Our presence is a deterrent and when necessary, we may be called upon to escort individuals off of our property."
good,Great Place to work to gain experience.  Work scheduling is very accomodating. Supervisors are friendly and helpful. They will help you learn new skills and achieving full time employment is easy.
good,"This is a very guest orientated position.Math skills, outgoing personality, attention to detail  are very key to this position.To become a Floor Supervisor you must be able to first deal all the games with proficiency."
good,Exciting and fast pace environment with many time sensitive deadlines.  Diverse culture and ethnicity in customers and co-workers.
good,"I was on the F&B opening management team,(F&B swing shift mgr.) that planned and executed Grand Opening Ceremonies for 15-20 thousand guests. Boyd Gaming is an excellent company, well organized and very fair with regard to employee needs and concerns."
good,Boyd gaming is one of the largest gaming operators in Vegas. Majority of the clientele are from the Hawaiian islands. The work culture is that Keep it fun and work smart.
good,Great place to work. Have met lots of interesting people and continue to learn everyday. Fun friendly atmosphere. Great midwestern values and the team takes care of one another.
good,"Working in the cage with the women I worked with was like being in a mean girls click. I even had a coworker dislike me so much she didn’t say one word to me for more than half a year. Never got in an argument with her or rarely spoke to her."
good,I haven't worked there in over 20 years. The work was fun and there was opportunity to advance if one wanted. There were some good perks and fun customers.
good,"Coworkers are fun, and understanding, team working is always required for a busy nights customers always satisfied, It was fun for the most time working..."
good,"As an intern Boyd Gaming did it's best to prove to the interns that it is a good company to work for. And it definitely is! In the IT department, things were hectic but everyone was friendly enough to help get things settled. There were hidden conflicts between some people because a lack of communication, but things get settled eventually."
good,"Overall, they have a good group of people working in this particular department, especially the shift I was on. There is a lot more to this job than you would imagine, but with time you'll pick it up, they have a really good management team. Had a real friendly atmosphere, but when its time to work and get stuff done, then its time to work and get stuff done. Really enjoyed the limited time I had at this job, unfortunately I had to vacate my position for another opportunity that unexpectedly came up. "
good,My time at Boyd I got to do what I always wanted to do. Get to know locals what they liked and what they wanted. Help build great communication with the locals.
good,"A typical day would require me to audit the prior days slot machine activity. I learned how to calculate meter reads, 10-key, balance check revenue. Management overall was friendly and helpful when needed. Co-workers had a good personality and made the environment pleasant to be in. The hardest part of that job was working overtime and holidays. The most enjoyable part was being able to go  home early if the work was completed."
good,Working for the Boyd Gaming was really crucial phase of my life I haven't spend much time but I learned a lot working for the  Boyd gaming. I'll recommend this place to all my friends.
good,"This job is not for everyone because it is very challenging work schedule to start till your seasoned, after which it becomes fun relaxing atmosphere. Having a great management team can make a big difference in your experience."
good,Met new people on a daily basis and had great customer service skills.  The job was fun and exciting and met some amazing people.  I left the job due to excessive standing and horrible smoke conditions while dealing all day.
good,"As a manager at one of the properties, I do work hard, but enjoy my job.  The management staff are friendly, collaborative, and supportive.  Staffing is an issue, though.   The company in general likes to work with a lean staff which generally means more hands on work, and less supervising, for managers."
good,"Always meeting new people, new events and all out enjoyable place to work. we were able to set up events, attend events and shows. Meet bands and set up to distribute tickets and drawings"
good,"Work itself was easy, laid back and fair."
good,"As a Hostess/cashier my job kept me on the move, but learning different areas in the beverage/food service kept me on my toes with customer service, learning how each customer needed to be treated and remembering their names and faces producing better recognition and tips for myself."
good,"Well developed training program, definatley the best in this area. After a couple of years experience one is able to move up to a lead position. I love being able to see everything that goes on at this property. Job is pretty exciting at times."
good,I enjoy working for a company that has room for advancement and challenge their employees professionally. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with co-workers and helping others.

good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was the team work, and each persons work counted as the teams accomplishment. The opportunity to work in another position that differs from each day."
good,Nothing is set in stone. Everything is always changing. Some managers are so dependable you never want them to leave while others you wish would actually do their jobs. If you have little to no seniority you wear a uniform. If you are able to have a position like a lead or something else you basically can wear whatever you want. It is friendly to tattoos as long as they are appropriate. Jewelry is basically whatever you want. Piercings and hair have limitations. The best parts of the job can turn into the worst based on what the circumstances are. The customers can be wonderful an almost become family while others treat you like a thief and something they are allowed to stomp on. The coworkers are generally great. There is always something going on and never a dull moment.
good,Very professional place from both team members and management. Good incentives. Great atmosphere to work. Attracted great clientele. Very liberal on meal policies. Management very accessible to employee needs. Excellent training program

good,great company to work for and and they help move you up and will train you and every Department to make you move and continue to grow with the company
good,I would recommend Boyd Gaming willing to work in the Gaming sector.  It is a smoke filled environment and requires customer service skills.  There is ample room for advancement if you have a great work record and service skills.
good,I love my job. I always will love that job. I enjoyed everyone who worked there and there silly smiles and there hilarious selves they are fun people to work with if I had of worked there much longer I would have had so much fun.
good,"I love my job at Boyd Gaming. I am able to make decisions on my own, decisions that will obviously make the business better. Advancement opportunities are always present."
good,If you have any complaints about the housekeeping manager just forget about it.  Retaliation is by far the most used weapon in the department.  The company is great but the Suncoast hotel housekeeping manager is very unprofessional.
good,It is my first experience on the page and it seems very practical and positive to what to find work refers to what I like at the moment what it offers
good,"It is a fun, exciting and interesting position.  It can get a little hectic at times depending on the event happening but overall it is good.  The training can get overwhelming when you are first starting."
good,This was an enjoyable part time job. The people were friendly and supportive and the customers were respectful and engaging.
good,I learned housekeeping is harder than I thought. I learned that there  are a lot of things to look for while cleaning . Teamwork is a big part of that department.

good,Loved the work. It was fun and the people were great to work with
good,I worked here for several years. I learned a lot and enjoyed my time there.
good,I enjoyed working here. Never a dull moment. I did work twelve hour nights. I worked as a cashier so there was not a lot of time to get to know all of my coworkers but I did meet a few friends. I loved meeting all the customers and expressing my concern when they had a hard night and celebrating the ones that had a great one.
good,"Boyd Gaming is a fun and exciting workplace with lots of diversity and advancement opportunities. I would recommend others to apply and work here,"
good,"There was a good and clean working environment.  My supervisors were fair, decipline wise.  The month end closing was a very stressful time.  Sometimes long hours."
good,"Team members at Boyd , all are very nice to work for.  Boyd has a family style culture.  It's a great place to work.  Definitely a place to learn and work"

good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was the creation and development of tools, manuals, and processes that enhanced the management and organization of both the department and company.  I also benefited by working along side a union represented department which taught me the skills and documentation tools needed for proper management within a unionized department.  A typical day at work would be maintaining and continuously developing existing processes and information.  Projects were routinely assigned and assessed annually for progress and completion.  Daily duties consisted of reviewing attendance, and editing of previous days labor, and exception/variances violations.  Daily point of system database access and maintenance."
good,"good people to work with good manangment. Good benefits. Free food, free uniforms, free vacation days. Good work environment, all tools provided by the company."
good,Beautiful and welcoming location for a casino. GREAT working conditions and you work with some truly great people.  Be realistic..it is a casino so 24/7 work schedules. BEST career ever in my opinion.
good,"Lots of fun events and competitions for Team Members"
good,"IT good  you stay focus on what u there for have clean fun just a friendly work place, they work with u to help u to complete your task and better yourself .YOu stay away from people that gossip or bully. THE HARDEST PART  is when YOU AGREE NOT TO DISAGREE ON SOMETHING YOU KNOW THAT NOT RIGHT . AND YOU HAVE NO SUPPORT TO BACK U UP. FAIRNESS!!!!  MY ENJOYABLE DOING WHAT I LOVE WORK,  LOVED MY WORK  LOVE THE CHALLENGE IT GAVE ME TO IMPROVE MYSELF AND BETTER AT WHAT I LOVE DOING!!!! IT HELP ME BECOME A BETTER PERSON TO SERVE OTHERS.IT IS TRULY A JOB OF INTERGRITY, HONEST, FRIENDLY, YOU JUST HAVE TO CHOOSE YOUR PATH  TO FOLLOW."
good,"The best leadership ever worked in any casino environment,  Management was sensitive for all employee needs and interests,  The company was with well defined mission, goals and objectives.  employees were treated with lot of respect.  team working environment was second to none in like casino.  The corporate level support to the local level casinos was outstanding"
good,"I have been with Boyd for over 15 years.  My daily routine consisted of assisting the Compliance Manager, performing BSA audits and training team members in Title 31.  Upper Management always takes time to make you feel like family and I will miss them all horribly when I move.  I am only looking for other employment elsewhere as I am relocating to Florida."
good,"Boyd Gaming offers a great culture, amazing coworkers, an executive team that cares, but has lower than market pay. Benefits also are lacking, high cost healthcare and PTO has been reduced. Despite this Boyd has much lower turnover than other companies within the industry. If you want to be an allstar and get allstar pay, look elsewhere, if you want to be part of a team, look no further."
good,Typical day included sorting the bed linens and towels or sorting table linens by color.  Hardest part was hanging the sheets on the proper ironer.  Made a good friend there.
good,"Very different culture.  The culture at Boyd Gaming supports individuals.  Once at Boyd Gaming in management, you had more visibility than at any other corporation.  Boyd seriously looks to advance current team members first."
good,I am still currently working for Boydgaming.  It's a great company to work for with people from all over the world.  I enjoyed the diversity of cultures.
good,Great place to work and my management team is Awesome!! We have fun with the customers and get to watch customers win lots of money!! I see many things in this job and the most fun is when Friday and Saturdays come.
good,I worked for Sams Town and Gold Coast for Boyd Gaming.  I spent 8 wonderful years there.  Bill Boyd knows how to care for his employees.  He was a great leader and was very down to earth.  The work environment was fun and relaxed.  I would go back to work there in a heartbeat!
good,great place to work really good management and great atmosphere very little money for the being a armed security

good,Boyd gaming was a great place to work although I did get laid off it took less than two days for them to call me back and give me an alternate position.
good,"Started off as a Bconnected Attendant and then got promoted to Slot Floor Supervisor. Awesome managers in the slot and slot marketing department. Always fun yet fast paced. My coworkers were the best. If I ever have to move back to vegas, boyd gaming will be the first company I apply to. They treat you like family. Enjoyed my time with them and still keep in touch with my coworkers till this day. :)"
good,"I love my job at the Kansas Star! Its not as bad as people make it out to be sometimes, in fact I've been here long enough to see people who didn't like it return because they figured out it wasn't that bad. Sure every company has good and bad things about it. The benefits are a little high but they work and we use them. My managers are awesome. If I need time off they work with me, if I'm sick they call to check on me. We sell fun at the KSC who else gets paid to play card games?!?!? I make awesome money and have a good time doing it. We have an awesome cafeteria, free soda, coffee and tea...free bagels and toast...free salad bar and only 3.00 for a hot lunch...you pay more for McDonald's and this is really good food most of the time! If I ever have problems I know who to ask for help, no one has ever treated me unfairly HR is very prompt and on top of anything I have questions about. My supervisors are always there when I need them. I'm looking forward to many more years at the Star."
